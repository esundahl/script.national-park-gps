How did these shells get there? It must be the ocean at work-or is it?<br /> <br /> Archeologists identify these sites as \"middens,\" debris piles containing remnants of past societies-the Tongva, the Chumash, and their ancestors. The island's 30 or so midden sites suggest that occupation dates back at least 4,000 years, and probably even more than that. However, due to the lack of a steady supply of fresh water and the few terrestrial resources, permanent settlements were never established on Santa Barbara Island. The island was instead used on a seasonal basis and as a stopover between Santa Catalina and San Nicolas Islands.<br /> <br /> These midden sites offer us a window into the Tongva and Chumash world. By examining these sites, archeologists can piece together a picture of the ancient island life of these peoples. The Tongva and Chumash were skilled craftspeople and seafarers, with a vast knowledge of the world around them and how to use it for their survival. The predominance of shells and fish bones within the middens reveals that they subsisted primarily on fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms. They often plied the Santa Barbara Channel in search of this rich variety of marine food, traveling in tomols (canoes) made of redwood or pine planks caulked with tar from natural seeps.<br /> <br /> These middens also reveal that other items not available in this isolated island environment had to be traded for with villages on the mainland or other islands. One of the principal products manufactured and traded by the islanders were shell beads, which were used as currency of trade in the Tongva and Chumash areas and throughout California.<br /> <br /> To produce these beads, chert microdrills were used to bore holes in pieces of olivella snail shells. Chert, a hard, durable silica rock, was found in considerable quantities on Santa Cruz Island. Because Eastern Santa Cruz Island had chert of the proper type and quality needed for tool construction, this location became the center for manufacturing chert microdrills. One particular site contains evidence of the highest density of microdrill production in North America.<br /> <br /> Santa Barbara Island and the other Channel Islands were not isolated enough to protect the island Tongva and Chumash from the diseases the Spanish explorers and missionaries brought with them as they began colonizing California in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, the island Tongva and Chumash had been devastated by measles and other introduced epidemics, as well as by drought and the disruption of their trade-based economy. The last of the islanders would leave their traditional island home by the mid-1800s.<br /> <br /> Although much of the islander's history and way of life has been lost, enough remains to remind us of this unique part of Santa Barbara Island's past. These midden sites, along with today's descendants of the island Tongva and Chumash, remind us how important and sacred these isolated islands are.<br /> <br /> <b>Ancient Ocean Pathways Lead the Chumash Home</b><br /> In 1976, the Chumash Brotherhood of the Tomol built and paddled the tomol , helek (Peregrine Falcon), from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island. This historic ocean voyage, the first since the mid-1800s, brought the Chumash back to their island home and sustained their traditional way life.<br /> <br /> Then in 1997, a group of Chumash built the traditional style tomol , 'elye'wun (Swordfish), the first to be owned by the Chumash in 150 years, and paddled her from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island in 2001, completing the island circle begun by Helek .<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual tomol crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.<br /> <br /> <br /> <em><strong>Taking from or disturbing archeological sites or artifacts is a violation of state and federal law. The archeological sites around the Channel Islands are a testament to the importance of the Tongva, Chumash and other American Indians.

Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.</strong></em><br />  </p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash and Tongva History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash and Tongva on Santa Barbara Island</strong><br /> Due to the lack of fresh water and few terrestrial resources, Santa Barbara Island most likely did not support any permanent native settlements. Recent studies show evidence that occupation of the island dates back at least 4,000 years, suggesting seasonal visits to the island. Southern California Indians would have been drawn to the island by the rich marine life surrounding the rocky shores, being able to fish, harvest shellfish and hunt pinnipeds, as well as manufacture tools.<br /> <br /> Since early European explorers did not leave any indication of landing on the island, no information about native island use or occupancy of the island has come from those sources. Although the explorers did see the small island, it did not receive much documentation. Cabrillo's chroniclers dubbed the southern islands, which included Santa Barbara, the \"other islands of San Lucas.\" Sebastian Vizcaino gave the island its name in honor of the saint whose day was December 4, the day he arrived, in 1602.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a></p> <p><br /> <strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash. It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em><strong>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students,</strong></em> Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop . Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named ˜elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, ˜elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, ˜elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing at the center point of a large open grassy plateau, at a Y-shaped point in the trail system, where three trails converge. It is marked with an upright 4-inch by 4-inch post about 3 feet high. From this point, two trails run almost parallel toward Signal Peak, a rounded hill in the distance, to the southwest. After a while, one trail veers southeast toward the Sea Lion Rookery and Cat Canyon at the southern end of the island. The third trail runs north toward the campground, Visitor Center, and Landing Cove.<br /><br />All of these narrow trails are slightly depressed into the sandy soil, creating groove in the landscape that is a foot or two wide, and several inches deep. The ground is blanketed with dried gray grass and small broken twigs. In patches, on either side of the trail, are grasses, crystalline ice plant, saltbush, and coastal sagebrush. A few coreopsis dot the landscape. These have thick branches topped with tufts of green leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers in springtime, and a shaggy brittle, brown mop of dead leaves and blooms in late summer and early fall. <br /><br />To the west, in the distance, you can see the ocean. <br />",

The wetland also serves as a resting and feeding stop for migratory birds and nesting habitat for resident waterfowl.<br /> <br /> Sediment column analysis from the marsh has revealed fire and vegetation change on Santa Rosa Island. As the climate changed, forest communities were replaced by mixed grassland and scrub communities around 12,000 years ago.

During the historic period, vegetation changed significantly to grasslands with the introduction of nonnative grazing animals.<br /> <br /> Fires appear to have been more frequent in the wetter periods than in the drier periods, with a probable increase after about 6,900 years ago as Island Chumash settlement and cultural complexity increased.

Channel Islands Aviation used to fly visitors regularly to the island using this airstrip but stopped their operation in 2021.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park</a></strong><br /> <br /> <em><strong>Private aircraft may not land within park boundaries.

    "audioDescription": "The air strip is located southeast of the ranch complex, on a large flat grassy plateau that lies above the shoreline of Bechers Bay. The dirt airplane landing strip is about 90 feet wide by half a mile long. Near the middle of the strip is an orange windsock on a metal post. It is a narrow cone of light windproof material, about 4 feet long, with a metal ring circling the one-foot wide opening. It is mounted sideways, like a flag, and it pivots on the top of the post, so that the wide part is always facing into the wind, and the tail is always pointing in the direction the wind is blowing. <br /><br />To the east is a view of the ocean. To the south are rolling hills, with dark green, Torrey pine-covered slopes in the foreground, and sandier slopes in the distance. To the west is the Water Canyon campground.<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Selasphorus sasin sedentarius</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Allen's hummingbird, <em>Selasphorus sasin sedentariusis,</em> an endemic subspecies found on all of the islands in Channel Islands National Park, with the exception of Santa Barbara Island. It is also a permanent resident on Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands. In the 1960's, sedentarius likely dispersing from Santa Catalina Island, colonized the Palos Verdes Peninsula of Los Angeles County. Since that initial colonization, <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> has spread over much of Los Angeles and Orange Counties.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Before receiving its present name, <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> was called <em>non-migratory Allen's hummingbird</em>.</li> <li>The endemic species found on the Channel Islands, <em>S.s. sedentarius</em>, differs from the mainland species <em>S.s. sasin</em>, by having a longer wing, tail and bill.</li> <li>During the breeding season, males defend territories in mixed shrubs and woods located in coastal canyons. Allen's hummingbirds have even been seen chasing red-tailed hawks and American kestrels from their territories.</li> <li>In the 1960's <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> was discovered nesting on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, which initially was perplexing.Through investigation, it was theorized that the ornamental non-native plants such as the eucalyptus and bottlebrush have played a role in this increased range.</li> <li>Recently, <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> has spread its range across the L.A. Basin, and beyond. They have also moved into Orange County to the south, and even into thevalleys neighboring the coastal plain.</li> <li>The recent colonization of <em>S.s.sedentarius</em> on San Miguel Island in the mid-20th century may be a recolonization of habitat that was once destroyed by grazing.</li> <li>Contrary to published accounts, Allen's Hummingbirds do not sound like the similar appearing Rufous hummingbirds. <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> is very different vocally as well as mechanically with the \"wing whistle\" and \"tail pops\".</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Allen's hummingbird is a small bird, with mature adults reaching only 3 to 3½ inches in length, although the subspecies on the Channel Islands, <em>S.s. sendentarius</em>, is slightly larger, and also has a longer wing, tail and bill. The male Allen's has a green back and forehead, with rust-colored rufous flanks, rump, and tail. The male's throat is also an iridescent orange-red. The female and immature Allen's hummingbirds are similarly colored, but lack the iridescent throat patch, instead having a series of speckles on their throat. Females are mostly green, featuring rufous colors only on the tail, which also has white tips. The immature Allen's hummingbirds are so similar to the female rufous hummingbird that the two are almost indistinguishable in the field.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Allen's hummingbird <em>S.s. sasin</em>, the nominate species, is migratory, and winters along the Pacific coast of central Mexico. The second race, <em>S.s. sedentarius</em>, is a permanent resident on the Channel Islands off southern California. In the 1960s, this population colonized the Palos Verdes Peninsula of Los Angeles County and has since spread over much of Los Angeles and Orange Counties.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> inhabits chaparral and riparian woodlands below 1000 feet in elevation. Interestingly, due to its expansion to the mainland, it now inhabits a mixed urban habitat. The more widely distributed subspecies, <em>S.s. sasin</em>, inhabits mixed evergreen, riparian woodlands, eucalyptus and cypress groves, oak woodlands, and coastal scrub areas in breeding season. The broad array of landscape horticulture found in residential gardens, in particular the fuchsia plantars; provide a substantial year-round food source of desirable nectar.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Like all hummingbirds, the Allen's hummingbird's high rate of metabolism requires it to feed frequently, about every hour. The Allen's hummingbird drinks nectar from flowers, as well as eating any small insects it finds crawling around the flower blossom, which provide it with needed protein.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The courtship flight of the male Allen's hummingbird is a frantic back and forth flight arc of about 25 feet similar to the motion of a swinging pendulum, followed by a high-speed dive from about 100 feet. The male is also highly aggressive and territorial. Hot-tempered despite its diminutive stature, a male Allen's hummingbird will chase any other males from its territory, as well as any other hummingbird species, and they have even been known to attack and rout predatory birds several times larger than themselves, such as kestrels and hawks.</p> <p>Males maintain territories that overlook open coastal scrub or riparian shrubs where they perch in conspicuous places. Females choose nest sites in areas where there is more tree cover. They locate the nest in shrubs and trees with dense vegetation such as vines and thickets anywhere from 2 feet to 45 feet off the ground.</p> <p>The Allen's hummingbird constructs its nest out of plant fibers, down, and weed stems, coating the nest with lichens to give it structure. The nest is placed above ground on a tree branch or the stalk or stem of a plant. On average the female lays two dull white eggs, which are incubated for 12-22 days. <em>S.s. sasin</em> usually lays two clutches per season; however, <em>S.s. sedentarius</em> will lay more. The young will leave the nest about three weeks after hatching. The mother will continue to feed the fledglings for several more weeks, then the young are left to fend for themselves.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Although this species may have a restricted range, it is not believed to be vulnerable. The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for vulnerable under the population size criterion. Recent surveys within the park indicate that there is an increasing trend with yearly fluctuation. For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen's_Hummingbird</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Allen\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Allen's_Hummingbird/lifehistory</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.audubon2.org/watchlist/viewSpecies.jsp?id=6\">http://www.audubon2.org/watchlist/viewSpecies.jsp?id=6</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.answers.com/topic/allen-s-hummingbird\">http://www.answers.com/topic/allen-s-hummingbird</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/ca5/pelagics/ALLENSHUMMER.html\">http://www.angelfire.com/ca5/pelagics/ALLENSHUMMER.html</a></li> <li>The Hummingbird Book: The Complete Guide to Attracting, Identifying, and Enjoying Hummingbirds By Donald Stokes, Donald W.

Once ashore, visitors must climb 157 stairs to the top of the island.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Landing History</strong><br /> The much-photographed stairway, landing and derrick hoist at East Anacapa reflect the ingenuity of the Lighthouse Service in providing access to their lighthouse installations. It is reportedly the only remaining Lighthouse Service derrick landing system that is available for the general public to observe on the west coast.<br /> <br /> The island's rugged terrain made landing construction quite challenging. In fact, Charles Hillinger, in the The California Islands, wrote that when members of the U. S. Coast Survey team visited Anacapa in 1854 they reported that it was an ideal but impossible site for a light station. Quoting a report, Hillinger wrote, \"It is inconceivable for a lighthouse to be constructed on this mass of volcanic rock-perpendicular on every face, with an ascent inaccessible by any natural means . . . .\" Nevertheless, construction of the landing facilities (along with the roads, tower, and support buildings) was completed in 1933 at a cost of $110,490.<br /> <br /> The landing dock is a three-tiered structure built into the rocky cliff face. The tiers are connected by 157 concrete and metal steps; first tier, the Lower Landing Dock, next the Middle Landing Platform and last the Upper Landing.<br /> <br /> On the Middle Landing, the original small boathouse and hoist near the bottom of the stairs have been removed, and the site where the U.S. Coast Guard launch was kept now hosts a canopy and a small building holding dive equipment and other supplies. A small crane was added to this location in 2020.<br /> <br /> The Upper Landing contains a small crane building. This building remains in its original use, as a control room, winch house and equipment shed for the large crane which sits next to it. The original crane was replaced in 2020 after the previous crane failed due to prolonged exposure to the harsh marine conditions on the island. The new crane restored essential park operations and improved visitor and emergency services on the island. It is a two-crane design that improved the safety of loading operations. The two-crane system mirrors the configuration of the original historic Anacapa Light Station crane that was installed in 1932. The stairwell was renovated in 1999 and again in 2010.<br /> <br /> Of this Charles Hillinger's account of the landing is quite memorable. In 1931 Superintendent H. W. Rhodes requested a 26-foot whaleboat with trunk and cabin to serve as a launch. To meet the problems of landing the craft, he had it equipped with special hoisting gear so that it could be hoisted upon arrival at the island onto the lower landing platform:<br /> <br /> \"Perpendicular cliffs shot straight up more than 250 feet from the water. Embedded in the rock 50 feet above the surging surf was the lower landing platform, our target and arrival point. Seated in the engine house on the landing platform when the utility boat arrived was the boatswain's mate 1st Class, the officer in charge of the station.<br /> <br /> The power was switched on, the heavy boom swung out over our boat and a steel derrick hoist cable and hook lowered. One seaman grabbed the hook and inserted [it] in a midship eye while another secured guiding lines at the bow and stern which were fastened to the landing. Screeching power echoed throughout the cave-locked cove as the powerful hoist was thrust into the lift gears.<br /> Up out of the water rose the 7,000-pound boat, her crew and passengers. The boom swung us into a custom-made cradle and our 50-foot flight to Anacapa ended. \"<br /> <br /> Another interesting account of the landing described the arrival of a new keeper (called officer-in-charge after the Coast Guard took over the Lighthouse Service in 1939) along with his wife. Their launch was stuck swinging in the air as the derrick stopped working mid-operation. The officer and his terrified wife spent their welcome dangling over the swells in the landing cove, not knowing what would happen. Finally the problem was fixed and the couple made it ashore, but the wife reportedly refused to use the derrick again, denying herself shore leave, until she left the island for good.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watersports</strong><br /> Anacapa is an Ideal place for swimming, diving, snorkeling, and kayaking, but there are no lifeguards on the island. Since Anacapa is a cliff island, access to the water is only at the Landing Cove on East Anacapa via a dock. There are no other accessible beaches unless you have a watercraft. Excellent watersports can be experienced at the Landing Cove. The underwater visibility is usually very good and the water is teeming with life since it is located within a marine reserve. Kayaking east towards Arch Rock or west towards Cathedral Cove provides great wildlife viewing, sea caves, and arches.<br /> <br /> Learn more about activities in the park at: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/outdooractivities.htm\">www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/outdooractivities.htm</a></p>",

The tiers are connected by 157 concrete and metal steps; first tier, the Lower Landing Dock, next the Middle Landing Platform and last the Upper Landing. The middle and upper tiers contain exhibits. <br /><br />The next three paragraphs describe each tier. <br />THE LOWER LANDING DOCK<br />The Lower Landing Dock is a sturdy, narrow, platform made of wooden planks built into the cliff. The dock is enclosed by a wooden fence rail. Two steel-rung ladders run down the side of the dock into the water. A series of concrete stairs set into the cliff take you to the middle Landing Platform where a metal, industrial style stairway zig zags up to the upper landing.<br /><br />THE MIDDLE LANDING PLATFORM<br />The Middle Landing Platform is a narrow concrete slab built into the cliff. It is surrounded by thick pipe railing and enclosed with metal fencing. Three panels mark this location; the Welcome to Anacapa Island panel and an illustration of Kelp Forests panel are mounted side by side on a white seawall. A panel that describes Marine Protected Areas is on the fence rail that overlooks rugged cliffs, the Lower Landing dock and the waters of Landing Cove below. Listen for seabirds roosting on the cliff face, the sound of waves crashing on the rocks and in the sea caves below and the fog signal of the lighthouse. <br /><br />THE UPPER LANDING<br />The Upper Landing is a wide concrete slab in the rock face. It is surrounded by thick pipe railing, enclosed with metal fencing along the cliff edge. A long metal crane and crane operator building sit on the slab. A panel that explains sea bird habitat is mounted to the railing that faces the rocky cliffs of Landing Cove, Arch rock, and the Anacapa lighthouse in the distance. Benches and picnic tables are provided. The trailhead begins to the west of the slab where the concrete surface changes to compacted soil.<br /><br />CRANE OPERATOR BUILDING AND CRANE <br />A small crane building sits on the concrete slab of the upper landing. This house like structure with a wood-shingled gable roof, horizontal white board siding and garage door, butts against a rocky ledge. Three sides of the building are wrapped with large bay-style windows each with green trim and grilling. A long, black, metal crane called a derrick hoist, hangs overhead, spanning the length of the concrete slab. The crane sits on a platform to the left of the crane building. Above the building, a tripod of pipes and several thick cables anchored to the slab hold the crane in place. <br /><br />MIDDLE LANDING EXHIBIT PANELS AND LANDSCAPE<br />You are on the Middle Landing Platform, a narrow concrete slab built into the cliff and surrounded by thick pipe railing, enclosed with metal fencing.<br /><br />Three panel exhibits mark this location; the Welcome panel and an illustration of Kelp Forests are mounted side by side on a white seawall.

    "bodyText": "<p><em>'anyapax is the Chumash word for Anacapa. It means mean 'mirage' or 'illusion' and refers to the atmospheric phenomena that occasionally distorts the appearance of the island when viewed from the mainland.<br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> <br /> Crossing the channel to Anacapa Island, one begins to understand why the island's name was derived from its Chumash Native American Indian name ’anyapax . Seeming to change shape in the summer fog or afternoon heat, the three islets of Anacapa look like an island of deception or a mirage. Almost five miles long, these islets (appropriately named East, Middle, and West Anacapa Islands) are inaccessible from each other except by boat. They have a total land area of about one square mile (700 acres). Waves have eroded the volcanic island, creating towering sea cliffs, sea caves, and natural bridges, such as forty-foot-high Arch Rock-a symbol of Anacapa and Channel Islands National Park.<br /> <br /> Exploring East Anacapa's two-mile trail system allows visitors to experience the island's native vegetation, wildlife, and cultural history. Although for much of the year the island vegetation looks brown and lifeless, the winter rains transform the landscape. Emerging from dormancy, the native plants come alive with color. The strange tree sunflower, or coreopsis, blossoms with bright yellow bouquets that are so vivid and numerous they can sometimes be seen from the mainland. Vibrant red paintbrush, island morning glory, and pale buckwheat add touches of color to the island's palette.<br /> <br /> Seabirds are probably the most conspicuous wildlife on Anacapa Island. Thousands of birds use Anacapa as a nesting area because of the relative lack of predators on the island. While the steep cliffs of West Anacapa are home to the largest breeding colony of endangered California brown pelicans, all the islets of Anacapa host the largest breeding colony of western gulls in the world. Western gulls begin their nesting efforts at the end of April, sometimes making their shallow nests just inches from island trails. Fluffy chicks hatch in May and June and fly away from the nest in July.<br /> <br /> The rocky shores of Anacapa are perfect resting and breeding areas for California sea lions and harbor seals. The raucous barking of sea lions can be heard from most areas of the island. Two overlooks (Cathedral Cove and Pinniped Point) provide excellent spots to look down on seals and sea lions in the island coves.<br /> <br /> Anacapa's rich kelp forests (ideal for kayaking, snorkeling, and diving) and tidepool areas provide visitors with the opportunity to meet some of the resident ocean animals up close. Visitors may also catch a glimpse of the fascinating undersea world of the kelp forest without getting wet. During the spring and summer, park rangers dive into the Landing Cove on East Anacapa with a video camera. Visitors can see, through the eye of the camera, what the diver is seeing-bright sea stars, spiny sea urchins, and brilliant orange Garibaldi-by watching video monitors located on the dock, in the mainland visitor center auditorium, in classrooms, or via the Internet. And, divers can answer questions from visitors as part of this distance learning program.<br /> <br /> Anacapa Island has a rich human history as well. Shell midden sites indicate where Chumash people camped on the islands thousands of years ago. In addition, visitors can view the 1932 light station whose mission revival style buildings include the lighthouse, fog signal building, one of four original keeper's quarters, a water tank building, and several other service buildings. The original lead-crystal Fresnel lens, which served as a beacon to ships until an automated light replaced it in 1990, is on exhibit in the East Anacapa Visitor Center.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Island Facts</strong></u></p> <p>- Located in Ventura County.<br /> <br /> - Fourteen miles from Ventura.<br /> <br /> - Five miles long and 1/4 mile wide.<br /> <br /> - Average rainfall is between eight and thirteen inches per year.<br /> <br /> - Supports 265 species of plants, including two found only on Anacapa and 20 found only on the Channel Islands.<br /> <br /> - The Anacapa deer mouse is only found on Anacapa Island.<br /> <br /> - West Anacapa is home to the largest breeding colony of California brown pelicans.<br /> <br /> - Scripps's murrelet colonies are recovering following rat eradication in 2002.<br /> <br /> - Frenchy LeDreau lived at Frenchys Cove from 1928 to 1956.<br /> <br /> - The Anacapa lighthouse, turned on in 1932, was the last permanent lighthouse built on the West Coast.<br /> <br /> - Harbor seals and California sea lions rest and breed on the island.<br /> <br /> - Home to 30 sea caves.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Things to Do</strong></u></p> <p>Anacapa Island is the perfect place for a half-day, one-day, or short overnight camping trip. If you have time to visit just one island, this may be the place. As with all the Channel Islands, visiting Anacapa Island is an exercise in preparation and self-reliance. Since there are no services on the islands, there are no remedies for poor planning once you have arrived. For more information than what is listed below visit: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/\">nps.gov/chis</a><br /> <br /> <strong>Boat Transportation</strong><br /> Island Packers offers trips year round. Travel time is about one hour.Almost all trips are to East Anacapa Island. A limited number of trips are offered throughout the year to Frenchys Cove on West Anacapa Island. Visitors must climb from the boat up a steel-rung ladder to a dock. Once ashore, visitors must climb 157 stairs to the top of the island. Non-landing trips are also available.<br /> <br /> <strong>Goods and Services</strong><br /> There are no goods, services, or accommodations (lodging) available on the island. Visitors must bring all their own food and supplies. Public phones are not available.<br /> <br /> <strong>Water</strong><br /> There is no water available on the island. Visitors must bring all their water with them.<br /> <br /> <strong>Picnicking</strong><br /> Picnic tables are available at the visitor center.<br /> <br /> <strong>Visitor Center</strong><br /> A small visitor center is located in one of the historic Coast Guard buildings. Features include displays on the natural and cultural resources of the island and the original lead-crystal Fresnel lens from the Anacapa Lighthouse.<br /> <br /> <strong>Interpretive Programs</strong><br /> On days that the concessionaire boats run to the islands, guided hikes may be offered by national park volunteers or concessionaire naturalists. If they are not available to lead hikes, self-guided interpretive trail booklets are available. Hikes generally begin 30 minutes after Island Packers boats arrive on the island. During the spring and summer, Channel Islands Live programs are offered where park rangers with special microphone-equipped dive masks and underwater video cameras descend into towering kelp forests and interact with you on this virtual underwater hike.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Although hiking options are limited with only two miles of trails, the scenery is unmatched. Except for the staircase to the top of the island, the figure eight-shaped trail system is relatively flat and easy while meandering over gentle slopes to dramatic overlooks, magnificent coastal views, and the last permanent lighthouse built on the West Coast. Hikers must stay on trails to protect fragile vegetation and nesting seabirds and for visitor safety. Middle Anacapa and West Anacapa are not open to hiking. They are set aside for the island wildlife except for Frenchys Cove on West Anacapa that can be reached only by boat.<br /> <br /> <strong>Camping</strong><br /> Primitive camping is available (seven sites; $15 per night per site; reservations required). Picnic table, food storage box, and pit toilet are provided. No water is available. Distance from landing to campground is one-half mile and includes a 157-stair climb.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watersports</strong><br /> Ideal place for swimming, diving, snorkeling, and kayaking, but there are no lifeguards on the island. Since Anacapa is a cliff island, access to the water is only at the Landing Cove on East Anacapa via a dock. There are no other accessible beaches unless you have a watercraft. Excellent watersports can be experienced at the Landing Cove. The underwater visibility is usually very good and the water is teeming with life since it is located within a marine reserve. Kayaking east towards Arch Rock or west towards Cathedral Cove provides great wildlife viewing, sea caves, and arches.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fishing</strong><br /> No fishing is allowed within the marine reserve that is located on the north side of Anacapa Island, including in the the Landing Cove. Also, no fishing is allowed (except for commercial and recreational lobster and pelagic finfish) in the marine conservation area on the north side of West Anacapa Island. Fishing is allowed outside these marine protected areas. To fish in Channel Islands National Park,m possession of a valid California state fishing license with an ocean enhancement stamp is required and all California Department of Fish and Game regulations apply.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wildlife/Wildflower Viewing</strong><br /> There is excellent wildlife viewing on Anacapa. A variety of seabirds can be seen throughout the year, including brown pelicans, cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and western gulls (gull nesting and chicks can be observed from the end of April through July). Seals and sea lions may also be viewed from Pinniped Point, Cathedral Cove, and the boat. During a normal year of rainfall, wildflowers are best viewed in late winter and spring. The brilliant yellow coreopsis flowers usually peak between late January and March. In addition, some plants like gumplant, buckwheat, poppies, and verbena continue to bloom during the summer. The only accessible site on Anacapa Island for tidepooling is at Frenchys Cove on West Anacapa Island. A limited number of trips are offered throughout the year by Island Packers.There is no access to Frenchys Cove or any other tidepools from East Anacapa.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Channel Islands Live: Webcams and Broadcasts</strong></u></p> <p>Remote, isolated, rugged, and sometimes inaccessible, the park can be challenging to experience. Now, through advanced technology, Channel Islands Live brings the park to you.<br /> <br /> Join rangers as they dive through Anacapa Island's towering kelp forests and hike it's dramatic trails.<br /> <br /> Channel Islands Live includes interactive broadcasts where visitors can talk to the rangers and ask questions, curriculum-based presentations for schools, and webcams for monitoring island and underwater features. By bridging the channel through technology we are helping plant the seeds of understanding that can grow into the desire to preserve and protect this extraordinary place.<br /> <br /> Park visitors and students can join us for these programs on Anacapa Island, at the Robert J. Lagomarsino Visitor Center in Ventura Harbor, in classrooms, and on the Internet.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/live-programs.htm\">Live Broadcasts</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/photosmultimedia/ocean-webcam.htm\">Ocean Webcam</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/photosmultimedia/anacapa-landing-cove-webcam.htm\">Anacapa Island Webcam</a><br />  </p> <p><u><strong>History and Culture Overview</strong></u></p> <p>Just 13 miles from the Channel Islands National Park Visitor Center in Ventura, Anacapa Island is the second smallest of the Channel Islands at roughly five miles long and one-half mile wide. The native Chumash once called this island \"Ennepah,\" a word meaning deception or mirage which alluded to this island's changing shape when viewed at different times from the mainland and other islands. Anacapa is actually a narrow chain of three islands appropriately called East, Middle, and West Anacapa. Emerging from the fog of the Santa Barbara Channel, Anacapa Island drifts in and out of sight, beckoning visitors from the mainland as it has for centuries.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on Anacapa</strong><br /> Archeological evidence suggests that the native Chumash people were visiting Anacapa Island as long as 5,000 years ago. Abalone and mussel shells, bones from fish, birds, and pinnipeds, and human artifacts such as bone tools, shell beads, projectile points, and fish hooks all suggest extensive human activity on the island. Due to the absence of fresh water on the island, it is likely that seasonal camps were used for fishing and other activities.<br /> <br /> Despite the lack of archeological evidence of permanent settlements on the island, Chumash legend holds that the American Indian population of the Channel Islands began on Anacapa. In the early 20th century, anthropologist John Harrington extensively interviewed a Mission San Buenaventura Chumash man named Fernando Librado who told Harrington a story passed on orally through generations of Chumash Indians. According to the story, eight families traveled to Anacapa Island after a civil war on the mainland and settled on the north side of the middle island. For water, they dug a hole and used seepage at Indian Cave on West Anacapa. After a time, the eight families left Anacapa for Santa Cruz Island, eventually spreading to all the northern islands.<br /> <br /> <strong>European Contact</strong><br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was the first European explorer to make contact with the Channel Islands in 1542. Although he passed Anacapa, he and his crew never settled there. Cabrillo named the northern Islands Las Islas de San Lucas, which included Anacapa.<br /> <br /> Learning that there were no American Indians on the island, few European explorers visited Anacapa the following decades. Its small size and relative unimportance left the island largely unrecorded for a period of 250 years. The 1793 expedition by Englishman George Vancouver standardized the names of the Channel Islands. Vancouver recorded Anacapa as \"Enecapa\" and the present spelling appeared on maps in 1854.<br /> <br /> <strong>Ranching</strong><br /> Like many of the other Channel Islands, Anacapa Island was used for sheep ranching during the latter half of the 19th century. It is uncertain exactly when ranching began on Anacapa. It is believed that three men owned ranches prior to the first recorded lease which began in 1902. H. Bay Webster, himself a sheep rancher on the island, recalled that the first sheep ranch had been established by George Nidever before 1885, although he may have been confused with events on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> Ranchers used Middle Anacapa for the main headquarters of their sheep operations and the livestock were landed on the northwest side of the island. Sheep survived year-round, but on a marginal basis. With no dependable supply of fresh water, many recalled the somewhat dubious story that the sheep would lick the moisture from the morning fog off of each other's coats. To improve grazing, sheep ranchers introduced exotic grasses to the island. By the 1930s the sheep had destroyed most of the native plants and had begun to eat the endemic Astragalus miguelensis. As a result, many of the sheep died, bringing an end to sheep herding on Anacapa.<br /> <br /> <strong>Residents</strong><br /> Heaman Bayfield Webster, a former island seal hunter, long-time Ventura resident and assistant postmaster, established residence on Middle Anacapa with his wife and two sons in 1907. For $31 per year, he leased all three of the islands \"for grazing and farming only,\" establishing the first government-recorded ranch on Anacapa. The family spent summers and two winters on the island tending to a flock of nearly 300 sheep. In the fall of 1911, Webster set up a school in a tent for his children and hired a governess to teach them, the first school house on the Channel Islands. Most of Webster's income came from tourism and wool.<br /> <br /> Perhaps the most illustrious resident of Anacapa Island was Raymond \"Frenchy\" LeDreau. The Frenchman made his way to the island in 1928, taking up the life of a fisherman and hermit. He built several huts perched on a ledge overlooking the area now called Frenchy's Cove. Focusing on lobster fishing, Frenchy sold fish to passing Larco Company boats and hosted visitors and fisherman passing by. Friends old and new brought him food and supplies in return for lobster, abalone, and conversation. He was an educated man, apt to discuss literature and sing an aria in a tenor voice. During prohibition he made money by watching over caches of liquor stored in many of Anacapa's caves by rumrunners and bootleggers.<br /> <br /> When the US Government created the Channel Islands National Monument in 1938, which included both Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands, it appeared that Frenchy might be forced to leave. So impressed, however, was National Park Service biologist Lowell Sumner with LeDreau's concern for the natural history and welfare of the island that Lowell suggested LeDreau \"be allowed to remain on the island as long as he desires.\" Frenchy became the de-facto caretaker of Anacapa Island for the National Park Service until 1956 when, at the age of 80, he was forced to leave after a fall left him with severe injuries. He had lived on Anacapa Island for 28 years.<br /> <br /> In 1932, the Anacapa Island Light Station was completed on East Anacapa Island. The lighthouse and fog signal are still operated by the US Coast Guard and the original Fresnel lens is on display in the island's visitor center.<br /> <br /> <strong>The National Park Service</strong><br /> On April 26, 1938, the Channel Islands National Monument was established. It included both Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands. Nearly twenty years later, in July 1959, Anacapa Island opened to visitors and provided park ranger services. Closest to the mainland, Anacapa is the second most visited island of the Channel Islands National Park.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Ethnographic Island Place Names</strong></u></p> <p>Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

This arch on the northeast shore of the island is a 130 ft tall and was created by wave erosion of fault weakened rock.<br /> <br /> <b>Stop 4: Arch Point Tour-Return of the Natives</b><br /> <br /> As you walk the island, you may notice the fields of grains and grasses that dominate the landscape. This was not always the case. What was once an island covered with coastal sage and bluff scrub, maritime cactus scrub, and native grasslands, has given way to nonnative, European grazing grasses and an assortment of weeds, including iceplants, oats, bromes, foxtails, thistles, and mustard. Today, about a third of the plant species found on Santa Barbara Island are nonnative.<br /> <br /> During the early 1900s, native vegetation was cut, burned, and plowed for farming. In addition, sheep, goats, and rabbits severely overgrazed the island, eliminating most of the native vegetation and creating open, disturbed, and eroded soils that allowed nonnative plants to flourish. Once established, these hardier nonnatives outcompeted the natives for limited soil and moisture, due to their longer germination and growth cycles and ability to withstand grazing and browsing by livestock.<br /> <br /> The NPS is working to restore the island's native vegetation, and special focus is being placed on the 14 plants endemic to the islands-those found nowhere else in the world. Four of these occur only on Santa Barbara Island: the Santa Barbara Island live-forever, buckwheat, cream cups, and island chicory. To ensure the survival of these unique species and encourage the recovery of the island's native vegetation, all non-native animals have been removed and the effort to plant native species and control nonnative weeds is underway.<br /> <br /> The recovery of native plants has so far been remarkable. Many are now spreading beyond the buried seed banks and steep canyon walls and cliffs, where they remained protected from grazing, and are reestablishing themselves slowly throughout the island.<br /> <br /> This reestablishment of native plants has also aided in the recovery of endemic deer mice, night lizards, and nesting land birds by providing important habitat. Today, there are 14 land birds that nest annually on the island. Three of these-the horned lark, orange-crowned warbler, and house finch-are endemic subspecies found only on Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the island's recovery did not come soon enough for the endemic Santa Barbara Island song sparrow, one of the smallest forms of song sparrow and differentiated from its mainland relative by its very gray back. The destruction of this sparrow's sagebrush and coreopsis nesting habitat and the presence of feral cats led to the extinction of this species in the 1960s. It is now lost forever.<br /> <br /> However, ecological restoration has helped populations of the endemic island night lizard recover to the point that it was removed from the Federal List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife in 2014. This species only occurs on Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, and San Clemente Islands.<br /> <br /> You can help with this recovery of island natives by cleaning your boots and other possessions, such as backpacks, before you visit. This ensures that you don't accidentally introduce nonnative species to the island. Together we can guarantee the return of native plants and animals throughout Santa Barbara Island.</p>",

J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Oceanodroma homochroa</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The ashy storm-petrel relies upon the isolated breeding grounds of the Channel Islands National Park to ensure its successful reproduction. Due to its sensitivity to outside influences that impact its numbers, the park has proved to be a major component in its vitality. The park's success in removing non-native species such as the black rat that have preyed upon nesting birds has been a factor in the increase in many of the susceptible seabird populations.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Ashy storm-petrel breeds on 17 islands in the northeast Pacific, principally off California, but also northwestern Baja California, Mexico.</li> <li>They have a restricted range and a small global population of approximately 10,000 birds.</li> <li>Fifty percent of the world's population of ashy storm-petrels breed on San Miguel, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and Anacapa islands.</li> <li>They mate in the same pair with the same mate for many years and nest at the same burrow.</li> <li>Ashy Storm-Petrels nest in rock crevices along cliffs, offshore rocks, and under driftwood in sea caves.</li> <li>Ashy storm-petrels have a long breeding cycle, laying just one egg in May and fledging in October.</li> <li>Ashy storm-petrels depart from and return to the nest at night to avoid predators.</li> <li>Petrels \"patter\" on the ocean's surface to gather prey items including squid, fish and krill.</li> <li>Ashy storm-petrels can live to 34 years old.</li> <li>The ashy storm-petrel is listed as species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The ashy storm-petrel, as the name implies, is an entirely gray seabird with a forked tail, roughly the size of a purple martin. This small seabird weighs 1.3 ounces and is eight inches in length, with a wingspan of 18 inches. It is smaller and grayer than the similar black and Leach's storm-petrels, but larger than the least storm-petrel-the other dark species found in the area.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The ashy storm-petrel can only be found on the islands off California and in the adjacent waters. This species' limited year-round range extends from Cape Mendocino, California, to northern Baja, just south of the US- Mexico border. Breeding colonies occur on offshore islands in the area, including the Southeast Farallon islands, San Miguel, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, San Clemente and Mexico's Coronados islands. On most of the larger islands listed above, breeding occurs on outlying rock formations, free of mammalian predators.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Ashy storm-petrels feed near their nesting islands in the offshore waters of the California Current, one of the richest regions of the world ocean. The birds breed on rocky islands among talus slopes, from just above sea level to the highest, interior portions of nesting islands. Smaller islands and offshore rocks where resources are not sufficient normally to sustain predatory mammals, such as rats and foxes, are preferred for nesting.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> It is a gregarious bird at sea, feeding nocturnally on squid, loligo opalescens, fish (particularly lanternfishes myctophids, which rise to the sea's surface at night) and krill, which also swarm at the surface. They are also attracted to fishing vessels for the fish oils released when the nets are pulled. During the breeding season, foraging coincides spatially and seasonally with the spawning aggregations of sardines and anchovies.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Ashy storm-petrels nest in rock burrows on offshore islands, returning to the nests at night. The species has a long breeding cycle, laying eggs in May and fledging in October, although timing varies greatly, more so than in most other storm-petrels: some pairs may have a chick that is half grown when other pairs are still laying. Like in many other seabirds, pairs show both mate and site fidelity. They mate in the same pair with the same mate for many years and nest at the same burrow. This is intriguing since the pairs spend their lives out of the breeding season separate from each other, and despite the fact that many individuals might seem to compete for burrows at the nesting colonies. A change in mate is usually associated with a change in nesting site.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Like other storm-petrels, ashy storm-petrels arrive and depart their breeding colonies only at night. Outside of the breeding season it is believed to be more widely distributed, foraging on the California Current, but undertakes no large migration and doesn't range as far as other species of storm-petrel.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The ashy storm-petrel is listed as species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game. The limited range of this species makes it susceptible to local disasters such as an oil spill. The species is particularly susceptible to loss of coastal upwellings that have been unpredictable along the California coast in recent years and are anticipated to decline further in the face of global warming. Increased populations of western gulls, predators of ashy storm-petrels, at a number of breeding sites are cause for concern. Ashy storm-petrel breeding colonies are also susceptible to introduced mammalian predators including mice, rats, and cats. Ashy storm-petrels are sensitive to disturbance, especially during the incubation period. Most ashy storm-petrel breeding colonies fall within protected areas in California, which includes Channel Islands National Park. The park's success in removing non-native species such as the black rat that have preyed upon nesting birds has been a factor in the increase in many of the susceptible seabird populations such as the ashy storm-petrel.

    "bodyText": "<p>Primitive, dispersed backcountry beach camping is available in the Norththwest Quadrant (Sandy Point to Carrington Point) from September 16 through December 31. Beaches around Sandy Point and at Lobo Canyon are closed to camping year round. Learn more at: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/backcountry-beach-camping-on-santa-rosa-island.htm\">Backcountry Beach Camping: Santa Rosa Island </a><br /> <br /> Backcountry beach camping is available mid August through December along Santa Rosa Island's extensive, beautiful, and undeveloped 55-mile coastline. This coastline is reminiscent of a California in days gone by. The rocky coast and sandy beaches are much the same as the ones the Chumash Indians, Spanish explorers, and early ranchers may have known. This remote, fragile environment is critical for sea and shorebirds, marine mammals, and plant communities.<br /> <br /> In 1992, the National Park Service opened the island to backcountry beach camping in recognition of its rare wilderness values. As you explore these wild areas by kayak or on foot, please take responsibility to help us protect and preserve these delicate natural resources for future generations. The following information will help you enjoy your visit while leaving the smallest impact on the island.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>WARNING: While backcountry camping is an incredible experience, it is not for the inexperienced backpacker or kayaker. Due to difficult weather, rugged terrain, and off-trail hiking, backcountry camping is an arduous endeavor and should be undertaken only by experienced, well-conditioned backpackers and kayakers.</strong> </b><br /> <br /> <b>Open and Closed Dates</b><br /> <br /> - January 1 - August 14<br /> Backcountry beach camping is closed to protect pupping seals/sea lions and nesting seabirds.<br /> <br /> - August 15 - September 15<br /> Only East Point to South Point Beaches (Southeast Quadrant) are open to backcountry camping for boaters, kayakers, and backpackers.<br /> <br /> - September 16 - December 31<br /> All beaches are open to backcountry camping except those around Sandy Point and those between Carrington Point and East Point.<br /> <br /> <b>Destinations and Distances</b><br /> The park boat concessionaire, Island Packers, usually drops off and picks up kayakers and backpackers at the pier near the ranch area in Bechers Bay. Channel Islands Aviation drops hikers at the end of the airstrip near Water Canyon, approximately one mile from the pier and a 1/2 mile from the frontcountry campground in Water Canyon.<br /> <br /> Hiking is along the beach, dirt roads, or unmaintained paths created by island animals. These roads and paths are rugged and mountainous with no signs. All distances that follow are approximate and measured from the pier, unless stated. Please refer to topographical maps for more accurate mileage and to help with the following descriptions. It is recommended that all backpackers purchase topographic maps (USGS 7.5 minute maps or the Trails Illustrated map of all the islands) and kayakers purchase nautical charts before departing on their journey.<br /> <br /> Although the closest beach that is open to camping between August 15 and September 15 is just south of East Point (approximately seven hiking miles and eight kayaking miles from the pier), it is not recommended for camping. This beach is a small pocket beach and may be washed out at higher tides. In addition, pounding surf and strong winds constantly reshape this beach.<br /> <br /> If hiking beyond East Point to Ford Point, it is recommended that you follow the ridge line or road until you reach the northeast ridge of San Augustine Canyon. Follow this ridge down to the mouth of the canyon. Hiking along the beach from East Point to Ford Point is impossible due to sections of vertical cliffs that drop directly into the ocean. However, kayakers can access beaches throughout this area. Once hikers reach Ford Point, they may follow the low terrace or higher ridge (both eventually run into a coastal road) down to the Johnsons Lee area. Refer to topographical maps for more details.<br /> <br /> Direct access to beaches between Johnsons Lee and Ford Point (including La Jolla Vieja) is also possible via the Main/Soledad or South/Wreck roads. Both of these routes are long hikes (see mileage chart to the right) with a considerable amount of climbing and, once again, like all hiking or kayaking on the island, is recommended only for the experienced, well-conditioned traveler.<br /> <br /> Beginning September 16, the closest beach camping is Cow Canyon (approximately five hiking miles or seven kayaking miles from the pier). Nearby Lobo Canyon beach is closed to beach camping and only available for day use.<br /> <br /> <u>Hiking Distances (from pier unless noted; in miles)</u><br /> <br /> - Ford Point via South Road: 9 hiking<br /> - East Point: 7 hiking; 8 kayaking<br /> - East Point to Ford Point: 8 hiking; 5 kayaking<br /> - Ford Point to Johnsons Lee: 4 hiking; 3.5 kayaking<br /> - Johnsons Lee (via East Point): 18 hiking; 16 kayaking<br /> - Johnsons Lee via Main Road: 14 hiking<br /> - Johnsons Lee via South Road: 13.5 hiking<br /> - La Jolla Vieja via South Road: 11.2 hiking<br /> - Cow Canyon: 5 hiking; 7 kayaking<br /> <br /> <b>Water</b><br /> One gallon of water per person per day is recommended. Water weighs approximately 8 pounds per gallon. Potable water is available in the Water Canyon campground.<br /> <br /> During the backcountry camping season (mid-August through December), the only location outside the Water Canyon campground with an accessible, guaranteed water source is Clapp Spring, approximately 7 miles from the pier. The water at Clapp Spring is safe to drink when boiled, filtered, or treated with iodine.<br /> <br /> Although nine canyons may carry some degree of water throughout the year (except during dry years), water is not always available at the mouth of the canyons near the beach and can be dirty. These nine canyons include: Water, Old Ranch House (intermittent), San Augustine, Wreck, Jolla Vieja, Arlington, Soledad, Cow (Intermittent), and Lobo (Intermittent). Since the water in the streams can be contaminated with coliform bacteria and giardia, it is recommended that you boil, filter, and/or add iodine to the water.<br /> <br /> <b>Weather</b><br /> Backpackers and kayakers should be prepared for strong northwest winds throughout the year, with the possibility of strong east or Santa Ana winds from October through January. The average wind speed is 15 knots, although speeds of 40 to 50 knots are not uncommon. Occasionally, the south side of the island (South Point to East Point) offers protection from these strong winds.<br /> <br /> Dense fog is common during the summer months, but may occur at any time, making chart and compass navigation mandatory. Weather conditions are generally best from August through October, with relatively calm wind and sea conditions and virtually no rain. Ocean water temperatures range from the lower 50s (Â°F) in the winter to the upper 60s (Â°F) in the fall.<br /> <br /> Kayakers may encounter strong ocean currents around the islands. Intense wave and surf conditions exist around the Carrington Point area. Sheer cliffs rise out of the ocean, reflecting incoming waves back out to sea, creating a washing machine effect. In this turbulent area there are no places to land, even in an emergency. The first landable beach is Lobo Canyon, five miles west of the ranch area pier. Rounding Skunk Point may be tricky as well because of merging currents. The wind often increases in the afternoon, and the prevailing northwesterlies can make paddling back to Water Canyon difficult. During the summer months, large swells often pound the south side of the island, making landing and launching from the beaches extremely challenging, requiring advanced skills.<br /> <br /> Visitors are advised to bring supplies for an extra day in case boats are unable to pick up campers due to sea conditions.<br /> <br /> For the most current weather forecast, please visit Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary's <a href=\"https://channelislands.noaa.gov/news/kiosk/forecast.html\"> Internet Weather Kiosk</a> .<br /> <br /> <b>Regulations and Guidelines</b><br /> The protection and preservation of your park's biological and cultural resources is the mission of the National Park Service.

    "bodyText": "<p>Primitive, dispersed backcountry beach camping is available in the Southwest Quadrant (South Point to Sandy Point) from September 16 through December 31. Beaches around Sandy Point are closed to camping year round. Learn more at: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/backcountry-beach-camping-on-santa-rosa-island.htm\">Backcountry Beach Camping: Santa Rosa Island</a><br /> <br /> Backcountry beach camping is available mid August through December along Santa Rosa Island's extensive, beautiful, and undeveloped 55-mile coastline. This coastline is reminiscent of a California in days gone by. The rocky coast and sandy beaches are much the same as the ones the Chumash Indians, Spanish explorers, and early ranchers may have known. This remote, fragile environment is critical for sea and shorebirds, marine mammals, and plant communities.<br /> <br /> In 1992, the National Park Service opened the island to backcountry beach camping in recognition of its rare wilderness values. As you explore these wild areas by kayak or on foot, please take responsibility to help us protect and preserve these delicate natural resources for future generations. The following information will help you enjoy your visit while leaving the smallest impact on the island.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>WARNING: While backcountry camping is an incredible experience, it is not for the inexperienced backpacker or kayaker. Due to difficult weather, rugged terrain, and off-trail hiking, backcountry camping is an arduous endeavor and should be undertaken only by experienced, well-conditioned backpackers and kayakers.</strong> </b><br /> <br /> <b>Open and Closed Dates</b><br /> <br /> - January 1 - August 14<br /> Backcountry beach camping is closed to protect pupping seals/sea lions and nesting seabirds.<br /> <br /> - August 15 - September 15<br /> Only East Point to South Point Beaches (Southeast Quadrant) are open to backcountry camping for boaters, kayakers, and backpackers.<br /> <br /> - September 16 - December 31<br /> All beaches are open to backcountry camping except those around Sandy Point and those between Carrington Point and East Point.<br /> <br /> <b>Destinations and Distances</b><br /> The park boat concessionaire, Island Packers, usually drops off and picks up kayakers and backpackers at the pier near the ranch area in Bechers Bay. Channel Islands Aviation drops hikers at the end of the airstrip near Water Canyon, approximately one mile from the pier and a 1/2 mile from the frontcountry campground in Water Canyon.<br /> <br /> Hiking is along the beach, dirt roads, or unmaintained paths created by island animals. These roads and paths are rugged and mountainous with no signs. All distances that follow are approximate and measured from the pier, unless stated. Please refer to topographical maps for more accurate mileage and to help with the following descriptions. It is recommended that all backpackers purchase topographic maps (USGS 7.5 minute maps or the Trails Illustrated map of all the islands) and kayakers purchase nautical charts before departing on their journey.<br /> <br /> Although the closest beach that is open to camping between August 15 and September 15 is just south of East Point (approximately seven hiking miles and eight kayaking miles from the pier), it is not recommended for camping. This beach is a small pocket beach and may be washed out at higher tides. In addition, pounding surf and strong winds constantly reshape this beach.<br /> <br /> If hiking beyond East Point to Ford Point, it is recommended that you follow the ridge line or road until you reach the northeast ridge of San Augustine Canyon. Follow this ridge down to the mouth of the canyon. Hiking along the beach from East Point to Ford Point is impossible due to sections of vertical cliffs that drop directly into the ocean. However, kayakers can access beaches throughout this area. Once hikers reach Ford Point, they may follow the low terrace or higher ridge (both eventually run into a coastal road) down to the Johnsons Lee area. Refer to topographical maps for more details.<br /> <br /> Direct access to beaches between Johnsons Lee and Ford Point (including La Jolla Vieja) is also possible via the Main/Soledad or South/Wreck roads. Both of these routes are long hikes (see mileage chart to the right) with a considerable amount of climbing and, once again, like all hiking or kayaking on the island, is recommended only for the experienced, well-conditioned traveler.<br /> <br /> Beginning September 16, the closest beach camping is Cow Canyon (approximately five hiking miles or seven kayaking miles from the pier). Nearby Lobo Canyon beach is closed to beach camping and only available for day use.<br /> <br /> <u>Hiking Distances (from pier unless noted; in miles)</u><br /> <br /> - Ford Point via South Road: 9 hiking<br /> - East Point: 7 hiking; 8 kayaking<br /> - East Point to Ford Point: 8 hiking; 5 kayaking<br /> - Ford Point to Johnsons Lee: 4 hiking; 3.5 kayaking<br /> - Johnsons Lee (via East Point): 18 hiking; 16 kayaking<br /> - Johnsons Lee via Main Road: 14 hiking<br /> - Johnsons Lee via South Road: 13.5 hiking<br /> - La Jolla Vieja via South Road: 11.2 hiking<br /> - Cow Canyon: 5 hiking; 7 kayaking<br /> <br /> <b>Water</b><br /> One gallon of water per person per day is recommended. Water weighs approximately 8 pounds per gallon. Potable water is available in the Water Canyon campground.<br /> <br /> During the backcountry camping season (mid-August through December), the only location outside the Water Canyon campground with an accessible, guaranteed water source is Clapp Spring, approximately 7 miles from the pier. The water at Clapp Spring is safe to drink when boiled, filtered, or treated with iodine.<br /> <br /> Although nine canyons may carry some degree of water throughout the year (except during dry years), water is not always available at the mouth of the canyons near the beach and can be dirty. These nine canyons include: Water, Old Ranch House (intermittent), San Augustine, Wreck, Jolla Vieja, Arlington, Soledad, Cow (Intermittent), and Lobo (Intermittent). Since the water in the streams can be contaminated with coliform bacteria and giardia, it is recommended that you boil, filter, and/or add iodine to the water.<br /> <br /> <b>Weather</b><br /> Backpackers and kayakers should be prepared for strong northwest winds throughout the year, with the possibility of strong east or Santa Ana winds from October through January. The average wind speed is 15 knots, although speeds of 40 to 50 knots are not uncommon. Occasionally, the south side of the island (South Point to East Point) offers protection from these strong winds.<br /> <br /> Dense fog is common during the summer months, but may occur at any time, making chart and compass navigation mandatory. Weather conditions are generally best from August through October, with relatively calm wind and sea conditions and virtually no rain. Ocean water temperatures range from the lower 50s (Â°F) in the winter to the upper 60s (Â°F) in the fall.<br /> <br /> Kayakers may encounter strong ocean currents around the islands. Intense wave and surf conditions exist around the Carrington Point area. Sheer cliffs rise out of the ocean, reflecting incoming waves back out to sea, creating a washing machine effect. In this turbulent area there are no places to land, even in an emergency. The first landable beach is Lobo Canyon, five miles west of the ranch area pier. Rounding Skunk Point may be tricky as well because of merging currents. The wind often increases in the afternoon, and the prevailing northwesterlies can make paddling back to Water Canyon difficult. During the summer months, large swells often pound the south side of the island, making landing and launching from the beaches extremely challenging, requiring advanced skills.<br /> <br /> Visitors are advised to bring supplies for an extra day in case boats are unable to pick up campers due to sea conditions.<br /> <br /> For the most current weather forecast, please visit Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary's <a href=\"https://channelislands.noaa.gov/news/kiosk/forecast.html\"> Internet Weather Kiosk</a> .<br /> <br /> <b>Regulations and Guidelines</b><br /> The protection and preservation of your park's biological and cultural resources is the mission of the National Park Service. By following the regulations and guidelines listed below, you can help protect these rare and unique treasures for future generations to enjoy. For a more complete description please visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/management/lawsandpolicies.htm\">Laws and Policies</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lnt.org/\">Leave No Trace</a> .<br /> <br /> <u>Regulations:</u><br /> - Check-in with a ranger on arrival for an on-site orientation.<br /> - Camping is prohibited year-round at Lobo Canyon and between Carrington and East Point (except in the Water Canyon campground).<br /> - From January 1 - August 14, backcountry beachcamping is closed to protect pupping seals/sealions and nesting seabirds.<br /> - From March 1 to September 15, the back beaches and sand dunes between and including Skunk Point to just north of East Point are closed to hiking to protect the nesting area for the snowy plover, a federally listed, threatened shorebird. Please remain on the wet sand (below mean high tide) or the road throughout this area.<br /> - The beaches around Sandy Point are closed to all access year-round.<br /> - It is prohibited by law and regulation to leave human solid waste in the backcountry or in the wet intertidal sand. Human waste and toilet paper must be packed out for proper disposal. A variety of commercial \"waste bags\" are available at the following websites: <a href=\"http://www.whennaturecalls.com/products/restop2.html\"> www.Whennaturecalls.com/products/restop2.html</a> , <a href=\"http://www.biffybag.com/\">www.biffybag.com</a> , <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/692303.\">www.rei.com/product/692303</a> .<br /> - Camping is only allowed on beaches. Camping is prohibited in any other areas, including coastal bluffs.<br /> - No fires are allowed.<br /> - Since the mice do carry hantavirus, some basic precautions should be taken: do not feed any wild animals; keep food and drink in rodent-proof containers; and prevent entry of mice into your tent by keeping it zipped up at all times.

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Pseudacris H. Hypochondriaca</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Baja California treefrog is found on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and Catalina islands. These are the only native frogs known to inhabit the Channel Islands off the coast of southern California. However, the tree frog is probably the most abundant frog found in California as well as the western United States.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>You can find the extended family of treefrogs in your backyard, along the beach, in the Mojave Desert, in woodlands, in grasslands or pastures, and even at 11,000 feet on Mount Whitney.</li> <li>Baja California treefrogs change color based on the air temperature and humidity.</li> <li>Baja California treefrog's color change is to reduce the likelihood that it will become a meal for a bullfrog, raccoon, heron, snake, or other predator.</li> <li>Baja California treefrogs have special \"sticky pads\" on their feet that help them climb.</li> <li>Treefrog are the only frog in the West that makes the classic \"ribbet\" vocalization - the sound that Hollywood film producers have made familiar around the world.</li> <li>Frog music is heard most often in the spring, but treefrogs vocalize all year unless the temperature dips below freezing.</li> <li>Interestingly, the treefrogs coordinate their vocalizations, creating a frog chorus. One male acts as the \"chorus master\" and starts calling. Other males in the vicinity gradually join in as the chorus swells.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Male Baja California treefrogs are just under 2 inches long and generally green or dark gray, with a creamy underside. Females are gray or brown and a bit larger than the males. The color of both sexes can vary, but you can verify the Baja California treefrog identification by looking for a dark brown or black band that runs from the eyes to the shoulders and white underside.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Even though the Baja California treefrog exist on Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and Catalina islands, the range of this frog is not clear, due to the small number of specimens sampled for the study that described the species. It is apparently found throughout southern California, south of Santa Barbara County and Bakersfield and on the offshore islands, excluding most of the southeast deserts. It ranges farther east into Nevada, and south into Baja California.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> This species utilizes a wide variety of habitats, often far from water outside of the breeding season, including forest, woodland, chaparral, grassland, pastures, desert streams and oases, and urban areas. Although, in the breeding season, shallow bodies of water act as habitat due to its component in the laying of eggs. During active periods, adults are most commonly found in close proximity to and along stream channels. During the daytime, individuals seek refuge in cavities or small depressions on the surfaces of the boulders lining streams, often fully exposed to direct sunlight. These perches are usually within a few jumps from the nearest pool.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The Baja California treefrog eats a wide variety of invertebrates, primarily on the ground at night, including a high percentage of flying insects. During the breeding season, they also feed during the day. Typical of most frogs, prey is located by vision, and then the frog lunges with a large sticky tongue to catch the prey and bring it into the mouth to eat. Tadpoles are suspension feeders, eating a variety of prey including algaes, bacteria, protozoa and organic and inorganic debris.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Breeding is aquatic. Fertilization is external. Breeding and egg-laying occurs between November until July, depending on the location. Adults probably become reproductively mature in their first year. Males move to breeding waters and begin to make their advertisement call. These calls attract more males, then eventually females. Males call while in or next to water at night, and during daylight during the peak of breeding when calling can occur all day and night. Some males and females have been observed staying only a few weeks at a breeding site. Some males have been observed moving to another site. And others have been observed staying at a site the entire breeding season.Males are territorial during the breeding season, establishing territories that they will defend with an encounter call or by physically butting and wrestling with another male. Satellite male breeding behavior has been observed - a silent male will intercept and mate with females that are attracted to the calling of other territorial males.</p> <p>Females lay on average between 400 - 750 eggs in small, loose, irregular clusters of 10 - 80 eggs each. Egg clusters are attached to sticks, stems, or grass in quiet shallow water. The eggs hatch in two to three weeks. Eggs appear to be resistant to the negative effects of solar UV-B radiation and even to increased water acidification. Eggs can also survive freezing temperatures for a short time. Tadpoles aggregate for thermoregulation and to avoid predation.</p> <p>Tadpoles metamorphose in about 2 to 2.5 months, generally from June to late August. In summer, there are often large congregations of new metamorphs along the banks of breeding pools. Metamorphosed juveniles leave their birth pond soon after transformation, dispersing into adult habitats.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Baja California treefrog is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and because it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. This frog is not included on the Special Animals List, meaning there are no significant conservation concerns for it in California according to the Dept. of Fish and Game.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bioeco/ptreefrog.htm\">https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bioeco/ptreefrog.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://amphibiaweb.org/index.html\">http://amphibiaweb.org/index.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2008/06/creature-feature-pacific-treefrog\">http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2008/06/creature-feature-pacific-treefrog</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/islands/caislandherps.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/islands/caislandherps.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/</a></li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The bald eagle is one of the largest birds of prey found in North America. It is the national bird and symbol of the United States of America. This sea eagle has two known sub-species and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. Bald eagles typically can be found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting. In Channel Islands National Park, due to the persecution by humans and the effects of organochlorine chemicals such as DDT, breeding bald eagles were eliminated by the mid-1950's. In an innovative reintroduction program conducted 2002 and 2006, sixty-one young bald eagles were released on the northern Channel Islands.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The scientific name means \"a white-headed sea eagle\" and comes from the Greek words <em>halos</em>, meaning sea; <em>aetos</em> meaning an eagle; <em>leukos</em> meaning white; and <em>kephalus</em> referring to the head. Bald is from the Middle English word <em>balled</em>, meaning shining white.</li> <li>Rather than do their own fishing, bald eagles often go after other creatures' catches. A bald eagle will harass a hunting osprey until the smaller raptor drops its prey in midair, where the eagle swoops it up.</li> <li>Had Benjamin Franklin prevailed, America's emblem might have been the wild turkey not the bald eagle.</li> <li>The largest bald eagle nest on record, in St. Petersburg, Florida, was 10 feet in diameter and 20 feet tall. Another famous nest—in Vermilion,Ohio—was shaped like a wine glass and weighed over 2 tons. It was used for 34 years until the tree blew down.</li> <li>Immature bald eagles spend the first four years of their lives in nomadic exploration of vast territories and can fly hundreds of miles per day. Some young birds from California have reached Alaska.</li> <li>Bald eagles can live a long time, with a longevity record of 28 years in the wild and 36 years in captivity.</li> <li>Bald eagles occasionally hunt cooperatively, with one individual flushing prey towards another.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The plumage of an adult bald eagle is evenly brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but reversed sexual dimorphism, which occurs in many raptors, is evident in the species in that females are 25 percent larger than males. The beak, feet, and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of Canada, all of the continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. It presently occupies historical habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England. Northern eagles are migratory,while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year.</p> <p>Historical records indicate that in the early 20th century bald eagles bred on all islands within the park, with at least two dozen nesting pairs over the 8 Channel Islands. Breeding bald eagles provided important ecosystem functions in the northern Channel Islands. For example, bald eagles were once the top marine aerial predator and probably fed upon a variety of seabirds and fish. Bald eagles are generally highly territorial, and in the past this behavior may have prevented golden eagles from colonizing the islands. Due to the persecution by humans and the effects of organochlorine chemicals such as DDT, breeding bald eagles were eliminated by the mid-1950's. In an innovative reintroduction program conducted 2002 and 2006, sixty-one young bald eagles were released on the northern Channel Islands. Bald eagles have also been reintroduced on Santa Catalina Island</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The bald eagle explores sea coasts and other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish as well as rivers,large lakes, and mountainous open country. The bald eagle prefers old-growth and mature stands of coniferous or hardwood trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Selected trees must have good visibility, an open structure, and proximity to prey, but the height or species of tree is not as being in close proximity to water. The bald eagle is extremely sensitive to human activity, and is found most commonly in areas free of human disturbance.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The bald eagle's diet is opportunistic and varied, but most feed mainly on fish. When fish sources are unavailable, eagles may rely largely on carrion, especially in winter, and they will scavenge carcasses up to the size of whales, though it seems that carcasses of hoofed animals and large fish are preferred. They also may sometimes feed on subsistence scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps. Mammalian prey includes rabbits, hares, raccoons, muskrats, beavers, and deer fawns. Preferred avian prey includes grebes, alcids, ducks, gulls, coots, egrets, and geese. Most live prey are quite a bit smaller than the eagle, but predatory attacks on large birds such as the great blue heron and even swans have been recorded. Reptiles, amphibians and crustaceans (especially crabs) are preyed on when available.</p> <p>Fishing is a learned behavior for the bald eagle, and so juvenile eagles spend their first year eating carrion (carcasses) until they become proficient at fishing (Dooley et al. 2005). Prey remains from bald eagle nests on Santa Catalina Island contained almost 90% fish (Newsome etal. 2010), but an historic bald eagle nest on San Miguel contained more bird remains than fish (Collins et al. 2005). The abundance of seabirds and pinnipeds on the northern Channel Islands means eagles likely take advantage of those resources more than in other areas. This could pose a problem for recovery of bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands (see below), because pinnipeds and seabirds contain more DDE than do marine fish, due to bioaccumulation at higher trophic levels.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Bald eagles nest in trees except in regions where only cliff face sor ground sites are available. They tend to use tall, sturdy conifers that protrude above the forest canopy, providing easy flight access and good visibility. In southern parts of their range, bald eagles may nest in deciduous trees, mangroves, and cactus. It's unknown whether the male or the female takes the lead in selecting a nest site. Nests are typically built near the trunk, high up in the tree but below the crown.</p> <p>On the Channel Islands, where large trees are scarce, bald eagles have built nests on cliff faces, rock shelves and shallow cliffs, as well as in island pines and Torrey pines. One pair even attempted nesting in a grassland on Santa Cruz Island.</p> <p>Bald eagles build some of the largest of all bird nests—typically5 to 6 feet in diameter and 2 to 4 feet tall and ranging in shape from cylindrical to conical to flat, depending on the supporting tree. Both sexes bring materials to the nest, but the female does most of the placement. They weave together sticks and fill in the cracks with softer material such as grass, moss, or cornstalks. The inside of the nest is lined first with lichen or other fine woody material, then with downy feathers and sometimes sprigs of greenery. Ground nests are built of whatever's available, such as kelp and driftwood near coastal shorelines. Nests can take up to three months to build, and may be reused (and added to) year after year. The female lays one to three eggs with a usual clutch size of two eggs. The eggs are incubated for approximately 35 days, and the young eagles fledge 10 - 12 weeks after hatching. Bald eagles become sexually mature at five to six years with maturity usually corresponding to when their head and tail feathers become white.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The bald eagle's recovery is a spectacular conservation success story. Once abundant in North America, the species became rare in the mid-to-late 1900s—the victim of trapping, shooting, and poisoning as well as pesticide-caused reproductive failures. In 1978 the bird was listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act. Since 1980, gentler treatment by humans along with the banning of DDT (the bird's main pesticide threat) has led to a dramatic resurgence. By the late 1990s, breeding populations of bald eagles could be found throughout most of North America.</p> <p>In 2002, with funding from the <a href=\"http://www.darrp.noaa.gov/southwest/montrose/index.html\">Montrose Trustees Restoration Program</a>, the park (in conjunction with partner, <a href=\"http://www.iws.org/\">Institute for Wildlife Studies</a>) began to introduce juvenile bald eagles to the northern Channel Islands. This was done using a technique called \"hacking\". Birds of approximately 8 weeks of age were kept in one of two hack towers on Santa Cruz Island until they were ready to fly (at approximately 3 months of age). Sixty-one young bald eagles were introduced to the northern Channel Island between 2002 and 2006.</p> <p>Today, bald eagles are again an important part of the island ecosystem. 2006 marked the first successful bald eagle nest on the Channel Islands in over 50 years, and since that time, the recovering bald eagle population on the islands has grown. As of 2013 there were five breeding pairs on Santa Cruz Island, two on Santa Rosa, and one on Anacapa, and a total of over 40 bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands.</p> <p>Recovery of bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands was seen as critical to recovery of the endangered island fox, since nesting bald eagles might dissuade dispersing golden eagles (<em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>) from establishing breeding territories on the islands (Coonan et al. 2010). Golden eagle predation was responsible for the massive decline of island foxes on the northern Channel Islands in the 1990s.</p> <p>In June 2007, the bird's recovery prompted its removal from the Endangered Species list. Continuing threats to bald eagle populations include lead poisoning from ammunition in hunter-shot prey, collisions with motor vehicles and stationary structures, and development-related destruction of shoreline nesting, perching, roosting and foraging habitats.</p> <p>Based upon information of population trends, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species has listed the bald eagle a species of Least Concern and current data demonstrates that the population is presently increasing.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://birds.audubon.org/species/baleag\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">BirdLife International</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Bald_Eagle/lifehistory\">All About Birds</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/106005688/0\">The ICUN Red List of Threatened Species</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.peregrinefund.org/subsites/explore-raptors-2001/eagles/baldeagl.html\">The Peregrine Fund</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.J., C.A.

    "bodyText": "<p>Becher's Bay is the main port of entry to Santa Rosa Island. The bay provides some protection from the strong northwest winds. The bay contains a pier and beautiful, wind-swept, white-sand beach. <br /> <br /> <strong>Place Name</strong><br /> According to Channel Islands historian Marla Daily, Becher's Bay, as we know it today, has had a variety of different names throughout history.<br /> <br /> An 1871-72 US Coast Survey map lists it as More's Harbor. An unpublished US Coast Survey map by Stehman Forney from 1873 simply lists it as N.W. Anchorage. Yet another US Coast Survey map from 1882 labels it as Bechers Bay. News accounts in 1877 and 1910 and a 1952 US Geological Survey Map describe it as Beechers Bay. However, the 1974 and 1993 US Geological Survey maps list it as Bechers Bay.<br /> <br /> The Santa Barbara historian Clif Smith speculated that the bay was named for explorer and naval officer Sir Edward Belcher (who was stationed off the west coast in the 19th century), and the name was just misspelled.<br /> <br /> Given all this, it's probably best just to follow island rancher Al Vail's advice to Marla Daily: \"Either one works, but I've always called it Bechers and spelled it that way.\"</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The edges of the bay are bordered by cliffs dropping down to the ocean to the east, with a view of Santa Cruz island in clear weather. Turning toward the south is a sandy cove that curves toward a distant Skunk Point in the southeast. Rolling, grassy hills with a stand of Santa Rosa Island Torrey pines are visible to the south. A long wooden fence and eucalyptus trees come into view as you turn to the west. And, finally, through the branches of the trees, the fences and buildings of the ranch complex can be seen to the northwest.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Boat visitors must climb from the boat up a steel-rung ladder to a pier at Becher's Bay on Santa Rosa Island. When the pier is closed, landings are via skiff onto the beach.<br /> <br /> <b>Historical Information</b><br /> For nearly 150 years, Santa Rosa Island owners maintained a pier to accommodate shipping cattle, sheep, and supplies. The first pier on Santa Rosa Island was constructed in June 1859, presumably at Bechers Bay near or at the present site of the pier. George R. Barclay, captain of the steamer Goliah, constructed the pier for a fee of $500 plus almost $1,500 in materials. By the end of the year this first wharf was destroyed in a storm.<br /> <br /> The second ranch pier at Bechers Bay was built by the More family around 1872 or 1873 and it may have been entirely rebuilt in 1913. The pier underwent major repairs in 1945 undertaken by a contractor for the Army Corps of Engineers. Ranch crews repaired the decking in 1983 with lumber salvaged from the Air Force pier at Johnsons Lee. As of 1984 the pier was described as approximately 572 feet long, with the width varying from 20 feet 3 inches to 37 feet at the end.<br /> <br /> The pier endured constant battering by surf and swells. With the pier a vital part of the lifeline between island and mainland, maintenance was a regular part of cowboy life. At times, the structural integrity of the pier was questionable. Margaret Vail Woolley spoke of the risks of walking on the pier \"wondering if you're going to be flung into the ocean:\"<br /> <br /> \"Every several years, there would be a storm that was strong enough to throw the boards off the dock so there'd be a big blank space. A lot of the boards would wash ashore down the coast and the cowboys would go get â€˜em and bring â€˜em back and stick them on again . . . Every now and then the pilings had to be replaced or repaired . . . and that was a kind of a casual program that went on year after year. They just patched together enough to use and then wait for it to blow up again, which made sense. \"<br /> <br /> Shortly after purchasing the island, the NPS rehabilitated the pier in 1987 to increase safety and provide better visitor access. These repairs were considered temporary, and in 2012 the park completed the construction of an entirely new pier on the same footprint as the old pier.<br /> <br /> One of the most infamous island events occurred on the pier on June 31, 1884, when A. P. More, the island owner at the time, killed Ah You, the island cook. A newspaper initially reported that Ah You, who had been working on the island for about 16 months, felt ill and wanted to leave the island on the schooner Santa Rosa, which was docked at the pier. More accosted him and, after \"the drawing of weapons,\" shot the man in the head. Ah You died after arriving at the mainland.<br /> <br /> An inquest revealed a number of probable inaccuracies in the news article. According to information gathered at the hearing, Ah You had been working unhappily as a laborer and wished to leave the island. Failing to inform More of his plans, he attempted to sneak aboard the schooner, but was seen by More who ordered that You's belongings be removed from the schooner. Ah You allegedly attacked More with a knife, inciting More to shoot Ah You in the head. Participants in the inquest seemed to favor More over the Chinese employee. Nevertheless, the case was thrown out because the shooting occurred out on the pier some 30 feet seaward from the low-tide line, where jurisdiction could not be defined.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> </strong></p>",
    "audioDescription": "You have stepped off the boat, onto the lower landing platform of the dock at the east end of a very long pier, that runs east to west. You are standing on metal decking with sturdy railings. The decking runs along two sides of the larger platform above you. Supporting the entire structure are metal beams and thick round posts that look like telephone poles, which extend down into the ocean below. Around the waterline and below, barnacles and mussels cling, in dense clusters, to those posts. The ocean waters extend out in every direction.<br /><br />A tall metal staircase with twelve risers leads up to the platform above. The upper dock platform is about 100 feet by 70 feet. Five-foot high wooden railings run along the perimeter of the pier and dock platform and pier. Below the dock railing, at each corner, is a light beacon, under a clear bell-shaped cap. <br /><br />If you are standing at the top of the risers on the platform, to your left, attached to top of a post are two large outdoor lights. Just past the lights, mounted to the railing, is a heavy plastic yellow container that is rectangular with a rounded top. The lettering on it reads,<br /><br />Life Ring.<br /><br />Straight ahead, on the opposite side of the dock, is a park orientation panel, mounted to the railing. <br /><br />To the right of that panel, and running parallel to the railing, are two low wooden risers with yellow stripes painted on the sides. Matching yellow L-shapes are painted on the pier about 10 feet away from the risers' corners, seemingly outlining a rectangular area on the dock.<br /><br />The ocean end of the dock extends out farther on the left side, by about 20 feet. Near the middle of that side of the dock is a metal cabinet, covered with green canvas. Three shapes stick up on the top, also covered in canvas. Nearby is a large yellow plastic barrel with square shapes that curve out on the sides. <br /><br />In the far right corner of the ocean end of the dock is an upright metal cylinder, about five-feet wide by eight-feet tall. At the top of the cylinder is a giant metal hinge that supports a long steel \"arm,\" ending with two thick parallel metal plates, just a few inches apart, creating a slot, like that between prongs of tongs or a clamp. The plates hang down lower than the arm about one foot. On top of the arm are three thin metal bands, each curved into an upright loop that is connected to the sides of the arm. Lettering on the side of the steel \"arm\" reads,<br /><br />Hydro Pro.<br /><br />The wooden plank pier, that connects the dock to the island, is 650 feet long and 20 feet wide. At the land end of the pier, on either side, is a steep sandy-colored rocky ridge with eroded gullies and a sandy beach below. The cliff surface varies from top to bottom. Embedded in the top area are random clumps of cobble-sized stones. On the lower part of the cliff are layers of horizontal ridges, like the wavy edge of a stack of pancakes.<br /><br />On the south side, 18 wooden steps with railings lead downward. At the bottom step, there is a ladder, that you can climb down to reach the sandy beach. <br /><br />On the north side is an information panel. <br /><br />At the end of the pier, a dirt road continues upward, cutting through the cliff to the top of the plateau.<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Thryomanes bewickii nesophilus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Bewick's wren is an endemic subspecies found on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and Anacapa Islands. It is a small, noisy, hyperactive little bird with bold white eyebrows, flicking its tail as it hops from branch to branch.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>This species is named after British engraver Thomas Bewick-a friend of pioneering bird artist John James Audubon, who collected the first recognized specimen.<br />  </li> <li>Courting Bewick's wrens normally form monogamous pairs. While they're setting up house and even after the female has begun incubating eggs, the male and female often forage together. This may help the male prevent his partner from mating with another bird.<br />  </li> <li>At the sound of approaching humans, a female Bewick's wren incubating eggs usually flushes quietly from her nest cavity, but remains nearby and scolds. Some females, however, sit tightly on their eggs even when disturbed.<br />  </li> <li>The male Bewick's wren learns its song while still on the parents' territory.It learns the song not from its father, but rather from the neighboring territorial males. The song repertoire developed before the first winter is retained for life.<br />  </li> <li>The Bewick's wren can live up to 8 years.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> This Bewick's wren is grayish-brown above with an obvious whitish eyebrow which extends back down the neck. The subspecies in the park is overall somewhat darker. It has a long, fanned tail, although the park's subspecies tail is smaller. Its tail is often cocked upward, which it flips and jerks from side to side as well as rises slowly up and down. The top and bottom of the tail is barred with black and you might be able to see the white spots on the outer tail feathers when the tail is fanned. This wren has whitish underparts and an unstreaked back. The bill is long and slightly downcurved. The legs and feet are gray. Both adults look similar. The juvenile is like the adult but has dark edges to its feathers.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Bewick's wrens are resident along the West Coast, throughout the southwestern U.S., and in parts of the eastern U.S. They leave some eastern breeding areas in the winter. The population is stable, except in the eastern U.S., where it is declining. The endemic subspecies, <em>Thryomanes bewickii nesophilus,</em> is found on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and Anacapa Islands, while a different subspecies, <em>T. b. catalinae</em>, occurs on Santa Catalina Island.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Bewick's wrens favor dry brushy areas, chaparral, scrub, thickets in open country, and open woodlands near rivers and streams. They are at home in gardens, residential areas, and parks in cities and suburbs. On the Channel Islands, based on recent surveys, nesophilus favors chaparral, pine forest, riparian, and/or woodland habitats.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Bewick's wrens eat the eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults of insects and other small invertebrates. Common prey include bugs, beetles, bees and wasps, caterpillars, butterflies, moths, grasshoppers, crickets, flies, and spiders. Bewick's wrens also occasionally eat seeds, fruit, and other plant matter, especially in winter. Bewick's wren nestlings receive mostly caterpillars, spiders, grasshoppers, and insect pupae. Adults sometimes consume pebbles and mud, perhaps for nutrients or to help with the grinding digestion of their food. The subspecies found in the park rarely feeds on seeds and generally gleans invertebrate prey from the lower branches of small trees and shrubs and from the stems of large herbaceous plants.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The Bewick's wren's cup-shaped nest has a base of sticks, grasses, rootlets, leaves, moss, or other plant materials, depending on what the local environment provides. Many contain spider egg cases. The open cup may be lined with feathers, wool, hair, or plant down. The male initiates nest building; both sexes participate. The construction process usually takes less than 8 days, though sometimes it can stall for long periods and require weeks to complete. The nest is about 2.5 to 3 inches high and 4 or 5 inches in diameter, the cup about 1-2 inches deep and 2-2.5 inches in diameter.</p> <p>The nesting period of the Bewick's wren begins with a clutch of 3 to 8 eggs laid in its cup shaped nest. From 1 to 3 broods may be laid in one season, but two would be the norm. The size of the egg would approximate two-thirds in length and about one half an inch in width. The eggs would be described as white with reddish -brown or purplish spots. The incubation period for bewickii would be from 14 to 16 days. The weight of the new hatchlings would be about 1/20th of an ounce and find its eyes tightly closed; its skin pink, with sparse down. After hatching, both parents bring foof to the nest. Generally, at two weeks the young leave the nest.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Bewick's wren is identified as a species of Least Concern by the ICUN Red List because the species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdinginformation.com/birds/wrens/bewicks-wren/\">http://www.birdinginformation.com/birds/wrens/bewicks-wren/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/bewicks_wren/id\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/bewicks_wren/id</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.oiseaux-birds.com/home-page.html\">http://www.oiseaux-birds.com/home-page.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106006938/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106006938/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdzilla.com/birds/Bewicks-Wren/description.html\">http://www.birdzilla.com/birds/Bewicks-Wren/description.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.planetofbirds.com/passeriformes-troglodytidae-bewicks-wren-thryomanes-bewickii\">http://www.planetofbirds.com/passeriformes-troglodytidae-bewicks-wren-thryomanes-bewickii</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.

Starting in 2014, Channel Islands National Park, The Nature Conservancy, and the U.S. Navy developed a joint biosecurity program to prevent, detect, and respond to nonnative species introductions. Preventing the re-introduction and establishment of nonnative species is vitally important to preserving the nearly 150 endemic plant and animal species of the islands.

Weeds often spread along trails and into adjacent un-infested areas. You can help prevent this by always staying on designated trails, avoiding weed-infested areas, and by not picking or transporting plants when hiking on the islands. Pack out all trash too. Just because a bit of trash is organic —apple cores, orange seeds, etc.— doesn’t mean it can be left behind. While most domestic fruit and vegetable species are not invasive, some can germinate and become pests.<br /> <br /> <strong>No Campfires</strong><br /> Campfires are prohibited on the islands. In addition to the threat of wildfire, firewood brought from the mainland can harbor harmful organisms. A prime example is the fungal-like disease \"Sudden Oak Death,\" which can attack several species of native trees. You can help prevent the spread of such threats by not transporting firewood under any circumstances.</p>",

The islands offer protected habitat in an increasingly disturbed southern California environment.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Seabirds and Shorebirds</strong><br /> The islands are particularly important for seabirds, offering critical nesting habitat. The particular association of northern and southern species found here is not duplicated anywhere else in the world. The islands support large numbers of western gulls, Cassin's auklets, Brandt's cormorants, and the only nesting population of California brown pelicans along the West Coast of the United States. Also, the islands support the world's largest population of Scripps's murrelets.</p> <p>While some seabird species may be viewed from the islands, park boat concessioners will search for seabirds on boat trips out to the islands. Be sure to tell a boat crew member that you are interested in seabirds and they will often assist in finding and identifying birds. In addition, local chapters of the Audubon Society occasionally sponsor boats trips around the islands to view seabirds. Due to limited beach access on some islands, shorebird viewing is best done on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Landbirds</strong><br /> The landbirds are also a distinctive group-they represent a unique selection of the birds that live on the California mainland. Ten of the 40 landbird species that commonly nest on the park islands are represented by endemic species or subspecies-forms that occur only on the islands and nowhere else. Of this group, the island scrub-jay (found on Santa Cruz Island) is the only bird that is endemic at the species level.</p> <p>The larger islands of Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa offer more types of habitats and, therefore, more variety of landbirds. Many birders visit Prisoners Harbor (easiest viewing opportunity) or Scorpion Ranch on Santa Cruz Island to view the island scrub-jay.</p> <p> </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The highest peak (1298 feet) on the northeast side of the island provides stunning views to visitors willing to make the strenuous 8-mile rountrip hike.<br /> <br /> <b>Cloud Forest</b><br /> Fog and wind are ever present on Santa Rosa Island, even more so here on top of Black Mountain. Here the fog condenses on twigs and leaves of island woodland plants, dripping and soaking into the ground. These \"cloud forests\" harvest the fog and provide a critical source of summer water for wildlife and the ecosystem.<br /> <br /> One of the main species of this cloud forest is the endemic island oak, Quercus tomentella. This species was once widespread on the mainland when the climate was warmer and wetter than it is today. Fossil evidence ranges from two to 60 million years, with the oldest fossils found in the Mojave Desert. Today this relict is only found on six islands-Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Catalina, San Clemente, and Guadalupe.<br /> <br /> Browsing and grazing by nonnative animals in decades past greatly impacted the island oak and native woodlands, changing the fog ecosystem and island hydrology. Now, the US Geological Survey is working with Channel Island National Park and other collaborators to restore the cloud forests of Santa Rosa Island. Research has shown that these efforts have already paid off with the recovery of island woodlands, including young island oaks. As they continue to return, the forests will again harvest water for the island, returning moisture to soils, springs, and streams.<br /> <br /> <b>San Miguel Island</b><br /> If the fog has lifted, you might be able to see San Miguel Island off to the west just three miles away from the western tip of Santa Rosa Island. Once described as a \"barren lump of sand\" in the 1930s, San Miguel Island is now densely vegetated with a diverse assemblage of native plants. Native vegetation has recovered remarkably well on San Miguel Island since the removal of sheep in the 1950s.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing at the top of highest point on the north eastern end of the island, Black Mountain. It has a magnificent view in all directions in good weather. To the northeast is Bechers Bay. In the east are Skunk Point and Santa Cruz Island. To the south is Soledad Peak. In the west is San Miguel Island. To the northwest is Lobo Canyon, forming a \"V\" shape in a distant hillside. In the north is Carrington Point. <br /><br />Poking up, near the edge of this summit, just a hundred feet away, one can see the tops of oaks in the cloud forest island oak grove. At your feet, the soil is rocky with small pebbles. Grass with tiny white flowers grows on the top of the mountain, with a few small patches of scrubby shrubs. <br /><br />There are three structures here. <br /><br />A tall metal pole structure, with a triangular base frame about 6 feet high, on three spayed legs. Two cylindrical white cannisters are mounted on the frame. Sticking up on short rod is a white object that looks like a stack of upside down bowls. On one corner of the frame, a tall rod sticks up about four feet. On another corner, a rod sticks out horizontally from the structure, with a small cap at the end. A vertical 20-foot tall pole sticks up from the center of the frame. At the very top is a rotating torpedo-shaped object with a propeller at the tip. It swivels to face into the wind. On one side is a metal box and two solar panels-flat dark glass panels with grids of light-colored lines. Cables run between the top of the structure and several of these boxes, devices, and solar panels.<br /><br />Flanking the tall triangular framed structure are four poles about 6 feet high and four inches in diameter. One pole has a saucer-shaped satellite dish mounted on it. At its center is a rod that sticks out with a circular metal piece at the end.<br /><br />Nearby is a freestanding solar panel array, mounted on an angle on a metal frame that has two poles extending up in back. Two black cables run from the back of the panel to a latched bin, below the panel, with a large rock on the lid. A thicker black cable runs, from that bin, back up to clamps at the tops of each of the poles on the back of the frame. One cable ends with what looks like an old tv antennae, or a two-sided comb-a metal rod with a row of smaller perpendicular rods sticking out on either side. The other cable sticks straight up, with a rounded metal top like a mushroom cap, about 3 inches in diameter.<br /><br />You are standing in the cloud forest island oak grove, on a slope near the top of Black Mountain. You are under the canopies of several island oak trees, their long, dark, twisting branches overlapping, and ending in clusters of small oval green leaves. It is often foggy here near the summit. When skies are clear, the open form of the branches makes a lacey pattern against the blue sky, and the sun casts a mottled pattern of shadows and light on the ground. <br /><br />The trunks and branches of the oaks are thickly covered with lichen and moss in shades ranging from yellow and pale green to dark olive green. Some growths are as tiny as powdered sugar on the branches. Others are taller, looking like spinach or curly kale, feathery dill weed, and soft curly hair or fur. <br /><br />The ground is thickly covered with fallen dry leaves, small twigs and patches of grass. When it is foggy, water condensation on these branches, leaves, mosses, and lichen will drip down on you, even if it isn't raining outside the oak grove.<br /><br />",

Some growths are as tiny as powdered sugar on the branches. Others are taller, looking like spinach or curly kale, feathery dill weed, and soft curly hair or fur. The ground is thickly covered with fallen dry leaves, small twigs and patches of grass. When it is foggy, water condensation on these branches, leaves, mosses, and lichen will drip down on you, even if it isn’t raining outside the oak grove.",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Haematopus bachmani</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The black oystercatcher is the signature bird of the rocky intertidal coastline. It is a permanent resident on all five islands in the park, being restricted in its range, never straying far from shores and particularly favoring rocky shorelines. It has been suggested that this bird is seen mostly on coastal stretches which have some quieter embayments, such as jetty protected areas. It hunts through the intertidal area, searching for food visually, often so close to the water's edge it has to fly up to avoid crashing surf.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Despite its name, this prominently-sized black bird with large feet seldom eats oysters.</li> <li>Although they don't swim, black oystercatcher chicks will sometimes dive under water to avoid predators.</li> <li>Migrating only short distances or not at all, they are permanent residents of their breeding range.</li> <li>The black oystercatcher can live for more than15 years.</li> <li>Monogamous pairs make their nests by tossing rock flakes, pebbles or shell fragments toward their nest bowl with a sideways or backward flip of their bills. They use the same nest year after year.</li> <li>Limpets and mussels have a strong muscle that holds the two shells tightly together—yet an oystercatcher can easily and quickly pry them open.</li> <li>The black oystercatcher has a very loud piercing whistle that can be heard at great distance over crashing waves.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The black oystercatcher is a distinctive, crow-sized, short-tailed, all-black shorebird. It has pale pinkish legs and a long, bright reddish-orange bill and eye-ring.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Oystercatchers breed from the western Aleutian Islands in Alaska south to central Baja, California. Within Alaska, they have ranged northward to the Pribilof Islands in winter and to Round Island, Bristol Bay, to nest in the summer. It is a permanent resident on all five islands in the park. Ranges of the black oystercatcher and the brown-and-white American oystercatcher overlap in Baja California.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Oystercatchers never stray far from shore and favor rocky shorelines in particular. It has been suggested that this bird is seen mostly on coastal stretches which have some quieter embayments, such as jetty protected areas.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Mussels and limpets are their primary food, but black oystercatchers prey on a wide range of shellfish and other creatures found along the rocky shore. They locate open mussels and disable them with a quick jab to the adductor muscle. With the mussel stuck in the open position, the oystercatcher can pull out the contents with the tip of its chisel-like bill. Oystercatchers often forage in the wave zone, because mussels that are splashed by waves open more frequently.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The female black oystercatcher lays two to three eggs among pebbles in a shallow rocky depression or in a hollow on the beach above the high tide line. The nest is built by both the male and the female. They will create or scrape a depression in the ground and then pick up and toss shells and bits of rocks and pebbles into the depression with a backwards or sideways flip of their heads. They use the same nest year-after-year. Both the male and the female take turns incubating the eggs. The eggs incubate for 24-29 days and the chicks fledge in about 35 days. The chicks remain close to the nest at first. One of the parents will stay with them while the other parent forages for food to bring back to the nest. Eventually, the chicks will go with their parents to feeding areas. The chicks fledge at about five weeks and will forage on their own, but they will still occasionally be fed by their parents. The female has one brood a year.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The black oystercatcher, with a global population of 10,000-12,000 individuals, is considered rare. It is completely dependent on marine shorelines, favoring sheltered areas of high tidal variation that support limpets and mussels, their preferred food. Their numbers are highest from Alaska to British Columbia, where there is relatively plentiful preferred habitat and lower levels of disturbance than in the southern portion of the range.</p> <p>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service selected the black oystercatcher as a Focal Species for Conservation Action due to small population size, restricted range, threats to preferred habitat, lack of baseline data to assess conservation status, and a suite of ongoing and anthropogenic and natural factors that may limit long-term viability. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and other agencies in 2007 developed a range-wide conservation action plan and working group, which is the unified resource and blueprint for tracking and conserving the species.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <p>Anders, Brad A.

    "bodyText": "<p>Archeological excavations around and within this building revealed artifacts and materials that suggested that this may have been the location of the\"forge\" or blacksmith shop shown on an 1892 map. In addition to a distinct layer of ash that was discovered, the excavation also revealed other materials that easily could be associated with the craft of blacksmithing, including bits of charcoal, fused and oxidized metal, chunks of mixed ash, charcoal debris, several horse shoes, nails, and a pair of rusty pliers. Built sometime between 1885-1892, this shop is one of the oldest wood buildings on the east end of the island.<br /> <br /> Despite being built on a small bench above the flood plain, years of flooding and deposition had caused the structure to tilt significantly to the south and by 1998 it was on the verge of collapse. Park staff stabilized the building and added a new roof to preserve it.<br /> <br /> Today, this shop helps to remind us of the unique island ranching operation and the important role that blacksmiths played in it. With the nearest mainland blacksmith over 25 miles away, it was essential to have working shops on the island to repair the equipment, fix and sharpen tools, and shoe horses.</p> <p><br /> <strong>A Day at the Shop</strong></p> <p><em><strong>The blacksmith shop was a hot, noisy, sweaty place, but it played a key role at Scorpion Ranch.</strong></em><br /> An isolated ranch needed to be self-sufficient - a blacksmith shop made this possible. The blacksmith was kept busy making or repairing Scorpion's tools and gear. Everything with metal parts passed through the smithy - on a given day the blacksmith might shoe horses, repair wagon wheels, sharpen plows and make oar locks.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Basic blacksmithing didn't require much - only a hot fire, simple tools and brute strength.</strong></em><br /> \"Forging\" is changing the shape of a piece of metal by heating and hammering it.<br /> It's a very physical process. Although the Scorpion blacksmith shop was probably operated by one person, an assistant \"striker\" may have added his blows when vigorous hammering was needed. Leg vises anchored to the floor gave the blacksmith extra support when hammering.<br /> <br /> <strong>Tools of the Trade</strong><br /> Grindstone: The blacksmith held a tool against the stone to sharpen it. Foot pedals made<br /> it easier to keep the stone turning.<br /> <br /> Anvil: An anvil is the iron block on which the blacksmith works metal. To keep it steady, this anvil was mounted on a sturdy log embedded in the dirt floor.<br /> <br /> Portable forge: Not all blacksmithing at Scorpion took place in the shop. The portable hand forge and leg vise were taken out into the field, probably for shoeing horses.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>How to Make a Horseshoe</strong></p> <p>1. Build a fire in the forge. Use blacksmithing coal, (a soft coal, free from impurities).<br /> When packed down around the fi re, it changes to coke, a lightweight material that burns with a clean, intense flame.<br /> 2. Use the shovel and poker to adjust the fire.<br /> 3. Use your left hand to work the bellows or crank the blower to add<br /> oxygen to the fire so it burns hotter.<br /> 4. Stick the iron bar into the forge to heat.<br /> 5. Heat the section you'll be working onto a bright-red heat, almost but not quite white hot.<br /> 6. Using the tongs, draw the iron bar out of the fire and turn to the anvil.<br /> 7. Pick up a small hammer.<br /> 8. Using the round face of the hammer, bend the iron bars over the anvil.<br /> 9. Once the horseshoe is the right shape, start the nailholes using a forepunch. The shape of the punch should exactly match the head of the nail.<br /> 10. Hammer a stamp into the hole to make a space for the shank of the nail.<br /> 11. Sharpen the pritchel on the grindstone. To complete the hole, hammer a pritchel into the hole. A little piece will drop out.<br /> 12. Lay the shoe flat on the anvil and hammer all around to level.<br />  </p> <p><strong>The \"Smith\"</strong></p> <p><strong><em>A versatile blacksmith - really a jack-of-all-trades - was essential to Scorpion's self-sufficient ranch operation.</em></strong><br /> \"Felix Mauri was an able iron worker. During his time, we still used draft horses and wagons and the skill of an iron worker was always in demand. In addition to repair of plows, wagons, sleds, there was of course horse shoeing and other related jobs. With Felix, breakfast was an important meal. Each morning he would have a \"rosetta\", consisting of four raw eggs and a glass of wine mixed together. - A quote by Pier Gherini<br /> <br /> <strong>A Gang of Blacksmiths</strong><br /> The Scorpion smith was in good company - there were once six blacksmith shops on the island. Blacksmiths at the satellite ranches, or outranches, dealt with day to day objects, while hinges, ornamental ironwork and railings were made at the main ranch blacksmith shop.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Blacksmith ShopThe Blacksmith shed contains artifacts and exhibits. It is a short walk down the road from the pier. Restrooms and the Orientation exhibit area are nearby. The one room shed measures 10 feet by fifteen feet. A 6-foot extension wall to the left of the building creates an open-air porch with a steeply pitched shake roof. Two door openings provide access. The walls are of two different styles, flat horizontal boards and board and batten. The interior floor is dirt. The open doorway, one small square window, and cracks between the wall boards let sunlight into the space.The interior and porch area exhibits are described in the next section starting with the interior exhibit panels and artifacts. As you enter the shop, a large piece of free standing equipment is in the left corner of the room, a vise with drill press. The metal column comes up from a base at the floor and holds the circular drill table at waist height. The column continues up to the chuck and spindle where a capstan wheel adjusts the height of the drill. A plaque on the base of the vice reads: Press and ViseThe blacksmith shop was a machine shop as well as a forge. This press which dates back to the Caire era (1880-1932) was used for drilling and threading pipes.An exhibit panel on the back wall behind the vice displays a black and white photograph of the exterior of the blacksmith shop.

    "bodyText": "<p>This building has been called the blacksmith shop, freezer barn, generator barn, and a barn-utility building. It was probably constructed in the early 1870s and housed the original blacksmith shop and other workshops and utility areas. It was originally twice the size with two side-by-side, gable-roofed sheds, the western one sheltering the More's massive matanza boilers.<br /> <br /> In 1876 a drought brought on the collapse of the wool market in California, resulting in a matanza (Spanish for \"slaughter\")in which thousands of sheep were killed for their tallow. The island had been supporting up to 45,000 sheep, thousands of which would starve and, as a commodity, would go to waste. The events attracted the attention of the Santa Barbara press, resulting in an article describing the spectacle:<br /> <br /> \"The slaughter of sheep for their pelts and tallow on Santa Rosa Island is still going on and will continue for some time. 25,000 sheep are to be killed, which will leave from 15,000 to 20,000 on the island. The matanza works erected by the firm are said to be among the largest and most complete on the coast. The kettles are of enormous size, large enough to take in several hundred sheep at a time. The number of carcasses boiled daily averages about 1,200. The fires are kept burning from Monday morning to Saturday evening. The sheep are skinned, the intestines taken out and the carcasses thrown into the kettles. After going through the kettles, the carcasses are thoroughly mashed up, the bones being softened so they will pulverize under the pressure of the hand. The offal is fed to hogs. In consequence of the sheep not being very fat in this year of short feed, the amount of tallow from each sheep is comparatively small; still under this systematic mode of treatment, a fair price, considering the year, can be realized per head. The skins are salted, dried and packed for market. These operations require a large force of men.\"<br /> <br /> Sometime after 1948 ranch crews removed the western structure, leaving the boilers exposed to the elements.<br /> The remaining building was used by Vail & Vickers as a blacksmith shop, generator house, slaughterhouse, and cold storage that held a freezer for making ice. The building contains six rooms-a maintenance/repair shop once housing a blacksmithy, a former generator room equipped with two diesel generators, a workshop equipped with a saw and grinder, a butcher room with a loading dock out its door, and two walk-in freezers.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> </strong></p>",
    "audioDescription": "The blacksmith shop is a two-story rectangular wooden building with a gabled, or simple peaked, roof, covered with corrugated metal, running the length of the building. The rectangular foundation of the building is rock and cement. The building's vertical board and batten siding is dark red with white trim.<br /><br />The long front, or eastern, side of the building, forms part of a large corral, with corral fencing connecting to both ends of the building. Along that wall there are two framed window openings: one under the roof eve, shuttered with wood planks; and another below it, to one side, with a metal screen over it. At the ground level are three framed doorways, with wooden gates that are open at the top. In front of the wall is an upright open metal frame or equipment of some kind, about 2 feet wide by four feet high. Also, on top of a five foot tall wooden platform, a metal cylinder is laying on its side. The cylinder is about 3 feet in diameter, and at least 5 feet tall. Nearby, twisted branches are heaped in a tall pile. A 6 foot high fence of vertical wooden planks extends out from the northeast corner of this barn wall, in line with the wall. The 4 foot high corral fence connects to this taller fence.<br /><br />At the south side of building, the corral fence connects directly to the building, near the center of the wall. A small framed window opening, a few feet above ground level, has a metal screen. Along the fence, adjacent to the building is another metal cylinder, laying on side, as well as a rusted yellow tractor. A deep wooden shelf is attached to the fence, mounted on cylindrical telephone poles that stick up through the shelf.<br /><br />A dirt road runs around the back, or west, side of the building. Wooden planks have been buried into the ground, creating a wooden ramp that leads up to an 8 foot by 4 foot platform with no railings, that is attached to the building, like a loading dock. Concrete and wooden stairs lead up to the platform on one side. At the back of the platform is a red door are two wooden doors: one red with two z-shaped plank braces, and one white with a screen window on top. Above these are three casement style window openings, framed with white trim, and shuttered with red wood planks. Penetrating one of these shutters is a grey metal pipe, that curves down from the building into the ground. The stone foundation of the building is reinforced by concrete wedges, shaped like small pyramids, positioned about every 4 feet, perpendicular to the wall. Toward the northern side of this wall are two small framed windows. One has a single panes of glass; the other has six panes of glass, separated by thin wooden mullions. Just outside these windows are two rusty cylindrical boilers about 12 feet tall by 5 feet in diameter. The outer surface of the boiler is made of curved rectangular metal sections, connected with lines of rounded bolts at the seams. Sticking up from the top of the container are small rods, caps, and valves. At the base of each boiler is an oval shaped opening. The opening on the right boiler has thick latch that hooks over a rod across it and a thick chain that is attached about six feet above it. The boilers are sitting on round foundations made of rock and cement.<br /><br />The north side of the building has a window with six panes of glass. Next to it is two-step platform that leads to a wooden door. The door is made of four vertical planks of wood, with Z-shaped plank bracing on the interior of the door. <br />",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Balaenoptera musculus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The blue whale, a baleen or filter feeder cetacean, as contrasted to toothed whales, is a part time resident of the waters off of the Channel Islands National Park and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. It is the largest animal that has been proven to have ever existed on earth. With a feeding area for this species lying offshore of Southern California, a unique opportunity is afforded the public to observe these extraordinary marine mammals on whale watching boats serving the area.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Blue whales can grow to be about 100 feet in length and may weigh around 160 tons. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>A blue whale heart is the size of a Volkswagen Beetle and pumps 10 tons of blood through the massive blue whale body. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>A blue whale aorta (the main blood vessel) alone is large enough for a human to crawl through. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>Blue whale blows, also called spouts, consist of air and water and rise about 30 feet high. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>It is estimated to take 2,200 lbs. of food to fill a blue whale's stomach. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>Female blue whales are generally larger than males. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>Blue whales live in all oceans of the world. <sup>4</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> According to <em>FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World</em> by Jefferson, T.A., S. Leatherwood, and M.A. Webber, \"The blue whale is the largest animal ever known;however, its size substantially overlaps with that of adult fin and sei whales. Like all rorquals, the blue whale is slender and streamlined. The head is broad and U-shaped (like a gothic arch) when viewed from above and relatively flat when viewed from the side. Along the center of the rostrum, there is a single prominent ridge, which ends in an impressive \"splash guard\" around the blowholes. The flippers are long and pointed, and the dorsal fin is relatively small, variably shaped, and placed about three-quarters of the way back from the snout tip. The broad flukes have a relatively straight trailing edge and a prominent notch. Blue whales are bluish grey dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath. The head is uniformly blue, but the back and sides are mottled. When viewed through the water surface they may appear dappled or uniformly light blue. There is light to extensive mottling on the sides, back, and belly, generally in the form of dark spots on a lighter surface, but sometimes the reverse. A chevron, with the vertex behind the blowholes, sometimes marks the transition of coloration between the head and the body. On the throat, there are 55 to 88 long pleats extending to or near the navel. The mouth contains 270 to 395 pairs of black, broad-based baleen plates, each less than 3 feet long. The blow is tall and slender, reaching 30 feet or more in height.\"<sup>2</sup> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Based on acoustic data, size, and photo identification studies, there are two groups of blue whales in the North Pacific: eastern and western. The eastern group, (which is the west coast of the US and Canada), winters off Mexico and Central America, and feeds off California and British Columbia in summer/fall (from June to November). <sup>4</sup></p> <p>According to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, \"Blue whales can be seen off the west coast of Baja California from about February through July. Peak numbers have been reported there in April. They appear in the area again in October, but have not been reported between November and January. They are seen fairly frequently off Southern California from June through December. Encounters have been most numerous during July through October. Many of the blue whales appear to be migrating northward just outside the Channel Islands. Catches of blue whales from British Columbia shore stations peaked in June and September, suggesting a northward movement past Vancouver Island in spring and a southward shift in autumn.\" <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The habitat of the blue whale, as reported from a study by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA, in 1998, shows the relationship of this species and its habitat to coincide with the movement of its food sources, as well as migration due to its imperative for breeding.The primary habitat that is based upon feeding, as stated in the study, was observed to be offshore of San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands in the Channel Islands and the adjacent continental shelf of the mainland. This is also where enormous swarms of krill and other food sources for this species are generally located. <sup>3</sup></p> <p>Additional habitat is centered upon the process of reproduction.This species migrates to southern climes, based upon observation, as far north as the Gulf of Cortez in Baja California and as far south as Central America where the initial nurturing of newly born calves provides optimal conditions.However, a specific location of the areas that the blue whale maternal activities occur is still unknown. <sup>3</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> An article published in the <em>American Scientist,</em> Goldbogen (Scripps Institution of Oceanography), described the unique technique used by the blue whale in feeding called \"lunge feeding.\"This effective method, as stated in the study, described in detail how the adaptation of the whale's jaw permitted the maximum opening, which in turn allowed the blue whale to draw in and envelop the greatest concentration of food. After the prey is captured, the water is pushed out by the tongue, and animals such as krill are filtered by the baleen and remain as food for the whale.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>The primary food of the blue whale off the Channel Islands of California is krill, which are tiny shrimp-like crustaceans.Three species of krill comprise this important food in the blue whale's diet. They are the North Pacific krill (<em>euphausia pacifica)</em>, thysanoessa spinifera, and nematoscelis difficilis. <sup>6</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Information from the Marine Mammal Center states \"Females give birth to calves every two to three years. They remain pregnant for about one year before giving birth. When born, the blue whale calf is about 23 feet long and weighs 5,000 to 6,000 pounds. A nursing blue whale mother produces over 50 gallons of milk a day. The milk contains 35 to 50% milk fat and allows the calf to gain weight at a rate of up to 10 pounds an hour or over 250 pounds a day! At six months of age and an average length of over 52 feet, the calf is weaned. The blue whale reaches sexual maturity at around 10 years of age. <sup>6</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The blue whale, being found in all oceans of the world, has distinct populations with varied challenges.With the exception of the Northeastern Pacific population, which includes Alaska down to Central America, all blue whale populations are in a serious situation.Based upon census date, only the Northeast Pacific is increasing in population.The IUCN List of Endangered Species in its evaluation of the blue whales status writes, \"Although there are uncertainties over present abundance, the total population has been depleted by at least 70%, and possibly as much as 90%, over the last three generations, assuming a 31-year average generation time. The species therefore meets the criterion A1(abd) for Endangered, and probably meets the same criterion for Critically Endangered.\"<sup>8</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li>Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary: <a href=\"http://channelislands.noaa.gov/animals/bluwhal.html\">http://channelislands.noaa.gov/animals/bluwhal.html</a></li> <li>FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the <em>World</em>, Jefferson, T.A., S.

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Tursiops Truncatus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Bottlenose dolphins are one of the most recognizable and well-known species of the cetacean family. Based upon historical references and their depiction in works of art going back to ancient civilizations, as well as today’s performers in entertainment venues in marine parks, such as Sea World, they are easily identifiable. Being primarily coastal inhabitants, the bottlenose is conspicuous to the public without the need to leave land to view them. In the Ventura area it is not unusual to spot forays by the bottlenose into Ventura Harbor, the site of the park’s administrative center. This species is also seen along the entire Southern California Bight by countless beach goers.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>There appear to be two main varieties; a smaller, inshore form and a larger, more robust form that lives mainly offshore. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>A social species, the bottlenose dolphin may live in groups of 100s of individuals. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>They employ a feeding strategy called \"fish whacking,\" where they strike a fish with their flukes and knock it clear out of the water. <sup>5</sup></li> <li>Dolphins can rest one side of their brain at a time, allowing them to sleep whilst remaining conscious enough to surface and breathe. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>Bottlenose dolphins are born with a few hairs on their \"rostrum\" or beak that they lose shortly after birth.<sup> 5</sup></li> <li>The bottlenose has more flexibility in its neck than other oceanic dolphin owing to the fact that 5 of its 7 neck vertebrate are not fused together. <sup>8</sup></li> <li>This species can live as long as 60 years. <sup>9</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> As described by the FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World, “The bottlenose dolphin is probably the most familiar of the small cetaceans because of its coastal habits, prevalence in captivity worldwide, and frequent appearance on television and in advertising. It is a large, relatively robust dolphin, with a short to moderate length stocky snout that is distinctly set off from the melon by a crease. The dorsal fin is tall and falcate, and set near the middle of the back. Color varies from light grey to nearly black on the back and sides, fading to white (sometimes with a pinkish hue) on the belly. The belly and lower sides are sometimes spotted. There is a dark stripe from eye to flipper, and a faint dorsal cape on the back (and sometimes an indistinct spinal sides are sometimes spotted. blaze), generally only visible at close range. Often, there are brushings of grey on the body, especially on the face, and from the apex of the melon to the blowhole. Bottlenose dolphins have 18 to 26 pairs of robust teeth in each jaw. In older animals, many of these may be worn down or missing.<br /> <br /> Adults range from about 5.5 to 13 feet in length with males somewhat larger than females. There is incredible variation between different populations. Maximum weight is at least 1400 pounds, although most animals are much smaller. At birth, the bottlenose is about 3 to 4 feet in length.” <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Bottlenose dolphins are cosmopolitan in distribution, occurring in most coastal areas in temperate and tropical regions of the world.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> According to NOAA, Fisheries Office of Protected Resources, the bottlenose dolphin is found in temperate and tropical waters around the world. They are found in temperate and tropical waters around the world. There are coastal populations that migrate into bays, estuaries and river mouths as well as offshore populations that inhabit pelagic waters along the continental shelf. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> In a comprehensive study of the bottlenose dolphins feeding habits published by Stephen Leatherwood in 1975, it was concluded that the species was both an “opportunistic and catholic feeder”. Additionally he comments, “The observations for coasts of mainland Mexico, Baja California, and southern California similarly involve feeding on varied prey and under varied circumstances. The recurrence of patterns over time at widely divergent locations suggests their adaptive value for the species.”<br /> <br /> Feeding strategies in collecting food have shown cooperative efforts of pods in herding or driving fish into shallower water on shorelines, bays or inlets to facilitate easier acquisition of prey. In the Southern California Bight, species utilized as food cover a broad spectrum. Sardines, northern anchovies, squid, shrimp and larger schooling species such fall within the bottlenoses diet. <sup>10</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Based upon studies by Jefferson, et al., 2008; Reynolds, III and Wells, 2003; Reynolds, III, et al., 2000 as found in Animal Diversity Web, the age of the bottlenose dolphins at sexual maturity varies geographically. Typically Female dolphins typically reach sexual maturity between 5 and 10 years of age, while males reach sexual maturity between 8 and 13 years old. Sexual maturity is usually achieved years before reproduction; males that reach sexual maturity at age 10 don’t typically breed until they are at approximately 20 years old. Reproductive seasons vary from region to region. Typically, females ovulate at a particular time of year while males are active throughout the year (but with a peak of testosterone production when females ovulate). Gestation lasts about 12 months and each pregnancy produces one calf. Females nurse their young from nipples on each side of their genital slit until the calf is between 18 and 20 months. Bottlenose dolphins reproduce every 3 to 6 years, with females usually becoming pregnant soon after their calf is weaned. Calves can be born at any time of the year but with a peak in birthing during warmer months. Females can reproduce well into their late forties.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Based upon a 2008 assessment, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (IUCN), states that although there are many threats operating on local populations, the species is widespread and abundant, and none of these threats is believed to be resulting in a major global population decline. It therefore states that the species is of least concern. <sup>11</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li>FAO Species Identification Guides: Marine Mammals of the World</li> <li><a href=\"https://channelislands.noaa.gov/\">Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalscience.org/\">The Society for Marine Mammalogy</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/\">arkive.org</a></li> <li>NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources</li> <li>International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (IUCN),</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.mmc.gov/species/bottlenosedolphin.shtml\">Marine Mammals Commission</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.acsonline.org/\">American Cetacean Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalscience.org/\">Marine Mammal Science</a></li> <li>Marine Fisheries Review, Vol. 37, No.9, September 1975, Leatherwood</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22563/0\">The IUCN List of Threatened Species</a></li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Phalacrocorax penicillatus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Brandt's cormorant is a seabird found only in North America with a range along the coast from Alaska to Mexico. San Miguel Island, the westernmost island in Channel Islands National Park, is home to the most important breeding colony of this species in Southern California.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Brandt's comorants breed along the Pacific Coast from Alaska to Mexico.</li> <li>Their main breeding range is between California and Washington.</li> <li>Brandt's cormornats nest in colonies on the ground including cliffs, islands, and offshore rocks.</li> <li>The male cormorant selects the nest site and brings the nesting materials to the female so she can build the nest.</li> <li>Brandt's cormorants are great divers and they can dive as deep as 40 feet in their pursuit of prey.</li> <li>Their webbed feet propel them underwater so they can swim and feed on fish close to the bottom.</li> <li>During the breeding season, they have an expandable pouch on their throat that turns blue.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Brandt's cormorants weigh about 4.6 pounds and measure 34 inches in length, with a wingspan of about 4 feet. Sexes look similar; with short black legs, a long black body and neck, and a dark bill with a hooked tip. Breeding adults have brilliant turquoise eyes and a bright blue gular pouch-distinctive among this species of cormorant-which fades quickly after the nesting season. Their breeding plumage also includes white plumes on either side of the head, neck, and back. Like other cormorants, Brandt's cormorants often spread their wings out to dry after a dive, as their feathers are not completely waterproof and become soaked. This helps reduce buoyancy and allows the cormorant to forage deep under water.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Brandt's cormorants breed along the Pacific Coast from Alaskasouthern British Columbia southward to Baja California. All five islands in the Channel Islands National Park provide breeding sites. In the main part of their range, from California to Washington, the cormorants rely upon food sources produced by the upwelling of the California Current. In the non-breeding season, the effects of this current diminish, and Brandt's cormorant populations redistribute along the coast from southern Alaska southward to Baja California, wintering wherever food is locally available.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Brandt's cormorants are exclusively marine, inhabiting inshore Pacific coastal waters, especially kelp bed areas; as well as large bays, estuaries, or coastal lagoons. Their preferred breeding location is on gentle slopes on the windward side of islands. They may forage either near shore or well out to sea.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The Brandt's cormorant diet consists predominantly of a wide variety of fish, including herring and rockfish, as well as shrimp, and crabs. This cormorant, sometimes feeding in groups, can dive deeply from the surface (capable of reaching over 100 meters) and pursues fish underwater, propelled by its powerful webbed feet. The bird snatches prey with its bill, rather than spearing it.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Brandt's cormorants breed on all of the islands of Channel Islands National Park, although San Miguel Island is the most important. The latest survey shows 4200 pairs in the entire park. This species is colonial, nesting with other Brandt's cormorant, and in California, with the common murre. Male cormorants choose the nest site and display there, inflating the blue throat pouch while pointing the head and tail skyward. The males are also responsible for nest building. They make a substantial nest on the ground, consisting of dry matter like weeds, grass, sticks, or marine debris all cemented together with droppings.Seaweed is collected by diving and is also used as nesting material. The female cormorant usually lays 3 to 6 pale blue eggs. Cormorant hatchlings are naked and helpless. Both parents care for the chicks, feeding by regurgitation, brooding chicks when cold, and shading them when hot. Chicks often congregate in groups called crèches once parents stop attending nests continously, but they return to their own nests to be fed.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Brandt's cormorants are primarily permanent residents, with some local movement. For example, Farallon Island birds migrate to the adjacent mainland. They may wander along the Mexican coast in winter, south of their breeding range, but never inland.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Brandt's cormorant colonies vary from year to year, both in size and location. In California, Channel Islands National Park, as well as refuges and ecological reserves, serve as protected areas. Persistant challenges to Brandt's cormorant include pesticides and oil pollution. During the incubation period, Brandt's cormorant are vulnerable to disturbance from fishing, diving, boating, and even visitation for research or educational purposes, which can result in near-total egg loss and colony desertion. El Nino's ocean warming effect has also negatively impacted populations. Research suggests that, given good ocean conditions and public access restrictions, Brandt's cormorants can persist even in high-disturbance areas. The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds required for listing as a vulnerable species. For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern in BirdLife International (2011) IUCN Red List for birds.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"109\"> <li sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"109\"><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"110\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></li> <li sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"111\"><a href=\"http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species\">Birds of North America</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/\">The Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a></li> </ul>",

Later, the fire erupted again and quickly devoured the old house, cookhouse, and bunkhouse and killed Anderson.<br /> <br /> After surveying the damage, Al Vail and Wallace sketched out a replacement bunkhouse on a napkin while returning to Santa Barbara on the Vaquero II. An architect put the plans on paper and, over the following year, Bill Wallace and his cowboys built the new bunkhouse, using much salvaged Air Force material, including doors, plumbing, toilets, basins, and lumber.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> </strong></p>",
    "audioDescription": "The bunkhouse building is about 20 feet below a dirt road, down a sloped hillside covered with iceplant. This succulent has long thick fleshy leaves, shaped like little fingers, that stick up to about 6 inches from the ground. One can walk down to the house via a set of stairs set into the iceplant, with railings; or drive down a sandy driveway. The building is a gray, single story, ranch-style, \"L\" shaped house, with one line of the \"L\" pointing east; the other pointing south. The road is on the south side of the building. The bunkhouse has board and batten siding, on a concrete brick foundation, and a gabled, or simple peaked, roof, covered with composite shingles. On the inside of the \"L\", the roof extends out toward the central courtyard, creating covered walkways along the walls. That portion of the roof is supported by wooden posts, rising out of into concrete brick bases, sitting on poured concrete walkways, about 6 feet wide.<br /><br />Each wall has three windows facing the courtyard. Two wooden benches sit below some of the windows. There are three doors on the southernmost end of the building, with a slatted vent above them, near the eaves, and a plaque that has the National Park Arrowhead Logo and reads,<br /><br />Santa Rosa Island<br />Research Station<br />A California State University Channel Islands Undergraduate Research Campus<br />Channel Islands Nation Park<br /><br />In the corner of the \"L\" of the building are two more doors, up one step. Near the easternmost end of the building, up three steps, is another door, with a thin vertical window beside it, and a raised planter bed below. On the walls facing the courtyard are a long, coiled hose and a fire extinguisher. Three long picnic tables are arranged in a single row in the courtyard. Another picnic table sits at the eastern end of the building, covered with a green canvas awning.<br /><br />A sturdy wooden fence with horizontal rails runs around the courtyard area and picnic tables, with a plaque at each gate, that reads:<br /><br />At the eastern end of the fence is a large eucalyptus tree with a gnarled trunk, tilting eastward at a steep angle. At the base of the tree is a cleared area for parking, beside it is the steep, sandy driveway that leads up the road. <br />",

In addition, Cabrillo is now considered to be Spanish rather than Portuguese. Nonetheless, the monument was placed by a civic organization with pride, based on the evidence available at the time.<br /> <br /> <b>Cabrillo and San Miguel Island</b><br /> In 1542 Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo was the first European explorer to reach the isolated, windswept shores of San Miguel Island. However, he was certainly not the first to \"discover\" it. When Cabrillo came ashore there were approximately 100 Chumash living in 2 villages along the island's coast, including a village at Cuyler Harbor. The Chumash and their ancestors had been living on San Miguel almost continuously for nearly 12,000 years.<br /> <br /> Cabrillo's chronicler Juan Paez de Castro wrote about San Miguel Island: \"Wednesday, the 25th [October 1542], they left these islands, that is, the one farthest to windward, which has a very good port inside which no bad effects will be felt in any kind of sea weather. They named it Posesión. That day they only sailed a little because there was no wind . . .\" Then, on \"Thursday, the 23d [November 1542] they arrived on their return at the Islas de San Lucas, at the one named Posesión.\" Paez de Castro wrote that \"they named this island the ˜Isla de Juan Rodriguez'\" and mentioned the Chumash names for the island which they had apparently learned from the friendly occupants. Antonio de Herrera wrote in 1615, \"In the eight days they were at this port they were well treated by the Indians, who go naked and have their faces painted in a checkerboard fashion.\"<br /> <br /> Returning to San Miguel Island after exploring northward on the coast, Cabrillo's party hauled out their frigata San Miguel at Cuyler Harbor to recaulk and repair planking. Either here or on another island the fleet wintered; debate continues whether the long-accepted location of San Miguel Island is accurate. Nevertheless, the Chumash were not as welcoming this time. Francisco de Vargas recalled in 1560: \"With the natives of this island he had some great fights as they came out in a warlike manner. During all the time the fleet was at the Island Capitana the Indians never stopped fighting.\" It was at this winter location, possibly San Miguel but also likely Santa Cruz or Santa Catalina, that Cabrillo sustained his mortal injury and died. The fleet returned to San Miguel Island again on March 5 but \"did not dare enter the port,\" according to Paez de Castro, \"on account of the storm which was blowing, which made the sea break in fifteen fathoms at the entrance. It was a north-northwest wind and the entrance is narrow.\"</p>",

Entering this area without a ranger is a violation of federal law.</strong></em><br /> <br /> The San Miguel Island's isolation has helped to preserve one of the island's most interesting features-the caliche forest, calcified casts of ancient vegetation that have been exposed in several areas by the eroding sand. This ancient fossilized vegetation is comprised of roots and trunks of a variety of plants, including possibly pines and cypresses that once grew on the island during periods of colder and wetter climates. The most unusual casting that has been found is a huge caliche log that was 2Â½ feet in diameter and about 30 feet long.<br /> <br /> Caliche Forest Formation Abridged Version<br /> The formation of this fossilized vegetation occurred when blowing sand apparently overwhelmed and buried the island's vegetation (including the old pines and cypresses) during the fluctuating seas of the last ice age - the Pleistocene (from 11,000 years ago to 1.8 million years ago). As the roots and trunks of these trees decomposed, their molds filled with sand.<br /> <br /> Calcium carbonate from shell fragments that were mixed in with the sand were dissolved by rain water, which is naturally slightly acidic. It accumulated below the surface in the sand filled molds and around remaining plant material, cementing together with sand and silt to create caliche.<br /> <br /> When the more recent livestock grazing destroyed much of the island's top soil and the strong winds blew away the remaining sandy soil, the caliche forest was revealed. So today, we are treated to a rare glimpse of a landscape turned inside out - the roots and trunks of these ancient plants now stand as \"forests.\"<br /> <br /> <strong>Caliche Forest Formation Detailed Version</strong><br /> There are two types of caliche present on San Miguel: soil caliche and caliche fossil forests. Soil caliche is found throughout the world in areas with arid climates, particularly where rainfall occurs in amounts less than about 30 inches (San Miguel receives about 16 inches per year). Calcium carbonate, which comes from shell fragments mixed in with blowing sand, is leached from the topsoil and deposited in the subsoil or substrate as a distinct soil layer - often called hardpan. This hard pan was quite evident on the trail we walked on to this overlook.<br /> <br /> Caliche fossil forests can be divided up into two different types of caliche - filled root, trunk and stem casts, and hollow root casts or sheaths. Each of these is formed by a somewhat different process.<br /> <br /> The stage was set when blowing sand apparently overwhelmed and buried the island's vegetation including old pines and cypresses. This most likely occurred during the last ice age when fluctuating sea levels exposed more sand around the island. It also may have occurred during the transition to a more arid climate beginning about 10-12,000 years ago. Overgrazing by pygmy mammoths probably contributed to the amount of blowing sand as well. As the roots and trunks of these trees decomposed, their molds filled with sand.<br /> Next, you need caliche. Caliche is calcium-carbonate material that is mixed with silt and sand. The calcium carbonate on San Miguel is derived by the dissolving of shells and shell fragments that have been blown across the island by the strong northwest winds. The dissolution of the shells are caused by the weak natural acid found in rain, which is formed by reactions between water vapor and some of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.<br /> <br /> San Miguel has a semi-arid climate; so when it rains, the volume of water is too small to carry dissolved materials away from the area. So the groundwater dissolves calcium carbonate shells in the surface layer and then re-precipitates it a little lower in the soil profile. As this calcium carbonate solution runs through the soil it is drawn to the sand-filled molds of the decomposed roots and trunks, possibly because they were more porous and provided an easy pathway for the groundwater. Once the calcium carbonate solution enters these sand-filled molds, it cements it together forming a cast of the former root, trunk or stem.<br /> <br /> The other type of caliche found in the fossil forests is hollow root casts or sheaths. Although the source of the calcium carbonate is the same as described above, this type of caliche is formed a little differently. The organic acids in living plants' root systems react chemically with the calcium carbonate solution, cementing sand and silt together to form caliche sheaths. After the plants decay, these hollow castings remain. Caliche sheaths are forming now, as we speak, around the living roots of some plants.<br /> <br /> These two types of caliche that make up the caliche fossil forests, were then revealed when the more recent livestock grazing destroyed much of the island's top soil and the strong winds blew away the remaining sandy soil.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Pelecanus occidentalis</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The importance of the Channel Islands National Park for conservation of wildlife is exemplified in its relationship to the California brown pelican. This seabird was classified as federally endangered in 1970 and as endangered by the state of California in 1971, but was delisted as a federally listed species in 2009. The only breeding colonies of California brown pelicans in the western United States are within Channel Islands National Park on West Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands. The preservation of this essential habitat along with the monitoring of this species is critical for the continued health of the California brown pelican population.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Breeding range is from the Channel Islands south to central Mexico.</li> <li>The only breeding colonies of California brown pelicans in the western United States are on West Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands.</li> <li>The non-breeding range extends north to Vancouver, Canada.</li> <li>Brown pelicans build large nest structures on the ground, in trees, or on vegetation.</li> <li>The nesting season can extend from January through October.</li> <li>Brown pelicans normally lay three eggs and the adults share incubation duties.</li> <li>Brown pelicans can dive from 60 feet in the air.</li> <li>Brown pelicans can live up to 40 years old.</li> <li>A pelican's throat pouch can hold over 2 gallons of water.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Brown pelicans weigh about 8 pounds and measure a little over 4 feet in length, with a wingspan of over 6.5 feet. The 6 subspecies of brown pelican are similar in appearance with slight differences particularly in breeding plumage. Sexes look similar, though males are slightly larger. Brown pelicans have short, dark legs, long, broad wings, a large, heavy all-brown body, and a huge bill. Webbing between all four toes makes the brown pelican an awkward walker, but a strong swimmer. In basic plumage, adults have a white neck and belly, pale yellow head with occipital crest, a brown body, brown eyes, a throat pouch that is reddish orange, and a billface that is paler at the base and tipped with yellow. As the breeding season approaches, the distal end of the bill turns reddish, the proximal end of the throat pouch brightens to a poppy-red, the iris turns a yellowish white to light blue, and a white stripe runs down the pouch side of neck, while the rest of the neck stays dark brown. Colors start to fade during the onset of incubation, and the yellow feathers on the head are replaced with white feathers.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The California brown pelican is a permanent resident of the coastal marine environment on the Pacific Coast and the range extends from British Columbia, Canada, south to Nayarit, Mexico. The bulk of the California brown pelican population (estimated to be about 90%) nests in Mexico. The only long-term breeding colonies of California brown pelicans in the United States are on Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands. The Channel Islands also provide roosting habitat for the birds, with major roosting areas occurring on offshore rocks of Santa Cruz Island and near the lighthouse on East Anacapa Island.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> California brown pelicans are aquatic birds and are typically found on rocky, sandy or vegetated offshore islands, beaches, open sea (for feeding),harbors, marinas, estuaries, and breakwaters. Nesting colonies are established on islands without mammalian predators and permanent human habitation. In the Southern California Bight, they typically build a nest on the ground or on native shrubs, but also occasionally in trees. On Anacapa and Santa Barbara Island, brown pelicans generally nest on inaccessible slopes, canyons, and high bluff tops and edges.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The brown pelican is the only pelican that is a plunge diver. The brown pelican is a unique feeder that makes impressive dives from ten to thirty above the surface. They are, however, able to dive from as high as one hundred feet. The deeper the meal the higher the dive. When it sees a potential meal it begins to tip downwards, the wings shape into a V, and dives. When the bill touches the surface of the water the pelican will push its legs and wings back creating a bit more force, under the water the bill opens and the pouch stretches out wide allowing the pelican to scoop up fish. The pelicans hit the water with such force that even fish six feet below the surface are stunned. Air sacs throughout the bird's body help to cushion the shock from the dive. Their pouch, attached to the lower mandible, when full can hold up to three gallons of water and fish, it is the largest pouch of any bird in the world. The pelican pops up to the surface, tips their head and bill forward letting the water drain out yet keeping the fish. Then they toss their head back to position the fish head first and swallow. It is said that brown pelicans can eat as much as four pounds of fish in one day.</p> <p>The California brown pelican stays close to shore and hunts for its food usually within five miles of land. Occasionally, one may travel as far as thirty to forty miles when necessary . Another way they feed is by sitting on the surface of the water and scavenging for food. It scans the ocean for the reflections off of the silvery scales of schooling fish rely solely on the ocean as their food source for they are carnivores and love to eat anchovies (Engraulis mordax). In fact, it is estimated that annually, California brown pelicans off the southern California coast eat about one percent of the total anchovy biomass. During their breeding season 90%of the California brown pelican's diet consists of the northern anchovy. Generally, they feed on this northern anchovy, the Pacific sardine and the Pacific mackerel.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Pelicans breed in nesting colonies on islands without mammalian predators and permanent human habitation. In the Southern California Bight, they typically build a nest on the ground or on native shrubs, but also occasionally in trees. On Anacapa and Santa Barbara Island, brown pelicans generally nest on inaccessible slopes, canyons, and high bluff tops and edges.</p> <p>Brown pelican are asynchronous nesters.The nesting season historically began in March and extended through late summer or early fall, but in recent years has often surpassed 11 months. Normal clutch size is three eggs. The peak of egg laying is usually March or April; however, eggs are often laid through June. Incubation commences after the first egg is laid, and males and females share incubation duties.</p> <p>Pelican breeding success is largely determined by the availability of their primary prey items, northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) and Pacific sardines (Sagax sarinops), which during the breeding season comprise nearly their whole diet. Brown pelicans can be seen performing a surface plunge from as high as 20 meters to catch their prey. Abandonment of nests can occur in years of rapid reduction in food availability.</p> <p>Brown pelican chicks are naked and helpless and are completely dependent on parental care and protection for the first three to four weeks after hatching. Both parents feed the young until they fledge. In California populations, chicks typically fledge about 13 weeks of age. A high percentage of post-fledging mortality is accounted for by the unsuccessful attempts of the young pelicans to feed themselves.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Brown pelicans are residents in much of their breeding range. After breeding, flocks move north along both coasts. In the Pacific, they migrate up to British Columbia. In early winter they return south to warmer waters on both coasts. Small numbers of immature birds wander inland in summer, especially in the southwest.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> In the 1960s and 1970s the park's colonies of California brown pelicans faced extinction. In 1970 on West Anacapa Island, only 552 nesting attempts were made and only chick survived. Scientists pinpointed the pesticide DDT flowing from mainland sewers into the sea as the cause. When the pelicans ate contaminated fish, DDT disrupted their reproductive systems. DDT altered the birds' calcium metabolism, resulting in egg-shell thinning. The egg shells were so thin that they broke under the parent's weight resulting in reproductive failure.</p> <p>The federal government listed the brown pelican as an endangered species in 1970, the state of California listed it as endangered in 1971, and DDT was eventually banned in 1972. The fight to save these birds led to a remarkable recovery. The park's breeding populations have steadily increased since 1980 and this subpopulation is now believed to be fairly stable. On Anacapa Island from 1969-1984, average colony size was 900 nest attempts per year.Strong increases in both productivity and nest attempts were observed in the mid 1980s, and the Anacapa colony has produced a mean of 4,600 nests per year during 1985-2006.</p> <p>Pelicans did not nest on Santa Barbara Island in recent times until 1980; the first significant nesting occurred in 1985. From 1985 to 2001, the colony produced a mean of about 770 nests per year. Starting in 2000, the pelicans started moving their nesting area around on the island.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"pelican-chart\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/nature/images/pelican-chart.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>California brown pelican colony size (nest attempts) on Anacapa Island, 1969-2006.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Today, the pelican population on West Anacapa Island averages about 4,600 nesting pairs annually and on Santa Barbara Island the average is about 1,500 nesting pairs.</p> <p>Nesting and roosting birds are very sensi¬tive to human disturbance. Pelicans are affected by ancillary fishing activities, including the presence of vessels, noise, and lights, near roosting and breeding areas. Increased light levels are known to alter the behavior of pelicans, leading to nest abandonment and increased egg and chick mortality. In 1999 large increases in nighttime squid fishing activity on park waters probably affected nesting pelicans - higher than average rates of nest abandonment and chick mortality were recorded and could not be explained by other environmental factors.<br /> <br /> There is no visitor access to West Anacapa Island. A no-entry closure from January 1 through October 31 also keeps boats well offshore to protect fledglings in the vicinity of the nesting colony and provides a buffer zone to nesting pelicans. On Santa Barbara Island, the pelican nesting area is closed to visitors and trails are closed when birds are nesting.</p> <p>In 2009, the brown pelican was removed from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife due to recovery. This action was based on a review of the best available scientific and commercial data, which indicated that the species is no longer in danger of extinction, or likely to become so within the foreseeable future. The brown pelican remains protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong><br /> <a href=\"http://birds.audubon.org/species/bropel\">National Audubon Society</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></p> <p> </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Zalophus Californianus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> California sea lions<em>, Zalophus californianus</em>, are probably the most familiar marine mammal at the Channel Islands. These smart, playful animals are often seen feeding, playing in the surf or lounging on beaches around San Miguel, Anacapa, and Santa Barbara, but may also be seen on the other Channel Islands. These members of the<em>otariid</em>or walking seal family have external ear flaps and large flippers that they use to \"walk\" on land. The trained \"seals\" in zoos and aquariums are usually California sea lions. Significant breeding rookeries for this species are found on the California Channel Islands.<sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Sea lions produce loud roars and barking, which helps explain why they're named after lions. Males of some sea lion species even grow thick manes around their necks. <sup>2</sup><br />  </li> <li>California sea lions are among the most gregarious marine mammals, forming dense aggregations of a thousand or more animals on land. <sup>2</sup><br />  </li> <li>In the wild this species can live up to 17 years, although in captivity, one California sea lion lived over 31 years. <sup>3</sup><br />  </li> <li>The deepest dive ever recorded by this species was 900 feet and it lasted just under ten minutes. <sup>3</sup><br />  </li> <li>Ninety percent of the young are born in June. They are born on land and nurse for a year or more.<sup>3</sup><br />  </li> <li>The stomach of an average California sea lion may contain as many as 100 pieces of gravel sized rocks. No one is sure yet what they are used for but it is believed that they are used to ease hunger pains during their mating and fasting periods. <sup>4</sup><br />  </li> <li>San Miguel Island is home to one of the largest rookeries in the world for California sea lions with a breeding population of approximately 80,000 animals.</li> </ul>   <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The California sea lion is the well-known performing \"seal\" of zoos, circuses, and oceanaria. In both sexes, the muzzle is dog-like and long, slightly tapering to a moderately blunt end. Adult males are substantially more robust and larger than females. Male California sea lions reach lengths of almost 8 feet in length, and weights of more than 600 pounds. Females, may reach up to 6 and a half feet in length and weigh up to 240 pounds. Newborn pups are about two and one half feet in length and weigh in from 13 to 20 pounds.</p> <p>The species has visible ear pinnae (ear flaps) on either side of its head (this is one distinguishing difference between sea lions from seals). Mature adult males have a raised forehead called the sagittal crest which increases to about an inch and a half at ten years of age. In adult males, the sagittal crest creates a high peaked crown. The crest begins to emerge at sexual maturity and, although highly variable, is most prominent in full-grown males. Females lack a pronounced crest and have a thinner head that slopes more gently to the end of the muzzle. This makes sub adult and juvenile males very difficult to distinguish from females. A California sea lions fore flippers are large and winglike, with the skeletal structure of a land animal.However, they have been modifies for swimming with cartilage extensions at the end of the finger bones.Not present are claws or hair.The California sea lion has a small flattened tail between the hind flippers.</p> <p>The color of California sea lions is highly variable. When dry, the coat of most adult males is dark brown. However, many males do not darken completely, remaining sandy brown on the sides, belly, and rear quarters. On most males, especially darker individuals, the crest and a corresponding area on the muzzle and around the eyes lighten with age. Adult females and juveniles are uniformly tan. Pups are born with a thick brownish black lanugo that is generally molted by the end of the first month.The succeeding light brown juvenile coat is shed 4 to 5 months later, and as adult males age, the hair around their heads lightens to a light tan is replaced by adult coloration. All ages and sexes have contrasting black flippers, naked except for a short stubble of dark fur partially covering the upper surface. <sup>1, 7</sup></p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The California sea lion ranges along the western coast and islands of North America, from southeast Alaska to central Mexico. Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California sea lion populations: the US or Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The US stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The stocks of the Gulf of California live in the shallow waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (Central stock), and the mouth of the bay (Southern stock). <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> During the breeding season, sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie closer to the water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or higher up along the coast. . Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near the Bonneville Dam in the Columbia River. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> California sea lions feed on a wide variety of seafood, mainly squid and fish, and sometimes clams. Commonly eaten fish and squid species include salmon, hake, Pacific whiting, anchovy, herring, rockfish, lamprey, dogfish, and market squid. They mostly forage near mainland coastlines, the continental shelf, and sea mounts. California sea lions may eat alone or in small to large groups, depending on the amount of food available. They sometimes cooperate with other predators, such as dolphins, porpoises, and seabirds, when hunting large schools of fish. Sea lions sometimes follow dolphins and exploit their hunting efforts. Adult females feed between 6.2 to 62 miles from shore, but males may forage as far as 280 miles from shore.<sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> California sea lions breed gregariously between May and August, when they arrive at their breeding rookeries. When establishing a territory, the males will try to increase their chances of reproducing by staying on the rookery for as long as possible. During this time, they will fast, relying on a thick layer of fat called blubber for energy. Size and patience allow a male to defend his territory more effectively;the bigger the male, the more blubber he can store and the longer he can wait. A male sea lion usually keeps his territory for around 27 days. Males do not establish their territories until after the females give birthThe animals tend to be more physically aggressive during this time. After this, the males rely on ritualized displays (vocalizations, head-shaking, stares, bluff lunges, and so on) to maintain their territorial boundaries. 5</p> <p>Most pups are born in June or July and weigh 13 to 20 pounds. They nurse for at least five to six months and sometimes over a year. Mothers recognize pups on crowded rookeries through smell and vocalizations. Pups also learn to recognize the smell and vocalizations of their mothers. Breeding takes place a few weeks after birth. Males patrol territories and bark almost continuously during the breeding season. Most pups are weaned at 12 months of age. However, some pups continue to receive maternal care as yearlings and 2-3year olds. <sup>1, 6</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the California sea lion should remain classified as species of Least Concern due to its large and increasing population size.Exploitation during the 19th and 20th centuries caused population reductions. The distribution range has not changed since the exploitation era but population numbers have increased mainly in California where the population estimate is around 238,000. The population in Mexico occupies both side of the Baja California Peninsula: the west coast has an estimated population of 75,000 –87,000, whereas the Gulf of California population is near 30,000. The total population of California sea lions is therefore around 355,000 individuals. The population in California is reaching carrying capacity. <sup>6</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/california-sea-lion/\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/california-sea-lion/</a>?</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/pinnipedia/california-sea-lion.htm#ff2\">http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/pinnipedia/california-sea-lion.htm#ff2</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/328615/details\">http://eol.org/pages/328615/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=123\">http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=123</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_sea_lion\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_sea_lion</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41666/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41666/0</a></li> <li>Marine Mammals of the World ID guide, Jefferson, Leatherwood and Webber</li> </ol>",

As highly prized targets for fishermen and divers, most California spiny lobsters do not live longer than 5-7 years before being caught. They have been known to achieve lengths of over 3 feet long and weighing 16 pounds.<br /> <br /> As predators, lobsters play a central role in maintaining the diversity of intertidal and subtidal communities. Predation on kelp-eating species such as sea urchins helps to maintain a balance in the kelp forest ecosystem, providing a more stable habitat for other species that rely on the kelp for food and shelter. The kelp forests of the Channel Islands offer an excellent rocky habitat for their pelagic larvae arriving with the converging currents from the south.</p>",

About halfway across the island, however, there is something that will help spur you on and encourage your feet to keep moving. That something is a sound-faint at first, but gradually getting louder and louder. The noise is a sort of rumble, low and rolling.

The originators of the noise that you have been listening to are the gigantic males with their long proboscises that give the species its name.

Other species include California sea lions, northern fur seals, and harbor seals. At one time, two other species were found here in abundance--Steller or northern sea lions and Guadalupe fur seals. While only an occasional male Steller sea lion has been seen since the 1980s, a few Guadalupe fur seals have occassionally pupped.<br /> <br /> Nevertheless, not only are more species sighted at this remote island than at anywhere else on the planet, but this gathering represents one of the largest congregations of wildlife in the world. Staggering populations of over 70,000 California sea lions, 5,000 northern fur seals, 50,000 northern elephant seals and 1,100 harbor seals breed and pup on the island each year.<br /> <br /> The diversity of pinnipeds is part of a larger picture of biological diversity found in the Santa Barbara Channel. San Miguel Island lies in an area of water that overlaps two currents-a cold current moving down the Pacific coast from Alaska and a warm current moving up the Pacific coast from Mexico. Those two currents meet and intermingle not only water, but many of the species associated with corresponding cold and warm currents.<br /> <br /> Islands also bring diversity by providing shelf areas where sunlight can penetrate the water, and plants, such as the giant bladder kelp, can grow. The dense kelp forests around the islands provide food and shelter for many varieties of plants and animals. Diversity is also linked to upwelling conditions that exist near San Miguel Island. Upwelling sucks cold nutrient-rich water that normally lies at the bottom of the ocean to the surface, providing food for hundreds of species.<br /> <br /> Finally, the isolation of the islands also plays a role. A beach all to themselves with no disturbance from people must be very enticing for seals and sea lions. Therefore, the Santa Barbara Channel, the islands, and Point Bennett, specifically, provide all the necessary ingredients that they need--wide sandy beaches, plenty of food, and others of their kind.<br /> <br /> Researchers from the National Marine Fisheries Service, in cooperation with the park, have been studying the seals and sea lions of San Miguel since 1968. Long-term behavior studies on marked animals provide information about reproductive behavior as well as migratory and feeding patterns. Current studies focus on population assessment and demographics, diseases, and parasites.<br /> <br /> These pinnipeds are protected by spending at least part of their lives in a national park-or are they? Some threats to these animals know no boundaries. Threats made by water pollution, plastics and debris in the ocean, gill net entanglement, oil spills, overharvesting of fisheries, toxins, and pesticides affect even isolated areas like Point Bennett. These threats can also affect people. Without protection, the spectacular rituals performed on the beaches of Cardwell Point can become a thing of the past. Generations to come may only experience the grandeur of Point Bennett through stories and photographs.<br /> <br /> People can make sure pinnipeds of the park and world survive into the future. Simple things like recycling plastics can make a difference to a curious young sea lion looking for something to play with. That plaything does not need to be a piece of plastic webbing that may strangle it.<br /> <br /> The most important action people can take is to visit Cardwell Point. Discover the world of the pinnipeds for yourself-then tell others how important it is to keep the rituals continuing.<br /> <br /> <b>Tortuga Shipwreck</b><br /> Foul weather and submerged rock and shoals had led to a large number of shipwrecks around San Miguel Island such as the former Navy dock landing ship USS Tortuga (LSD-26) near Cardwell Point. The ship eventually became a target ship for weapons testing and grounded on San Miguel Island during a storm in 1987. Soon after, the Navy towed it off the island and sank it in deep water 20 miles southwest of the island.<br /> <br /> Learn about other shipwrecks on San Miguel by visiting the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/shipwrecks.htm\">Shipwrecks</a>.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Cardwell Point offers a magnificent view of two stretches of beach. If you are standing on Cardwell Point facing right to the southeast side, there is a sandy cove, several hundred yards away. The beach is dotted with clusters of pinnipeds-slug-shaped sea mammals. On the northeast side, to your left, is the second stretch of beach with a rocky reef. Santa Rosa Island is offshore, in the distance.<br /><br />Cardwell Point is covered with green grass and patches of a low red succulent with light pink flowers. To the northwest, from your bird's eye view you can see lobster traps out in the water, and a large reef just beyond the shore. Along the northwest shore and about a half mile away to the southwest are beaches that often bustle with activity. Depending on the time of year, the beaches may be filled with dozens and sometimes hundreds of pinnipeds, including California sea lions, northern elephant seals, and northern fur seals. These torpedo-shaped sea mammals have flippers, and heads shaped like a dog's, but with tiny or invisible ears. More pinnipeds swim just off shore-hunting or \"body-surfing\" the waves. The whole scene is accompanied by a chorus of their varied calls-from bellows and bleats to snorts, barks, and creaks. <br /><br />Adult male elephant seals are the largest animals on the beach. These brown animals have short, bulbous snouts, are about 12 feet long, and can weigh as much as 5,000 pounds. They often rest, almost motionless, on the beach, but during the breeding season the males battle one another for females. Known as \"bulls\", the male elephant seals make snorting sounds while slamming their massive bodies together and gouging each other with their short, carrot-shaped tusks, until their necks are red with blood. The females, which are about 10 feet long, and weigh up to 1,800 pounds. When born, the babies, called pups, are 3 to 4 feet long, and weigh only about 70 pounds, or 1.5 % the size of the bull elephant seals. <br /><br />The California sea lions have large front and back flippers, and are more agile on land than other pinnipeds; roaming up to a mile inland. The mature males are dark brown, about 7 feet long, and weigh up to 1,000 pounds. Males have a bellowing bark, that sounds like \"Aarh!.\" <br />Females are golden brown, about 6 feet long, and weigh about 200 pounds. Pups are dark brown and about 16 pounds at birth, but their coats become golden brown after about 5 months. <br /><br />Females will fight other females to defend their pups. In order for females and their pups to find one another, the pups call out in a bleating, \"Baah\" sound, like that of a baby lamb. Their mothers call back in a creaking, \"Ahh\" sound. <br /><br />The older pups wander farther from their mothers, with many cavorting together in groups in a sandy lagoon a hundred yards back from the shoreline. <br /><br /><br />Northern fur seals have very large front and back flippers and tiny ears. Males are grey to black, and between 300 - 600 pounds. They declare their territories with a bellowing sound, almost like a cow's \"moo\", and vigorously defend their turf by chasing away intruders. Females are light brown on the back with a reddish brown chest, with a light patch. They weigh about 100 pounds. <br />",

Although once found on San Miguel, today this rare plant species is only found on Santa Rosa Island and exists in just two locations.<br /> <br /> The island paintbrush must grow beneath the canopy of coast goldenbush or other shrubs because it is semi-parasitic. It makes some of its own nutrients, but relies on a host plant to provide most of its nutrients and sugars.<br /> <br /> In 1997, this paintbrush was listed as endangered as a result of trampling by nonnative herbivores, competition with nonnative grasses for water and other nutrients, and large gaps in the goldenbush canopy However, vegetation monitoring has shown that with the removal of nonnative animals this species has begun to recover.<br /> <br /> <b>Channel Islands Pygmy Mammoth</b><br /> In 1994, geologists who were surveying an ancient sand dune just to the west of Carrington Point discovered bones of a pygmy mammoth sticking out from an eroding bluff. After a 10-day excavation, the discovery proved to be the world's most complete fossil of this species. About 95 percent of the skeleton was almost perfectly preserved because sand had covered the body soon after the mammoth's death.<br /> <br /> This specimen was determined to be a male that was 5.5 feet tall and had weighed approximately 2,000 pounds. With worn teeth and signs of arthritis, paleontologists estimated this mammoth to be about 50 years old at the time of death, 12,840 years ago. The cause of death was most likely old age.<br /> <br /> The Channel Islands pygmy mammoth's ancestors were 14-foot, 20,000-pound Columbian mammoths that roamed the mainland. About 30,000 years ago, some of these Columbian mammoths swam to the ancient Channel Islands. At that time sea level was about 300 feet lower than it is today, and the four northern islands were joined together to form a \"super island\" known as Santarosae that was only about four miles from the mainland. Mammoths were probably just as seaworthy as their descendants, modern elephants. With their snorkel-like trunks and buoyancy, elephants have been known to swim up to 23 miles.<br /> <br /> With ample food and no predators, the island mammoths thrived at first. However, as the climate changed and glaciers and ice sheets melted and the sea level rose, the island habitat shrank and food became scarce. Smaller mammoths had an advantage as they could survive with less food and water during seasonal shortages.<br /> <br /> Within less than 20,000 years, a process of natural selection bred these mammoths to be usually less than 6.5 feet at the shoulder-less than half the height of their mainland ancestors. These small mammoths became a new species, the Channel Islands pygmy mammoth.<br /> <br /> Theories about the extinction of pygmy mammoths and Columbian mammoths, as well many other large animals around 10,000 years ago, include climate change, human hunters, viruses carried by humans, or some combination of these. However, while there is evidence of people hunting mammoths on the mainland, there is no evidence on the Channel Islands. Furthermore, there is still no proof that humans and pygmy mammoths even coexisted on the Channel Islands.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Ptychoramphus aleuticus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Cassin's auklet is a small, chunky seabird that ranges widely in the North Pacific. It is noteworthy for its extraordinary diving ability and skill at catching prey underwater. The Channel Islands National Park is a major breeding and feeding grounds for this species. The park provides the isolation required for its nesting sites providing the environment required to maintain its population.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Cassin's auklets breed along the Pacific coast, from midways up the Baja California peninsula to Alaska's Aleutian Islands. On the Channel Islands, the Cassin's auklet currently nests on Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, San Miguel, and Anacapa Islands.</li> <li>During the non-breeding seasons, Cassin's auklets will spend most of their time at sea.</li> <li>Cassin's auklets nest in rock crevices and build burrows.</li> <li>They will also nest in artificial burrows allowing biologists to easily monitor a colony.</li> <li>Both parents incubate a single egg.</li> <li>Cassin's auklets are excellent divers; their wings allow them to \"fly\" underwater.</li> <li>During the nesting season, food is stored in a specialized throat pouch and brought back to the nesting site. They return to their nest only at night.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Cassin's auklet is a small (10 in., 7 oz.) nondescript auk. Its plumage is generally dark above and pale below, with a small white mark above the eye. Its bill is overall dark with a pale spot, and its feet are blue. Unlike many other auks, the Cassin's auklet lacks dramatic breeding plumage, remaining the same over most of the year. At sea it is usually identified by its flight, which is described as looking like a flying tennis ball.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Cassin's auklet ranges from midway up the Baja California peninsula to Alaska's Aleutian Islands off North America. It nests on offshore islands, with the main population stronghold at Triangle Island off Vancouver Island's Cape Scott, where the population is estimated to be around 550,000 pairs.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> San Miguel Island and its islets, particularly Prince Island and Castle Rock, provide the most important nesting sites for the Cassin's auklet in the Southern California bight. It also breeds colonially on the other islands of the Channel Islands National Park, except Santa Rosa Island. The Cassin's auklet usually nest in dense colonies in rock crevices and in burrows they dig in rocky compacted soil or they may excavate burrows for nesting in soft soils under vegetation, stumps, or fallen logs on seaward slopes of coastal sites.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The Cassin's auklet feeds offshore, often relying on upwellings of cooler nutrient rich waters and associating with bathymetric landmarks such the continental shelf and underwater canyons. This species unique ability to dive by beating its wings for propulsion allows it to hunt down large zooplankton, especially krill. It can dive to 30 meters below the surface, and by some estimates 80 meters.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The Cassin's auklet may be found in the breeding colony year round. Auklet pairs show a strong loyalty towards each other, nesting on the same site for many years. Parents take turns incubating a single white egg, with the at-sea parent returning after dusk to swap shifts in order to avoid predators such as the western gull or peregrine falcon. The egg is incubated for 40 days. The small chick is then fed nightly for 35 days by both parents, who regurgitate partially digested food (krill and other small crustaceans) carried in a special gular pouch, often referred to as a sublingual pouch. The chick fledges alone and makes its way to the sea. The Cassin's auklet is unusual amongst seabirds because it will occasionally lay a second clutch after a successful first clutch.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> This seabird is not recognized as the migratory bird, however the northern birds may move southward during the winter season toward ice-free areas. Populations on the west coast are generallypermanent residents.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Cassin's auklet is listed as Least Concern. Although some populations (principally the Farallon Islands population) have suffered steep declines since the early 1970's, the species is still numerous overall. Threats to the auklet include introduced carnivores (particularly in Alaska), oil spills, and changes in sea surface temperature (caused by El Niño events). The Cassin's auklet is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.On Santa Barbara Island, efforts are underway to restore seabird nesting habitat for Cassin's auklets by removing non-native plants and planting native vegetation to improve seabird habitat. Nest boxes insulated against the elements have also been installed with the goal of providing a secure nesting area and vocalization playback systems have been used to attract auklets. Scorpion and Orizaba Rocks, located off of Santa Cruz Island, are also important nesting islets for Cassin's aucklets. To restore seabird habitat on these islets, restoration efforts have included removing non-native vegetation, revegetation with native plants, installation of nest boxes, and signs informing the public that the rocks are closed to protect nesting seabirds.

In 1938, the Gherini family brought the tractor to the island via a tug boat from San Pedro, California. When the \"cat\" was being unloaded at the beach, one of the wood planks used to allow the tractor to be driven off the barge collapsed and the tractor tipped over. Through the use of ropes and block and tackle, a rope was run from the tractor to a rock (through the block and tackle) and then out to the tug, which pulled the heavy tractor back onto its tracks.<br /> <br /> Thereafter, the tractor proved to be a significant piece of equipment in building and grading roads and constructing an earthen dam. Since the Caterpillar Company started using yellow as its standard color in 1931, this model was manufactured sometime thereafter. The bulldozer attachment is not original to the tractor. Additional spare parts can be seen scattered about, including a radiator.</p>",

One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park, and six nautical miles around each island form Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.<br /> <br /> The Channel Islands lie within a large embayment known as the Southern California Bight-an area just below Point Conception where the California coastline turns sharply to the east. Within this area, the seafloor is composed of canyons, banks, escarpments, sea mounts, and deep basins (the Santa Cruz Basin is deeper than the Grand Canyon). Nutrient-rich waters upwelling from these depths mix and mingle with cool waters from the north (California Current) and warm southern waters (California Countercurrent), creating the Santa Barbara Gyre-a swirling eddy that circulates nutrients and supports a wealth of marine plants and animals, from giant kelp forests and blue whales to tiny crabs and plankton. Here, northern and southern species overlap, creating a transition zone between the Oregonian and Californian marine biogeographic provinces.<br /> <br /> **Kelp Forests**<br /> The isolated islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in southern California, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of alga that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing organisms on Earth-it can grow two feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales feasting on plankton.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but also those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use toothpaste are all using a little bit of seaweed as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredient called algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine algae and plants such as kelp provide Earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the 20th century.<br /> <br /> However, with the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls, fishing regulations, research, and public education, some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> **Marine Protected Areas**<br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provides a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 marine reserves (including two on Santa Rosa Island-around Carrington and Skunk Points), recreational fishing and commercial harvesting are prohibited; limited fishing and harvesting are allowed in two marine conservation areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.</p> <h3>California Sea Lion</h3> <p>**Scientific Name**<br /> <strong>Zalophus Californianus</strong><br /> <br /> **Introduction**<br /> California sea lions, <strong>Zalophus californianus</strong> , are probably the most familiar marine mammal at the Channel Islands. These smart, playful animals are often seen feeding, playing in the surf or lounging on beaches around San Miguel, Anacapa, and Santa Barbara, but may also be seen on the other Channel Islands. These members of theotariidor walking seal family have external ear flaps and large flippers that they use to \"walk\" on land. The trained \"seals\" in zoos and aquariums are usually California sea lions. Significant breeding rookeries for this species are found on the California Channel Islands.1<br /> <br /> **Quick and Cool Facts**<br /> - Sea lions produce loud roars and barking, which helps explain why they're named after lions. Males of some sea lion species even grow thick manes around their necks. 2<br /> <br /> - California sea lions are among the most gregarious marine mammals, forming dense aggregations of a thousand or more animals on land. 2<br /> <br /> - In the wild this species can live up to 17 years, although in captivity, one California sea lion lived over 31 years. 3<br /> <br /> - The deepest dive ever recorded by this species was 900 feet and it lasted just under ten minutes. 3<br /> <br /> - Ninety percent of the young are born in June. They are born on land and nurse for a year or more.3<br /> <br /> - The stomach of an average California sea lion may contain as many as 100 pieces of gravel sized rocks. No one is sure yet what they are used for but it is believed that they are used to ease hunger pains during their mating and fasting periods. 4<br /> <br /> - San Miguel Island is home to one of the largest rookeries in the world for California sea lions with a breeding population of approximately 80,000 animals.<br /> <br /> **Appearance**<br /> The California sea lion is the well-known performing \"seal\" of zoos, circuses, and oceanaria. In both sexes, the muzzle is dog-like and long, slightly tapering to a moderately blunt end. Adult males are substantially more robust and larger than females. Male California sea lions reach lengths of almost 8 feet in length, and weights of more than 600 pounds. Females, may reach up to 6 and a half feet in length and weigh up to 240 pounds. Newborn pups are about two and one half feet in length and weigh in from 13 to 20 pounds.<br /> <br /> The species has visible ear pinnae (ear flaps) on either side of its head (this is one distinguishing difference between sea lions from seals). Mature adult males have a raised forehead called the sagittal crest which increases to about an inch and a half at ten years of age. In adult males, the sagittal crest creates a high peaked crown. The crest begins to emerge at sexual maturity and, although highly variable, is most prominent in full-grown males. Females lack a pronounced crest and have a thinner head that slopes more gently to the end of the muzzle. This makes sub adult and juvenile males very difficult to distinguish from females. A California sea lions fore flippers are large and winglike, with the skeletal structure of a land animal. However, they have been modifies for swimming with cartilage extensions at the end of the finger bones. Not present are claws or hair. The California sea lion has a small flattened tail between the hind flippers.<br /> <br /> The color of California sea lions is highly variable. When dry, the coat of most adult males is dark brown. However, many males do not darken completely, remaining sandy brown on the sides, belly, and rear quarters. On most males, especially darker individuals, the crest and a corresponding area on the muzzle and around the eyes lighten with age. Adult females and juveniles are uniformly tan. Pups are born with a thick brownish black lanugo that is generally molted by the end of the first month.The succeeding light brown juvenile coat is shed 4 to 5 months later, and as adult males age, the hair around their heads lightens to a light tan is replaced by adult coloration. All ages and sexes have contrasting black flippers, naked except for a short stubble of dark fur partially covering the upper surface. 1, 7<br /> <br /> **Range**<br /> The California sea lion ranges along the western coast and islands of North America, from southeast Alaska to central Mexico. Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California sea lion populations: the US or Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The US stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The stocks of the Gulf of California live in the shallow waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (Central stock), and the mouth of the bay (Southern stock). 5<br /> <br /> **Habitat**<br /> During the breeding season, sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie closer to the water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or higher up along the coast. . Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near the Bonneville Dam in the Columbia River. 5<br /> <br /> **Feeding **<br /> California sea lions feed on a wide variety of seafood, mainly squid and fish, and sometimes clams. Commonly eaten fish and squid species include salmon, hake, Pacific whiting, anchovy, herring, rockfish, lamprey, dogfish, and market squid. They mostly forage near mainland coastlines, the continental shelf, and sea mounts. California sea lions may eat alone or in small to large groups, depending on the amount of food available. They sometimes cooperate with other predators, such as dolphins, porpoises, and seabirds, when hunting large schools of fish. Sea lions sometimes follow dolphins and exploit their hunting efforts. Adult females feed between 6.2 to 62 miles from shore, but males may forage as far as 280 miles from shore.5<br /> <br /> **Reproduction**<br /> California sea lions breed gregariously between May and August, when they arrive at their breeding rookeries. When establishing a territory, the males will try to increase their chances of reproducing by staying on the rookery for as long as possible. During this time, they will fast, relying on a thick layer of fat called blubber for energy. Size and patience allow a male to defend his territory more effectively; the bigger the male, the more blubber he can store and the longer he can wait. A male sea lion usually keeps his territory for around 27 days. Males do not establish their territories until after the females give birthThe animals tend to be more physically aggressive during this time. After this, the males rely on ritualized displays (vocalizations, head-shaking, stares, bluff lunges, and so on) to maintain their territorial boundaries. 5<br /> <br /> Most pups are born in June or July and weigh 13 to 20 pounds. They nurse for at least five to six months and sometimes over a year. Mothers recognize pups on crowded rookeries through smell and vocalizations. Pups also learn to recognize the smell and vocalizations of their mothers. Breeding takes place a few weeks after birth. Males patrol territories and bark almost continuously during the breeding season. Most pups are weaned at 12 months of age. However, some pups continue to receive maternal care as yearlings and 2-3year olds. 1, 6<br /> <br /> **Conservation Status**<br /> According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the California sea lion should remain classified as species of Least Concern due to its large and increasing population size. Exploitation during the 19th and 20th centuries caused population reductions. The distribution range has not changed since the exploitation era but population numbers have increased mainly in California where the population estimate is around 238,000. The population in Mexico occupies both side of the Baja California Peninsula: the west coast has an estimated population of 75,000 -87,000, whereas the Gulf of California population is near 30,000. The total population of California sea lions is therefore around 355,000 individuals. The population in California is reaching carrying capacity. 6<br /> <br /> **References and Additional Information**<br /> 1. <a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/california-sea-lion/?\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/california-sea-lion/?</a><br /> 2. <a href=\"http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/pinnipedia/california-sea-lion.htm#ff2\">http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/pinnipedia/california-sea-lion.htm#ff2</a><br /> 3. <a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/328615/details\">http://eol.org/pages/328615/details</a><br /> 4. <a href=\"http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=123\">http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=123</a><br /> 5. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California <strong>sea</strong> lion\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California <strong>sea</strong> lion</a><br /> 6. <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41666/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41666/0</a><br /> 7. Marine Mammals of the World ID guide, Jefferson, Leatherwood and Webber</p> <h3>Harbor Seal</h3> <p>**Scientific Name**<br /> <strong>Phoca vitulina</strong><br /> <br /> **Introduction**<br /> The California Channel Islands play an important role in the life cycle of many large marine mammals that live along the west coast of North America.. Harbor seals, Phoca vitulina, can often be spotted on rocks near the water's edge with their head and flippers elevated in order to be warmed by the sun's rays. 4<br /> <br /> **Quick and Cool Facts**<br /> - Harbor seal pups can swim at birth and can dive for up to 2 minutes when they are only 2-3 days old. 3<br /> <br /> - Harbor seals are estimated to reach an average lifespan of 40 years in the wild. In captivity, the longest recorded lifespan was 47.6 years. 2<br /> <br /> - Harbor seals can dive to depths of 1400 feet and remain underwater for nearly 30 minutes without resurfacing.2<br /> <br /> - Their sensitive whiskers acoustically detect sound waves, which is useful for catching prey. 2<br /> <br /> - Contrasted to other pinnipeds, harbor seals are not sexually dimorphic;meaning that is no significant differences is size between females and males. 5<br /> <br /> **Appearance**<br /> Pacific harbor seals have spotted coats in a variety of shades from white or silver-gray to black or dark brown. They reach five to six feet in length and weigh up to 300 pounds. They are true or crawling seals, having no external ear flaps. True seals have small flippers and must move on land by flopping along on their bellies.<br /> <br /> **Range**<br /> Harbor seals are found north of the equator in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In the Pacific, they range from Alaska to Baja California, Mexico.1 Harbor Seals are typically found near shore.They are found throughout the California Channel Islands including all five Islands in Channel Islands National Park.On San Miguel Island 1,100 harbor seals breed annually on Point Bennett, which is also an extraordinary haul out area for four other pinniped species.<br /> <br /> **Habitat**<br /> They favor near-shore coastal waters and are often seen on islands, rocky coastlines, sandy beaches, mudflats, bays, and estuaries.They often choose to rest close to the water so they have quick access to the water in case of a threat. 1, 5<br /> <br /> **Feeding**<br /> Harbor seals are carnivores that consume mostly fish. Despite regional variation in individual diets, the overarching goal of harbor seals is to keep foraging efforts low by eating what is abundant and easily caught. Adults eat mostly fish, consuming the fish whole or head first. Preferred medium-sized fish species include codfish, hake, mackerel, and herring. They also eat octopus or squid, as well as crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp. Because newly weaned pups have poorly developed diving abilities, their primary diet consists of crustaceans that are easier to catch. Harbor seals weighing about 220 pounds eat about 11 to 15 pounds of food per day. 2<br /> <br /> **Reproduction**<br /> In California, harbor seal pups are born between February and April and weigh about 20 to 24 pounds at birth. If born prematurely, harbor seals retain a whitish lanugo coat (which is usually lost before birth). A pup can swim at birth and will sometimes ride on its mother's back when tired. Pups make a bleating noise that sounds like \"maaaa\". After about four weeks, the pups are weaned. Adult females usually mate and give birth every year. 1<br /> <br /> **Conservation Status**<br /> The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species considers the harbor seal to be a species of Least Concern. Spring brings harbor seal colonies to rookery beaches that are accessible to humans. Sometimes a pup and mother become separated due to disturbance by beachgoers. Unfortunately, this severely decreases the pup's chance for survival. The worldwide harbor seal population is estimated to be 500,000 individuals. The number estimated to live in California was 34,000 in 2009. 1<br /> <br /> **References and Additional Information**<br /> 1. <a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/pacific-harbor-seal/\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/pacific-harbor-seal/</a><br /> 2. <a href=\"http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Phoca <strong>vitulina/\">http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Phoca vitulina/</a><br /> 3. <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/pinnipeds/harborseal.htm\">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/pinnipeds/harborseal.htm</a><br /> 4. <a href=\"http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=12\">http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=12</a><br /> 5. <a href=\"http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/harbor <strong>seals/facts.htm\">http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/harbor seals/facts.htm</a></p>",
    "audioDescription": "Trail Stop 8: Cathedral Cove<br />For your safety, please remain behind the railroad ties on the ground.<br /><br />The view: From the northern post for trail stop #3, you are at the edge of a steep cliff facing north across the Channel towards the mainland in the distance. The edge of the cliff is about two feet in front of you and drops several hundred feet straight down to the ocean. The cliff continues east and west along the full length of the island. At 8 o'clock, at the bottom of the cliff is a tall shallow cave filled with a small beach. There, you can usually spot tiny tan and brown lumps that are actually pinnipeds, a scientific family that includes seals and sea lions. They generally lay still and may be mistaken for rocks when seen from this far away. Every few minutes however, one or two will roll around, flap their flippers, or fight with one another. Their bellows can often be heard, even from this distance. At 9 o'clock, around a rocky outcrop, is another shallow beach at the base of the cliff. More pinnipeds are often seen there. Just offshore a kelp forest can be seen below the water, interspersed with patches of sandy ocean bottom.<br /><br />From 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock, Santa Barbara County can be seen on the distant mainland, across the channel. At 2 o'clock is Ventura County. At 3 o'clock is the white, cylindrical Anacapa lighthouse, about 6 stories tall.<br /><br />The guide:<br />The guide shows a baby sea lion, with large front flippers.<br />The guide reads, \"Stand atop the bluffs at Cathedral Cove and watch sea lions haul out and sun themselves on the narrow, rocky shoreline. <br /><br />The isolated beaches scattered along Anacapa's northern and southern shores offer harbor seals and sea lions an ideal combination of safety from predators and freedom from human disturbance.<br /><br />Even Anacapa's isolation could not protect these and other sea mammals from human predation. Fur hunters exploited the large communities of sea otters near the Channel Islands. Fur seals, elephant seals, and sea lions were also killed for their fur, hides, and oil. Even sea lion whiskers were a popular commodity. Gentlemen used them for pipe cleaners.<br /><br />Sea mammal hunting ended in the early 1900s and laws now protect these marine species. Today harbor seals and sea lions regularly breed on Anacapa's rocky beaches. Their protected populations are nearly recovered from centuries of slaughter.\"",

    "audioDescription": "You are standing on the dirt road on a plateau, between the ranch complex and the landing pier. In the grass are two large rusty structures. One is a cattle chute that looks like a rusty rectangular metal box frame, about 8 feet high, 18 feet long, and 3 feet wide. It has six thin vertical ribs, that wrap around the box, connecting to two long horizontal beams on the top and two on the bottom. Some of the metal is slightly bent and rusted through. Wooden planks and large wooden boards line the sides of the metal frame up to about 6 feet high. The floor is made of a long metal plate with a diamond pattern. At about every 10 inches, a metal rod is welded onto that metal floor panel. Metal panels are also mounted to the bottoms of the side walls, like a baseboard molding. Laying on the floor, we see a variety of poles, wooden planks, rope, lengths of chain, and a long narrow metal panel with wooden 2 by 4s bolted to it. Attached to one end of the structure, are metal, triangle-shaped extension walls. A rope is looped through a hole at the base of one of these. Dangling from an outside pole are a few rusted cables, gathered up by a rusted cinch or buckle. On the outside of the structure is a shallow shelf frame, stacked with several wooden two by fours. Growing on the wooden walls are patches of lichen, looking like a pale green crusty growth.Near the cattle chute is a rusted crane. The support for the crane is a 12-foot tall pyramid-shaped frame, made of three upright poles. These poles are mounted into a narrow triangular metal footing about 15-feet long, with 1-foot high sides, and a 10 inch wide shelf-like rim along the top. Welded to this rim is a \"T\" shaped handle at the front tip, with a metal cable looped around it; and a metal plate with a two foot long metal horizontal \"spool\", with a thick cable wound around it. The spool cable runs up and around two disc-shaped pullies, to the outer tip of the crane. From there, the cable hangs down, with a cylindrical metal weight and a hook at the end of it. A rope extends from the hook, and is tied off on one of the crane support poles, at about eye level.You are standing on the dirt road on a plateau, between the ranch complex and the landing pier. Adjacent to the road is a pile driver. It has an upright wooden frame shaped like a folding ladder, with four upright posts, joined at the top, to make a shape like a right triangle, when viewed from the side. This pile driver is about 20 feet tall and about 1 and one half feet wide at the top. On one side, the ladder-like legs are vertical and parallel, so they are about 1 and one half feet wide at the top and bottom, with a couple of metal braces. On the other side, the ladder-like legs tilt out at a 30-degree angle and are splayed to be wider at the bottom, about 6-feet wide. These two tilted legs are connected with a metal plate and two x-shaped wooden braces-a small X near the narrower top, and a wide X near the base. All four of these upright wooden posts are secured to a wooden platform base, with large metal plates, and thick metal brackets. Lying on top of the base platform are rope, pieces of wood, and lots of rusty metal items: gears, valve handles, screws, cranks, a large spool of cable, and a long pole with an X shaped point on one end, like a giant Phillips head screwdriver with a long, x-shaped bit with a flat, x-shaped tip at the very end.Mounted to one of the vertical ladder-like posts is an actual metal ladder, with round legs and rungs about the width of rebar, maybe three fourths of an inch in diameter. That metal ladder reaches all the way to the top of the pile driver's ladder-like frame. Two metal cables also connect to the top, secured at the wooden base platform. On the top of the pile driver, mounted on either side of the frame, are two rusted metal pulleys. All of the wood is covered with lichen, a pale grey-green crust-like growth.To one side, a similar pile driver is lying flat on the ground, as if the ladder-like frame has been folded. Nearby is a pile of more than a dozen long rusty metal pipe sections. Each is at least 20 feet in length. Located on a grassy plateau, near the edge at the shoreline, the rope house is a wooden plank shed-8 feet wide by 10 feet deep. Its flat roof is covered with corrugated metal. The shed is leaning slightly to one side. The door is missing from the open door frame. At the threshold is a white sign on a pole that reads,Posted No Trespassing. Keep Out.The building's vertical wooden plank siding is overlaid with a broad grid of thin additional vertical and horizontal strips of wood. The shed has two open window frames, on either side of the building. Neither has any glass panes. One window opening has a plank wedged on a diagonal, from corner to corner.Inside the building you can see where the light shines through between the planks. The wooden floor is lifted slightly off the ground. Wide two by four framing is visible of the building interior. One of the",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Batrachoseps pacificus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Channel Island slender salamander is found on Santa Cruz, San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Anacapa islands and is the only endemic amphibian found on any of the California islands. This secretive creature is found under rocks and logs (mainly near streams) and also in the soil litter, or duff, during the winter and spring rainy season.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The Channel Islands slender salamander is a member of family Plethodontidae, the lungless salamanders.</li> <li>Lungless salamanders breathe through their skin, requiring them to live in damp environments on land, not in water, and to move about on the ground only during times of high humidity.</li> <li>Typical of most slender salamanders, when disturbed, this salamander may coil up and remain still, relying on cryptic coloring to avoid detection.</li> <li>It might also uncoil quickly and spring away, repeatedly bouncing over the ground, or drop its tail to distract a predator.</li> <li>The tail is easily broken off, but it can be regenerated.</li> <li>The cool marine climate of the Channel Islands, including summer fog, provides enough moisture for this species to be active all year.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Channel Islands slender salamander is a small slim salamander with 18-20 costal grooves, which denote its rib connections. It has short limbs, a narrow head, long slender body, very long tail, and with its conspicuous costal and end of torso grooves, this species has the worm-like appearance typical of most slender salamanders. There are four toes on the front and hind feet, which is also typical of slender salamanders. Fairly robust for a slender salamander, with relatively long legs. Its coloration is brown to pinkish above with a wide dorsal stripe with indefinite borders, and may be made up of many light speckles. The throat and underside of the tail are pale and the abdomen area is whitish or slate, with light and dark speckling.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Channel Islands slender salamander is an endemic species found only on the Channel Islands, although not on Santa Barbara Island. Interestingly, Channel Islands slender salamanders share their habitat on Santa Cruz Island with another similar species, the black-bellied slender salamanders without interbreeding. In one February survey, researchers recorded 155 Channel Islands slender salamanders and 152 black-bellied slender salamanders in similar habitat. However, only Channel Islands slender salamanders were found under driftwood on a sandy substrate near the ocean. In general, when only one species is found at a more open site, it is usually Channel Islands slender salamanders.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Channel Islands slender salamanders occur in grassland, coastal sage scrub, chaparral, riparian, oak woodlands, and pine forest communities. They have been found under rocks and logs, especially near streams. Dense populations have been found in open areas near the ocean; in February at the west end of Santa Cruz Island, salamanders were abundant under driftwood on sand within 200 feet of the ocean. Periods of surface activity correspond generally to the rainy season, especially in drier inland valleys (e.g., Santa Cruz Island). However, the moderating influence of cool, marine air, combined with daily fog, extends activity throughout the summer.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Feeding probably occurs both above and below ground. Studies describe that a similar species, the California slender salamander (B. attenuatus) capture prey using a projectile tongue and feed on small invertebrates, which consist of on earthworms, small slugs, a variety of terrestrial arthropods including sowbugs and millipedes, and insects including collembolans, aphids, caterpillars, small beetles, beetle larvae, and ants. The Channel Islands slender salamander probably eats a similar array of prey items.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The Channel Islands slender salamander do not have the ability to dig their own burrows, but use excavations of other animals and cracks in the soil, in addition to man made tunnels and crevices. Because of this they must descend from the surface to moist areas underground before the late spring. Eggs are laid while the female is below ground during late fall and winter. Egg sets have been found from December 8 to January 18. The number of eggs per set ranged from 13 to 20. Hatchlings emerge during winter and early spring. It is not known if adults tend their young, and the adults and the young animals migrate to the surface during the early rains in the fall and winter. The timing of this cycle is highly dependent on weather, and varies greatly between wet and dry years.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The most recent edition of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species listed the Channel Islands slender salamander as of Least Concern since, although its Extent of Occurrence is much less than 5,000 per square kilometer, it is common and occurs in an area of extensive, suitable habitat which appears not to be under threat, it has a presumed large population, and it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li>Natural History of The Islands of California, Schoenherr, Feldmeth & Emerson</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/index.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/index.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.amphibiaweb.org/\">http://www.amphibiaweb.org</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/59131/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/59131/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/311573/details\">http://eol.org/pages/311573/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17626\">http://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17626</a></li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Melospiza melodia graminea</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Introduction</strong>This small bird, although somewhat difficult to identify due to its inconspicuous marking, is familiar to most birders: the song sparrow is one of the most widespread sparrow species in North America. Though its bland plumage has a wide range of variations, its exquisite voice is easily recognized. The Channel Islands endemic subspecies, <em>M. m. graminea</em>, is found on San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Anacapa Islands. It was a former resident of Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The song sparrow is found throughout most of North America, but the birds of different areas can look surprisingly different. Song sparrows of the Desert Southwest are pale, while those in the Pacific Northwest are dark and heavily streaked. Song sparrows of Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain are even darker, and they're huge: one-third longer than the eastern birds, and weighing twice as much.</li> <li>Some scientists think that song sparrows of wet, coastal areas have darker plumage as a defense against feather mites and other decay agents that thrive in humid climates.The darker plumage contains more of a pigment called melanin, which makes feathers tougher and harder to degrade than lighter, unpigmented feathers.</li> <li>The song sparrow lives up to its name, being one of the most persistent singers throughout the spring and summer.</li> <li>Other birds such as mockingbirds are not able to effectively imitate their song.</li> <li>They recognize enemies by both instinctual and learned patterns, and adjust future behavior based on both its own experiences in encounters, and from watching other birds interact with enemies.</li> <li>A group of song sparrows are collectively known as a \"flock\", \"choir\", and \"chorus\" of sparrows.</li> <li>The oldest known song sparrow lived to be 11 years, 4 months old.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The song sparrow is medium sized sparrow that has heavily streaked gray-brown upperparts. Its underparts are a dull white that includes a dark central breast spot with thick streaks. Its head has brown crown, paler median stripe, pale gray eyebrow, white chin and a dark brown moustache stripe. It has rust-brown wings and a tail that is long and usually tinged rust-brown. The Channel Islands song sparrow has longer feet, a longer tail and wings, and is also grayer.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Channel Islands song sparrow is limited to San Miguel and Santa Rosa Island. It is also a transient visitor in the spring and fall to Anacapa Island. It was a former resident of Santa Barbara Island where it was driven to extinction by predation (cats) and habitat destruction brought about by introduced rabbits.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The song sparrow is distributed widely in North America and occur in many different habitat types, most often inhabiting shrubs on moist ground near freshwater, saltwater or coastline. On San Miguel the song sparrow has been found to be most abundant in areas with dense shrubs, and unlike on the mainland, were found in areas well-removed from water, perhaps due to the availability of considerable fog-moisture on San Miguel. Song sparrow use of Santa Rosa habitats was also not tied to water availability. Song sparrows utilized riparian areas but did not prefer them. They strongly selected for coastal sage scrub and grassland, while avoiding chaparral, woodland and pine habitat types.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The song sparrowforages on the ground, in shrubs or in very shallow water. Anecdotal observations from San Miguel Island suggest that its diet is similar to that of song sparrows on the mainland. The year-round diet of song sparrows in California is composed of 21% insects and 79% plant. Insects, such as beetles, caterpillars, bees, ants and wasps, true bugs, and flies. These are an important component of the diet in the spring, when animal prey make up 71% of overall diet versus 3% in September The song sparrow also eats crustaceans and mollusks on the coast.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Song sparrows at San Miguel construct compact, open nest bowls of twigs, herbs, parts of shrubs, weed stems, grass stems, and dry leaves deep, which they line with fine grasses or leave unlined. The nest is typically constructed deep within the nest plant, where they are concealed by the pro­tective canopy from island fox predation. This subspecies also tends to build heavier nests and locate them on the leeward side of a shrub because of the winds. 6The female lays two to six red brown marked, pale green eggs are laid in a cup nest 2 to 4 feet above the ground. Incubation ranges from 12 to 14 days and is carried out by the female who raises up to three broods per season. Both parents are involved in feeding the nestlings that remain in the nest from 9 to 12 days.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Channel Islands song sparrow is listed by the State of California as a Species of Special Concern. In addition, the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service lists it under the heading of Birds of Conservation Concern.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/song_sparrow/lifehistory\">All About Birds</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Sparrow\">Wikipedia</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=19000\">Comrack, Lyann A. and Randi J.

However, sometimes you can see some characteristics of both species on one tree.<br /> <br /> For many years, new pines were unable to gain a foothold because of overgrazing by sheep. With the removal of nonnative sheep by 2001 and the nonnative pigs by 2007, there has been significant regeneration of this pine forest.<br /> <br /> Other trees that are occasionally interspersed within this pine community include: island ironwood ( <strong>Lynothamnus floribundus ssp. aspleniifolius</strong> ), coast live oak ( <strong>Quercus agrifolia</strong> ), and island oak ( <strong>Q. tomentella</strong> ). The Bishop pine community also includes many commonly associated understory species such as chamise, coyote brush, globe lantern, toyon, smooth mouse ears, island deerweed, island monkeyflower, chaparral current, poison oak, canyon sunflower, and the rare island barberry.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island pines and bishop pines, like some of the Channel Islands' chaparral species, are adapted to coexist with fire. Mature trees may succumb to a blaze, but the cones they produce typically remain closed until fire opens them and disperses their seeds, allowing stands to quickly regenerate in the nutrient rich soil. Aging and heat exposure may also open the cones occasionally, but without fire regeneration the rate is slow.</p>",

Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.</strong></em></p> <p><br /> <u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash on Anacapa</strong><br /> Archeological evidence suggests that the native Chumash people were visiting Anacapa Island as long as 5,000 years ago. Abalone and mussel shells, bones from fish, birds, and pinnipeds, and human artifacts such as bone tools, shell beads, projectile points, and fish hooks all suggest extensive human activity on the island. Due to the absence of fresh water on the island, it is likely that seasonal camps were used for fishing and other activities.<br /> <br /> Despite the lack of archeological evidence of permanent settlements on the island, Chumash legend holds that the American Indian population of the Channel Islands began on Anacapa. In the early 20th century, anthropologist John Harrington extensively interviewed a Mission San Buenaventura Chumash man named Fernando Librado who told Harrington a story passed on orally through generations of Chumash Indians. According to the story, eight families traveled to Anacapa Island after a civil war on the mainland and settled on the north side of the middle island. For water, they dug a hole and used seepage at Indian Cave on West Anacapa. After a time, the eight families left Anacapa for Santa Cruz Island, eventually spreading to all the northern islands.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word <strong>Michumash</strong> , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using <strong>tomols</strong> . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by <strong>yop</strong> , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the <strong>tomol</strong> ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the <strong>tomol</strong> allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. <strong> 'Achum</strong> , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the <strong> tomol</strong> by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.sbnature.org/collections-research/anthropology/chumash-life/\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.santaynezchumash.org/chumash-history\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p><strong>Hutash</strong> , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> was married to the <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. <strong>Limuw</strong> was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy <strong>Hutash</strong> . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, <strong>Hutash</strong> had the idea of making a bridge out of a <strong>wishtoyo</strong> (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on <strong>Limuw</strong> all the way to <strong>Tzchimoos</strong> , the tall mountain near <strong>Mishopshno</strong> (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. <strong>Hutash</strong> felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students</em> . Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called <strong>tomols</strong> , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called <strong>yop</strong> . <strong>Yop</strong> is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The <strong>tomol</strong> is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the <strong>Brotherhood of the Tomol</strong> . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built <strong>Helek</strong> , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of <strong> tomol</strong> construction. It was the first <strong>tomol</strong> built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long <strong>tomol </strong> which they named '<strong>Elye'wun</strong> (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, '<strong>Elye'wun</strong> made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the <strong>tomol </strong> began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the <strong>tomol</strong> and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, '<strong>Elye'wun</strong> again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of <strong>Swaxil</strong> , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the <strong>tomol </strong> was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p>",

Southern California Indians would have been drawn to the island by the rich marine life surrounding the rocky shores, being able to fish, harvest shellfish and hunt pinnipeds, as well as manufacture tools.<br /> <br /> Since early European explorers did not leave any indication of landing on the island, no information about native island use or occupancy of the island has come from those sources. Although the explorers did see the small island, it did not receive much documentation. Cabrillo's chroniclers dubbed the southern islands, which included Santa Barbara, the \"other islands of San Lucas.\" Sebastian Vizcaino gave the island its name in honor of the saint whose day was December 4, the day he arrived, in 1602.<br />  </p> <p><strong><u>More Chumash History</u></strong></p> <b>Chumash on the Channel Islands</b><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word <strong>Michumash</strong> , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <b>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</b><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using <strong>tomols</strong> . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by <strong>yop</strong> , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the <strong>tomol</strong> ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the <strong>tomol</strong> allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. <strong> 'Achum</strong> , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the <strong> tomol</strong> by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <b>Missionization</b><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <b>Contemporary Chumash</b><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br /> <br /> <b>Limuw: A Story of Place</b><br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> was married to the <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. <strong>Limuw</strong> was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy <strong>Hutash</strong> . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, <strong>Hutash</strong> had the idea of making a bridge out of a <strong>wishtoyo</strong> (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on <strong>Limuw</strong> all the way to <strong>Tzchimoos</strong> , the tall mountain near <strong>Mishopshno</strong> (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. <strong>Hutash</strong> felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students</em> . Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br /> <br /> <b>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</b><br /> Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called <strong>tomols</strong> , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called <strong>yop</strong> . <strong>Yop</strong> is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The <strong>tomol</strong> is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the <strong>Brotherhood of the Tomol</strong> . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built <strong>Helek</strong> , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of <strong> tomol</strong> construction. It was the first <strong>tomol</strong> built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long <strong>tomol </strong> which they named <strong>'Elye'wun</strong> (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, <strong>'</strong><strong>Elye'wun</strong> made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the <strong>tomol </strong> began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the <strong>tomol</strong> and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, <strong>'</strong><strong>Elye'wun</strong> again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of <strong>Swaxil</strong> , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual <strong>tomol </strong> crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the <strong>tomol </strong> was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.<br /> <br />   <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "If you are standing on the steps, with the dock platform on your left, facing the water, you are looking into a small cove, surrounded by a steep, rocky slopes. At the shoreline, the slopes extended into flatter ledges that are often occupied by pinnipeds-furry, tan, torpedo-shaped sea mammals. Here, the pinnipeds usually include sea lions and much larger elephant seals. They all have dog-like heads, but tiny or barely visible ears, and make loud barking sounds. The sea lions have large flippers, and are more agile on land. The elephant seals have short flippers and short snouts on their heads. The pinnipeds are also often seen swimming and diving in the waters of the cove. Just offshore is a small sea rock, which often has more pinnipeds lounging about. <br /><br />To your left is the tall dock. It is supported by sturdy, upright posts, with some additional planks crossed like an \"x\" in between them. The dock's wooden platform is about 20 feet above the waterline. A wooden railing surrounds the edge of the platform. In the center of the platform is a single story building roofed with curved red clay tiles. The building has two small windows under the eaves of the roof. Two doors open onto the platform, facing the cove. Close to the edge of the platform is a large mechanical device. A rounded column about 3 feet in diameter and 5 feet high is bolted to the platform. On top of this is a giant hinge, like a shoulder, with a long metal arm extending outward. A spool of black cable is visible on top of the giant hinge. Various small boxes and other equipment are also located on the dock.<br /><br />Behind you, stairs, with a railing, continue up a steep, rocky hillside covered with grasses and scrubby plants. Depending on the season, you may see coreopsis, with a thick, bare trunk, topped by a shaggy mop of yellow flowers and feathery green leaves, shaped like fluffy ostrich feathers and yarrow with mounds of white flowers.<br /><br />In late summer, fall or winter, the grass will be brown, and the coreopsis will turn into waist-high brown stalks that look dead. <br /><br />At the top of the stairs, the path continues as a dirt trail. The climb from the landing cove to the ranger station is about 200 feet along a Â¼ mile trail.<br />",

According to the story, eight families traveled to Anacapa Island after a civil war on the mainland and settled on the north side of the middle island.

Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word <strong>Michumash</strong> , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <b>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</b><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using <strong>tomols</strong> . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by <strong>yop</strong> , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the <strong>tomol</strong> ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the <strong>tomol</strong> allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. <strong> 'Achum</strong> , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the <strong> tomol</strong> by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <b>Missionization</b><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <b>Contemporary Chumash</b><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park.

They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> was married to the <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. <strong>Limuw</strong> was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy <strong>Hutash</strong> . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, <strong>Hutash</strong> had the idea of making a bridge out of a <strong>wishtoyo</strong> (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on <strong>Limuw</strong> all the way to <strong>Tzchimoos</strong> , the tall mountain near <strong>Mishopshno</strong> (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. <strong>Hutash</strong> felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students .</em> Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br /> <br /> <br /> <b>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</b><br /> Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called <strong>tomols</strong> , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called <strong>yop</strong> . <strong>Yop</strong> is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The <strong>tomol</strong> is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the <strong>Brotherhood of the Tomol</strong> . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built <strong>Helek</strong> , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of <strong> tomol</strong> construction. It was the first <strong>tomol</strong> built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long <strong>tomol </strong> which they named <strong>'Elye'wun</strong> (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, <strong>'Elye'wun</strong> made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the <strong>tomol </strong> began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the <strong>tomol</strong> and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, <strong>'Elye'wun</strong> again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of <strong>Swaxil</strong> , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual <strong>tomol </strong> crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the <strong>tomol </strong> was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.<br /> <br />   <p> </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Historical records have proven that Chumash people made permanent settlements on San Miguel Island, although archeological remains of a village have not been found. One chronicler of the Cabrillo expedition wrote that local natives called the island <strong>Ciquimuymu</strong> , with two villages named <strong>Cico</strong> and <strong>Nimollollo</strong> . Accepted Chumash knowledge notes the island being called <strong>Tuqan</strong> , with the same name applied to its largest town that was probably located at Cuyler Harbor. A smaller settlement named <strong>Niwoyonmi</strong> has not been located. The occupants of this island would have experienced harsher climatic conditions than their neighbors on Santa Rosa or Santa Cruz islands; there were few locations that afforded good shelter, although water was available. Archeologists considered that the more intense conditions on the island likely spurred the San Miguel Chumash into extensive trade, especially with people on the mainland east of Goleta. San Miguel's occupants also had strong ties with those of Santa Rosa Island.<br /> <br /> Humans settled San Miguel Island at a very early date, as evidenced by evaluation of archeological materials found at Daisy Cave and other sites along the coastline. Preliminary results from excavations at Daisy Cave indicate a society reliant on the sea for sustenance, and one that had adapted through the development of technologies considered to be the earliest examples known in the New World, including the use of fishhooks and line. Fish bones from Daisy Cave have been dated as up to 11,500 years old, suggesting that the island was occupied as early as its neighbor, Santa Rosa Island; together (the four northern islands were one large island during this early period) these would represent perhaps the oldest known settlement in the region.<br /> <br /> As with the occupants of the other Channel Islands, the combination of pressures from the mainland missions, disruption of their trade and subsistence activities and invasions by European hunters eventually caused the Chumash to vacate the island, reportedly as early as 1816. However, the exact date when the last Chumash occupants of San Miguel Island were removed or left is not known. Fernando Librado, J. P. Harrington's Chumash informant, claimed that many people were killed in a fierce storm at the time of removal from the island, but the story has not been substantiated.<br /> <br /> The Chumash presence on San Miguel Island is today represented in the archeological record. Many important discoveries have been made indicating early habitation and technological innovation. Further investigations will lead to a better understanding of the social structure, subsistence and technology of the island residents and their relationships with mainlanders and other islanders.<br /> <br /> The earliest descriptions of the island Chumash culture and the first historical documentation of contact activities are found in the accounts of the various explorers who traveled in the region between 1542 and 1603. Cabrillo's chronicler Juan Paez de Castro wrote about San Miguel Island: \"Wednesday, the 25th October 1542], they left these islands, that is, the one farthest to windward, which has a very good port inside which no bad effects will be felt in any kind of sea weather. Paez mentioned the Chumash names for the island which they had apparently learned from the friendly occupants. Antonio de Herrera wrote in 1615, \"In the eight days they were at this port they were well treated by the Indians, who go naked and have their faces painted in a checkerboard fashion.\"<br /> <br /> Returning to San Miguel Island after exploring northward on the coast, Cabrillo's party hauled out their <em>frigata San Miguel</em> at Cuyler Harbor to recaulk and repair planking. Either here or on another island the fleet wintered; debate continues whether the long-accepted location of San Miguel Island is accurate. Nevertheless, the Chumash were not as welcoming this time. Francisco de Vargas recalled in 1560: \"With the natives of this island he had some great fights as they came out in a warlike manner. During all the time the fleet was at the Island Capitana the Indians never stopped fighting.\"<br /> <br /> Direct contacts with the island were few after Cabrillo's fateful voyage. Vizcaíno had contact with island Chumash in 1602, as his chronicler wrote: \"At dawn the captain's ship was near an island [San Miguel] in the shelter of which it was calm. A canoe came out with two Indians and a small boy, their eyes being painted with antimony. They asked us to go to their land; however, there was such a heavy sea and the island presented so many shoals that we did not dare to go to it, but veered out to sea . . . \"<br /> <br /> <u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><b>Chumash on the Channel Islands</b></p> <p>Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years.

    "audioDescription": "From the middle of the Nidever Canyon, if you are facing down toward the ocean, you will be facing north. A narrow one-mile trail is carved into the steep canyon wall, leading to Cuyler Harbor Beach below. Along some parts of the trail, wooden planks are laid into the dry ground, creating steps. At the base of the canyon are large sand dunes that give way to the beach below. Prince Island can be seen in the distance. It is tall and rocky, with a plateau on top. Behind you, the trail leads up to the Cabrillo Monument, the campground, and the ranger station. <br /><br />The hillsides along Nidever Canyon Trail are covered with a large variety of flowering plants. Dudleya, a succulent with thick grey-green leaves clustered in a rose shape, an inch or two high. Red stems rise up from these clusters, topped by yellow rounded flowers about four inches tall. <br />Coreopsis, with a thick, bare trunk, is topped by a spray of yellow, daisy-like flowers, and feathery green leaves, shaped like fluffy ostrich feathers, in the spring. During drier seasons, the plant appears dead, as the top withers into a shaggy, brittle, brown mop of dried leaves.<br />Island buckwheat, with soft grey-green rounded leaves and, in season, clusters of button-like yellow flowers. Non-native grasses also grow in the canyon. Water is almost always present in the bottom of the canyon. Depending on the time of your visit, there is also a seasonal waterfall. Landbirds are often seen here. <br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>Archeological investigations indicate that Santa Cruz Island has been occupied for at least 9,000 years. The island was home to the largest population of island Chumash and developed a highly complex society dependent on marine harvest, craft specialization and trade with mainland groups. The Santa Cruz Island Chumash produced shell beads that they used for currency, which formed an important part of the overall Chumash economy. Those living on the east end of the island mined chert from the numerous island outcroppings to make tiny blades for drilling holes to make the shell disc beads. Native villagers had no known contact with outsiders until the 16th and early 17th centuries. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who is credited with the first European exploration of the California coast, named the island San Lucas, although the Chumash called it <strong>limuw</strong> . Cabrillo observed at least six villages, though he and his crew never stopped at the island. Research has shown that there were 11 historical villages and one seasonal encampment. They were called:<br /> <br /> swaxǝɬ or swaxil<br /> This means 'East End Anchorage,' but this translation was surely descriptive. Fernando Librado also said \"it means something like dermadero.\" (sic) A derramadero is a 'wash or spillway.'<br /> <br /> kaxas or xaxas<br /> This means, 'the sand.'<br /> <br /> maštšal or mashchal<br /> This means 'crystalline,' adding that, 'when it rains puddles of water remain; or you can see yourself in the water, as in a looking glass.'<br /> <br /> tš̓ǝšǝ (tš’ǝšǝ) or ch’ishi <br /> This means a clam species called in Spanish, almejas chilones.<br /> <br /> lalale pr l’alale<br /> This name is derived from the Cruzeño word for 'west,' lale.<br /> <br /> tlaqayam̓u or l’akayamu <br /> This means, 'on top, of some mountain or hill.' It was likely a temporary village at harvest time.<br /> <br /> tš̓ološǝš (tš’ološǝš) or ch’oloshush <br /> This means a group of sea birds.'<br /> <br /> šawa or shawa<br /> This means, 'stranger, or emigrant.' It’s possible this meaning is not a translation, but harkens to the story of emigrations from šawa to the mainland and back.<br /> <br /> liyam<br /> The root of this word -yam-, means 'to descend or go down.' This refers to the creeks coming down and funneling into a bigger creek.<br /> <br /> nanawani<br /> This means 'sky/up/above.'<br /> <br /> lu’upš or lu’upsh<br /> This word means 'put it in.' It is thought that it must refer to a small bay, inferring it was a landing place for canoes.<br /> <br /> nimatlala<br /> The meaning of this name is uncertain. nimatlala did not appear in the mission baptismals, leading archealogists to consider it a seasonal encampment with the populace associated with kaxas.<br /> <br /> <br /> <b>Limuw: A Story of Place</b><br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> was married to the <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. <strong>Limuw</strong> was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy <strong>Hutash</strong> . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, <strong>Hutash</strong> had the idea of making a bridge out of a <strong>wishtoyo</strong> (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on <strong>Limuw</strong> all the way to <strong>Tzchimoos</strong> , the tall mountain near <strong>Mishopshno</strong> (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. <strong>Hutash</strong> felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <strong>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students</strong> . Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.</p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><b>Chumash on the Channel Islands</b><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word <strong>Michumash</strong> , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <b>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</b><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using <strong>tomols</strong> . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by <strong>yop</strong> , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the <strong>tomol</strong> ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the <strong>tomol</strong> allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. <strong> 'Achum</strong> , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the <strong> tomol</strong> by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <b>Missionization</b><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <b>Contemporary Chumash</b><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br /> <br /> <b>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</b><br /> Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called <strong>tomols</strong> , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called <strong>yop</strong> . <strong>Yop</strong> is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The <strong>tomol</strong> is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the <strong>Brotherhood of the Tomol</strong> . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built <strong>Helek</strong> , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of <strong> tomol</strong> construction. It was the first <strong>tomol</strong> built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long <strong>tomol </strong> which they named '<strong>Elye'wun</strong> (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, '<strong>Elye'wun</strong> made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island.

Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the <strong>tomol</strong> and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, '<strong>Elye'wun</strong> again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of <strong>Swaxil</strong> , now known as Scorpion Valley.

The age of the Arlington remains and a host of archeological sites on the Channel Islands that date to the late Holocene (10,000-6,500 years before present) indicate an early migration route from the Old World into North America along the West Coast.<br /> <br /> Santa Rosa Island and the other Channel Islands provided rich resources for seafaring peoples to thrive by hunting seabirds, sea mammals, fish and shellfish. With extensive trade networks on the mainland, the island Chumash were able to trade marine resources with mainland peoples for goods they could not harvest or produce on the island. With plentiful food and fresh water, the island supported several villages at the time of European contact.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo sailed up the coast of California in 1542, the first European to visit the Channel Islands, and documented three villages on Santa Rosa Island. A half-century later, Sebastian Rodriguez CermeÃ±o wrote about his interaction with the Chumash on the south side of the island on December 13, 1595, as he sailed southward along the coast: \"...and there came alongside a small boat like a canoe, with two Indians in it rowing. And having arrived at the launch, they brought some eighteen fish and a seal and gave them to us, for which we gave them some pieces of taffeta and cotton cloth in order that they should bring more. They went on shore and returned in the same boat with three Indians and brought nothing, At this island we went fishing with lines and caught some thirty fishlike cabrillas sea bass], which we soon ate on account of our great hunger....On both [Santa Rosa Island and Santa Cruz Island] the land is bare and sterile, although inhabited by Indians, there are no ports or coves in them in which to take shelter.\"<br /> <br /> The historical villages included:<br /> hitšǝwǝn or hichimin<br /> It was call this because the Chumash had to carry water in vessels on their head.<br /> <br /> qʰšiwqʰšiw or qshiwqshiw<br />  Means 'where there’s a lot of crap.'

Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <b>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</b><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using <strong>tomols</strong> . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by <strong>yop</strong> , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the <strong>tomol</strong> ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the <strong>tomol</strong> allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. <strong> 'Achum</strong> , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the <strong> tomol</strong> by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <b>Missionization</b><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <b>Contemporary Chumash</b><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> <a href=\"https://www.sbnature.org/collections-research/anthropology/chumash-life/\">- Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.santaynezchumash.org/chumash-history\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br /> <br /> <br /> <b>Limuw: A Story of Place</b><br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> was married to the <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. <strong>Limuw</strong> was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy <strong>Hutash</strong> . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, <strong>Hutash</strong> had the idea of making a bridge out of a <strong>wishtoyo</strong> (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on <strong>Limuw</strong> all the way to <strong>Tzchimoos</strong> , the tall mountain near <strong>Mishopshno</strong> (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. <strong>Hutash</strong> felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students .</em> Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br /> <br /> <br /> <b>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</b><br /> Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called <strong>tomols</strong> , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called <strong>yop</strong> . <strong>Yop</strong> is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The <strong>tomol</strong> is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the <strong>Brotherhood of the Tomol</strong> . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built <strong>Helek</strong> , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of <strong> tomol</strong> construction. It was the first <strong>tomol</strong> built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long <strong>tomol </strong> which they named '<strong>Elye'wun</strong> (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, '<strong>Elye'wun</strong> made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the <strong>tomol </strong> began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the <strong>tomol</strong> and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, '<strong>Elye'wun</strong> again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of <strong>Swaxil</strong> , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual <strong>tomol </strong> crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the <strong>tomol </strong> was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p> <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The wooden plank pier, that connects the dock to the island, is 650 feet long and 20 feet wide. At the land end of the pier, on either side, is a steep sandy-colored rocky ridge with eroded gullies and a sandy beach below. The cliff surface varies from top to bottom. Embedded in the top area are random clumps of cobble-sized stones. On the lower part of the cliff are layers of horizontal ridges, like the wavy edge of a stack of pancakes.<br /><br />On the south side, 18 wooden steps with railings lead downward. At the bottom step, there is a ladder, that you can climb down to reach the sandy beach. <br /><br />At the end of the pier, a dirt road continues upward, cutting through the cliff to the top of the plateau.<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>Before European settlement, the high, fog-drenched ridge that dominates central Santa Rosa Island was covered with a \"Cloud Forest\"—a forest of tall oak and pine groves growing out of a cover of shorter chaparral plants, named for the fog that it needs to survive. The trees and plants here harvest water from the heavy fog that regularly rolls across the island and condenses on leaves and twigs, eventually dripping to the ground like rain. Each piece of the cloud forest is integral to its survival: the fog waters the plants, the trees shelter the chaparral shrubs, and the chaparral plants act as a nursery for the trees –they form a deep, moist, and shady leaf litter bed so that acorns and other seeds can sprout and grow. It is the chaparral plants that form the backbone of this relationship, by allowing bigger trees to establish themselves, helping those trees to reproduce and spread, and protecting those trees from eroding soil.</p> <p>However, beginning in the mid-1800s, grazing by non-native animals like sheep, feral pigs, cattle, horses, deer, and elk eliminated most of this cloud forest, along with over 75% of the entire island's native vegetation. When Santa Rosa Island became a part of Channel Islands National Park efforts began to encourage the recovery of native vegetation, beginning with the removal of all non-native grazing animals. The recovery that has followed these actions has been remarkable. Many native plants are now spreading beyond the canyon walls and cliffs where they remained protected from grazing for over 150 years, reestablishing themselves throughout the island.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Santa Rosa Island's cloud forests are not recovering. The areas where they were once found have become too harsh for the chaparral plants that protected and nourished the oak and pine trees to reestablish themselves. Grazing animals stripped the soil down to bedrock, creating deep, barren gulleys that are prone to extreme wind and water erosion. Without the chaparral shrubs, stands of ancient island oaks, which grow nowhere else in the world except on the California Channel Islands, are having the soil and bedrock worn away around them by winds of up to 50 mph. Once their roots are exposed, sometimes to depths of 5 feet, these trees topple, leaving behind more barren ground where acorns and other seeds find no moist nursery in which to grow.</p> <p>Now that the grazing animals have been removed from the island, we have an opportunity to help this amazing environment fully recover. To restore the chaparral and, ultimately, the cloud forest, the US Geological Survey is working closely with Channel Islands National Park and other collaborators to do what the absent chaparral cannot, in order to start the recovery cycle: slow wind and water erosion, trap leaf litter on the ground, collect native seeds, and harvest fog with artificial structures to water plants grown in the island nursery.</p> <p>The details of these restoration efforts include:</p> <ul> <li>Pinning natural fiber wattles along slope contours to slow wind and water erosion at the ground surface</li> <li>Placing rock bags on steep bedrock slopes where anchoring wattles is not possible because of the hard rock.</li> <li>Making check-dams and rock groins in gulleys to slow water, collect sediment, and fill in the ditches</li> <li>Rehabilitating roads to stop erosion</li> <li>Stretching fences across the ground near oaks to trap blowing leaves and tumbling seeds</li> <li>Collecting native seeds and growing them in the island nursery</li> <li>Planting seedlings with the wattles so that their roots can bind sediment into the soil</li> <li>Starting a pine and scrub-oak forest upwind of the island oaks for a windbreak</li> <li>Putting \"fog fences\" –wire fences covered with fabric –around plants to drip water to the ground around them</li> <li>Harvesting and storing fog water in tanks on the ridge to use in the restoration work</li> <li>Monitoring progress by surveying sedimentation and litter build-up in plots along t</li> </ul>",

While a number of other lights had been placed in isolated and dangerous locations, Anacapa enjoyed a combination of isolation and danger with reasonable proximity to civilization. For instance, the wife of assistant keeper Rex Coursey fell and seriously injured herself in 1934. Radio calls for help were met with a response from the battleship California that was nearby. The ship rapidly appeared, Mrs. Coursey was lowered to the landing and taken to the mainland. The quick response saved her life, according to doctors at the hospital.<br /> <br /> With its new residences and equipment, life at Anacapa could be better than many other stations that typically had 19th century buildings and infrastructure. The complex resembled a neighborhood, with houses flanking a central road that led to the utility buildings and lighthouse. A photograph taken in 1951 showed the \"Main Street\" lined with rocks painted white and neat fences around the residences. Typically, six men lived at the station, some with families. During the Coast Guard years, a man typically made a two-year tour of duty, moving on to another assignment at the end of the Anacapa tour. The stucco mission revival houses could be found on any suburban California street except for the distance from a shopping center.<br /> <br /> For more information, visit the Anacapa Island <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/self-guided-tour-start.htm\">Self-guided Tour Introduction and Lighthouse Complex</a>.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Delphinus Capensis</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Common dolphins can be split into two groups long and short beaked. Both groups are found throughout the world’s oceans and share similar behavioral characteristics such as jumping and surfing the bow waves of vessels. However, the long beaked dolphins, delphinus capensis, are more commonly seen near coastal areas.. Both forms have a dark gray dorsal surface with a lighter hourglass pattern on their sides, and white undersides.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Common dolphins are one of the most numerous cetaceans in the world, with a population that is estimated to be over one million. <sup>2</sup></li> <li>Until recently, the long-beaked common dolphin was not considered a valid species, (and was grouped with the short-beaked dolphin) however, in 1994, it was demonstrated that it is indeed a valid species. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>These dolphins have an estimated lifespan of approximately 40 years. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>Long-beaked common dolphins are gregarious. Schools range from less than ten to several thousand. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Hybrids between this species and common bottlenose dolphins have been born in captivity.3</li> <li>Long-beaked common dolphins have more teeth than any other species of dolphin <sup>5</sup></li> <li>The species name capensis refers to the Cape of Good Hope. <sup>5</sup></li> <li>Long-beaked common dolphins are capable of diving to at least 900 feet and holding their breath for up to 8 minutes to feed on prey. <sup>5</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> As described by the FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World, “The common dolphin is a moderately slender animal (although some offshore animals are rather stocky) with a medium to long beak and a tall, slightly falcate dorsal fin. Common dolphins are strikingly marked, with a dark brownish grey back, white belly, and tan to ochre anterior flank patch. This flank patch dips below the dorsal fin and combines with streaks of light grey on the tail stock to produce the species’ most characteristic feature, an hourglass pattern on the side. The lips are dark, and there is a stripe running from the apex of the melon to encircle the eye. There is also a black to dark grey chin-to flipper stripe, and sometimes a thinner stripe running towards the area of the anus. There are 40 to 61 small pointed teeth per row. <sup>1</sup><br /> <br /> Common dolphins are highly geographically variable and many regional forms have been described. In several parts of the world, two types of common dolphins appear to exist: a long-beaked coastal type (generally with a muted color pattern), and an offshore type with a shorter beak (the latter comprises several stocks in the eastern tropical Pacific). Recent research indicates that these two types represent separate species. <sup>1,3</sup> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> According to NOAA’s Office of Protected Resources, The long-beaked common dolphin has a restricted distribution in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. Long-beaked common dolphins are commonly found along the U.S. west coast, from Baja California (including the Gulf of California) northward to about central California. Distinct populations can be found off the coasts of California and Mexico, South America (Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina) -- The abundance and distribution of this species may change with varying oceanographic conditions. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Long-beaked common dolphins generally prefer shallow, tropical, subtropical and warmer temperate waters closer to the coast, usually within 50-100 nautical miles and on the continental shelf. <sup>5 </sup>These parameters of adaptation for this species make the Southern California Bight and ideal fit.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Long-beaked common dolphins are capable of diving to at least 900 feet and holding their breath for up to 8 minutes to feed on prey. The NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources states that the majority of their diet consists of small schooling fish such as anchovies and sardines. Krill and cephalopods (e.g., squid) also comprise and important part of their diet. Dolphin groups may work together to herd schools of prey. This species has 47-67 pairs of small sharp conical teeth in each jaw used for grasping prey. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> As stated in Marine Mammals of the World, in a 2008 publication by Jefferson, T. A, M. A. Webber, and R. L. Pitman, Long-beaked common dolphins become sexually mature at around 6.5 feet in length. Breeding usually takes place between the spring and autumn, followed by a 10-11 month. gestation period. Females give birth to a single calf that is about 2.5-3 feet long and weighs about 20 lbs, and have an estimated calving interval of 1-3 years. <sup>1, 5</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The long-beaked common dolphin is covered by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (IUCN), states that although the species is widespread and its aggregate abundance probably numbers in the high tens or low hundreds of thousands, in several areas (most notably West Africa, the east and west coasts of South America and East Asia) there are known incidental and directed takes of unknown, but possibly large, magnitude, making it difficult to make a reliable assessment of the impact on the species. Therefore, the Long-beaked Common Dolphin is listed as Data Deficient.<sup> 6</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li>FAO Species Identification Guides: Marine Mammals of the World</li> <li><a href=\"https://channelislands.noaa.gov/\">Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.marinemammalscience.org/\">The Society for Marine Mammalogy</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/long-beaked-common-dolphin/delphinus-capensis/\">Wildscreen Arkive</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/long-beaked-common-dolphin\">NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/\">International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (IUCN),</a></li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Uria aalge californica</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> In July, 2011, researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey and National Park Service discovered that California common murre chicks had hatched for the first time since 1912 on the Channel Islands. This new nesting colony was spotted perched on the 100-foot-high sea cliffs of Prince Island-a small islet off San Miguel Island within Channel Islands National Park. Historically, common murres nested on Prince Island, but this colony disappeared nearly a century ago, likely a result of human disturbance and egg harvesting.</p> <p>Since it has been so long since the last nesting was observed here, scientists surmised that recent ocean conditions could be the reason for the re-establishment of this seabird colony. With this murre colony, Prince Island now hosts 13 nesting seabirds, making it one of the most important and biologically diverse nesting habitats on the West Coast of North America.</p> <p>Please visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/news/murre.htm\">Common Murre Press Release</a> for more information on this discovery of nesting common murres.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The common murre's breeding range on the Pacific Coast is from Alaska south to the Channel Islands National Park in Southern California.</li> <li>Common murres are silent at sea, but in flight make a soft murrr sound.</li> <li>If you see a string of black and white birds flying swiftly across the surface of the water, chances are you're seeing a \"bazaar\" or \"fragrance\" of common murres.</li> <li>Courtship displays including bowing, billing and preening. The male points its head vertically and makes croaking and growling noises to attract the females.</li> <li>The eggs vary in color and pattern to help the parents recognize them, each egg is unique.</li> <li>Common murres can fly 125 miles from the nest to find food for their chicks.</li> <li>Common murres will dive to almost 250 feet in pursuit of schools of small fish.</li> <li>When the chick is ready to fledge, the male swims below the cliff and calls out to it. The chick then hurls itself off the cliff edge and drops 800 to 1,000 feet into the ocean where it swims out to its father.</li> <li>The male stays with the chick and cares for it and feeds it until it is able to fly when it is 39-46 days old.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Common murres are football-sized seabirds with the tuxedo colors of penguins. They are about 15 to 18 inches long, with short necks and long, straight bills. The body is black above and white below with distinct summer and winter plumages. In the summer, the head and neck are black with grayish-brown wash on the crown. In the winter, the throat, cheeks and fore-neck are white, with a black line down the cheeks. The neck is short and the bill is fairly long, slender, and black. The feet are blackish. The trailing edge of the secondaries is white.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> During the breeding season, the common murre is found along the Pacific and Atlantic Coasts. On the Pacific Coast, it is found from Alaska south to California as far as the northern limit of the Channel Islands off Southern California. On the Atlantic Coast, it is found from Labrador, Canada south to New Brunswick, Canada. It winters at sea from Newfoundland, Canada south to Massachusetts on the Atlantic Coast, and from Alaska to southern California on the Pacific Coast. It is also found in Greenland and northern Europe and Asia.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Common murres favor cool ocean waters, both near and far from shore. During the breeding season they are found closer to rocky shorelines. They nest on coasts and on islands alike, provided there are cliff ledges or flat bare rocks atop sea stacks, which are steep rock formations near the coast. San Miguel Island in the Channel Islands National Park is a prime example of a breeding area that is attractive for the breeding common murre colony. Common murres are to be found after breeding season on the open ocean or in large bays.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Common murres feed entirely by pursuit-diving, and are capable of diving to depths of more than 240 feet in search of prey such as fish during breeding, and more krill and squid during winter and pre-breeding periods. Common prey species include northern anchovy, rockfish, Pacific herring, Pacific whiting and market squid. To dive, they partly extend their wings and propel themselves underwater, then snatch and carry a single fish lengthwise in their mouth, with the head of the fish held in the mouth cavity.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Common murres first breed at 4 to 5 years of age. Pairs exhibit a high degree of site and mate fidelity. Upon arrival at nest sites, they participate in courtship displays. They do not build nests. The female lays a single egg each year. Common murre eggs are pointed at one end; when pushed, they roll around in a circle, preventing them from rolling off the nesting ledge. The variation in egg color and markings allows parent murres to recognize their own eggs when they return from sea. As many as 20 pairs may incubate in one square meter. Incubation lasts about 5 weeks; both sexes incubate and feed the newly hatched chick. Often, to prevent young chicks from jumping off the ledge prematurely, adults stand between the chicks and the cliff edge. When the chick is ready to fledge, the male swims below the cliff and calls out to it. The chick then hurls itself off the cliff edge and drops as much as 800 to 1,000 feet into the ocean where it swims out to its father. On Prince Island, off of San Miguel Island in the Channel Islands National Park, the cliffs are a mere 100 feet high. At the end of the colony chick-rearing period, successful breeding males and their partly-grown chicks depart the colony. During the at-sea chick-rearing period, chicks are fed at sea until independence. Other adults (i.e., females, failed breeders, and sub-adults) also cease colony attendance once male-chick pairs have departed. The first successful chick hatching since 1912 in the Channel Island National Park was observed on July 28, 2011, on Prince Island, and islet of San Miguel Island, the northernmost island in the park.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> In California, common murres are largely resident year-round near breeding colonies, but some birds disperse to southern California in winter. Insufficient evidence is available to determine whether murres from Alaskan colonies winter in the area from southern British Columbia to California, although some Alaskan murres (especially from the Forrester Island colony) are present in northern British Columbia in summer and winter.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> A new colony of common murres is situated within Channel Islands National Park, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, and the recently designated Harris Point California Marine Protected Area. Seabird biologists will continue to evaluate the future of the common murre colony at Prince Island. Partners in this monitoring effort included the Montrose Settlements Restoration Program and the California Institute for Environmental Studies.</p> <p>Common murres are the most frequent avian victims of oil spills on the Pacific coast because of their low reproductive rate and concentrations in major shipping channels. However, murres have suffered major kills on every North American coast during past half century. In the 1988 Nestucca spill, about 30,000 murres were killed off the Washington and British Columbia coasts; in 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska killed many more. Other threats to common murres include over-fishing, gill-netting, and marine climate change. An estimated 70,000 murres were killed in gill nets in California before restrictions were imposed in 1987. Gill-netting continues today in Puget Sound.</p> <p>Pacific coast common murres experienced further heavy declines after the 1983 El Niño event, which caused warmer, less productive ocean environments. Their recovery is complicated by eagle predation and disturbance. Common Murres are highly sensitive to disturbance by humans on foot, in boats, or in planes. Washington colonies are disturbed by low-flying aircraft, especially near military bases. Hastening to fly clear of disturbances, murres knock eggs and chicks out of the nest. Unguarded chicks and eggs are easy prey for gulls and other predators.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul sizcache04325152706174546=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"109\"> <li sizcache04325152706174546=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"109\"><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li sizcache04325152706174546=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"110\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></li> <li sizcache04325152706174546=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"111\"><a href=\"http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species\">Birds of North America</a></li> <li sizcache04325152706174546=\"7\" sizset=\"112\"><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/\">The Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a></li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Corvus corax</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> This unique species, also called the northern raven, is widely distributed throughout North America, and is a permanent resident on all of the Channel Islands. Ravens are, like other corvids, among the smartest of birds, and have gained a reputation for solving ever more complicated problems invented by ever more creative scientists.This species has thrived among people for centuries and today even resides in cities such as Los Angeles. On the Channel Islands ravens have increased in recent years, perhaps because they have opportunistically taken advantage of novel food resources</p> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong> <ul> <li>Common ravens can mimic the calls of other bird species. When raised in captivity, they can even imitate human words;one common raven raised from birth was taught to mimic the word \"nevermore.\"<br />  </li> <li>Common ravens are smart, which makes them dangerous predators. They sometimes work in pairs to raid seabird colonies, with one bird distracting an incubating adult and the other waiting to grab an egg or chick as soon as it's uncovered.<br />  </li> <li>Native people of the Pacific Northwest regard the raven as an incurable trickster, bringing fire to people by stealing it from the sun, and stealing salmon only to drop them in rivers all over the world.<br />  </li> <li>Breeding pairs of common ravens hold territories and try to exclude all other ravens throughout the year.<br />  </li> <li>Young ravens finding a carcass will call other ravens to the prize. They apparently do this to overwhelm the local territory owners by force of numbers to gain access to the food.<br />  </li> <li>The oldest known wild common raven lived to be 17 years 2 months old.</li> </ul> <br /> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Common ravens are entirely black, right down to the legs, eyes, and beak. The raven is not just large but massive, with a thick neck, shaggy throat feathers, and a Bowie knife of a beak. In flight, ravens have long, wedge-shaped tails. They're more slender than crows, with longer, narrower wings, and longer, thinner “fingers” at the wingtips.<br />   <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> This species of common raven, aka northern raven, is found year-round on the Channel Islands, however, it is highly adaptive and found in far North America, as well as in the Arctic Circle. It also inhabits very high elevations in very cold climes.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The park’s ecological monitoring program detected increases in raven populations on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands in the past two decades. 4 Both increases may be due to the ability of ravens to capitalize on novel food resources. The increase on Santa Rosa may be tied to the availability of deer and elk carcasses, when those non-native ungulates were hunted as part of a commercial hunt operation. Ravens on San Miguel began taking advantage of pinniped carcasses made available in the early 1990s due to mortality by hookworms, and that may have fueled their increase on that island.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Common ravens occur over most of the Northern Hemisphere in nearly any habitat (eastern forests and the open Great Plains are exceptions). These include coniferous and deciduous forests, beaches, islands, chaparral, sagebrush, mountains, desert, grasslands, agricultural fields, tundra, and ice floes. They do well around human habitations including farms, rural settlements and isolated houses. In larger towns they are often replaced by American crows, although they do occur in some cities including Los Angeles. Human presence has allowed ravens to expand into areas where they didn’t previously occur, such as using artificial ponds and irrigation to survive in deserts and living on human garbage in some forests. Common ravens are slowly moving back into the forests of the northeastern United States and Canada as those forests regenerate.The raven is also a permanent resident of all of the Channel Islands.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Common ravens are omnivorous and highly opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity.<sup> </sup>Common ravens will eat almost anything they can get hold of. They eat carrion; small animals from the size of mice and baby tortoises up to adult rock pigeons and nestling great blue herons; eggs; grasshoppers, beetles, scorpions, and other arthropods; fish; wolf and sled-dog dung; grains, buds, and berries; pet food; and many types of human food including unattended picnic items and garbage.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Common ravens build their nests on cliffs, in trees, and on structures such as power-line towers, telephone poles, billboards, and bridges. Cliff nests are usually under a rock overhang. Tree nests tend to be in a crotch high in the tree, but below the canopy and typically farther down in a tree than a crow’s nest would be.</p> <p> </p> <p>Juveniles begin to court at a very early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key behaviors of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.</p> <p>Breeding pairs must have a territory of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles</p> <p> </p> <p>In most of their range, egg laying begins in late February. Females lay between three to seven pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. However, the male may stand or crouch over the young, sheltering but not actually brooding them. Young fledge at 35 to 42 days, and are fed by both parents. They stay with their parents for another six months after fledging.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion. The population trend appears to be increasing, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion. The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size. For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.avianweb.com/commonravens.html\">http://www.avianweb.com/commonravens.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17657\">https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17657</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Common_Raven/id\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Common_Raven/id</a></li> <li>Coonan, t.J., R.C.

The plant's brittle, seemingly lifeless stems are easily damaged or broken. Anacapa's isolation and the absence of large animals that might trample them protect coreopsis during this dormancy.<br /> <br /> Native plants found in association with coreopsis include island morning glory, gumplant, Indian pink, and golden yarrow. Please be careful to stay on the designated path and not disturb or walk on the island vegetation.<br />  </p> <p><strong><u>Drought</u></strong><br /> The 2010s drought in California has had a huge impact on the coreopsis. Without adequate rainfall many of the islands' coreopsis has died off or been blown over in strong winds. Once the rains return, seedlings will sprout and the coreopsis forest will begin to grow again.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>More Native Plants</strong></u><br /> With the islands never being connected to the mainland, plants, seeds, and spores over millions of years were carried from the mainland by ocean currents, wind, and birds or in the fur of animals that reached the islands. Due to continuous isolation from the mainland, many plant communities on the islands are unique, including the absence of some common mainland species and the presence of many island endemics (species that grow naturally only on one or more of the Channel Islands).<br /> <br /> Since the Chumash did not practice agriculture, they used native plants as a primary source of food and medicine. Native plants also provided important construction materials for canoes, houses, bows, arrows, nets, baskets, beds, clothing, footwear, ornaments, and a variety of other items used in daily life.<br /> <br /> With nonnative iceplant now removed, many native plants are starting to recover and reestablishing themselves throughout the island. Take time to look carefully and you should see some of the following species.<br /> <br /> <strong>Monkey Flower</strong><br /> Monkey flower is common in chaparral throughout California. Known as \"sticky\" monkey flower because the deep green leaves secrete a gluey substance, they bloom from January to May and were named for the monkey face that sometimes can be seen within the orange to pale yellow flowers. The island endemic species differs from the mainland species in the lack of sticky leaves and its bright red flowers.<br /> <br /> <strong>Lemonade Berry</strong><br /> Lemonade berry is a shrub with thick, leathery leaves. The Chumash would steep the sticky, lemon-tasting berries in water to make juice, or they would suck on them like candy. One should be careful, however, since lemonade berry belongs to the same family as poison oak and can trigger a skin rash in those sensitive to it.<br /> <br /> <strong>Coastal Prickly Pear</strong><br /> The coastal prickly pear is a cactus that blooms in May and June, producing a shiny yellow flower with dense layers of petals. The plant's shallow root system spreads over a wide area to extract maximum moisture while its sharp spines reflect the sun and wind to help protect the plant from deyhydration.<br /> <br /> The Chumash harvested the sweet prickly pear fruit and used its beet-red juice as a paint and dye. The long, sharp cactus thorns were used for decorative ear piercing and tattooing. Vertical and transverse lines were commonly tattooed on the cheeks and chin, although tattoo designs were applied also to the forehead, arms, and other parts of the body. To create a dark blue tattoo, the skin was pricked with a cactus thorn and the punctures rubbed with charcoal. When the wounds healed the pigment was sealed under the skin.<br /> <br /> <strong>Dudleya (Live-forever)</strong><br /> Perhaps no plant is more versatile in adapting to different habitats than dudleya. These low-growing, fleshy succulents with a waxy coating commonly grow on dry, rocky outcroppings.<br /> <br /> However, they also can be found on stabilized sand dunes, grasslands, and scrub habitats in conditions varying from full sun to shade. This adaptability is reflected in the variety of dudleyas found on the Channel Islands, including one species on Anacapa Island, sand-lettuce.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wild Cucumber</strong><br /> Another plant that evolved to deal with the dry conditions of southern California is the vine-like wild cucumber that often can be seen along the hillsides in the oak understory. This plant has an immense, poisonous, fleshy root, or underground tuber, that stores water and nutrients.<br /> <br /> Wild cucumber is one of the very first flowers to bloom from January to June. The plant sprawls over trees, shrubs, and the ground, leaving a tangle of dried stems and leaves by midsummer. In spring however, the wild cucumber forms large, egg-shaped, bright green fruits covered with big soft green prickles that turn hard and spiny as the fruits dry.<br /> <br /> Inside are large seeds. The Chumash made necklaces of these seeds, polishing them along their oiled bodies. They were used also as marbles by Chumash children.<br /> <br /> <strong>Giant Coreopsis</strong><br /> Each spring Anacapa's coreopsis, or tree sunflower, undergoes a marvelous transformation. For a few brief weeks in March and April the plant's tall, bare trunks disappear beneath masses of bright green foliage with showy yellow blossoms.<br /> <br /> Coreopsis survives the lengthy dry season-nine or ten months each year-by remaining dormant. The plant's brittle, seemingly lifeless stems are easily damaged or broken. Anacapa's isolation and the absence of large animals that might trample them protect coreopsis during this dormancy.<br /> <br /> <strong>Other Native Plant Species</strong><br /> Other plants to look for include giant coreopsis, scouring rush, coastal goldenbush, indian pink, island morning glory, gumplant, coastal sagebrush, and golden yarrow.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Trail Stop 6: Coreposis Forest <br />The view:<br />You are in a meadow near the western end of the island, facing north. This northern side of the trail is filled with clusters of tall tree-like plants called coreopsis. The plant grows on a bare trunk, 2-4-inches thick and 2-4 feet tall. In spring, it is the plant is topped with a cluster of lacy green leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers. In the dry season, the leaves and flowers wither and turn brown, so the plant may appear to be dead. Surrounding these clusters of coreopsis are smaller plants, which may include morning glory, gumplant, Indian pink, and golden yarrow. <br /><br />At 9 o'clock the trail continues ahead into the west, with the ocean and glimpses of Middle and Western Anacapa Islands beyond. From 11 to 1 o'clock Santa Barbara County is seen across the channel, in the distance, and about 1 o'clock is Ventura County. At 3 o'clock, the trail stretches back toward the east.<br /><br />The guide:<br />The guide shows five flowering plants. The largest image is of a stand of coreopsis plants. Their thick trunks have one or two stubby branches near the top, ending with either a shaggy mop of dead leaves, or a cluster of new feathery leaves and daisy-like flowers.<br /><br />Other illustrations show, from top to bottom:<br />Liveforever, a succulent with fleshy leaves curving up around a center, like an artichoke. Rising up from the cluster of leaves are thin stalks with two or three branches at the top, covered with small flowers. <br /><br />Below that is island morning glory, with heart-shapes leaves, and pale trumpet-shaped flowers.<br /><br />The next is gumweed, with small leaves and flowers in various stages of bloom. Most are closed in tight round buds; one has petals that are beginning to open; and the last is fully open, showing about sixteen pointed petals around a wide center, shaped almost like a small sunflower.<br /><br />At the bottom of the page is yarrow. It has very slender stalks with feathery leaves. At the top, the stalk divides into several even thinner stems, each ending with a rounded pillow-like tuft of pale flowers. A close up view of the yarrow flowers shows that each one is made up of five rounded petals, around a tiny center.<br /><br />The guide reads, \"Each spring Anacapa's coreopsis, or tree sunflower, undergoes a marvelous transformation. For <br />a few brief weeks in March and April the plant's tall, bare trunks disappear beneath masses of bright green foliage with showy yellow blossoms.<br /><br />Coreopsis survives the lengthy dry season-nine or ten months each year-by remaining dormant. The plant's brittle, seemingly lifeless stems are easily damaged or broken. Anacapa's isolation and the absence of large animals that might trample them protect coreopsis during this dormancy.<br /><br />Native plants found in association with coreopsis include island morning glory, gumplant, Indian pink, and golden yarrow. Please be careful to stay on the designated path and not disturb or walk on the island vegetation. \"",

The circulation of livestock on the island depended on the location of roundup grounds and the various construction designs of the corrals. On the island, two kinds of corral enclosures were used and still exist: the corrals at the ranch complex that were used for a number of functions, including holding, treatment, and shipping, and the roundup corrals scattered around the island, where cattle would be herded from the surrounding rangelands into the corral (with the help of a wing fence), separated as necessary, and moved to the ranch complex at Bechers Bay for shipment.<br /> <br /> <b>Main Ranch Corrals</b><br /> The extensive corrals at the ranch complex at Bechers Bay performed an important function in sorting and caring for cattle. They saw most use around the time of shipping, as newly arriving calves could be sorted and penned and outgoing steers lodged temporarily while being weighed and evaluated. Horses occupied the horse corral adjacent to the horse barn at roundup time.<br /> <br /> Their layout is complex, with particular corrals used for various activities such as weighing stock, doctoring, observation, watering, and selection. The long pen paralleling the eucalyptus windbreak was used for holding cattle newly brought in for processing.<br /> <br /> The next pen north is a watering pen, with a large trough centrally located. This pen was used for watering animals before and after shipping. It also doubled as a baseball field with local rules that included anything hit over the fence was out and anything in the water tank was a home run. To the west of the water pen is a multiuse corral adjacent to the blacksmith shop barn and rarely used for livestock except for passing through. The pens east of the horse barn were the most active at shipping time, with larger pens for holding cattle awaiting processing feeding into smaller pens that funneled the animals into either the scales, squeeze chute, dip vat, or shipping pens.<br /> <br /> A row of six smaller pens connected by a narrow lane is aligned with the land end of the pier. These were used to separate cattle by number and weight for loading onto corresponding pens on the Vaquero II. On the opposite side of the windbreak is a series of two hospital pens with water and feed, and at the south side of the windbreak, east side, another hospital pen, also with water and feed.<br /> <br /> <b>Roundup Corrals</b><br /> The nine remaining roundup corrals are scattered around the island and are relatively recent in origin, all but four dating from the 1960s. The roundup corrals are similar in construction and identical in purpose. The cattle were herded to the corral and sorted to the appropriate pen, i.e., animals to be shipped, animals to be treated, animals to be released back to pasture.<br /> <br /> The corrals had to be sturdy as the strength of the recalcitrant cattle could break through a weak fence. The corrals were constructed of posts, usually retired utility poles or railroad ties, with two-by-twelve rails, and, as an additional structural element, metal road guard rails salvaged from the Air Force roadway on the south side of the island. Salvaged chain-link fencing was used in many of the corrals as an alternative to horizontal boards.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> </strong></p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a sandy dirt road, more than 300 feet long, running roughly east to west, from the ocean side near the landing dock road, toward the ranch barns. There are 6-foot high wooden fences on the north and south sides, creating a long, narrow corridor. To the east is a glimpse of the ocean. Toward the southeast, just beyond the fence, a long line of eucalyptus trees form a windbreak. The fences on the north side of this road, and some of the south side, are part of a series of ranch corrals. The corral fences are constructed of posts, with four wooden plank rails, each about one foot by twelve. <br />As you walk west along the road, toward the ranch buildings, on your left, you will see a long pen that parallels the eucalyptus windbreak. About half-way down the road, on the left is another pen with a large water trough. At the far end, straight ahead, is a large corral, adjacent to a blacksmith shop barn. A little to the right, farther away, is a larger horse barn with a large corral connected to it. Turning around to return east, back along the same road toward the ocean, this larger pen feeds into smaller pens, ending with a row of six small pens connected by a narrow fenced corridor.<br />",

It is reportedly the only remaining Lighthouse Service derrick landing system that is available for the general public to observe on the west coast.<br /> <br /> The island's rugged terrain made landing construction quite challenging. In fact, Charles Hillinger, in the The California Islands, wrote that when members of the U. S. Coast Survey team visited Anacapa in 1854 they reported that it was an ideal but impossible site for a light station. Quoting a report, Hillinger wrote, \"It is inconceivable for a lighthouse to be constructed on this mass of volcanic rock-perpendicular on every face, with an ascent inaccessible by any natural means . . . .\" Nevertheless, construction of the landing facilities (along with the roads, tower, and support buildings) was completed in 1933 at a cost of $110,490.<br /> <br /> The Upper Landing contains a small crane building. This building remains in its original use, as a control room, winch house and equipment shed for the large crane which sits next to it. The original crane was replaced in 2020 after the previous crane failed due to prolonged exposure to the harsh marine conditions on the island. The new crane restored essential park operations and improved visitor and emergency services on the island. It is a two-crane design that improved the safety of loading operations. The two-crane system mirrors the configuration of the original historic Anacapa Light Station crane that was installed in 1932. The stairwell was renovated in 1999 and again in 2010.<br /> <br /> Of this Charles Hillinger's account of the landing is quite memorable. In 1931 Superintendent H. W. Rhodes requested a 26-foot whaleboat with trunk and cabin to serve as a launch. To meet the problems of landing the craft, he had it equipped with special hoisting gear so that it could be hoisted upon arrival at the island onto the lower landing platform:<br /> <br /> \"Perpendicular cliffs shot straight up more than 250 feet from the water. Embedded in the rock 50 feet above the surging surf was the lower landing platform, our target and arrival point. Seated in the engine house on the landing platform when the utility boat arrived was the boatswain's mate 1st Class, the officer in charge of the station.<br /> <br /> The power was switched on, the heavy boom swung out over our boat and a steel derrick hoist cable and hook lowered. One seaman grabbed the hook and inserted [it] in a midship eye while another secured guiding lines at the bow and stern which were fastened to the landing. Screeching power echoed throughout the cave-locked cove as the powerful hoist was thrust into the lift gears. Up out of the water rose the 7,000-pound boat, her crew and passengers. The boom swung us into a custom-made cradle and our 50-foot flight to Anacapa ended. \"<br /> <br /> Another interesting account of the landing described the arrival of a new keeper (called officer-in-charge after the Coast Guard took over the Lighthouse Service in 1939) along with his wife. Their launch was stuck swinging in the air as the derrick stopped working mid-operation. The officer and his terrified wife spent their welcome dangling over the swells in the landing cove, not knowing what would happen. Finally the problem was fixed and the couple made it ashore, but the wife reportedly refused to use the derrick again, denying herself shore leave, until she left the island for good.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are on the Upper Landing, on a wide concrete slab in the rock face. It is surrounded by thick pipe railing, and enclosed with metal fencing along the cliff edge. Benches and picnic tables are provided. A long metal crane sits on the slab and the crane operator building is tucked into the islands rugged, rocky surface. <br /><br />The small crane building is a house-like structure with a wood-shingled gable roof, horizontal white board siding and garage door. Three sides of the building are wrapped with large bay-style windows each with green trim and grilling. A long, black, metal crane called a derrick hoist, hangs overhead, spanning the length of the concrete slab. The crane sits on a platform to the left of the crane building. Above the building, a tripod of pipes and several thick cables anchored to the slab hold the crane in place.<br /><br />An exhibit panel that illustrates sea bird habitat is mounted to the railing and faces the rocky cliffs of Landing Cove and Arch rock with Anacapa lighthouse in the distance. Listen for seabirds roosting on the cliff face, the fog signal of the lighthouse and the sound of waves crashing on the rocks and in sea caves below.<br /><br />The trail system begins to the west of the slab where the concrete surface changes to compacted soil. The trail leads to the historic building complex, restrooms, lighthouse and visitor center. At the visitor center, pick up the main trailhead to explore the rest of the island's destinations.<br />",

Each island population is recognized as a separate endemic or unique subspecies.<br /> The island fox, a descendant of the mainland gray fox, is the largest of the Channel Islands' native mammals, but one of the smallest canid species in the world.<br /> <br /> Although foxes have always existed at low population sizes, four island fox subspecies underwent catastrophic declines in the 1990s. On San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands at Channel Islands National Park, the decline was attributed to predation by golden eagles. The presence of non-native ungulates as a food source in addition to the DDT-caused decline of bald eagles, a natural competitor, facilitated the establishment of golden eagles as resident breeders on the islands. By 2000, predation on island foxes resulted in population declines to 15 individuals on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands, and less than 80 on Santa Cruz Island. In 2004, each of the park's island fox subspecies were federally listed as endangered.<br /> <br /> In 1999, Channel Islands National Park began an island fox recovery program that included captive breeding and reintroduction of foxes, removal of resident golden eagles, re-establishment of bald eagles, and removal of non-native ungulates. This coordinated, organized and highly focused strategy was able to reverse the certain extinction of an endangered population. Today, the population has recovered within the park. Population trend and annual survival are currently monitored to ensure that recovery continues and future threats to the park's island fox subspecies are identified.<br /> <br /> <b>The Captive Breeding Program</b><br /> Captive breeding was a necessary - and ultimately successful - recovery action for island foxes, and it also provided an opportunity to study island fox reproductive biology, which was previously unknown. When foxes were first brought into captivity on San Miguel Island just before the 2000 breeding season, mated pairs were established by placing together males and females that appeared likely to have been paired in the wild, based on information available at capture. Because there were more females than males, some females were housed together.<br /> <br /> In subsequent years as pups were born and reached maturity, they were assigned mates based on a computer program designed to prevent inbreeding in small populations, such as the fox, and maximize genetic heterozygosity (lack of similarity).<br /> <br /> The success of the island fox breeding program is evident in data given in the 2011 Island Fox Meeting Report. Considering the northern Channel Islands exclusively, numbers that include pups are as follows: Santa Cruz, 1302; San Miguel, 516; Santa Rosa, 292.<br /> <br /> As a result of research conducted during the captive breeding period, we now know that island foxes have induced estrus and ovulation, which is unique among canids and may be related to other distinctive features of their mating system. Island foxes differ substantially from wolves, the species perhaps best known for its complex social system, strong pair bonds, and solicitous parental care. All the canid species appear to be socially monogamous, but from there they diverge in terms of group size, degree of sociality, and age of dispersal of young. For example, male aggression toward females - something that appeared rather common even in the reproductively successful island foxes - is virtually unknown for other canid species, in which males tend to be very solicitous to females, especially during estrus and pregnancy. However, it is unclear whether this behavior is characteristic of free-ranging island foxes or merely an artifact of captive conditions. In another contrast with other canids, the reproductive rate was lower for captive-born island foxes, the opposite of what is usually observed in other canid species. This suggests that something, such as social experience during the juvenile period, might have been missing in the captive environment, something that apparently is less important to other canid species.<br /> <br /> <b>Reintroduction of the Bald Eagle</b><br /> The process of bringing back the bald eagle to the northern Channel Islands led authorities to believe that they might prove to be a natural deterrent to the colonization of the golden eagle. In 2006 a bald eagle was observed escorting a golden eagle out of its territory on Santa Rosa Island. Newly released bald eagles were also seen chasing golden eagles off of a carcass provided for them. Historical evidence and studies have shown that the natural bald eagle food sources are marine fishes, seabirds and pinniped carcasses, suggesting that bald eagles pose little threat to the island fox.<br /> <br /> From 2002-2006, the Institute for Wildlife Studies (IWS) released 61 bald eagles on Santa Cruz Island. In 2006, the first known nesting attempts occurred in the northern Channel Islands. Two pairs of eagles successfully fledged one chick each from nest at Pelican Harbor and Malva Real on Santa Cruz Island. Since 2006, there have been successful hatchings and Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands. As of 2012 there are over 50 bald eagles on the California Channel Islands and over 30 known eagles on the northern Channel Islands.<br /> <br /> <b>Encouraging Native Plants</b><br /> Island foxes evolved in an environment thick with native shrubs that later dwindled after the introduction of livestock grazing. Without shrubs for hiding cover, the foxes were especially easy for the golden eagles to catch. Today, the removal of nonnative grazers is showing astonishing results. Lush shrubs and wildflowers are coming back. Restoring the island's vegetation benefits the foxes and all native wildlife.<br /> <br /> <b>An Ecosystem Solution</b><br /> Without the ecosystem-level changes of pig removal and bald eagle restoration, fox recovery was not assured. That those two ecosystem level actions were implemented in conjunction with island fox recovery actions was fortuitous. The two actions had been planned and funded separately from island fox recovery, but the value of those planned actions to island fox conservation was recognized when the complicated relationship among foxes, pigs, and eagles became apparent. The success of those ecosystem-level actions was facilitated by the islands' isolation and their limited, more defined ecosystems: once pigs were removed from the islands, there was little chance of them returning. The success of these ecosystem-level actions for island fox conservation underscores the importance of considering ecosystem-wide conditions in endangered species management.<br /> <br /> <b>Current Status on San Miguel Island</b><br /> An affiliated group of management agencies, landowners, academics, and non-profits concerned with the conservation of the island fox has convened since 1999 to exchange information regarding the status and trend of the six island fox subspecies, and to work cooperatively on island fox conservations issues in such areas as captive breeding, wild population management, veterinary issues, and educational/outreach. In the most recent 2011 meeting of this group, the Island Fox Working Group, data was presented that indicated that 4 of the 6 island fox (Urocyon littoralis) subspecies were stable or increasing, with high survival, though island foxes still face potential threats from pathogens and predation.<br /> <br /> Captive breeding continued for the San Miguel Island fox (Urocyon littoralis littoralis) until 2007 and all foxes were returned to the wild. The population continues to increase by about 25% per year with a high annual fox survival rate, 90%. As of 2011 the population had reach pre-decline levels (close to 400 adults) and can be considered biologically recovered. As the population has reached known historical levels, biologists are watching to see how the population stabilizes. Monitoring foxes via radio telemetry collars has also provided early identification of predation or disease threats. Annual vaccination of 60 - 100 individual foxes is protecting a larger potential survivor group in the event of introduced rabies or distemper virus.<br /> <br /> <b>Future Prospects of Threats to Species</b><br /> The IUCN Red List of Endangered Species still lists the Island Fox as critically endangered as of a 2008 assessment. The US Fish and Wildlife Service will likely release a draft island fox recovery plan in 2012. Monitoring and mitigation of known threats (eagle predation and canine disease) will be a prominent recovery action in the plan. Island foxes may be vulnerable to impacts of future global climate change. Such impact could be direct, such as changes in acceptable temperature ranges, or indirect, such as impacts on floral or faunal food sources for the fox. Alternatively, global climate change may affect the distribution or virulence of pathogens, such as bacteria or parasites.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Island Plant Adaptations Guide Stop 7</b><br /> <br /> The plants habitats found in many regions of the Channel Islands present a number of environmental challenges. South-facing slopes are hot and dry, and receive seasonal rainfall only during the winter and early spring months. In many locations soils are thin and rocky, and have little covering of leaf mulch to hold moisture or provide nutrients.<br /> <br /> Plants found on the Channel Islands have responded to these environmental challenges through adaptations. For example, the light-colored leaves of coastal sagebrush reflect more sunlight than darker leaves, thereby helping to control plant temperature. Sagebrush also sheds many of its leaves in the dry season, which conserves even more water. A waxy coating on the leaves of the sage plant controls evaporation, and their curled edges protect the delicate undersurface.<br /> <br /> Other island plants have evolved different strategies for dealing with dry conditions. The vine-like wild cucumber has immense underground tubers that store water and nutrients. Cacti such as coastal cholla and coastal prickly pear have spines in the place of leaves. The spines reflect sun and win, thereby protecting the plants from dehydration. These cacti have also evolved shallow root systems that spread over a wide area to take maximum advantage of the limited rainfall on the islands. Coastal boxthorn has also adapted to the hot, dry environment by developing small, specialized leaves to conserve moisture and reduce heat.<br /> <br /> Perhaps no plant is more versatile in adapting to different habitats than dudleya, also known as live-forever. Dudleya commonly grows on dry, rocky outcroppings; however, it can also be found on stabilized sand dunes, grasslands, and scrub habitats in conditions varying from full sun to shade. This adaptability is reflected in the variety of dudleyas found on the Channel Islands, which include Santa Rosa Island live-forever and Santa Barbara Island live-forever.<br /> <br /> Approximately 22 percent of the native plants growing on California's Channel Islands are endemic to one or more of the islands. This endemism results from tens of thousands of years of isolation; during this period of isolation genetic factors and environmental change have produced new plant species unique to the islands.<br /> <br /> Because of their highly specialized nature, populations of endemic plants are generally small. Endemic plants are also vulnerable to competition from hardier introduced species such as nonnative grasses. These introduced plants can grow and reproduce rapidly, thereby competing with native plants for limited soil and moisture. Native plants are also vulnerable to competition from humans. Today there is great pressure to develop wild land; such development inevitably destroys the integrity of the habitat and severely impacts native species.</p>",

Introduced species such as deer and elk browsed on the shoots of young trees, and feral pigs consumed the acorns. Annual grasses, introduced to the islands to provide pasture for sheep and cattle, formed a dense ground cover that robbed the soil of water and nutrients needed by oak seedlings. As a result of these factors, natural propagation of these trees remained rare.

The calves would be separated and brought through the squeeze chute where they were branded, vaccinated, and if necessary, castrated.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The house sits on a knoll overlooking Chinese Harbor, although the porch and front door face south towards the hills of the island. The house measures 18 feet by 30.5 feet and sits on a concrete foundation. Its lapped wood siding, reportedly redwood, is painted white, while the trim is yellow. The windows are two-over-two double hung wood sash, custom made for the restoration project. The house has a shed roof with composition shingles. A concrete slab porch wraps around the south (5 feet wide) and west (9.5 feet wide) sides of the house, all protected under the shed roof. A wood frame wall encloses the north side of the west porch, acting as an extension of the north wall. Two doors provide access to the interior of the house: a front door on the south elevation and a side door to the pantry on the west. The house has five rooms: a combination kitchen/dining room which also acts as a living room with a wood stove; two bedrooms, one with four bunks; a small bathroom and a walk-through pantry. The interior walls are knotty pine. West of the ranch house, in a flat swale, sits a complex of corrals and two sheds. The corrals consist of three large enclosures, the largest of which measures roughly 60 feet by 66 feet and the smallest 24 feet by 90 feet, and a series of alleys and pens. A small shed measuring 8 feet by 12 feet stands in the center of the corral complex, and a large metal-roofed shed measuring about 17 feet by 92 feet occupies the eastern edge of the complex. The small \"medicine room\" shed has been remodeled into a sleeping room. It sits on a concrete foundation and has a shed roof with red roll roofing, lapped siding, a shed roof, a door with a window, and a six-over-six double-hung window. The interior has been remodeled with knotty pine to match the main house. A metal squeeze chute stands east of the medicine room. The large shed, used for sheltering horses and/or calves, has a corrugated metal shed roof and walls on three sides; the west side opens to a series of six pens. In 2012 NPS removed the solar panels from the roof of the ranch house and constructed a new photovoltaic system over the north end of the long shed. The inverter and batteries are housed within the shed. The corrals are constructed of horizontal boards nailed to sturdy wood posts. A ramp chute allowed loading of cattle onto trucks for shipping. All of the gates are wood and hung with metal hinges. Overall, the complex of corrals and sheds measures about 100 feet by 180 feet.<br /><br /><br />",

Ocean conditions are highly variable and sometimes dangerous. Many beaches on the islands have steep, dangerous shore breaks. The wind and swell generally come from the northwest and become stronger as the day continues. From October through January, visitors must also be prepared for strong east or Santa Ana winds. The ocean currents outside of coves and protected beach areas can be strong and extremely dangerous. These conditions should be carefully considered when planning your trip and entering the water.</p> <p>In addition to the regulations and guidelines listed at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/management/lawsandpolicies.htm\">Laws and Policies</a>, the following suggestions should also be considered:</p> <ul> <li>There are no lifeguards on duty, so all water sports are at your own risk. Visitors should be aware of boat landing operations at all times-avoid water sports near skiffs that are conducting surf landings.</li> <li>Snorkelers, divers, and swimmers should always use the buddy system. This allows for someone to go for help if you encounter trouble.</li> <li>For your own safety, the law requires divers to display a dive flag while diving. It is recommended that spear guns be unloaded at least 50 feet from the beach.</li> <li>Before departing, swimmers, snorkelers and divers should leave an itinerary and/or float plan with someone who is on shore and can be easily contacted.</li> <li>Sea caves can be very dangerous-large waves or swells can fill a cave unexpectedly. Be extremely careful and wear a helmet at all times when exploring sea caves.</li> <li>Due to cold water conditions (55° to 70° F), wetsuits and hoods are recommended.</li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Phalacrocorax auritus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The double-crested cormorant is the most numerous and widespread North American cormorant, although this bird is listed as a species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game. Owing to the isolation of Channel Islands National Park, this bird is provided with the protected breeding area of Santa Barbara Island, and especially Prince Island off the northeast coast and Castle Rock off the northwest coast of San Miguel Island. Anacapa Island also has established breeding colonies.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Double-crested cormorants are the most numerous and widely distributed species of the six North American cormorants.</li> <li>Their range extends from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska down to Mexico.</li> <li>Like other cormorants, their feathers are not waterproof and they need to dry their wings after spending time in the water.</li> <li>During the breeding season, the skin on their throat turns bright orange.</li> <li>Double-crested cormorants nest in a variety of places: on the ground, cliff edges, trees, shrubs, and in artificial structures.</li> <li>Double-crested cormorants make a bulky nest of sticks and other material. They frequently picks up junk, such as rope, deflated balloons, fishnet, and plastic debris to incorporate into the nest. Parts of dead birds are commonly used too.</li> <li>Females on average lay four eggs. Large pebbles are occasionally found in cormorant nests, and the cormorants treat them as eggs.</li> <li>Incubating adults hold the eggs on their feet.</li> <li>Double-crested cormorant nests often are exposed to direct sun. Adults shade the chicks and also bring them water, pouring it from their mouths into those of the chicks.</li> <li>They are gregarious birds usually found in colonies. In breeding colonies where the nests are placed on the ground, young cormorants leave their nests and congregate into groups with other youngsters (creches). They return to their own nests to be fed.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Double-crested cormorants weigh from 3.3 to 6.6 pounds and measure 33 inches in length, with a wingspan of about four feet. Sexes look similar, with short, dark legs, a long black body and neck; a lighter colored bill with a hooked tip, bare orange skin around the face and chin. Breeding adults have brilliant turquoise eyes and mouth lining. A small curled plume on either side of the crown may be seen during the breeding season. The long neck is kinked in flight. Because their feathers are not waterproof, double-crested cormorants often spread their soaked wings out to dry after a dive. This incomplete waterproofing helps reduce buoyancy, a valuable attribute for a diving seabird.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Growing in numbers throughout its range, the double-crested cormorant is widely distributed across North America. It breeds locally along all coasts and extensively in Florida, the center of continent, and along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway, as well as in Mexico, Belize, the Bahamas, and Cuba. Most cormorants winter along the Pacific Coast from Alaska to Mexico, along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from North Carolina to Belize, and inland on ice-free areas along large rivers and lakes.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The double-crested cormorant is very adaptable. They may be found in diverse aquatic habitats, ranging from rocky northern coasts to mangrove swamps, lagoons, estuaries, rivers, small inland ponds, and large reservoirs. The double-crested cormorant is a species that is even more widespread in winter. The largest number of colonies in southern California of double-crested cormorants is found on islands of Channel Islands National Park with nesting occurring on Santa Barbara, Anacapa, and San Miguel islands, with an occasional colony on Santa Cruz Island.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The diet of the double-crested cormorant consists predominantly of a wide variety of fish. The cormorant dives from the surface and chases fish underwater, propelled by its powerful webbed feet. The bird then grabs the fish with its bill, rather than spearing it; upon surfacing, it flips the fish into the air, then catches and swallows it head-first.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> They first breed at 3 years of age in nesting colonies, sometimes with other wading birds. The birds make a bulky nest of sticks and other bulky items, including seaweed and flotsam, often lined with grass in a tree near water, on a cliff ledge, or on a beach. They frequently pick up debris, including rope, deflated balloons, and fish nets, to incorporate into the nest. The cormorants usually lay 3 to 4 pale blue eggs. Cormorant hatchlings are naked and helpless. Both parents care for the chicks. Double-crested cormorant adults shade the chicks and bring them water, pouring it into the chicks' mouths from their own. In ground-nesting colonies, young cormorants leave their nests and congregate with other youngsters, called crèches, returning to their own nests only to be fed. The young birds begin to fly at about 5 weeks, and become independent at about 9 weeks of age.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Populations on the west coast generally are permanent residents, but double-crested cormorants elsewhere are migratory. They migrate by day in flocks, often forming \"V\"-shaped formations as they follow rivers or coastlines, headed from the coldest parts of their breeding range toward ice-free areas.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Although, the double-crested cormorant is a wide spread species and classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, in 2002 the California Department of Fish and Game listed the double-crested cormorant as a species of special concern. This variance occurred due to the fact that the bird is not listed under the federal Endangered Species Act or the California Endangered Species Act. Due to the fact that human threats and climatic conditions produced low historical populations, it made it prudent to take a conservative view to the species. In California, Channel Islands National Park, as well as refuges and ecological reserves, are protected areas for this bird.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul sizcache024667503963620274=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"109\"> <li sizcache024667503963620274=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"109\"><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li sizcache024667503963620274=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"110\"><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></li> <li sizcache024667503963620274=\"7\" sizcache05322701438980744=\"7\" sizset=\"111\"><a href=\"http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species\">Birds of North America</a></li> <li sizcache024667503963620274=\"7\" sizset=\"112\"><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/\">The Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a></li> </ul>",

Today the widespread presence of introduced grasses such as wild oats, foxtails, and brome are evidence of this period in Anacapa's history.<br />  </p> <p><strong>More Sheep Ranching History</strong><br /> Around 1885, E. E. Elliot had a sheep camp on Anacapa Island around as evidenced by photographs in the Santa Barbara Historical Society collection. Elliot constructed a number of buildings on the middle island that became known as \"The Houses\" and planted eucalyptus trees that remain. He eventually abandoned his operation due to problems with poaching by fishermen. Elliot apparently had no government lease.<br /> <br /> The earliest lease recorded in lighthouse files was that awarded to Louis le Mesagner by the Department of Treasury for $25 a year beginning April 1, 1902. Charles Holder, who visited the islands at about this time, called it a sheep ranch and reported that several hundred animals found sustenance there even in the summer. A herder volunteered that although there was no water, there was an abundance of fog. The moisture from this was soaked up by the sheep's coats and in the morning they licked each other to obtain water, a somewhat dubious story heard on other islands as well. In the spring, Indians and Mexicans were hired by the sheep owners to go to the island and shear the sheep.<br /> <br /> The Department of Commerce and Labor leased Anacapa Island to former island seal hunter and long-time Ventura resident Heaman Bayfield Webster on April 1, 1907, for $31 a year. The lease read \"All the Island of Anacapa . . . consisting of three islets . . . and known as the Anacapa Light Reservation . . . for grazing and farming only.\" He could place on it no permanent buildings, and the lease noted that previous sheepherders had left an old cistern. Webster's sheep herd increased to about 600 through breeding but depredations by fishermen, eagles and drought resulted in continuous losses.<br /> Webster established residence on the middle island with his wife Martha and two sons, Morris and Harvey. They built or reused five shacks to each of which they affixed a name: Camp Felicity, Camp Simplicity, Camp Capacity, Camp Intensity and Camp Necessity, the latter being an outhouse with a toilet flushed by sand. Camps Felicity and Simplicity had roofs, floors and furnishings while the others were less substantial. The location was apparently the one occupied by Elliot in the 1880s, marked by eucalyptus trees.<br /> <br /> Webster constructed a water storage tank, which he kept filled with water imported from the mainland in five-gallon cans. The family spent summers and two winters on the island tending the flock of sheep, and a caretaker stayed during the Websters' absences. The Websters welcomed vacationers who arrived in their own boats or on one of Bay Webster's charters. Early on the newspapers referred to him as the \"King of Anacapa Island.\" In the fall of 1911 Webster set up a school in a tent for his children, and hired a governess for them. \"He is pretty sure that he is the first man to ring a school bell on the island,\" wrote a reporter, \"which he calls a strip of rock six miles long and something over an inch wide.\"<br /> <br /> Webster obtained his income from tourism and wool sales. He sold no more than 50 sheep during the ten years on the island but concentrated on breeding and shearing. He herded the sheep from the west island towards the east where they were sheared, either hog-tying them for the inter-island trip in a boat or forcing them to swim the distance.<br /> <br /> Various lessees continued to ranch on the island after Webster. However, by the 1930s the sheep had destroyed most of the native plants useful to them and had begun to eat the endemic Astragalus miguelensis. From this many sheep died, taking the profit out of sheep herding and bringing to an end to sheep ranching when Anacapa became part of Channel Islands National Monument in 1938.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>This overlook of Elephant Seal Cove is 2.5-miles, round trip from the visitor center. As its name implies, elephant seals can be seen along the rocky shoreline.<br /> <br /> <b>Stop 7: Arch Point Tour-An Ocean Park and Sanctuary</b><br /> <br /> From this vantage point, one has the opportunity to gaze upon another part of the park: the marine environment. One nautical mile of water around each island is part of Channel Islands National Park, and the six nautical miles around each island form Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm, one often sees or hears California sea lions, northern elephant seals, or harbor seals. The island's isolated shoreline offers these pinnipeds an ideal combination of safety from predators and freedom from human disturbance, making the island an ideal place to rest, breed, and pup.<br /> <br /> But even Santa Barbara Island's isolation could not always protect these and other sea mammals from human predation. As early as the late 1700's, fur hunters were exploiting sea otters, fur seals, elephant seals, and sea lions for their fur, hides and oil. Sea mammal hunting ended in the early 1900's and laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act now protect these species. Today, elephant seals, sea lions, and harbor seals regularly breed along the island's shoreline. In this isolated environment, their protected populations are recovering from centuries of slaughter. Unfortunately, the sea otter has not yet returned.<br /> <br /> These pinnipeds, along with over 800 other marine species, also depend on the extensive kelp forests found in these waters for food, shelter, and protection- from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales feasting on plankton. Kelp is a type of algae that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing organisms on Earth-it can grow two feet per day.<br /> <br /> While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California coastal mainland, the isolated islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp forests don't just benefit marine species-they benefit us as well. Not only do we eat some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but everyday products like ice cream, salad dressing, and even toothpaste also use a little bit of seaweed as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredient called algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine plants and algae such as kelp provide Earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, human activities have placed the kelp forest and its inhabitants in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have altered the kelp forest ecosystem, and kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the 20th century.<br /> <br /> However, with the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls, fishing regulations, and increased research and public education, some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary, this network of MPAs provides a refuge for sea life, as well as opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 marine reserves (including one on Santa Barbara Island's southeastern side), recreational fishing and commercial harvesting are prohibited; limited fishing and harvesting are allowed in two marine conservation areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and an important part of a larger, worldwide effort to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.<br /> <br /> <b>Park Protection</b><br /> In 1938, Santa Barbara Island was proclaimed a national monument to protect, preserve, and teach us about the island's fragile resources and unique past. This distinction was reaffirmed and strengthened in 1980, when the island was included in the newly established Channel Islands National Park. By understanding these resources and the role isolation plays on these islands, the National Park Service can preserve them for future generations to study and enjoy.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service needs your help as well. We encourage you to explore and learn more about Santa Barbara Island and the rest of the Channel Islands-but don't stop there. In recognizing the importance of these islands, take your awareness to the action level. Make every effort to preserve the plants, animals, and artifacts found not only within this park, but throughout the world as well.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing at the end of an extension trail that branches off from the Elephant Seal Cove Trail. This branch trail has led you down to a low, rocky bluff just about 40 feet above the shoreline, with an intimate peak into a secluded corner of elephant seal cove. Steep cliffs curve around the cove, leaving just shallow pockets of narrow sandy beaches at the shoreline. One such beach is only one or two hundred feet away. Here, a variety of pinnipeds, which are torpedo-shaped sea mammals with flippers, and heads shaped like a dog's, but with tiny or invisible ears, can often be found, crowded together. Depending on the time of year, the beach is filled with hundreds of pinnipeds. <br />In the water, dark oblong shapes of pinnipeds are visible under the surface, swimming, bodysurfing, and hunting. Occasionally, they pop their heads above the water to breathe, look ashore, and sometimes, to bark a bellowing call. <br /><br />The whole scene is accompanied by a loud chorus of their varied calls-from bellows and bleats to snorts, barks, and creaks <br /><br />Here, at Elephant Seal Cove, the pinnipeds generally include California sea lions, northern elephant seals, and northern fur seals. They are all here to breed, give birth, raise their young, and sometimes to molt, or shed, their fur. With so many competing groups of mammals on the crowded beach, this breeding colony, or rookery, is often a chaotic mix of fighting, sex, sleep, terror, play, and death; sometimes happening all at once. <br /><br />Adult male elephant seals are the largest animals on the beach. These brown animals have short, bulbous snouts, are about 12 feet long, and can weigh as much as 5,000 pounds. They often rest, almost motionless, on the beach, but during the breeding season the males battle one another for females. Known as \"bulls\", the male elephant seals make snorting sounds while slamming their massive bodies together and gouging each other with their short, carrot-shaped tusks, until their necks are red with blood. The females, which are about 10 feet long, and weigh up to 1,800 pounds, form harems around the winners of the battles. Each harem numbers between 10 and 50 females. When born, the babies, called pups, are 3 to 4 feet long, and weigh only about 70 pounds, or 1.5 % the size of the bull elephant seals. As the adult males continue to defend their group against other male competition, pups are sometimes accidentally injured or killed. So, scattered around the beach a dead pup or two may be seen, in various states of decay; some being eaten by sea gulls. <br /><br />The California sea lions have large front and back flippers, and are more agile on land than other pinnipeds. The mature males are dark brown, about 7 feet long, and weigh up to 1,000 pounds. Females are golden brown, about 6 feet long, and weigh about 200 pounds. Pups are dark brown and about 16 pounds at birth, but their coats become golden brown after about 5 months. After about 5 years, the male's fur changes to a dark brown color once again. Males have a bellowing bark, that sounds like \"Aarh!.\" They fight other males to defend their territories. <br /><br />Females will fight other females to defend their pups. In order for females and their pups to find one another, the pups call out in a bleating, \"Baah\" sound, like that of a baby lamb. Their mothers call back in a creaking, \"Ahh\" sound. <br /><br />The older pups wander farther away from their mothers. Aggressive sea lion males will occasionally chase and crush pups that venture too far from another male's harem, leaving another carcass, and its attending seagulls, on the beach. <br /><br />Northern fur seals have very large front and back flippers and tiny ears. Males are grey to black, and between 300 - 600 pounds. They declare their territories with a bellowing sound, almost like a cow's \"moo\", and vigorously defend their turf by chasing away intruders. Females are light brown on the back with a reddish brown chest, with a light patch. They weigh about 100 pounds. These mothers and pups also find one another through distinctive calls.<br /><br />Whitewater surges around rock outcrops between the beaches. Large, dark patches of kelp forests are visible offshore, their tangled brown blades creating a floating mat at the water's surface. Farther offshore, in the distance to the northwest, is Shag Rock. Beyond that, at the end of the island, there is a glimpse of Arch Point, the northernmost side of the island.<br />",

Please take a moment to read this information and learn what you can do to take care of San Miguel. This information will inform you about what you can see and do here on San Miguel.<br /> <br /> <b>About the Island</b><br /> San Miguel is the home of pristine tidepools, rare plants, and the strange caliche forest. Four species of seals and sea lions come here to breed and give birth. For 10,000 years the island was home to the seagoing Chumash people. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo set foot here in 1542 as the first European to explore the California coast. For 100 years the island was a sheep ranch and after that it was used by the military. San Miguel is still owned by the Navy, but it is managed under agreement by the National Park Service. In 1980 it was designated part of Channel Islands National Park.<br /> <br /> <b>Access Permit Required</b><br /> A permit (including liability waiver) is required to visit the island. If you are traveling to San Miguel Island with Island Packers, Channel Islands Aviation, or Truth Aquatics, they will provide the forms to you upon your reservation. Private boaters can obtain the forms at a self-registration station at the Nidever Canyon trail head entry on San Miguel Island. It is the responsibility of private boaters to contact the park to ensure the island is open before coming ashore.<br /> <br /> Many parts of San Miguel are closed to protect wildlife, fragile plants, and geological features. Several areas, however, are open for you to explore on your own. Others are open to you when accompanied by a park ranger.<br /> <br /> On your own you may explore the Cuyler Harbor beach, Nidever Canyon, Cabrillo monument, and the Lester ranch site. Visitors are required to stay on the designated island trail system. No off-trail hiking is permitted. The island was a former bombing range and there are possible unexploded ordnance. In addition, visitors must be accompanied by a ranger beyond the ranger station.<br /> <br /> The Nidever Canyon trail will take you to the ranch site, monument and ranger station. The trail begins at the top of the dune above Gull Rock. It climbs along the east wall of the canyon.<br /> <br /> <b>Arranging a Hike with a Ranger</b><br /> To see other parts of the island, such as Point Bennett or the caliche forest, you must go with a ranger. If you are with Island Packers, Channel Islands Aviation, or Truth Aquatics a ranger or volunteer will be available for most of these trips to lead hikes. They will announce time and date during your arrival. If you are a private boater, the San Miguel ranger can be contacted on Marine Radio Channel 16. You can also arrange a hike with the ranger through park headquarters at (805) 658-5730.<br /> <br /> <b>Island Rules</b><br /> - Everything is protected. Do not collect anything.<br /> - San Miguel Island is open only when National Park Service personnel are on the island.<br /> - Access permit (including liability waiver) is required.<br /> - No pets are allowed on shore.<br /> - No smoking or fires.<br /> - Take your trash off the island with you.<br /> - Hikers must stay on trails.<br /> - Hikers must be escorted beyond the ranger station. On your own visitors may only explore Cuyler Harbor beach, Nidever Canyon, Cabrillo monument, and the Lester ranch site.<br /> - California State fishing regulations apply. No fishing in marine reserves.<br /> <br /> <b>Safety</b><br /> - The island was a former bombing range and there are possible unexploded ordnance. Do not disturb any munitions that you may find on or off shore. It is extremely dangerous and may detonate at any time. Report its location to a ranger, who will have it removed by qualified personnel.<br /> - Use caution when crossing the rockfall along the beach.<br /> - The Nidever Canyon trail is steep and slippery. Watch your step.<br /> - Hantavirus has been found in deer mouse populations on San Miguel. This is a potentially fatal disease and some basic precautions should be taken: avoid contact with rodents; do not feed wild animals; keep food and drink in rodent-proof containers. For more information, please see the bulletin board in the campground.<br /> - Carry plenty of water and drink it.<br /> - Hikers should never hike alone-use the buddy system.<br /> <br /> <b>Additional Information</b><br /> - On the beach, you may walk to either end of the beach to where the sand runs into the rock.<br /> - If seals are present on the beach, do not approach or disturb them.<br /> - The distance from the palm trees to the campground is about one mile.<br /> - Pit toilets are available at both the ranger station and the campground.<br /> - There is no drinking water on the island.<br /> - Landing is only permitted on the beach at Cuyler Harbor.<br /> - Only the area outside of the marine reserve is open to fishing.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "If you are at the edge of Cuyler Harbor Beach, facing the water, you will be facing north. It is a relatively flat sandy beach, about two miles long. Its soft pale sand is the consistency of white sugar. To the left, is a cluster of palm trees at the distant end of Cuyler Harbor Beach, where the sand ends against a rocky coastline. To the right, the sandy beach extends to an unnamed rocky point. Just offshore is the small rocky island, Gull Island. In the distance, is the larger Prince Island. Behind the beach are large dunes, covered with low succulent plants. Behind you, Nidever canyon cuts up through the rocky cliff to the plateau on top of the island.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The farm implements on display throughout the Scorpion ranch historic area reveal a period in island history that is hard to imagine in today's technologically advanced world. A period of horse-drawn equipment such as plows, mowers, and hay balers. A period when repairs to this equipment along with the manufacturing of iron fittings, railings, hinges, and other materials were done by a resident blacksmith. A period of self-reliance-of homemade sawmills and other modified equipment that demonstrate how those living on the island adapted to the difficulties of isolated island life and, as former ranch superintendent Clifford McElrath states in On Santa Cruz Island, \"learned to make do with what [they] had.\"<br /> <br /> Some of this equipment dates back to the Justinian Caire era that began in the early1880s. At that time Caire started developing a large island agricultural community that \"included the production of wine, wool, tallow, meat, and olives.\" (Gherini, p. 84) One can well imagine that \"the developments of an island rancho (covering 62,000 acres) presented a formidable logistical problem of transporting large quantities of supplies to and from the island located twenty miles off the coast of California.\" (Gherini, p. 81)<br /> <br /> By the 1890s, Caire raised over 50,000 sheep, harvested 150 acres of vineyards, and planted olive orchards, eucalyptus groves, and extensive gardens. By 1900 wagons, carts, horse hay rakes, hay presses, mowers, gang plows, breaking plows, cultivators, barley seeders, anvils, drills, harrows, windmills, water pumps, and other pieces of equipment were commonplace. Over a hundred horses provided the power to pull the equipment. Later, tractors such as the \"Waterloo Boy\" would replace the horses and provide the power to pull the equipment.<br /> <br /> Caire's ranching agricultural enterprise featured ten sub ranches on the island. Scorpion and Smugglers, known as the granary, played an important part in this ranching system since the vast plateaus of the east end \"supported a variety of crops such as wheat, corn, potatoes, beans, barley, and onions, besides hay and alfalfa.\" (Gherini, p. 95) Ranch hands tended to flocks of sheep and to a small herd of cattle as well as performing the arduous task of building roads and rock walls. To make better use of the land for planting, \"workers cleared the fields of rocks; then they piled the huge rocks into cairns which remain today as a monument to their labor.\" (Gherini, p. 100) In one way or another, many of the farm implements on display helped in the establishment of a unique island rancho.<br /> <br /> Ranching continued on the eastern end of Santa Cruz Island until 1984. Between 1926 and 1984, the Gherini family, descendants of Justinian Caire, operated a sheep ranch for meat and wool out of the Scorpion Ranch area. This era ended in February 1997 when the National Park Service acquired the last interest from the Gherini family. Today, the National Park Service is preserving this historic area so visitors always will have the chance to remember and understand this unique part of the island's past.<br /> <br /> As you walk throughout this historic area use the Farm Implements Self-guided Tour (under \"Tours\") or the Interpretive Guide to Eastern Santa Cruz Island (available in the orientation area) to locate the various farm implements. The numbers on the map mark the location of the farm implements described in this guide.<br />  </p> <p><strong>How did the implements get to the island?</strong><br /> Transporting equipment and supplies across twenty miles of ocean presented difficult logistical problems. \"The task of unloading at Scorpion Harbor could be difficult and potentially dangerous especially when unloading heavy equipment.\" (Gherini, p.199) The owners often used barges or lighters to off-load heavy equipment such as the Waterloo Boy in 1918 and the Caterpillar 30 in 1938. When off-loading the Caterpillar 30 it tipped over.<br /> <br /> In another instance, in the 1950s, the Natco, a 42-foot boat owned by the Gherini family to haul supplies to the island, carried parts and new tracks for the Caterpillar 30. The Natco took on water several miles from the island and nearly sank. The Coast Guard came to the rescue and towed the Natco back to Santa Barbara. In 1975, \"a pick-up truck was being off-loaded from the Hodge. The ocean surged around the cement pier, and as the boat's boom lifted the truck from the deck and swung it over to the pier, the boom snapped like a toothpick. The truck dropped into the ocean and became another island relic.\" (Gherini, p.200) Today, the National Park Service uses a landing craft to bring heavy equipment to the island.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "As you walk from the beach to the Scorpion Ranch Visitor Center, a series of historic rusted farm implements are placed on display outside in the grass along a roped off strip of land beside the trail. Another set of implements are placed along a wooden fence that surrounds the bunkhouse and ranch house complex. Examples of the types of implements include: horse drawn equipment, plows, mowers, hay balers, saws, wagons, tractors and old truck beds. A map in the Interpretive Guide marks the location of the various implements and provides details of each in historical context and use.",

Some plants, such as island manzanita and chamise, have adapted to fire by developing deep root systems and large, swollen trunk bases called burls. After a burn, these plants regenerate by sprouting from the many buds that were protected in the burls. The deep roots also make these plants ideally suited to hot, dry rocky ridges and slopes.<br /> <br /> Certain annuals, such as wild heliotrope, and perennials, such as mariposa lily, are \"fire followers\" and sprout well only after fire has cleared the chaparral. The seeds of these plants lie dormant until fire removes the shrub canopy, leaving behind a mineral-rich soil and ample sunlight. When the winter rains come, the seeds germinate and begin to grow; their roots anchor the soil and reduce erosion, while their plants carpet the landscape with a profusion of wildflowers. Each spring these annuals return, but are decreased in number as the chaparral regenerates, consuming soil nutrients and forming a closed canopy of brush that covers the land until fire begins the cycle anew.</p>",

In the distance are rolling hills, covered with grass and patches of scrubby shrubs.<br /><br />The foreman's house is a white single story house with wood plank siding and a peaked roof, and a fenced yard around three sides of the house. The roofing material and the wood trim around windows and doors is dark green. The house has several large windows. The front of the house has entry door with two large windows on its left and a smaller window and large window on its right. An additional large open shed is connected to the house, it has a large framed opening and a wooden gate. At the right corner of this shed is a tall wood plank fence, almost the height of the building, that connects to another small shed, also white with green trim. <br /><br />The left side of the main house has another entry door and two large windows. Above the windows in the eaves of the roof is a wooden vent. The back of the building has a smaller window and another door. Connected to the end of the house is another large white shed, with green trim and a large paned window.<br /><br />The house and narrow yard is surrounded by a sturdy white wooden fence with several wooden gates. The fence connects to the outer corners of the two sheds, forming a u-shaped yard around the house. Nearby, outside the fence, is another small white wooden shed on wood posts. It has a slanted top, and two doors that open towards the house. <br />",

It means 'doorway (opening) of luqtikay (West Anacapa Island),' referring to the beach landing at Frenchy's Cove.<br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> Frenchy's Cove is located on the north side of West Anacapa Island. It is the most popular anchorage on the island, providing some protection from the west wind and swell. The cobblestone beach at Frenchy's Cove is an ideal place to land, picnic, explore protected tidepools (located to the south of the cove), and snorkel. Due to the State of California's  Anacapa Special Closure - Brown Pelican Fledgling Area, the beach and anchorage is currently closed from January 1 through October 31.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Raymond \"Frenchy\" LeDreau</strong><br /> Frenchy's Cove was named after Raymond \"Frenchy\" LeDreau, an emigrant from Brittany, France, who arrived on Anacapa in 1928 prior to the establishment of the National Monument. LeDreau had studied for the priesthood but became disenchanted with the church and so took to the sea. He reportedly joined the U. S. Navy and fought in the Spanish-American War. While on leave in California he met a woman named Emma and married, producing three children. His wife died in the 1918 flu epidemic and in his grief LeDreau took up fishing, drinking and the life of a hermit.<br /> <br /> After settling on Anacapa he built or adopted several huts perched on a ledge overlooking what would be called Frenchy's Cove. With no natural water source, he gathered rainwater in barrels, and collected driftwood for fires. LeDreau focused his energies on lobster fishing, for which he constructed wood and wire traps held afloat by empty wine bottles. He sold fish to passing boats, and acted as a popular host to fishermen, and island visitors on boats, as related by historian Karen Jones Dowty:<br /> <br /> \"In his customary red flannels and a three-day stubble on his face, Frenchie would be stoking the fire from a wood pile that housed his colony of semi-wild cats. Beer and wine would be passed around. The sea stories would start and so would another day in Frenchie's Cove.\"<br /> <br /> Friends old and new brought him food and supplies in return for lobster, abalone and conversation. He was an educated man, apt to discuss literature and sing an aria in a tenor voice. LeDreau also served as watchman over caches of liquor temporarily stashed in certain caves and the chicken coop on the island during prohibition and made \"good money.\" LeDreau told Don Meadows about the time when a purse seiner loaded with 1,000 cases of Scotch whiskey approached the island in need of storage, so LeDreau showed the crew a large cave near his camp. For three days' storage he received five cases of whiskey, fifty dollars and an equal amount worth of supplies.<br /> <br /> LeDreau's livelihood could have been threatened by the creation of Channel Islands National Monument in 1938 but for his beguiling character and interest in the island's natural history. When park service biologist Lowell Sumner visited Anacapa that year to evaluate its resources, he found that LeDreau exhibited an accurate knowledge of and interest in the pelicans and other wildlife, and suggested that he be given some sort of minor custodianship and authorization to warn away would-be egg collectors. \"Mr. LeDreau was exceedingly friendly and helpful to the investigating party. He is undoubtedly a conscientious well meaning person who would be happy to assist in the preservation of the various features of the island.\" The only drawback was Frenchy's cats, but Sumner dismissed their dangers to wildlife by explaining that they were well fed by their master. \"In any event,\" wrote Sumner, \"it is recommended that the livelihood of Mr. LeDreau not be interrupted and that he be allowed to remain on the island as long as he desires.\"<br /> <br /> By 1941 LeDreau was receiving copies of Superintendent Scoyen's letters and called an informal caretaker. Park personnel established camp with him when they visited the island, stayed in his cabins, and used his rowboat and outboard motor. LeDreau chased off vandals and reported on happenings at the island during the early years of the national monument. The only other inhabitant on the island as of June 1939 was a lobster fisherman named Cal Vollin who was said to have lived there for many years. For years Frenchy's cabins appeared in photographs of the cove area and his presence became known farther afield.<br /> <br /> Sidney Lang of Bakersfield visited with Frenchy LeDreau in 1950 when he and friends established camp for a week at Frenchy's Cove. Lang considered LeDreau to be a hermit who enjoyed company:<br /> <br /> \"We invaded his privacy without notifying him or seeking permission. This seemed to please him rather than perplex him. From the first he was friendly and helpful. He greeted us with all of the expressions of happiness of which a Frenchman is capable short of kissing us on the cheek. He made us feel that we had been long expected and that he was glad we had arrived.\"<br /> <br /> Lang described LeDreau's bouts with alcohol, his expertise at locating fishing spots and his dirty cabin, where the walls \"were nearly obscured by smoke from the kerosene stove and lamps and the grease from many skillets of sea food.\" But Frenchy had a fine view of the ocean through the shack's window, and his personality made up for any shortcomings in housekeeping. Lang wrote that LeDreau's attire \"seemed to fit his situation but did not invite close association. His cap, shirt and pants were stained, spotted, and glazed from toiling with things of the sea. Long underwear gasped for fresh air where loose buttons and shirt sleeves allowed it to escape. It took only minutes to find that his character contrasted with his outward appearance.\"<br /> <br /> The National Park Service allowed LeDreau to stay as a caretaker into the 1950s. Superintendent Scoyen visited with Frenchy in the fall of 1950 and then wrote to his superiors that \"Mr. Raymond (Frenchy) LeDreau still maintains residence on the island. Neither Frenchy nor his shack show any change, except that additional junk has accumulated around the place . . . I think all are agreed to leave the old Frenchman undisturbed.\" A bureaucrat in the San Francisco office agreed with Scoyen's assessment, writing that LeDreau \"does a little lobster fishing and is quite old, and may well be permitted to end his days there. His cabin is clean, but the surroundings should be better policed . . . .\"<br /> <br /> Raymond LeDreau continued to act as the caretaker and greeter at Anacapa until, at age 80, falling from the cliff near his shack, sustaining severe injuries. He was reportedly found semi-conscious and bloody by passing fishermen, who took him to the mainland for treatment. He apparently returned to his cove but the park service decided that it would be in his best interest to leave the isolated island and so, after 28 years on Anacapa, Raymond \"Frenchy\" LeDreau was taken to the mainland where he immediately and mysteriously disappeared.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>First National Park Service Ranger Station</strong><br /> In a pilot study of the island in 1959, Frenchy’s Cove was selected for park headquarters since it was a site that had been established as a development area under Mission 66. Seasonal rangers arrived on Anacapa on June 15, 1959, and went to work setting up the area so that it resembled an area under the protection of the Park Service.  Debris at Frenchy’s Cove was cleaned up, three of the four shacks were given temporaray repair, and an outhouse was constructed.<br /> <br /> In July 1959, Anacapa Island was finally opened to visitors with ranger service provided. Positive publicity caused visitor numbers to rise dramatically by the end of summer: the ranger counted 103 boats with 427 passengers, and 93 campers, 48 of whom stayed for more than five days.  <br /> <br /> Anacapa Island continued to be popular with private boaters and visitors arriving on boats operated by Island Packers, the first transportation company to operate as a park service concession beginning in 1968 with day and camping trips to Frenchy's Cove for $7.50. Over 50 years later, Island Packers still transports visitors to the park.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Pelicans of West Anacapa Island</strong><br /> Except for the beach at Frenchy's Cove, West Anacapa is designated as a Research Natural Area and is closed to the public in order to protect nesting California brown pelicans.<br /> <br /> Anacapa Island, the other Channel Islands, and all their associated islets and offshore rocks comprise one of the largest breeding centers on the west coast for sea birds and shore birds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, and the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> On the north slopes of West Anacapa, California brown pelicans typically nest and raise their young from January through October. In fact, West Anacapa has the largest and most consistently used brown pelican nesting colony on the West Coast of the United States. Brown pelicans will abandon their nests if disturbed, leaving the eggs and chicks defenseless against predators such as gulls and ravens. A serious disturbance can cause an entire colony to be abandoned. For this reason Anacapa's isolation is a critical factor in the successful nesting of these seabirds.<br /> <br /> But even the island's isolation could not protect California brown pelicans from human impacts. The gathering of eggs, disturbance of rookeries, and pesticides have all been detrimental. The pesticide DDT nearly caused the pelican to become extinct as a breeding species on the west coast of the United States. In 1970, on neighboring Anacapa Island, only 552 nesting attempts were made with just one chick surviving. On October 13, 1970, the brown pelican was listed as an endangered species.<br /> <br /> Today, the recovery of the California brown pelican and other seabrid species continues as their isolated island home is ensured protection within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of the seabird populations in southern California.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Tidepooling</strong><br /> The only accessible site on Anacapa Island for tidepooling is near Frenchy's Cove on the south side of West Anacapa Island. There is no land access to Frenchys Cove or any other tidepools from East Anacapa. All access if via private vessel. <br /> <br /> The trail from Frenchy's Cove to the tidepools is currently closed. So access to the tidepools is only via skiff on the other side (south side) of Frenchy's Cove near Cat Rock.<br /> <br /> Due to their relative isolation and protection, the tidepools in Channel Islands National Park are some of the best within southern California. Anemones, sea stars, urchins, limpets, periwinkles, chitons, barnacles, mussels, and many other beautiful species can be seen at numerous pristine tidepool sites such as Frenchys Cove.<br /> <br /> The area between the land and the sea is not distinct, but is a zone of transition. This area may be covered with water during high tide or exposed to sunlight during low tide. Life in this intertidal region must be the hardiest within the marine environment-able to withstand hours of exposure and the incessant pounding of the energy-filled surf.<br /> <br /> Intertidal life has adapted to the sea and the land. When looking at a tidepool area, notice how plants and animals may be found in certain areas and not in others. Those living in the upper splash zone are tolerant to sunlight, heat, and water loss and have either a means to \"shelter\" themselves or the ability to move into an area of greater moisture. An animal with a tightly closed shell or a shell firmly attached to rock will hold water within, so that it does not require water surrounding it at all times. Animals found in rock crevices and submerged pools usually require more moisture to prevent them from drying out.<br /> <br /> How an animal feeds often depends on its ability to move. An animal that moves about is able to search for its food. Some graze the rocks for algae, while others feed on settled debris. An animal that remains stationary feeds on food particles suspended within water.<br /> <br /> Because space is a limiting factor, there is competition between organisms. Many animals and plants are found in a small area, some may live on each other, or use an old shell as a surface on which to live. This is one important reason why collecting is not permitted-you may be taking away a home.<br /> <br /> Although hardy against the forces of nature, the plants and animals of the intertidal zone cannot entirely endure the impact of humans. Since individuals interact with one another, minute changes in the area could disrupt the entire community. While exploring, please keep in mind these tidepool tips:<br /> <br /> - Watch your step! The rocks can be very slippery and there may be small animals on the rocks.<br /> - Keep an eye on the waves. The surge can sneak up on you.<br /> - Take your time and look carefully. Tidepool organisms are often very small and camouflaged.<br /> - Do not collect anything! Not only is it unlawful, but if animals and shells are taken, there may be nothing left for others to enjoy.<br /> - If you pick up an animal to observe, please place it back where it was found. That particular spot is its home territory.<br /> <br /> Although you may not know the animals by name, through simple observation a great deal of information can be learned. Consider, for example, what keeps it from drying out? Why doesn't it get swept out to sea? Does it search for food or wait for food to come to it?</p> <p><strong>Tidepool Species</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Snails</strong></em><br /> Snails are abundant in the intertidal zone. Varieties include black and brown turban snails and periwinkles. At low tide some nestle tightly in crevices. Most snails graze on algae, scraping them off the rock with a rough, tongue-like radula.<br /> <br /> Snails can withdraw into their shells, behind a trapdoor-like bony plate called an operculum. This protects them from predators and water loss. Some exude mucus that coats their shells and helps them stick to the rocks and hold in precious moisture.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Barnacles</strong></em><br /> Related to crabs and shrimp, barnacles cluster on surfaces at every level of the intertidal zone. They attach themselves headfirst and use their feathery legs to absorb oxygen and net food that floats by. Barnacles' shells are a series of connected, overlapping plates. Some are volcano shaped and some are camouflaged to their surroundings. Varieties include the acorn, pink, and gooseneck barnacles.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>California Mussel</strong></em><br /> Mussels anchor themselves with tough, fibrous threads. Shells up to six inches long protect these animals. Their gills provide the mussels with oxygen and help them capture food. When the tide is in, they open just enough to filter the seawater for tiny floating plants and animals. As one of the most abundant animals in the intertidal zone, mussels are also a key food source for others in the food chain.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Chiton</strong></em><br /> Chitons cling to the rocks with their foot at low tides. When the tide is high and it is safe, they venture out to eat by scraping algae, bacteria, and diatoms off the rocks. Chitons blend in well with the rocks in the intertidal zone. Their shells are made of eight overlapping plates. Like pill bugs on land, these armored animals roll up to protect themselves from predators. The three-inch-long mossy chitons are one of several species here. Their mossy looks come from the stiff hairs that fringe their edges and the algae that often grow on their shells.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Algae</strong></em><br /> Algae are near the bottom of the tidepool food web. They use photosynthesis to capture light energy from the sun. Large algae cling to the rocks and seafloor with root-like holdfasts. Algae range in size from single-celled organisms to 150-foot-long giant kelp. Rockweed algae grow to 10 inches in the intertidal zone. They mark the high-tide line like \"bathtub rings.\" Coralline algae, once mistaken for coral, are crunchy due to calcium carbonate in their cell walls. They range from flat to three inches in height.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Sea Star</strong></em><br /> Sea stars use hundreds of suction-cupped feet to move and capture food, which they eat with stomachs in the center of their bodies. Bat stars have extra webbing between their arms. They graze over algae and rocks in the intertidal zone, eating tiny algae, plants, and animals. The most common sea stars found in the intertidal zone are the ochre stars. Up to 18 inches across, they can be found in ochre (orange), yellow, red, brown, or purple. They feed upon mussels from the intertidal zone, freeing up habitat for other species that thrive there.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Striped Shore Crab</strong></em><br /> These crabs live on the sand, mud, or rocks near tidepools, splitting their time between land and sea. They eat algae and animals-dead or alive. Striped shore crabs make the tiny clicking sounds that are heard near tidepools. As they outgrow their shells, they cast them off. The new underlying soft shells harden quickly. Striped shore crabs are common on the Channel Islands. They are striped in black and green, with red or purple claws, and grow to two inches in diameter.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Anemone</strong></em><br /> The giant green anemone and the slightly smaller aggregate anemone are both common in tidepools. They look very similar to one another. However, the giant green anemone is usually solitary, and the aggregate anemone lives in colonies of many individuals. Both are blue-green in color, which comes from algae living inside of them. Their tentacles capture and paralyze small animals, dragging them to their central mouths to be digested. At low tide they retract their tentacles to stay moist. Sand and gravel stick to their surfaces, serving as camouflage. They grow to 10 inches wide.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Sea Urchin</strong></em><br /> Sea urchins live in the intertidal zone to 100 feet in depth. At low tide, they take shelter from waves in rock cavities. At other times they roam in search of their favorite foods, giant kelp and other algae. Urchins have hard, round shells called tests, covered with spines. Spines can break off in human skin and be painful and hard to remove. Related to sea stars, they have similar tube feet that stick out between their spines for maneuvering and capturing prey. They also have a central mouth with strong jaws and sharp teeth.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Sandcastle Worm</strong></em><br /> The sandcastle worm is about two inches long and forms tubes of cemented sand grains that shield the worm's body. These worms build huge colonies of honeycombed, reef-like structures that often appear like a rock to the casual observer. If you look closely you can see the openings of individual worm houses.<br /> <br />  </p> <p><strong>Ethnographic Island Place Names</strong><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</strong></em> </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Hypsypops rubicundus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The garibaldi, a member of the damselfish family, is the California State marine fish and its possession is illegal. It is easily identified by its bright red orange coloration. The garibaldi is found in temperate waters off the California coast from Monterey Bay southward and northern Baja coastline waters of Mexico. The Channel Islands, and in particular the southern isles, are the more predominant habitat for this species.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The species is one of the brightest colored fishes off the southern California coast. Adults are bright orange</li> <li>The garibaldi gets its common name, garibaldi, from the 19th century Italian leader by the same name whose famous army wore flashy red/orange colors into battle.</li> <li>One reason the garibaldi is protected in California is its popularity as a salt water aquarium fish, for which a law was passed to make it illegal to remove them from their habitat.</li> <li>The male garibaldi is the housemaker of a mating pair. It not only selects the nesting area, but also prepares it meticulously for the laying of eggs by the female.</li> <li>Being fiercely territorial, it is not uncommon for the garibaldi to chase away divers from its nesting area.</li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Garibaldis are round, plump fish with flowing pectoral and tail fins, and staring yellow eyes. Swimming through dark reefs and brown kelp, they're a jolt of glowing orange, a reminder that garibaldis are relatives of coral-reef damselfish. Juvenile garibaldis are deeper orange, with sparkling spots of blue and blue-trimmed fins. <sup>1</sup> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The garibaldi is primarily found off the coast of California. They have a home range from Monterey Bay down to the Baja California peninsula, and around the Channel Islands as stated by Eschmeyer, W., E. McFarland, J. Chess in their 1983 work, the field guide to Pacific coast fishes of North. However, the northern Baja coastline of Mexico, as well as islands such as Guadalupe, is home to this species.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> In contrast to most other species of the damselfish family that have tropical reefs as their habitat, the garibaldi lives in cooler temperate waters. Their habitat ranges from the shallow subtidal regions down to depths of approximately 100 feet. The garibaldi occupies shallow rocky reefs near where the intertidal and subtidal zones meet. Here they swim in and around the kelp forests that are prevalent in this habitat. These kelp forests are a critical habitat element as they provide potential protection from predators, are a source of food, and are important for reproductive success for this species.<br /> <br /> Garibaldis have a clear idea of exactly where their territories end, and two males may be seen peacefully grazing less than two feet apart—as long as each remains on his own turf. Female garibaldis tend to be less protective of their territories, perhaps because they contain no eggs. Territoriality seems to be tied to the rocky reef—periodically, garibaldis gather without drama in the waters above the reef. These \"kelp socials\" seem to be a way for garibaldis to investigate each other and may help females choose their mates.<sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The garibaldi feeds during the day on a diet of primarily bottom-dwelling invertebrates including worms, small anemones, sponges, bryozoans, crabs, shrimps, small shellfish, and sea stars. Given the opportunity, females eat their own eggs. Their diet of sponges may contribute to their bright colors.<sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> According to observational research conducted by the Monterey Bay Aquarium, it is discovered that much of the work of raising babies is handled by the male. Upon becoming an adult, a male garibaldi picks out a promising stretch of reef—a sheltering nook plus a smooth expanse of rock wall—where he will live for the rest of his life. Each March, males work feverishly to tidy their nest areas, by removing debris, carrying away sea stars or urchins that wander along, and biting away all the plant growth except for a few species of red algae. These he trims so they're about an inch long—perfect places for thousands of eggs to rest.<sup>4</sup><br /> <br /> Once a male's nest is perfectly trimmed, the next challenge is attracting the attention of female garibaldis. Beginning in April and lasting until fall, females ready to lay eggs make outings to look for good nests. They signal their interest by swimming with their fins sticking straight up. Males try to entice these females over by swimming loops with their bright orange bodies. At the same time, they thwack together the teeth in their throat to make a thumping sound that (they hope) the female can't ignore. If she takes notice, he swims straight over to his nest, hoping she will follow. Females are very choosy, often visiting 15 nests or more before making up their minds. The Monterey Bay Aquarium states that the male garibaldis are fiercely protective of their territories and they don't get sentimental after attracting a mate. As soon as a female has laid her eggs, the male chases her away before she has the chance to munch on any other eggs in his nest, then fertilizes the eggs by scattering his sperm over them. He also chases off any other creatures that venture too close.<sup>4</sup><br /> <br /> In the end, it seems to make little difference how well tended a male's nest is or how well he swims loops. Females are reluctant to lay their eggs in an empty nest—they look for a nest with eggs from at least one other female (and up to 20 females). This means male garibaldis have to work hard to attract their first females; after that, many others come—sometimes lining up to lay eggs at a popular nest. Females are also picky about the age of the eggs in a male's nest. They prefer to deposit theirs alongside other freshly laid, bright-yellow eggs. Garibaldi eggs hatch in two to three weeks, so eggs with just a few days' head start would hatch earlier and have an advantage over younger hatchlings. In a bizarre turn of events, males sometimes eat the older eggs in their nests (gulping down 200 at a time), gambling that they'll attract even more females in the next day or so.<sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), there are no major threats known for this species. However, this fish was historically exploited by the aquarium trade (Moe, 1992). Conservation actions have been taken by the State of California to fully protect the species and it may be present in some Marine Protected Areas in Mexico and United States as shown in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA 2006).<sup>3</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"https://channelislands.noaa.gov/\">Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/cab\">Cabrillo National Monument</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/183367/0\">International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animal-guide/fishes/garibaldi\">The Monterey Bay Aquarium</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/garabaldi/\">Aquarium of the Pacific</a></li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Stereolepis gigas</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Giant Black Sea Bass is a unique species if not for any other reason than its extraordinary size. Its presence in the waters off of California and Baja California has played an important role in the health of the ecosystem in which it lives. With a position at or near the top of the food chain, it provides the balance required for an optimum marine environment. Prior to the 1950’s, this species of bony fish was very common to the near shore waters of Southern California. Due to over-fishing, their population was reduced to critically low levels. Back as far as the late 1970’s, the California Department of Fish and Game made it illegal to spearfish these giants. In 1982, both commercial and sport fishing of Giant Black Sea Bass was banned in California waters.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>It is estimated that the Giant Black Sea Bass is capable of growing to lengths of over 7 feet and weighing over 700 pounds.</li> <li>The largest species ever caught by a sport fisherman with rod and reel, weighing 563 pounds, was caught off of Anacapa Island in 1968. <sup>5</sup></li> <li>Up to 60, 000, 000 eggs are produced by the female during the spawning season. <sup>6</sup></li> <li>Giant sea bass was originally assigned to the grouper family, Serranidae, but was later placed in a new family called the Percichthyidae<sup>.7</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong> <p>As implied by its alternative name of giant sea bass, the most dramatic feature of this fish is its conspicuous size, capable of growing over 700 pounds! The bulky, robust fish has a large mouth, small teeth and a distinctive single, strongly-notched dorsal fin (4). Almost as impressive as its size is the variation in color displayed by this species. Juveniles start out life as a bright orange color with black spots, with the orange turning a more bronzy purple as the individual grows and the spots fading as the fish gets darker. Large adults often appear solid black to grey, with a white underside, but retain the ability to display large black spots. Indeed, black sea bass are in fact capable of rapid and dramatic color changes, from dark above and light below to displaying white mottling or simply changing from jet black to pale grey. These color changes are thought to act as a form of communication between individuals or to be an indication of stress. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> According to the Pfleger Institute of Environment Research, the giant (black) sea bass range from Humboldt Bay to the tip of Baja California, and occur in the northern half of the Gulf of California. Within California this species is rarely found north of Point Conception. “PIER sponsored research from 2000 to 2005 focused on documenting the movements of giant sea bass around the northern Channel Islands. PIER researchers placed acoustic tags in giant sea bass within PIER’s Channel Islands Acoustic Receiver array. The study revealed that many of the giants leave Anacapa Island during the winter months and return in May or June while others remain at the island year round. Data on the seasonal movement patterns, spatial distribution, feeding habitats and potential spawning aggregation locations have been compiled and are awaiting publication. ” <sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Adult giant sea bass seem to prefer the edges of near shore rocky reefs (35 to 120 feet) and are often associated with kelp beds. At certain times of the year adults can be found well away from the reef, foraging over sandy bottom and routinely associated with spawning squid. <sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> “The most important prey items of the giant (black) sea bass’, based upon research by PIER, 4 “are sting rays, skates, lobster, crabs, various flatfish, small sharks, mantis shrimp, blacksmith, ocean whitefish, red crab, sargo, sheephead, octopus, squid and an occasional kelp bass or barred sand bass. Giant sea bass are not built for sustained speed, and the vast majority of their prey is organisms that live on the bottom. These organisms, located crawling across the substrate or buried just below the surface, are drawn into the mouth of a giant sea bass by the vacuum produced when the huge mouth is rapidly opened. Certainly some mid-water fish are ambushed and sucked in by giant sea bass lurking in the shadows of the kelp.” <sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> As shown in a study by Sepulveda, C., S. Aalbers. 2009. \"The Giant Sea Bass: Status of Biological Knowledge” , “Male giant sea bass reach sexual maturity at about 40 pounds, while females mature at sizes of 50 to 60 pounds. These sizes correspond to an age of 11 to 13 years for either gender. During a three mouth spawning period from July to September, females may produce up to 60,000,000 eggs. After fertilization, the eggs absorb water and swell up, measuring up to 1/24th of an inch in diameter. Eggs are positively buoyant and float to the surface. After hatching, larvae drift and feed on plankton for about a month until they sink and start their juvenile phase.”6</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Based upon a 2008 assessment, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (IUCN), states that the Giant Black Sea Bass was classified as a Critically Endangered species by IUCN in 1996. This assessment presents additional information to support that assessment. The American Fisheries Society classified the species as Threatened. <sup>7</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/black-sea-bass/stereolepis-gigas/\">Wildscreen Arkive</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://channelislands.noaa.gov/\">National Marine Sanctuary</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fishbase.de/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?ID=3310&AT=Giant+seabass\">FishBase</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://pier.org/ca_coastal_gs_bass_biological.php\">Pfleger Institute of Environment Research</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.dfg.ca.gov/marine/anglingrecords.asp\">California Department of Fish and Wildlife</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Stereolepis_gigas/\">Animal Diversity Web</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/20795/0\">IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a></li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Aquila chrysaetos</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The golden eagle is one of the largest, fastest, and nimblest raptors in North America. Lustrous gold feathers gleam on the back of its head and neck;a powerful beak and talons advertise its hunting prowess. Although they had never bred historically on the Channel Islands, golden eagles were able to colonize the northern Channel Islands in the mid 1990s due to the presence of an alien prey base (feral pigs and mule deer fawns) and the absence of the native bald eagle, extirpated from the islands by chemical contaminants and by direct persecution. Golden eagles also preyed on the vulnerable island fox, nearly driving foxes to extinction. Subsequent conservation efforts successfully relocated golden eagles to the mainland, and restored bald eagles to the Channel Islands, helping to bring back the island fox from the brink of extinction.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The golden eagle is the most common official national animal in the world, being the emblem of Albania, Germany, Austria, Mexico, and Kazakhstan.</li> <li>Golden eagles are important to many Native American cultures, which include the bird and its feathers in ceremonies.</li> <li>Golden eagles are not typically found in the densely populated eastern portion of the United States, but are found instead in the rugged solitude of the sparsely populated western U.S.</li> <li>Although capable of killing large prey such as cranes, wild ungulates, and domestic livestock, the golden eagle subsists primarily on rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, and prairie dogs.</li> <li>Golden eagles possess astonishing speed and maneuverability for their size. Diving from great heights, they have been clocked at close to 200 miles per hour.</li> <li>Nests are huge, averaging some 5-6 feet wide, and 2 feet high, enclosing a bowl about 3 feet by 2 feet deep. The largest golden eagle nest on record was 20 feet tall, 8.5 feet wide.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The golden eagle is a large, dark brown raptor with broad wings. Its size is variable: it ranges 28-33 inches in length, has a wingspan of 6-7 feet , and weighs 7 to 13 pounds.Sexes are similar in plumage but display the typical reversed sexual dimorphism of raptors, in which the female is much larger than the male.Adults are primarily brown, with gold on the back of the crown and nape, and some grey on the wings and tail. Tarsal feathers range from white to dark brown. In addition, some birds have white epaulettes on the upper part of shoulder feathers on each wing.The bill is dark at the tip, fading to a lighter horn color, with the waxy top of the beak, called a cere, colored yellow.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Golden eagles can be found throughout much of the northern hemisphere, typically in sparsely populated areas</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The golden eagle seeks open areas with large, rocky cliffs or large trees, such as pines, cypress or sycamores. They are often found in alpine parkland, open forests and mid-elevation clear-cuts, as well as in chaparral or plains areas.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The golden eagle's predominant prey in North America are medium-sized mammals such as rabbits and ground squirrels. Other species, such as foxes, martens, young deer are also taken. Ranchers have historically battled the eagle because of its ability to prey upon small livestock such as lambs and small goats. In Channel Islands National Park, predation by the golden eagle on the endemic island fox brought the latter close to extinction, with golden eagle breeding on the islands supported by feral pigs on Santa Cruz Island and deer on Santa Rosa Island Other important prey include birds; indeed,virtually any bird, from jays to swans, are potential prey. Golden eagles also r steal prey from other raptors. While not as large as some vultures, golden eagles are capable of driving vultures and other raptors from carrion. Golden eagles are avian apex predators, meaning they make their living at the top of the food chain (nothing preys on a golden eagle).</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Golden eagles usually mate for life. They build several eyries within their territory and use them alternately for several years. These nests consist of heavy tree branches, upholstered with grass when in use. Old eyries may be quite large as the eagles repair their nests whenever necessary and enlarge them during each use. If the eyrie is situated on a tree, supporting tree branches may break because of the weight of the nest. The female usually lays two eggs between January and September, depending on the locality. The eggs vary from all white to white with cinnamon or brown spots and blotches. They start incubation immediately after the first egg is laid, and after 40 to 45 days the young hatch. They are covered in fluffy white down and are fed for fifty days before they are able to make their first flight attempts and eat on their own. In most cases only the older chick survives, while the younger one dies without leaving the eyrie. This is due to the older chick having a few days' advantage in growth and consequently winning most squabbles for food. This strategy, called asynchronous nesting, is useful because it makes the parents' workload manageable even when food is scarce, while providing a reserve chick in case the first-born dies soon after hatching. Golden eagles invest much time and effort in bringing up their young; once able to hunt on their own, most golden eagles survive many years, but mortality even among first-born nestlings is much higher, in particular in the first weeks after hatching.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Some golden eagles live in their nesting territory all year. Others may migrate due to lack of food during the winter. As a rule, they do not have to migrate large distances because of their excellent hunting abilities.</p> <p><strong>Golden Eagle Status in the Park</strong><br /> From 1999 through 2006, golden eagles were live-trapped and removed from the park, because golden eagle predation was the primary source of mortality for island foxes and was responsible for the massive island fox decline from 1994–2000.</p> <p align=\"start\">Until the 1990s, golden eagles never bred on the Channel Islands. Golden eagles nested on both Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands from the mid-1990s to as recently as 2006. They were able to colonize the islands because of several factors. First, bald eagles were absent from the Channel Islands, having disappeared by the mid-20th century due to both human persecution and the presence of DDT in the environment. Territorial bald eagles may have deterred goldens from establishing. Second, golden eagles arriving on the islands found food sources that were not available prior to the ranching era: feral pigs on Santa Cruz Island, and mule deer on Santa Rosa.</p> <p align=\"start\">In order to mitigate golden eagle predation on island foxes, The Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, with the support of the Park Service and The Nature Conservancy, relocated golden eagles to distant sites on the California mainland. A total of 44 golden eagles, including 10 eaglets born on the islands, were trapped and relocated, and monitoring indicates that none have returned.</p> <p align=\"start\">Other ecosystem-wide actions, such as the removal of feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island and the restoration of bald eagles, have tipped the balance in favor of island foxes and away from continued golden eagle use of the islands. As of 2009 the occasional golden eagle visits the islands, but the level of predation on island foxes is negligible;all three island fox subspecies in the park are recovering rapidly.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> In North America the situation is not as dramatic as it has been in in temperate Europe, North Asia, North Africa, and Japan, but there has still been a noticeable population decline. The main threat is habitat destruction which by the late 19th century already had driven golden eagles from some regions they used to inhabit.In the 20th century, organochloride and heavy metal poisonings were also commonplace, but these have declined thanks to tighter regulations on pollution. Within the United States, the golden eagle is legally protected by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. Available habitat and food are the main limiting factor nowadays.

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Eschrichtius robustus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The gray whale is probably the best known of the great whales of the northeastern Pacific and the one most frequently seen in and around Channel Islands National Park and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. Owing to its extraordinarily long migration on a coastal route that passes close to large human populations, it is probably the most viewed of any large whale.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Adult Pacific Gray Whales can be 45 feet long and weight up to 33 tons. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Gray whales make one of the longest migrations of any mammal--10,000 miles round trip. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Baby gray whales average 15 feet in length and weigh about a ton. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>A mother gray whale's milk is more than 50% fat. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Gray whales can live 40 to 60 years. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Gray whales were nearly hunted to extinction in the 19th century. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Gray whales have been protected from exploitation by the International Whaling Commission since 1946. As a result, current populations are considered close to their pre-exploitation numbers. <sup>3</sup></li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong></p> <p>According to <em>FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World</em>\"by Jefferson, T.A., S. Leatherwood, and M.A. Webber, \"Gray whales are easy to identify. They are intermediate in robustness. The upper jaw is moderately arched, and the head is acutely triangular in top view and slopes sharply downward in side view. The flippers are broad and paddle-shaped, with pointed tips. The flukes have smooth S-shaped trailing edges, with a deep median notch. There is a dorsal hump about two thirds of the way back from the snout tip, followed by a series of 6 to 12 smaller \"knuckles\" on the dorsal ridge of the tail stock. There may be several (generally 2 to 5) short, but deep, creases on the throat that allow compression of the throat during feeding. Although young calves are dark charcoal grey, all other gray whales are brownish grey to light grey. They are nearly covered with light blotches and white to orangish patches of whale lice and barnacles, especially on the head and tail. These patches of ectoparasites are very helpful in distinguishing this species. The mouth contains 130 to 180 pairs of yellowish baleen plates, with very coarse bristles. The blow is bushy, heart-shaped when viewed from ahead or behind.\" <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> According to the National Marine Mammal Laboratory, the eastern North Pacific stocks of gray whales spend their summer around the northern Bering and southern Chukchi seas between Alaska and Russia. In the winter, many of these gray whales migrate to the warm waters of the west coast of Baja California, Mexico, and the southeastern Gulf of California. .A large numbers of whales, particularly females with newborn calves, utilize coastal lagoons on the Pacific coast of the Baja peninsula. There is also a western North Pacific population of gray whales found along the coast of eastern Asia that is totally isolated from the eastern North Pacific population. This western North Pacific population of gray whales, estimated to include fewer than 100 individuals, remains highly depleted and its continued survival is questionable. <sup>7</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales prefers shallow, coastal waters and feeds over oceanic continental shelves around the northern Bering and southern Chukchi seas between Alaska and Russia during the summer. 7 During the winter, the Marine Bio Conservation Society states that the gray whales inhabit shallow coastal waters of the eastern and western North Pacific often sighted along the North American Pacific Coast between the arctic and the equatorial lagoons of Baja California, Mexico. The southward journey takes 2-3 months and the whales remain in the lagoons for 2-3 months allowing calves to build up thick layers of blubber for the northward migration. The return trip north takes another 2-3 months and mothers and calves travel very near shore on the northbound migration to avoid their main predators. <sup>8</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The gray whale is unique in the use of its baleen feeding technique as contrasted to other baleen whales.According to the National Marine Mammal Laboratory, \"Gray whales are bottom feeders, and suck sediment and the 'benthic' amphipods that are their prey from the sea floor. To do this, they roll on their sides and swim slowly along, filtering their food through coarse baleen plates, of which they have 130-180 on each side of the upper jaw. In doing so, they often leave long trails of mud behind them, and \"feeding pits\" in the sea floor.\"Whereas, when other baleen whales find a food source, they open their mouths underwater taking in water as well as the prey. The whale then partly shuts its mouth, pressing its tongue against its upper jaw, thus forcing the water to pass out sideways through the baleen, which retains the prey such as krill, a major food source that it then swallows.</p> <p>Gray whales, as described by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), are stated to feed primarily on swarming mysids, commonly called opossum shrimps, tube-dwelling amphipods, and polychaete tube worms in the northern parts of their range, but are also known to take red crabs, baitfish, and other food (crab larvae, mobile amphipods, herring eggs and larvae, cephalopods, and megalops) opportunistically or off the main feeding grounds. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The Society of Marine Mammalogy states that gray whale breeding and calving are seasonal and closely synchronized with migration.. Sexual maturity is attained between 6 and 12 years of age. Breeding is highly synchronous, with females coming into estrus during a three-week period from late November to early December, which coincides with the onset of the southward migration. Conception is restricted to a short period between late November and early January. If there is no conception, a second estrus may occur 40 days later when the whales are on the wintering grounds. Females normally reproduce at intervals of two years, producing a single calf every other year.</p> <p>The gestation period is estimated to be 12 to 13 months, with a mean calving date in mid-January. Some calves are born during the southward migration while others are born near or on the wintering grounds of the west coast of Baja California, Mexico, and the southeastern Gulf of California. Calves are weaned and become independent by seven to nine months old while on the summer feeding ground. <sup>6</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the Society of Marine Mammalogy, the population is presently estimated at about 20,000 animals. In contrast, the western gray whale population, which was also decimated by whaling, remains highly depleted today and its continued ability to survive is of concern. The most recent assessment of this population suggests that about 130 individuals exist. 6Based upon a 2008 assessment, by Taylor, B.L. and Notarbartolo di Sciara, G. (Cetacean Red List Authorities) of the ICUN, the gray whale is given a listing of \"Least Concern\" since when the two subpopulations are assessed as a single species-level unit, the estimated population size is above the threshold for a threatened category, and the population has increased over the last three generations. The recent apparent decline in the eastern subpopulation is considered to be a fluctuation and is not inconsistent with a \"Least Concern\" listing. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li>Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary: <a href=\"http://channelislands.noaa.gov/animals/graywhal.html\">http://channelislands.noaa.gov/animals/graywhal.html</a></li> <li>FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the <em>World</em>, Jefferson, T.A., S.

Entering this area without a ranger is a violation of federal law.</b></em> </strong><br /> <br /> Near the 817 foot tall Green Mountain, lies the wreckage of the B-24 Liberator bomber. On July 5, 1943, the B-24 bomber crashed on the north side of Green Mountain, killing all 12 men aboard. The \"Liberator\" was part of a fleet of new bombers that eventually numbered 18,000. The air armed forces used dozens of Liberators for training, using mostly young and inexperienced crews, which led to numerous crashes. \"It had a long, thin, high lift wing which made it suitable for long distance bombing missions . . . generally it was not regarded as the safest aircraft in the sky,\" wrote crash historian R. W. Koch. \"Yet, it played a major role in helping to win the war in Europe and Asia.\" The 56,000-pound planes were equipped with four 1,200 horsepower engines, had a maximum speed of 303 mph and a range of 3,200 miles. The B-24-E Liberator in question was built by the Ford Motor Company in Michigan and was new; its personnel was assigned to the 2nd Air Force, 34th Bomb Group, 7th Bomb Squadron at Salinas Army Air Base in Salinas.<br /> <br /> The plane, with a crew of 12 aboard, had been searching for ten crew members of another B-24 that had crashed near Santa Barbara the day before after the crew had bailed out somewhere near the coast. The search plane left Bakersfield towards Santa Barbara, and was to continue to Point Conception and Salinas, but disappeared after reporting over Santa Barbara at 8:00 a.m. Evidently, the B-24 flew too low in foggy conditions while approaching Point Conception; the ceiling that day was 300 to 500 feet and the plane had no radar. The bomber struck the side of 831-foot Green Mountain and practically disintegrated, killing all aboard and spreading wreckage over an area of up to ten acres. Although the crash site was only a short distance from the Coastal Lookout Station, it was at least two miles from the barracks and no one heard the impact and no one saw the wreckage.<br /> <br /> Robert Brooks came on the wreckage some time later when he was gathering sheep near Green Mountain, although government records state that sailors based at the island's radio/weather station found it on March 19, 1944. Whatever the date, the late discovery reflected on the diligence and state of readiness at this lookout station at the time of the crash. Stan Sokolis and Robert McKee, stationed on the island radio unit, reportedly assisted in the task of removing the bodies and salvaging important plane parts, although much of the scattered wreck was left on the site.<br /> <br /> In 1954 some hikers found the wreckage and human bones. Authorities were notified who could not find a record of the wreck; they dispatched an investigation team on a Coast Guard cutter in the night. Unfortunately, the cutter collided in the darkness with the yacht Aloha off Point Mugu, killing two aboard. After rescuing three survivors the cutter returned to Los Angeles, then again commenced its mission to San Miguel Island. There they found the wreckage but soon received a radio message stating that records of the wreck had been located and that the investigation was off.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "If you are standing on the main trail near Green Mountain, facing the rounded summit, you are facing north. The main trail is generally running east - west. To your right, or east, amid the low vegetation, large white, sand-like patches are visible. The patch closest to the main trail is the Caliche Forest. Another rounded summit, San Miguel Hill, rises in the distance. Behind you, to the south, is the ocean. To your left, the main trail continues toward Point Bennett, which is out of sight. <br /><br />Green Mountain is shaped like a gently rounded hill. It is covered with various grasses and clusters of small green plants. A narrow side trail snakes through the grassy mountainside to the summit. <br /><br />The hillside is covered with various grasses including wild oats, foxtail, and rip-gut brome. These all grow to be tall, with slender dark green leaves. Later in the growing season, they also send up hollow erect stems with spikelets. True to their name, these are thin, oblong, pointed pods with needle-like spikes at their tips. These spiky tips are usually and inch or two long, and have barb-like, stiff hairs that face backwards, so they will easily get stuck, like Velcro, in clothing, hair, or animal fur. <br /><br />The look of the spikelets varies between the grass types. Wild oats spikelets dangle from the stems, pointing downward, like individual ornaments on a Christmas tree branch. Foxtail has upright clusters of multiple, brush-like spikelets that resemble the tail of a fox, or the kind of broom used to sweep a floor at home. Rip-gut brome's spikelets are spaced out individually along the stem, sticking out at various angles. Its long, narrow green leaves are also hairy and rough. <br />",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Arctocephalus townsendi</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Little is known about Guadalupe fur seals because they were hunted almost to extinction before researchers began to study them. Although named fur seals, Guadalupe fur seals are members of the otariidae family, meaning they are more like sea lions. They have long flippers and external ear flaps (unlike true seals that have short front flippers and ear holes). By looks alone, juvenile Guadalupe fur seals are very difficult to tell apart from juvenile California sea lions and northern fur seals. Increasing numbers have been seen on California's Channel Islands, and in recent years, several Guadalupe fur seals have stranded along the central California coast. It is not yet known whether these strandings are a result of El Niño events (warmer water pushing their prey northward) or a sign of Guadalupe fur seals returning to their former range. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The Guadalupe fur seal was nearly hunted to extinction in the 1880's, with the known population numbering only 7 individuals in 1892. <sup>2</sup></li> <li>Guadalupe fur seals breed on Isle de Guadalupe, Baja California, Mexico. But in 1997, a pup was born on San Miguel Island, California. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Mothers and pups identify each other by unique vocalizations and scent. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Guadalupe fur seals nurse their pups for 8 to 9 months.<sup>3</sup></li> <li>The seals are not migratory, but a male and his females will occasionally disperse to new areas. <sup>2</sup></li> <li>They can dive to a depth of 180 feet for about 2.5 minutes. <sup>2</sup></li> </ul> <br /> <br /> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The fur of Guadalupe fur seals is brownish gray dorsally, with a silvery and yellowish-gray \"mane\" on the nape of the neck. Their snouts are pointed, with a rust-orange color on the sides. This species has great sexual dimorphism. Adult males usually weigh about 275 pounds, and may get up to 350 pounds. Females weigh about 110 pounds, rarely over 120. Males grow to slightly over six feet in length and females to four and one half feet in length.<sup>6</sup> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Guadalupe fur seals breed on Isla de Guadalupe and Isla Benito del Este off the coast of Baja California, Mexico.Guadalupe fur seals are sighted as far south as the Mexico / Guatemala border, and as far north as the Point Reyes National Seashore in California.In 1997 one Guadalupe fur seal was born on San Miguel Island off the California coast. <sup>3</sup><br />  </p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Guadalupe fur seals are found in coastal rocky habitats and caves in the tropical waters of the southern California/Mexico region. Their hauling out habitat is close to the water, as a means to keep cool and protect them from heat exhaustion, owing to their thick fur, which requires them to swim during the heat of the day to protect them from heat exhaustion. Even the territorial males must abandon their territories to cool off in the surf during the middle of the day. <sup>3</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Guadalupe fur seals feed mainly at night on squid, mackerel, and lantern fish by diving up to depths of 65 feet (20 m).</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Guadalupe Fur Seals are polygynous, with males establishing territories that are occupied by an average of six females. Pups are born from mid-June to August with a median birth date of 21 June. Male tenure on territories lasts at least as long as 31 days. Males defend territories with vocalizations, displays, and mutual displays with neighboring bulls. Fighting between males is rare once territories are established. Females select only male territories that provide cover and shade from the sun and all territories occupied by females are fronted by water and include tidal pools. Adult females enter the water daily, presumably for cooling, while otherwise \"ashore\" attending their pups. Most animals breed in small caves, grottos, and cliff and boulder areas on the rugged east coast of volcanic Guadalupe Island. A small breeding colony was discovered on the east side of the easternmost parts of the San Benitos Islands in 1997, and it appears to be growing annually. During the breeding season of 2007, Guadalupe Fur Seals were seen on the three islands of San Benito.<sup>5</sup></p> <p align=\"justify\">Females returning to the rookery for the first time usually arrive at night or early in the morning. Interest by a female to become pregnant once again occurs 5-10 days after a female gives birth, and females can leave for their first foraging trip right after mating, or stay on the colony for another few days before departing. Foraging and attendance patterns are not well-known but the limited information indicates that females may travel from 700 to 4,000 km during feeding trips lasting from 4 to 24 days. Pups are weaned at 9–11 months, and females with pups can be seen on or around the San Benito Islands throughout the winter and into the spring. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The species was considered extinct after most of the population was killed in 1928 but it was rediscovered in 1954. The Guadalupe fur seal is now fully protected by Mexican national legislation, the Isla de Guadalupe having been declared a pinniped sanctuary in 1975. It is protected in the U.S. portion of its range by Californian law, as a Threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and as a Depleted and Strategic species under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act. <sup>4</sup></p> <p>According to the ICUN List of Threatened Species, the reduction of this species took place more than three generations (30 years) ago, and its population is now increasing. It is restricted to a single location during the breeding season, but there are no immediately obvious threats that seem likely to drive it to Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short time period;it is, however, close to meeting criterion D2 for Vulnerable, and so it is listed as Near Threatened. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/guadalupe-fur-seal/\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/guadalupe-fur-seal/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Arctocephalus_townsendi/\">http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Arctocephalus_townsendi/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/pinnipeds/guadalupefs.php\">http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/pinnipeds/guadalupefs.php</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.pinnipeds.org/seal-information/species-information-pages/sea-lions-and-fur-seals/guadalupe-fur-seal\">http://www.pinnipeds.org/seal-information/species-information-pages/sea-lions-and-fur-seals/guadalupe-fur-seal</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/2061/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/2061/0</a></li> <li>FAO Species Identification Guide.

    "bodyText": "<p><em>pʰts̓awapʰ hoti is the Chumash word for Gull Island. It means 'house of cormorant.'<br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> Gull Island is a small rocky island approximately 55 feet high, located on the south side of the island about a mile off shore from Punta Arena. The place name appears on the June 1882 U.S. Coast Survey map Pacific Coast from Santa Monica to Point Conception.<br /> <br /> In 1934, a survey station was located on Gull Island \"on the highest and north westernmost hump of the main section of Gull Island\" surveyor by Charles K. Green. An automatic light was installed near the south edge of the nearly flat top shortly after the survey station was established.<br /> <br /> <b>An Ideal Isolated Home</b><br /> Gull Island and Santa Cruz Island are home to eleven different species of nesting seabirds and shorebirds, including ashy storm-petrels, Brandt's cormorants, Cassin's auklets, pigeon guillemots, and black oystercatchers.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island, the other Channel Islands, and all their associated islets and offshore rocks are vital habitat for seabirds and shorebirds, providing essential nesting and feeding grounds for 99% of seabirds in southern California and important wintering areas and stopover points for shorebirds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, and the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> Thirty shorebird and twelve seabird species have been recorded, including: half of the world's population of ashy storm-petrels and western gulls; 80% of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets; the only major breeding population of California brown pelicans in the western U.S.; and the the largest colonies in southern California of Cassin's auklet, western gulls, Scripps's murrelets, rhinoceros auklets, tufted puf fins, ashy storm-petrels, double-crested cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and black storm-petrels.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>Impacts to Seabirds</b> </strong><br /> Seabirds in the park and throughout southern California are impacted by many factors including contaminants, oil spills, invasive species, and changes in the ocean environment. For example, the introduction of DDT, a long-lived pesticide, into the marine environment has severely impacted seabird populations at the islands. Before DDT was banned in the 1970s, California's brown pelican population suffered nearly complete reproductive failure.<br /> <br /> On land, predation and habitat disturbance by invasive species have impacted seabirds. At Anacapa, introduced black rats preyed heavily on seabird eggs and chicks severely depleting populations of Scripps's murrelets. Black rats still prey on seabird populations on San Miguel. At Santa Barbara Island, seabirds were decimated by cats and habitat has been marginalized by years of over grazing by introduced livestock and rabbits. Seabird habitat has also been severely impacted by grazing of non-native animals on Santa Cruz Island. On Scorpion Rock, but human disturbance caused the entire colony to be abandoned by the 1930s.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>Seabird Monitoring and Restoration</b> </strong><br /> Today, the gradual recovery of these species continues as their isolated island home is ensured protection within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of the seabird populations in southern California.<br /> <br /> On Santa Cruz Island, these efforts have focused on closing off public access to certain habitat critical sea caves and restoring seabird habitat on Scorpion and Orizaba Rocks. These rocks are important nesting islets for burrow-nesting seabirds. To restore seabird habitat on these islets, restoration efforts have included removing non-native vegetation, revegetation with native plants, installation of nest boxes, and closures to protect nesting seabirds. For more information about seabird restoration visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/photosmultimedia/seabird-restoration.htm\">Seabird Restoration Videos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.montroserestoration.noaa.gov/restoration/seabirds/santa-cruz-island/\">Montrose Settlement Restoration Program</a> .<br /> <br /> <u><b>Ocean Habitat</b></u><br /> <br /> <strong><b>Mixing of Waters and the Diversity of Marine Life</b> </strong><br /> The Channel Islands lie within a large embayment known as the Southern California Bight-an area just below Point Conception where the California coastline turns sharply to the east. Within this area, the sea floor is comprised of canyons, banks, escarpments, sea mounts, and deep basins (the Santa Cruz Basin off the island's south coast is deeper than the Grand Canyon). Nutrient-rich waters upwelling from these depths mix and mingle with cool waters from the north (California Current) and warm southern waters (California Countercurrent), creating the Santa Barbara Gyre-a swirling eddy that circulates nutrients and supports a wealth of marine plants and animals, from giant kelp forests and blue whales to tiny crabs and plankton. Here, northern and southern species overlap, creating a transition zone between the Oregonian and Californian marine biogeographic provinces. Santa Cruz Island lies in the middle of this transition zone. The western half of the island harbors numerous northern species, while southern species are more common on this eastern end of the island.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island also serves as the meeting ground for seabirds and shore birds that rarely occur together, such as black oystercatchers from the north and American oystercatchers from the south. Both species, as well as hybrids between the two, have nested at Fraser Point on the island's west end. Other northern birds, such as pelagic cormorants and pigeon guillemots, overlap with additional southern species, such as Scripps's murrelets and California brown pelicans.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>The Giant Kelp Forest</b> </strong><br /> From this vantage point, one also has the opportunity to gaze upon another part of the park-the marine environment. One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park (six nautical miles around each island is part of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary).<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm below one may be able to see or hear California sea lions. These playful animals are often spotted just to the west of Potato Harbor, hauled-out on the rocks. Sea lions, along with a variety of other marine species, depend upon the extensive kelp forests that can be found around Santa Cruz Island and the other Channel Islands. While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California coastal mainland, the islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of algae that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing plants on earth-it can grow 2 feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales seeking a plankton snack.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use tooth-paste are also using a little bit of kelp as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredientcalled algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine plants such as kelp provide the earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have completely altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the century.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>Marine Protected Areas</b> </strong><br /> However, with the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls and fishing regulations, transplantation of kelp, public education, and various research programs some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provide a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 Marine Reserves (including the Scorpion Marine Reserve in the waters below you from Potato Harbor to Scorpion Rock), recreational fishing and commerci;al harvest are prohibited; limited fishing and harvest are allowed in two Marine Conservation Areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.<br /> <br /> <b>Ethnographic Island Place Names</b><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Phoca vitulina</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The California Channel Islands play an important role in the life cycle of many large marine mammals that live along the west coast of North America.. Harbor seals, <em>Phoca vitulina</em>, can often be spotted on rocks near the water's edge with their head and flippers elevated in order to be warmed by the sun's rays. <sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Harbor seal pups can swim at birth and can dive for up to 2 minutes when they are only 2-3 days old. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Harbor seals are estimated to reach an average lifespan of 40 years in the wild. In captivity, the longest recorded lifespan was 47.6 years. <sup>2</sup></li> <li>Harbor seals can dive to depths of 1400 feet and remain underwater for nearly 30 minutes without resurfacing.<sup>2</sup></li> <li>Their sensitive whiskers acoustically detect sound waves, which is useful for catching prey. <sup>2</sup></li> <li>Contrasted to other pinnipeds, harbor seals are not sexually dimorphic;meaning that is no significant differences is size between females and males. <sup>5</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Pacific harbor seals have spotted coats in a variety of shades from white or silver-gray to black or dark brown. They reach five to six feet in length and weigh up to 300 pounds. They are true or crawling seals, having no external ear flaps. True seals have small flippers and must move on land by flopping along on their bellies. <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Harbor seals are found north of the equator in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In the Pacific, they range from Alaska to Baja California, Mexico.<sup>1</sup> Harbor Seals are typically found near shore.They are found throughout the California Channel Islands including all five Islands in Channel Islands National Park.On San Miguel Island 1,100 harbor seals breed annually on Point Bennett, which is also an extraordinary haul out area for four other pinniped species.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> They favor near-shore coastal waters and are often seen on islands, rocky coastlines, sandy beaches, mudflats, bays, and estuaries.They often choose to rest close to the water so they have quick access to the water in case of a threat. <sup>1, 5</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Harbor seals are carnivores that consume mostly fish. Despite regional variation in individual diets, the overarching goal of harbor seals is to keep foraging efforts low by eating what is abundant and easily caught. Adults eat mostly fish, consuming the fish whole or head first. Preferred medium-sized fish species include codfish, hake, mackerel, and herring. They also eat octopus or squid, as well as crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp. Because newly weaned pups have poorly developed diving abilities, their primary diet consists of crustaceans that are easier to catch. Harbor seals weighing about 220 pounds eat about 11 to 15 pounds of food per day. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> In California, harbor seal pups are born between February and April and weigh about 20 to 24 pounds at birth. If born prematurely, harbor seals retain a whitish lanugo coat (which is usually lost before birth). A pup can swim at birth and will sometimes ride on its mother's back when tired. Pups make a bleating noise that sounds like \"maaaa\". After about four weeks, the pups are weaned. Adult females usually mate and give birth every year. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species considers the harbor seal to be a species of Least Concern. Spring brings harbor seal colonies to rookery beaches that are accessible to humans. Sometimes a pup and mother become separated due to disturbance by beachgoers. Unfortunately, this severely decreases the pup's chance for survival. The worldwide harbor seal population is estimated to be 500,000 individuals. The number estimated to live in California was 34,000 in 2009. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/pacific-harbor-seal/\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/pacific-harbor-seal/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Phoca_vitulina/\">http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Phoca_vitulina/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/pinnipeds/harborseal.htm\">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/pinnipeds/harborseal.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=12\">http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=12</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/harbor_seals/facts.htm\">http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/harbor_seals/facts.htm</a></li> </ol>",

    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a sandy dirt road, more than 300 feet long, running roughly east to west, from the ocean side near the landing dock road, toward the ranch barns. There are 6-foot high wooden fences on the north and south sides, creating a long, narrow corridor. To the east is a glimpse of the ocean. Toward the southeast, just beyond the fence, a long line of eucalyptus trees form a windbreak. The fences on the north side of this road, and some of the south side, are part of a series of ranch corrals. The corral fences are constructed of posts, with four wooden plank rails, each about one foot by twelve. As you walk west along the road, toward the ranch buildings, on your left, you will see a long pen that parallels the eucalyptus windbreak. About half-way down the road, on the left is another pen with a large water trough. At the far end, straight ahead, is a large corral, adjacent to a blacksmith shop barn. A little to the right, farther away, is a larger horse barn with a large corral connected to it. Turning around to return east, back along the same road toward the ocean, this larger pen feeds into smaller pens, ending with a row of six small pens connected by a narrow fenced corridor",

    "audioDescription": "On the valley floor, within the protection of a wide canyon is the Scorpion Ranch housing complex that consists of a two-story ranch house with a kitchen, bakery with a built-in masonry oven, dining area and two rooms upstairs for housing ranch staff. A bunkhouse and a storage shed, about the size of a garage, are also within the 5-foot-high wooden split rail fence that surrounds the compound. Gardens, shrubs and fig trees edge the buildings. The two-story, adobe Scorpion Ranch house, now the visitor center with exhibits, is tucked in close to the canyon walls and faces the open valley to the south. The ranch house was built in 1886 of rubble-wall masonry and rests on a stone and mortar foundation. The building has a rectangular plan that measures 51 feet by 18 feet. It has a shed roof and walls that are 20 inches thick and composed of local stone, adobe bricks, mortar covered with white stucco, and limestone. Windows across the face of the building provide natural light. The first floor has two main rooms, both are open to the public with exhibits and audio visual components that describe the natural and cultural history of the area. The bakery is at the west end of the building and also contains exhibits. The bunkhouse is located immediately south of the adobe ranch house. Built in 1914, this one-and-a-half story wood frame structure has a simple, gable-roof and white board-and-batten siding.",

Horned larks favor short grasses and bare ground habitat.</p> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong><br />   <ul> <li>Larks return to their birthplace after every migration (a characteristic known as philopatry).<br />  </li> <li>Because of their philopatric behavior, local populations have adapted to the color of their habitat, resulting in 15 distinct subspecies in the West.<br />  </li> <li>The use of mowed areas around airstrips has allowed the horned lark to colonize regions where no other suitable habitat may exist nearby, such as heavily forested areas.<br />  </li> <li>Adult horned larks eat primarily weed and grass seeds, but they feed insects to their young.<br />  </li> <li>Many collective nouns have been used to describe a group of larks, including an \"ascension\", \"chattering\", \"exaltation\", \"happiness\", and \"springul\" of larks.</li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Unlike most other larks, this is a distinctive-looking species on the ground, mainly brown-grey above and pale below, with a striking black and yellow face pattern.The summer male has black \"horns\", which give this species its common name.Vocalizations are high-pitched, lisping or tinking, and weak.The song, given in flight as is common among larks, consists of a few chips followed by a warbling, ascending trill. <p>The island subspecies, <em>insularis</em>, shows all of the characteristics typical of change in the island birds including darker color, a longer broader bill, longer tarsi, and longer toes. They also have shorter wings and tail. This subspecies has some streaking below.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Besides breeding the Channel Islands, the horned lark breeds in Alaska and Canadian Arctic, coastal Canada, and south throughout all of the U.S. except in the Southeast. Horned larks winter from southern Canada southward;also found in Eurasia.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Larks are common to abundant residents in a variety of open habitats, usually where trees and large shrubs are absent. It is found from grasslands along the coast and deserts near sea level to alpine dwarf-shrub habitat above tree line In winter, flocks in desert lowlands and other areas augmented by winter visitants, many migrating from outside the state.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Adult horned larks eat primarily weed and grass seeds, but they feed insects to their young.1 The horned lark searches for food by walking along the ground.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The horned lark breeds from March through July, with peak activity in May. The lark pair nests solitarily;with two to five gray or green eggs spotted brown, which are laid in a nest made of grass lined with feathers and soft materials and built in a shallow depression, natural or dug by the female. Incubation ranges from 11 to 12 days and is carried out mostly by the female. A pair frequently raises 2 broods in a season. Incubation is 10-14 days;altricial young tended by both parents. Young leave nest at 9-12 days, and can fly 3-5 days later.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The global population of this bird does not show signs of decline that would necessitate inclusion on the IUCN Red List. For this reason, the current evaluation status of the Horned Lark is Least Concern.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/horned_lark/id\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/horned_lark/id</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdzilla.com/birds/Horned-Lark/bent_life_history.html\">http://www.birdzilla.com/birds/Horned-Lark/bent_life_history.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/691/overview/Horned_Lark.aspx\">http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/691/overview/Horned_Lark.aspx</a></li> <li>California's Wildlife.

    "bodyText": "<p>The horse barn, sometimes called the saddle barn, no doubt dates from the heyday of the More sheep era. It was probably built in the mid-1870s and contains graffiti dating from the 1880s. It is presumed that the Mores used the barn for horse stables, tack rooms, wagon and feed storage, and lodging for visiting sheep shearers during the season.<br /> <br /> No documents have been found that definitively state the uses of the barn by the Mores, although the fiesta described in an 1893 article may have taken place in this building:<br /> <br /> \"For the \"Spaniards,\" the grand finale was always a kind of fiesta, mostly dancing in the shearing barns that were swept clean, with polished floors and gay decorations. To the music of guitars and a piano they celebrated the end of another strenuous season of labor with its neatly stored harvest of precious wool.\"<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers used the barn for stabling horses, tack rooms, feed storage, vehicle storage, and mechanic's shop. The Navy used part of the barn to store their vehicles until the 1970s, and Vail & Vickers parked their trucks and tractor there often. A photograph of the barn taken in the 1910s shows it painted white. The Vails installed a corrugated metal roof in the 1950s and painted the barn red at that time.<br /> <br /> The barn is the largest structure in the ranch complex. It is a four-level building with a long main gable flanked by shed roofs in a traditional California barn design (rectangular footprint, simple roof line, vertical board siding, no adornment).<br /> <br /> The barn can be divided for description purposes into three long rooms. The east portion is a long shed containing a colt shed, horse stalls with feed bins, and an area with saddle racks where horses were prepared for ranch use. On the northern side of this area are two tack and storage rooms with a stairway up to the loft.<br /> <br /> The central portion of the barn is two stories with wood plank floors and large door openings at either end. The lower part was used for feed storage, a carpenter shop, a tack room, and an area for storing fence materials. One wall contains graffiti dating to the 1880s and 1890s. The larger area of the upper story of the central barn was used for storing additional feed; the use of this area as seasonal lodging is likely. Historical graffiti is found on the west wall of the loft near the north end. The inscriptions, appearing in black paint or ink, include: \"John Hicks/Nov. 11, 1896/Santa Rosa/Island;\" \"Henry Lopez/Oct. 31/1896\" (Lopez' inscription is accompanied by fancy but crude decorations); and \"May 1, 1897.\"<br /> <br /> The west portion is another shed off the main structure, with an old rough wood floor laid diagonally and otherwise one large room open at both ends with large doorways. A mechanic's pit is located near the north end of this room.<br /> Maintenance by the NPS to this barn and the blacksmith shop barn has included painting, reroofing, and upgrading the electrical system.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\"><strong>Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </strong></a><strong> </strong></p>",
    "audioDescription": "The horse barn is the largest structure in the ranch complex, about 30 feet tall. The rectangular wooden building is red with white trim, with entrances on the shorter ends of the building. The barn has vertical board and batten siding and a long gabled, or simple peaked, roof, flanked by lower shed roofs, on either side. The roofing material is corrugated metal. <br /><br />The barn is built into a slope. On the uphill, or east, side the long wall of the barn forms part of a large corral, with corral fencing connected to the barn at the ends. <br /><br />On both of the shorter, north and south, ends of the barn, concrete ramps lead up to two rectangular openings. One is about the size of a garage door opening. The other, on the downhill side, is large enough for a tractor, and leads to a passage that goes all the way through the barn to the other side, with a five foot high metal gate at each end. Centered below the peaks of the roof, on each end, are small windows, shuttered with red boards. At one end, a large outdoor light is mounted to the exterior wall, under the eaves. On the other end, a circular metal automobile wheel rim is attached to a door frame. <br /><br />Inside the barn, the roof is supported by long wooden posts and beams every 15 feet or so., Light fixtures are attached to the lower beams. There is an old rough wood floor laid diagonally. <br /><br />A road wraps around the lower, or west, side of the barn. There is a long row of rocks piled at the base of the barn.<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Carpodacus mexicanus frontalis</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The endemic subspecies of house finch, <em>m. frontalis</em>, is found only on Santa Barbara Island and the other southern Channel Islands. The northern islands all have the same subspecies as the coastal mainland does, so they are not endemic. The distinguishing characteristic of this sub species is a heavier bill and some evidence of vocalization differences. The degree of red color in house finches is somewhat dependent on diet. House finches on the southern islands can frequently be found nesting on the cactus. This bird is primarily a ground feeder and particularly favors seeds from composites.<br /> <br /> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The house finch was originally a bird of the western United States and Mexico. In 1940 a small number of finches were turned loose on Long Island, New York, after failed attempts to sell them as cage birds (\"Hollywood finches\"). They quickly started breeding and spread across almost all of the eastern United States and southern Canada within the next 50 years.</li> <li>The total house finch population across North America is staggering. Scientists estimate between 267 million and 1.4 billion individuals.</li> <li>House finches feed their nestlings exclusively plant foods, a fairly rare occurrence in the bird world. Many birds that are vegetarians as adults still find animal foods to keep their fast-growing young supplied with protein.</li> <li>The oldest known house finch lived to be 11 years, 7 months old.</li> <li>The red of a male house finch comes from pigments contained in its food during molt (birds can't make bright red or yellow colors directly). So the more pigment in the food, the redder the male. This is why people sometimes see orange or yellowish male house finch.</li> <li>Females prefer to mate with the reddest male they can find, perhaps increasing the probability of obtaining a capable mate who can do his part in feeding the nestlings.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The adult male of the species typically has a bright red breast, rump, forehead, and supercilium;center of crown, nape, and back are brown and dark wing has two white wing bars and pale edges to flight feathers. Belly and rest of underparts are mostly white, with clear demarcation from red breast, and bold streaks on flanks. Some birds have an orange tone to breast. Contrastingly, the adult female has gray-brown plumage, streaked above and below, with two pale wing bars and pale edges to flight feathers. Juveniles will show the same appearance as the adult female. The distinguishing characteristics of the subspecies found in Santa Barbara Island is a heavier bill and some evidence of vocalization differences.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> House finches are very adaptable and can be found in a wide range of habitats, from arid deserts to open woodlands and shrubby fields. They are common in both urban and suburban areas as well, extending from the southern edge of Canada through central and southern Mexico. Populations are less dense in the central Great Plains states and the southeastern United States. The endemic subspecies of house finch, <em>m. frontalis</em>, is found only on Santa Barbara Island and the other southern Channel Islands. The northern islands all have the same subspecies as the coastal mainland does, so they are not endemic. These birds generally do not migrate, but they can become nomadic in search of food. In the park, house finches declined on San Miguel from 1993 to 2003, for unknown reasons, and have increased in recent years.<br /> <br /> <strong>Habitat</strong><br /> House finches are native to open and desert habitats, but have expanded their range, naturally and through introductions, and now can be found in almost any kind of human-altered habitat. They prefer edge habitat and are absent from dense coniferous forests.<br /> <br /> <strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The vast majority of the house finch's diet is vegetable matter--seeds, buds, berries, and nectar. They feed their young regurgitated seeds. They eat a few small insects, especially aphids, but are primarily seed- and fruit-eaters at all times of the year.<br /> <br /> <strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> House finches are monogamous, and pairs tend to form while the birds are in their winter flocks. Some pairs may stay together year round. They choose a wide variety of nesting sites, and will nest in man-made objects such as window ledges and holes in buildings. Ivy growing on buildings or trees creates many nesting sites. Nests may also be located in conifer trees, hanging planters, and old nests of other birds. The first requirement is a solid base with some overhanging material. The female builds most of the nest, which is an open cup of grass, weeds, twigs, leaves, and rootlets, lined with feathers and other fine material. The female incubates 4 to 5 eggs for 13 to 14 days while the male brings her food. The female broods the young for the first few days after they hatch, and the male continues to bring food. The female then joins the male in bringing food to the young. The young leave the nest after 12 to 15 days and may be fed by the male for about two more weeks, while the female starts a second clutch. Pairs may raise three or more broods each season.<br /> <br /> <strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The house finch has an extremely large range and appears to be increasing, and so does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under any of the criteria of the IUCN Red List. It is instead identified as a species of Least Concern.<br /> <br /> <strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/house_finch/lifehistory\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/house_finch/lifehistory</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://enature.com/fieldguides/detail.asp?recnum=BD0050\">http://enature.com/fieldguides/detail.asp?recnum=BD0050</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/bird/house_finch\">http://www.birdweb.org/birdweb/bird/house_finch</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://birding.about.com/od/birdprofiles/p/housefinch.htm\">http://birding.about.com/od/birdprofiles/p/housefinch.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106008856/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106008856/0</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.J., R.C.

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The spectacular humpback whale, that performs acrobatic leaps, is common within the Channel Islands National Park and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary boundaries. Generally, the humpback whale can be seen from mid-May to mid-September on whale watching boats servicing the public in the vicinity.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Humpback whales produce the most diverse range of sounds known for any whale and some of the longest and most varied sounds of any animal in the world. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>The estimated population on the United States west coast is estimated at about 597 individuals. (2010 review by Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary).<sup>4</sup></li> <li>Some humpback whales make a round trip journey of 10,000 miles.<sup>4</sup></li> <li>The humpback whale gets its name from fact that the dorsal fin sits on a large \"hump\" on the back, which is noticeable when the whale arches its back and dives.4</li> <li>They are also seen swimming on their backs with both flippers in the air. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>Humpback whales are slow swimmers compared to other whales. They can reach up to 16 miles per hour, but average only 2-9 miles per hour.<sup>4</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> As described by the \"FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World\", the the humpback whales flippers are extremely long (up to one-third of the body length) with a series of bumps, including 2 more prominent ones in consistent positions on the leading edge, more-or-less dividing the margin into thirds. The flukes have a concave, serrated trailing edge, and the dorsal fin is low and broad based (usually sitting on a hump). The head has a single median ridge, and the anterior portion of the head is covered with many bumps (each containing a single sensory hair). The body is black or dark grey dorsally and may be white ventrally, but the borderline between dark and light is highly variable and seems to differ by population. The flippers are white on the ventral side and vary from all-white to mostly black on the dorsal surface. The ventral side of the flukes also varies from all-black to all-white. There are 270 to 400 black to olive baleen plates, and 14 to 35 ventral pleats extending back to the navel or beyond. The blow is rather low and bushy for a balaenopterid, reaching only 3 m. It may sometimes appear V-shaped. At close range, the humpback is one of the easiest whales to identify. At a distance, however, there can be some confusion with other large whales, especially blue and sperm whales. When a closer look is obtained, humpbacks are generally unmistakable. As far as size, the adult humpback whales are 45 to 56 in length, with females being about 6 feet longer than males on the average.Newborn calves are 16 to 18 feet in length and weigh up to one ton. Weights of at least 35 tons or 70, 000 pounds are attained by adults. Individual humpback whales can be identified using photographs of the distinctive markings on the undersides of their flukes.<sup>2</sup><br />   <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Humpbacks are widely distributed in all oceans, ranging from tropical wintering grounds near islands and continental coasts to open-ocean temperate and sub-polar summering habitats.<sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Humpbacks feed and breed in coastal waters, often near human population centers, and this helps make them one of the most familiar of the large whales. They migrate from tropics (breeding areas) to polar or sub-polar regions, reaching the ice edges in both hemispheres (feeding areas);their migrations take them through oceanic zones.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> According to NOAA Fisheries, the humpback whale has a unique way of feeding by using a technique of lunging through patches of krill (small shrimplike crustaceans) or fish and then gulping vast mouthfuls of water. Humpbacks also use an impressive skill called \"bubble-netting\" which involves swimming in a spiral beneath their prey and blowing out air from their blowholes. This \"net\" of bubbles surrounds the shoal of fish or krill, then, the humpback swims through the center with its mouth open. These techniques are the most diverse, as well as spectacular of all baleen whales.<sup>3,5</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Humpback whales are probably old enough to mate at about 7 years of age.Females are pregnant for about 11 to 12 months and get pregnant approximately every two to four years. Calves are born on wintering grounds in tropical and subtropical regions and are able to swim and can grow 1.5 feet (0.5 meters) per month while nursing.Females nurse their new born calves in warm, shallow water.</p> <p>Humpbacks have very complicated courtship behaviors and many male humpbacks can surround a female and compete with each other to get close to the female.Sometimes the competition involves males lunging at and bashing into each other. Males also appear to compete for access to estrus females, by using their now well-known complex songs as part of their breeding display. At the end of the mating and calving season, humpback whales migrate to cold, productive waters to feed.<sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Humpback whales were not a favorite target of Yankee whalers. However, because of their relatively slow swimming speeds and coastal habits, they were an early target of modern large-scale commercial whaling, beginning with shore based whaling in many areas. Commercial whalers hunted humpbacks into the 20th century, reducing the number of the species to possibly 10 percent of the original population worldwide.</p> <p>Humpback whales are now protected by the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, making it illegal to harass or kill a humpback whale in United States' waters. In addition, the International Whale Commission gave humpback whales worldwide protection status in 1966. Since then it has been illegal to hunt humpback whales anywhere in the world. Steps are also being taken to try to reduce ship collisions and fishing gear entanglement.</p> <p>In August 2008, the IUCN, International Union for Conservation of Nature, changed humpback's status from Vulnerable to Least Concern, although two subpopulations remain endangered. The United States, through a review conducted by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, is considering listing separate humpback populations, so smaller groups, such as North Pacific humpbacks, which are estimated to number 18,000-20,000 animals, might be delisted. This is made difficult by humpback's extraordinary migrations, which can extend the 5,157 miles from Antarctica to Costa Rica.<sup>1,4,6</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/humpbackwhale.ht\">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/humpbackwhale.ht</a>m</li> <li>FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World, Jefferson, T.A., S.

    "bodyText": "<p>Alvin Hyder, lived on the island along with his extended family from 1914 to 1922. What follows is a detailed history of the Hyder family on Santa Barbara Island. For an abridged version please visit the Arch Point or Signal Peak Trail Stop 2.<br /> <br /> Alvin Hyder acquired the Board of Lighthouses lease of Santa Barbara Island on June 16, 1914. Alvin Hyder's son, Denton O. \"Buster\" Hyder, spoke with Don Meadows in 1940, Ralph Philbrick in 1970, Ron Morgan in 1979 and with Marla Daily many times between 1986 and 1991. The following narrative has been written based on notes and tape recordings of these interviews.<br /> <br /> Alvin Hyder was born in a log cabin near Claremore, Missouri, one of twelve children. His father died while he was a young boy and in 1892 the mother brought the family to Huntington Beach. When Alvin was 14, he went to sea on a sailing vessel for two years. By 1900 he and his brother had a small boat in which they went around the various islands picking up crayfish on a regular route. In 1904 Alvin built the Nora, a 65-foot, 15-ton boat used to haul sheep to and from the Channel Islands. In the summers he used it to haul fish for the canneries. This boat burned off the coast of San Juan Capistrano. Hyder then had the 16-ton Nora II built by Fellows and Stuart in Wilmington. She was 65 feet long with an 18-foot beam, and traveled at nine knots. Hyder equipped her deck with sheep pens built of one-by-sixes.<br /> <br /> On January 16, 1916, his lease of Santa Barbara Island in hand, Hyder set out in the rain with his wife Annie and two children Nora and Buster to establish a farm and sheep ranch on the island. They took with them household goods, furniture and lumber to build a house. They saw only one house on the island when they arrived. It stood on the north side of the present landing. A bridge ran across the cove from the south side to the house, reportedly that of Chinese lobster trappers who had lived there previously. Otherwise, according to Buster, \"there was nothing but wild cats and all kinds of mice all over.\"<br /> <br /> The Hyders had visited the island for a night some years before obtaining the lease. Buster Hyder recalled staying in the lobster fisherman's shack at the landing when he was about five years old. He described the \"shaky\" bridge (it had a handrail) and remembered two or three bunks in the house; his parents slept in the upper bunk, he and his sister in the lower. A pair of skids allowed the former fishermen to pull their skiff up to the shack. When the Hyders returned in 1916, the house was gone but the bridge remained.<br /> <br /> The year previous to the families' arrival Hyder and his brothers had built a house near the edge of the island 100 yards south of and 150 feet above the landing. Built from lumber salvaged from the mainland, it had two rooms: one for Alvin and his family and the other for his brother Clarence, his wife Kelly and their four children. The house was anchored to the ground by cables so the wind wouldn't blow it off the cliff. It had no electricity. The two families arrived in January so as to be able to plant crops and take advantage of the winter rains.<br /> <br /> Hyder rebuilt the pier at the landing, where they unloaded supplies and equipment with a boom. Hyder rigged a sled on wood tracks down the steep slope between the landing and house: \"We had a sled on the track that we let up and down with a long rope. That was all volcanic rock we had to drill to cement those spikes in for the track. Talk about workin'. We done it all with pick and shovel. The tracks went right up over the top of the hill. We used the sled for getting everything heavy to the top of the island or back down. The bottom of the track was set on the landing, and when the sled would come down, we would come down, we'd fill it up.\"<br /> <br /> Buster Hyder recalled keeping the rounded out two-by-four wooden tracks greased with oil. A horse pulled the sled up the track, and the people lowered it by hand. The horse named Dan, listened for a signal from below to start hauling, and stopped in just the right place when the load was at the barn. Hyder family members widened the existing narrow trail from the landing to the houses, breaking up the volcanic rock with picks; ten-year-old Buster was then assigned to keep it clear of rocks and dirt with a shovel.<br /> <br /> Alvin and Clarence's brother Cleve and his wife Margaret also lived on the island. They mainly fished for lobster. Cleve built a house near the upper part of the landing in 1918. The one-room cabin had a shed roof and windows looking out onto the landing cove. A picket fence surrounded the yard, making a fairly picturesque scene. Tanks around the house collected rainwater off the roofs. The house was built in the middle of a drainage on a leveled area with a retaining wall; Hyder constructed a drainage ditch to keep water flowing down the canyon from flooding the house. Margaret Hyder taught school to the six island children in her house, using \"old apple boxes\" for chairs. She joined her husband lobster fishing much of the time. They built another cabin at Webster Point for convenience.<br /> <br /> A man named George Sands and his wife Effee joined the community, fished for crayfish and lived in a tent near the barn; they left after two years. Paul Wills worked as a laborer for the Hyders; he lived in a 10 by 12-foot house southwest of the double-room house. At one time around 1915 some 15 people lived on the little island.<br /> <br /> The family cooked on a coal-oil stove. Friends in fishing boats and family members transported supplies and groceries to the island. Often they traded mutton with fishermen for groceries. The water shortage ruled out planting an orchard, but the family attempted a garden. They adapted to island life to the point that Buster brushed his teeth with green coreopsis branches.<br /> <br /> Since the island had no springs or flowing water, the Hyders constructed a system of reservoirs. They built two large concrete cisterns at the house. The Hyders brought water on Nora II in twenty-five 50-gallon barrels from the mainland, piping the water to the house reservoir through a one-and-a-half-inch pipe. In 1918 they installed a Rambler auto engine to pump the water. They searched the island for water sources, even looked for fresh water deep in sea caves. Any collecting method possible would be used, no matter how disgusting. Buster Hyder cleaned the bird droppings off of the roof every year before the rains came, because the drain water went to the cistern. Buster recalled how \"you had to limit your drinking water. It had to last a year. Then it got stagnant. Many times when it was raining I'd drink water out of horse tracks. No kiddin'.\" Buster had the job of removing dead mice from the drinking water supply every day. \"Boy, it was hard to drink it. But when you don't have anything else, you have to drink it.\"<br /> <br /> The Hyders constructed two water catchment basins on the island for the livestock and crops. Alvin and Buster built a \"big dam\" on the west side near Webster Point, using two mules and a scraper. The pond filled with water draining off the west slope of the island. \"It's all hard rock under there. It stayed full of water pretty near a year because of the hard pans there.\"<br /> On the east slope of Signal Peak near Cat Canyon the Hyders had another system of reservoirs. Water running off the side of the hill was collected into concrete ditches that fed into a wooden settling tank, and then fell into the reservoir that measured about 70 by 100 feet. Buster Hyder described building the ditches when he was fifteen years old, around 1920: \"There are two ditches coming off the mountain gully, one to the north and one on the south of a bald spot. We used them both. They both come together. The ditches were made of cement. I got all the volcanic rock and sand to build these. We hauled the water for the cement over in the wagon. It had great big wheels on it. I'd fill â€˜em up with salt water, pump â€˜em full and then I'd bring them over . . . . We built forms and cemented it.\"<br /> <br /> When it rained, Alvin Hyder paid close attention to this particular reservoir system. He came out, even in the middle of the night, to make sure no water would get diverted away from the collection system. He and Buster cleaned out the concrete ditches regularly.<br /> <br /> The Hyders built a substantial barn measuring 60 by 40 feet and a stable with two stalls for their two horses; they also had two mules. They brought farming equipment to the island and set to work. The island was covered with foxtails, ice plant and jungles of coreopsis, which the Hyders called cabin stock. They cleared land for hay fields and crops by hand, pulling up coreopsis and cutting the ice plant, which was then dried and burned. They burned parts of the island annually to encourage grasses. In 1918 they burned the entire island but still found they had to pull the coreopsis. The Hyders plowed the land with a moldboard plow hitched to four horses. They grew five acres of potatoes and corn on the west terrace and 150 acres of barley on the larger and more fertile east slope. The rich soil produced plentiful barley, which was cut, baled and shipped on Nora II to the mainland fifteen tons at a time. The potato crop failed (\"too much guano in the ground . . . it burned â€˜em,\" according to Buster Hyder), and most were left to rot in the ground. They also grew hay between 1918 and 1922.<br /> <br /> \"We grew hay all the way out to where those badlands are, clear through that whole area. We planted from the foot of the mountain clear to the south end of the island . . . . We could have made money on all of our hay, too. We shipped it to the beach there on 6th Street. We sold our hay to this guy, and he went bankrupt. We lost all our feed and all our work for one year. We got skunked.\"<br /> <br /> Buster Hyder told of hauling a precious hay baler up the steep cliff only to have it slip and plunge into the water. The men rescued the baler and, with the help of a blacksmith, \"straightened it out\" and put it to work.<br /> <br /> The Hyders brought about 300 sheep to Santa Barbara Island in 1915, the first known sheep to graze there, at least in many years. Alvin Hyder bought fine Rambouillet sheep from the Caires of Santa Cruz Island. The Hyder sheep were fattened and sold for meat, but in the meantime were shorn in corrals on the west side near the reservoir. Buster Hyder watered the sheep every day, taking a bucket to the reservoir and dipping water out into wooden troughs. At shipping time, the sheep were driven into wing fences, which funneled them into pens by the landing. The Hyders lowered them down to the boat ten at a time. \"We'd hog tie them, load them into the sled, and then let it down the hill.\" After the Hyder's lease ran out, Buster returned with a herd of sheep to fatten them, living alone on the island for six months in the late 1920s.<br /> <br /> The Hyders kept goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys and geese, often feeding them broken seagull eggs. The high winds wreaked havoc on the chickens and geese: \". . . we watched more gosh darn chickens and turkeys and our stuff blow out in that ocean-blow â€˜em clear out.\"<br /> <br /> The Hyder horses and mules did much of the work on the island. Horses named Dan and Charlie performed chores such as hauling the wagon, herding sheep and transporting the Hyders across the island. Charlie died after slipping and falling over a cliff during a sheep drive at Graveyard Canyon. Dan, who knew so well the routine of pulling the cart rope at the landing, died while being loaded onto the boat as the Hyders were vacating the island. The island ranch had two mules. Jack, a hard worker who hauled loads of water and rock among other things, died of a heart attack while hauling gravel from Arch Point. The Hyders left Beck, a white mule, on the island when they left, and suspected that soon fishermen had eaten the lonely mule.<br /> <br /> In the early decades of the century, people made good money raising rabbits, marketing the meat and selling the pelts. Following the trend, the Hyders brought hundreds of pure black and pure white Belgian hares out to the island and turned them loose. At the time, feral cats roamed the island and feasted on the rabbits, as did the resident eagles. The Hyders responded by poisoning cats with strychnine-laced rabbit carcasses. Four hogs brought to the island also died from eating the poisoned rabbits, and no doubt a number of eagles died as well. Years later Buster Hyder brought hunters to the island to shoot rabbits. \"They'd go up and they'd come back with just tons of rabbits. Freeze them all down and eat them later.\"<br /> <br /> The amount of work on the island ranch was staggering. Alvin Hyder and his family members took care of the animals, crops, buildings, equipment, supplies and each other. Buster Hyder described his father: \"The ol' man got up with a lantern and went to bed with a lantern. Eight hours was just getting' started. He worked all the time. He was a hard working man who never knew when to stop.\"<br /> <br /> The Hyder lease expired in 1919 but they stayed on anyway. After seven years of hard work and frustration, they decided to leave the island in 1922. They took their twelve goats, 300 sheep, dogs and four horses to their homestead in Cuyama Valley north of Santa Barbara. Following the terms of the lease, they tore down the buildings and brought the materials to the mainland, although they failed to remove the main house. Reportedly Alvin Hyder tried to lease Santa Barbara Island for another term without success; an entrepreneur from Venice outbid him. Nevertheless, he took 250 sheep back to the island for fattening many years after their lease had run out.<br /> <br /> In 1936 Alvin Hyder and his son Buster were loading wool on San Nicolas Island. A swell came up and rolled the boat, killing Alvin Hyder. Buster went on to run a sport fishing business out of San Pedro, founding the 22nd Street Landing. He died in 1994 at age 87 on the land his father had homesteaded in Cuyama Valley.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "If you are standing at the flagpole, facing the Santa Barbara Island Visitor Center, you are on a high bluff, and the ocean is far below, on your left. You are in the middle of a coreopsis forest. Depending on the season, the coreopsis, with a thick, bare trunk, topped by a shaggy mop of yellow flowers and feathery green leaves, shaped like fluffy ostrich feathers. In late summer, fall or winter, the coreopsis will turn into waist-high brown stalks that look dead.<br /><br />The single-story beige building, has a roof made of overlapping curved red tiles. On the wall, facing you, are two wooden signs with white lettering. The one on the ocean side reads, \"Visitor Center.\" The one on the land side reads, \"Private Residence.\" Between the signs are two narrow vertical windows. Below the windows, running the length of the building are several dense shrubs. An open patio extends out on the ocean side of the building, but watch your step, as it is about ten inches above ground. Just off this patio is the door to the visitor center and a tall window with a view into the exhibit. The patio has a picnic table and an outdoor panel about sea bird habitat, described separately. Beyond this first patio is another, gated, patio, blocked by a brick wall. On the opposite side of building-the \"Private Residence\" side- is a walkway running the length of the building.",

Inspirational even on a foggy day.<br /> <br /> A cool, salty mist fills the air at Inspiration Point. Graceful gulls and pelicans soar above the foaming waves that surge across the narrow, rocky strait separating East and Middle Anacapa. Seven different species of marine birds nest on Anacapa, including western gulls, California brown pelicans, double-crested cormorants, Brandt's cormorants, pelagic cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and Xantus' murrelets. Twenty-two different species of land birds breed on the island and many other birds stop over during migration.<br /> <br /> The western gull rookery on East Anacapa is one of the main breeding colonies on the Channel Islands. Gulls have a surprisingly high chick mortality rate, as much as sixty percent. Anacapa's isolation and freedom from predators such as foxes and nonnative rats are crucial for these seabirds to successfully breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> On the north slopes of West Anacapa, California brown pelicans typically nest and raise their young from January through October. In fact, West Anacapa has the largest and most consistently used brown pelican nesting colony on the West Coast of the United States. Brown pelicans will abandon their nests if disturbed, leaving the eggs and chicks defenseless against predators such as gulls and ravens. A serious disturbance can cause an entire colony to be abandoned. For this reason Anacapa's isolation is a critical factor in the successful nesting of these seabirds. Except for the beach at Frenchy's Cove, West Anacapa is designated as a Research Natural Area and is closed to the public.<br /> <br /> From Inspiration Point you can return by the same trail or follow the longer route that loops through the lower terrace. Either way, you will experience Anacapa's unique beauty. You will also notice how isolation has allowed endemic species such as island morning glory and live-forever to flourish on the island.<br /> <br /> Today the populations of harbor seals, sea lions, and other sea mammals are recovering from the massive hunts of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The spread of alien plants such as iceplant and European grasses, as well as increased erosion along the trails, continues to threaten Anacapa's natural resources.<br /> <br /> Anacapa Island's unique resources were first recognized in 1938, when the island was proclaimed a national monument. The protection was reaffirmed and strengthened in 1980 when Anacapa was included in the newly established Channel Islands National Park. The National Park Service is preserving the island's native plant and animal communities and its historical and archeological features for future generations to study and enjoy.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>More Seabird Information</strong></u></p> <p>The Channel Islands are vital habitat for seabirds and shorebirds, providing essential nesting and feeding grounds for 99% of seabirds in southern California and important wintering areas and stopover points for shorebirds. Thirty shorebird species have recorded, including snowy plovers, willets, wandering tattlers, whimbrels, black turnstones, and sanderlings. Twelve species of seabirds depend on the rich marine resources and the isolation of these offshore islands to provide food and undisturbed nesting grounds safe from predators. The islands host half of the world's population of ashy storm-petrels and western gulls and 80% of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets. In addition, the islands are home to the only major breeding population of California brown pelicans in the western U.S.<br /> <br /> The Channel Islands are critically important to seabirds, supporting:<br /> <br /> - the largest breeding colonies of seabirds in southern California<br /> - the only breeding colonies of California brown pelicans in California<br /> - the only protected colonies of California brown pelicans and Scripps's murrelets on the West Coast of the U.S.<br /> - the largest colonies in southern California of Cassin's auklet, western gulls, Scripps's murrelets, rhinoceros auklets, tufted puf fins, ashy storm-petrels, double-crested cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and black storm-petrels<br /> - over 30 years of seabird research<br /> <br /> <strong>Impacts to Seabirds</strong><br /> Seabirds in the park and throughout southern California are impacted by many factors including contaminants, oil spills, invasive species, and changes in the ocean environment. For example, the introduction of DDT, a long-lived pesticide, into the marine environment has severely impacted seabird populations at the islands. Before DDT was banned in the 1970s, California's brown pelican population suffered nearly complete reproductive failure.<br /> <br /> On land, predation and habitat disturbance by invasive species have impacted seabirds. At Anacapa, introduced black rats preyed heavily on seabird eggs and chicks severely depleting populations of Scripps's murrelets. Black rats still prey on seabird populations on San Miguel. At Santa Barbara Island, seabirds were decimated by cats and habitat has been marginalized by years of over grazing by introduced livestock and rabbits. Seabird habitat has also been severely impacted by grazing of non-native animals on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Monitoring and Restoration</strong><br /> Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support seabird populations in southern California. Several of these projects have been funded by the Montrose Settlements Restoration Program (MSRP), a multi-agency government program dedicated to restoring natural resources harmed by DDTs and PCBs released into the environment.

The island's steep, lava rock cliffs have numerous caves and crevices that are particularly important for the increasingly rare seabird species, Scripps's murrelet and ashy storm-petrel. The largest breeding colony of the California brown pelican in the United States is Anacapa Island and a unique subspecies of deer mouse occurs only here as well.<br /> <br /> The Anacapa ecosystem, however, was degraded by the presence of non-native black rats (Rattus rattus). Rats have been introduced to over 80% of the world's islands, accounting for an estimated 40-60% of all bird and reptile extinctions in the world. On Anacapa, rats were introduced prior to 1940, most likely as stowaways on ships to the island. They have had large impacts on nesting seabirds, preying heavily on eggs and chicks of seabirds as their food source. Approximately 40% of Scripps's Murrelet nests on Anacapa have shown evidence of egg predation. Rats also prey directly on the native island deer mouse.<br /> <br /> In the mid-1990s, the park teamed with the Island Conservation and Ecology Group (ICEG) to determine if and how rats could be eradicated from Anacapa Island. ICEG, active internationally in the restoration of island ecosystems through the eradication of non-native species, was aware of several successful eradications of rats from islands, particularly in New Zealand. Rats have been eradicated on over 100 islands worldwide by applying rodenticide bait; trapping alone has never succeeded.<br /> <br /> Anacapa Island presented special challenges. The island has extensive steep cliffs, making placement of bait into the territory of every rat difficult. The endemic deer mice would feed on any bait that was attractive to rats. The endangered California brown pelican, extremely sensitive to disturbance, breed and nest on a large portion of the island during eight months of the year.<br /> <br /> Following extensive consultation with experts, the park and ICEG determined that rats could be eradicated through the distribution of bait pellets with brodifacoum, the anticoagulant used in the majority of successful rat eradications. This product contains half the amount of rodenticide that is found in products that homeowners commonly purchase in the local grocery store and it would not accumulate in the environment since it breaks down into harmless carbon dioxide in water.<br /> <br /> Fortuitously, the American Trader Trustee Council (ATTC), consisting of California Department of Fish & Game, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, had court settlement monies resulting from an oil spill in southern California. The purpose, in part, of the settlement monies was to restore seabird populations injured by the oil spill. The trustees supported eradication of the black rat from Anacapa Island because it is one of the most significant islands for breeding seabirds in southern California.<br /> <br /> The bait application (from a hopper suspended under a helicopter) was scheduled during the fall, the end of the dry season, when rats were very hungry and both visitation and bird populations were low. Protection of the native deer mice had two components: a) holding a small population of mice in captivity, and b) maintaining deer mice in the wild by treating East Anacapa one year prior to treating Middle and West Anacapa.<br /> <br /> Phase I, application of bait to East Anacapa Island, was completed in December 2001 and Phase II, treatment of Middle and West Anacapa, was completed in fall 2002. Extensive ecological monitoring pre- and post-rat eradication was conducted to determine the environmental impacts of the project. This monitoring has found substantial recovery of rare seabirds and other native wildlife on Anacapa Island following the eradication of rats. Mouse populations have returned to normal and they are breeding abundantly in the wild, while juvenile side-blotched lizards and slender salamanders are thriving in the absence of rats.<br /> <br /> Numerous environmental groups endorsed the project including the American Bird Conservancy, Pacific Seabird Group, California Audubon Society, Endangered Species Recovery Council, Audubon Living Oceans, and Jean-Michel Cousteau's Ocean Futures. American Bird Conservancy President, George H. Fenwick, stated, \"The Anacapa Island project is precisely the type of well-designed, extensively researched, and responsibly implemented program that the American Bird Conservancy supports and encourages. The long-term benefits of rat eradication on Anacapa Island are enormous for the conservation of one of North America's most distinctive ecosystems.\"<br /> <br /> Almost immediately, scientists recorded a dramatic and positive response by Scripps's murrelets, a rare seabird that nests on the island. In 2003, Thomas Hamer, of Hamer Environmental, reported, \"We have detected increases in the number of birds visiting nesting colonies ranging from 58% to more than two times higher when compared to the number of detections that we recorded per night in any of the previous years.\" Since then, biologists have continued to monitor an increasing number of nests of Scripps's murrelets and a consistently high success rate for hatching of eggs. Another rare seabird, Cassin's auklet, has returned to Anacapa Island as a breeding following the elimination of the rats. They continue to be very uncommon on the island. It is hoped that their numbers will also continue to increase.<br /> <br /> Channel Islands National Park Superintendent Russell Galipeau, comments, \"This project was critical to protecting and restoring the rare and unique wildlife on Anacapa. The National Park Service is dedicated to ensuring a diverse, naturally functioning island ecosystem.\"<br />  </p> <p><strong>Western Gull</strong></p> <p>Anacapa Island is one of the largest breeding centers for western gulls in the U.S. The breeding/nesting period is May through July. In 1993, over 1000 nests were estimated on East Anacapa, 4-5,000 on Middle and West Anacapa, plus other large colonies throughout the Channel Islands. [Previously, East Anacapa was a large pelican breeding center. However, when the lighthouse was built in the 1930's, human disturbance caused the pelicans to move to West Anacapa. In the late 1960's and early 1970's, eggshell thinning from the pesticide DDT resulted in almost complete reproductive failure of this population (only one West Anacapa pelican successfully fledged in 1969). With the ban on DDT production shortly thereafter, the pelicans have made a steady comeback. Since 1980, as many as 6,000 nests per year have been built on West Anacapa, making it the largest pelican rookery in So. Calif.]<br /> <br /> A western gull's nest starts as a scrape or depression in the ground, with twigs and grasses added to form a nest bowl in which the eggs are laid. Some gulls prefer to build their nests in small cliffside caves. They usually lay 2-3 eggs which are incubated for 4 weeks. In 1993, there were many 3-chick broods, often a sign of good food sources and healthier parents. The eggs are cryptically-colored a mottled brown, similar to the chicks' downy feathers during the first month of life---to camouflage them from predators.<br /> <br /> Gull \"brood patches\" are on the breast. This is a highly vascularized area that loses all the downy underfeathers during the breeding season. Adults sit with the eggs or small chicks pressed against this very warm patch of bare skin. [In contrast, pelicans have highly vascularized feet so they stand on their eggs. This is one of the problems with eggshell thinning--the full weight of the bird causes the egg to break.]<br /> <br /> A 50-70% 1st-year mortality rate is not uncommon for gull chicks, due to: 1.) predation--from other gulls (when they wander outside their territory), ravens, feral cats, rats and others; 2.) starvation--due to abandonment or lack of food sources in meager years; 3.) hazards--falling off cliffs and other accidents.<br /> <br /> The survival rate increases with each year until sexual maturity at 4-5 years. The western gull's average lifespan is 15-17 years, although some have been tracked for over 20 years-looking just as healthy as newly-matured birds.<br /> <br /> Chicks begin to grow their flight feathers at 4 weeks, with first flights at 6-7 weeks. 2-3 weeks later, they are ready to leave the nest, although gull parents may continue to feed them awhile longer.<br /> <br /> The red spot on the adult gull's beak is a feeding target for chicks. They tap the red spot and the parent-bird regurgitates food. As scavengers, mature gulls will eat practically anything, including clams, crabs, urchins, fish, carrion and human garbage (the bones along trails of Anacapa are most likely chicken bones from the Oxnard garbage dump).<br /> <br /> Adults will maintain the same territory year after year, often putting the nest in the exact same location. When the chicks mature, they return to breed in the same general nesting area where they were hatched.<br /> <br /> Year-to-year, there are recognizable differences in sub-adult feather coloration (plumage). Therefore, gulls can be aged by plumage until adulthood is reached--4 years for males and 5 years for females. First-year western gulls are completely dark, including their bills. Mature birds have a white head and body, light-orange bill with a red spot, dark gray mantle (the back between shoulders), and black-tipped dark gray wings. [The northern race of western gulls above Morro Bay have a lighter gray mantle.]<br /> <br /> Western gulls mate for life and both parents incubate the eggs, protect the chicks and feed them (as do pelicans). They usually work in shifts to protect the eggs and chicks at all times. If one parent dies, the nest may be abandoned--one cause of chick mortality. Since the male is really the holder of the territory, he will quickly attract a new mate. If the male dies, the female has to wander in search of a male with his own territory.<br /> <br /> Since there is a notable shortage of fresh water in the middle of the ocean, gulls and most other sea birds drink salt water. They have a special gland to filter excess salt from their blood. In the western gull, this \"salt gland\" is located at the base of the bill, and the excess salt is excreted through the nostrils. {Sea lions and seals have specialized digestive systems to perform this same function.]<br /> <br /> Western gulls are highly territorial. Squabbles and fights are common. No mercy is shown to any invaders of territory, even chicks from adjacent nests. Squawking at invaders, including people, is an effective defense mechanism. Sometimes, gulls may lift off and dive at intruders, attempting to kick with the feet, bite or hit with the bill. Putting your hand up high above your head will ward them off. [Pelicans are more tolerant of each other, tending to nest in close proximity within their colonies. A \"bill's length\" away defines their territory.]<br /> <br /> Western gulls are one of eleven gull species found on the West Coast of the United States. 22 gull species are seen in all of North America, with 45 species worldwide.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Trail Stop 7: Inspiration Point<br /><br />Note: For your safety, please remain well away from cliff edges.<br /><br />The view: <br />You are standing at the narrow tip of a several hundred-foot cliff at the western edge of the island. The edge of the cliff drops off about ten feet in front of you and about 50 feet to your left. Toward 8 o'clock, about 20 feet to your left is a bench. Beyond the cliff's edge is the Pacific Ocean with no other land in sight. <br /><br />At 12 o'clock, the rest of the Anacapa islets stretch out toward the west, rising and falling like a sea serpent swimming through the water. Pelicans and other seabirds dot the surfaces of these islets, cliffs, and the rocky shorelines. Middle Anacapa Island is visible, as is West Anacapa, and the landing there, called \"Frenchy's Cove.\" Boats are often seen anchored off the cove. In the distance is Santa Cruz Island. From 2 o'clock to 3 o'clock, across the channel, is Santa Barbara County on the distant mainland.<br /><br />The guide:<br />The guide has no new illustrations for this trail stop.<br />The guide reads, \"NOTE: For your safety, please remain well away from cliff edges.<br /><br />A cool, salty mist fills the air at Inspiration Point. Graceful gulls and pelicans soar above the foaming waves that surge across the narrow, rocky strait separating East and Middle Anacapa. Seven different species of marine birds nest on Anacapa, including western gulls, California brown pelicans, double-crested cormorants, Brandt's cormorants, pelagic cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and Xantus' murrelets. Twenty-two different species of land birds breed on the island and many other birds stop over during migration.<br /><br />The western gull rookery on East Anacapa is one of the main breeding colonies on the Channel Islands. Gulls have a surprisingly high chick mortality rate, as much as sixty percent. Anacapa's isolation and freedom from predators such as foxes and nonnative rats are crucial for these seabirds to successfully breed and rear their young.<br /><br />On the north slopes of West Anacapa, California brown pelicans typically nest and raise their young from January through October. In fact, West Anacapa has the largest and most consistently used brown pelican nesting colony on the West Coast of the United States. Brown pelicans will abandon their nests if disturbed, leaving the eggs and chicks defenseless against predators such as gulls and ravens. A serious disturbance can cause an entire colony to be abandoned. For this reason Anacapa's isolation is a critical factor in the successful nesting of these seabirds. Except for the beach at Frenchy's Cove, West Anacapa is designated as a Research Natural Area and is closed to the public.<br /><br />From Inspiration Point you can return by the same trail or follow the longer route that loops through the lower terrace. Either way, you will experience Anacapa's unique beauty. You will also notice how isolation has allowed endemic species such as island morning glory and live-forever to flourish on the island.<br /><br />Today the populations of harbor seals, sea lions, and other sea mammals are recovering from the massive hunts of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The spread of alien plants such as iceplant and European grasses, as well as increased erosion along the trails, continues to threaten Anacapa's natural resources.<br /><br />Anacapa Island's unique resources were first recognized in 1938, when the island was proclaimed a national monument. The protection was reaffirmed and strengthened in 1980 when Anacapa was included in the newly established Channel Islands National Park. The National Park Service is preserving the island's native plant and animal communities and its historical and archeological features for future generations to study and enjoy.\"<br /><br />Last Page<br />At the very end of the guide is the logo for the National Park Service. The logo shows a flat arrowhead with flint-napped edges, pointing down. On the top are the words, \"National Park Service\" and a black and white sketch of a large pine tree with shrubs nearby, and a snow-capped mountain in the distance. Near the tip on the bottom are the words, \"Department of the Interior\" and a sketch of a light colored buffalo with a large, dark, shaggy head. The buffalo's body has large front legs and tall, rounded shoulders. It slopes downward in the back, to hindquarters about two-thirds the height of its shoulders.<br />A logo for the Western National Parks Association is also shown.<br /><br />The credits read, \"Written by Bill McCawley, Illustrated by Jean M.

Please do not pick the flowers or touch the plants.</p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>The warm morning sun climbs from a low bank of fog to illuminate a brilliant field of yellow-flowered coreopsis of Anacapa Island. A cool breeze rustles the leaves of island oaks crowning a rocky hilltop on Santa Rosa. The soil surrounding their gnarled, moss-covered trunks is still damp with moisture from the nighttime fog. Gulls swoop and dive above a windswept cliff carpeted with green and yellow goldfields on Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> A fascinating variety of plants can be found in California's Channel Islands National Park. This is due in large measure to the many plant habitats that exist on the islands, each representing a distinct combination of environmental conditions affecting plant germination and growth. Some of these conditions include wind, sun, fog, seasonal rainfall, soil conditions, and the amount of sea salt in the air and soil. The distance and isolation of the islands from the mainland has allowed plants and animals to develop into unique island forms.<br />  </p> <p><strong>How Did Plants Reach the Channel Islands?</strong></p> <p>Plants originally arrived on the Channel Islands by a slow, steady process known as dispersal. The islands were never connected to the mainland; however, over millions of years, plants, seeds, and spores were carried from the mainland by ocean currents, wind, and birds. Some seeds and spores may also have been caught in the fur of animals that reached the islands. More recently, humans have been important agents of plant dispersal. During the prehistoric period, the Chumash may have introduced some plants to the islands. Beginning in the early 1800s, European grasses and other foreign plants became established on the islands, largely as a by-product of farming and ranching.<br /> <br /> Toyon, which grows on all of the larger islands, is an excellent example of natural dispersal. During summer and fall the small flowers decorating the tips of the branches gave way to clusters of bright-red berries. These berries are an important source of winter food for California's birds. In turn, birds help propagate toyon by dispersing undigested seeds to new locations. The island scrub-jay also stores toyon seeds in winter food caches; seeds that are not consumed may germinate and become established as new plants.</p>",

Toyon (qwe') was also a valuable source of hardwood for manufacturing a variety of implements such as arrows, harpoons, fish spears, digging sticks, and gaming pieces.<br /> <br /> The Chumash often used heat or steam to shape and form objects made from toyon and other hardwoods. For example, bundles of toyon arrows were steamed in earth ovens to make the rods pliable; the shafts were then straightened and allowed to dry. After drying, the arrows were trimmed to the proper size, the points shaped and hardened in hot ashes, and feathers added.<br /> <br /> Other plants important to Chumash manufacturing included elderberry, used for whistles, clapper sticks, and bows; willow, used for house frameworks, basketry, and cordage; tule, used for matting and for thatching houses; and milkweed, used for string.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Peromyscus maniculatus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Each of the Channel Islands is home to an endemic subspecies of deer mouse that is found nowhere else on earth. In some cases, island deer mice are the only terrestrial mammal occuring on the island. They thrive in the varied habitats on the islands, with populations densities that are higher than anywhere else in the world. The island deer mouse population is an important part in the ecosystem, as food for predators, and as consumers of seeds-including those of non-native plants.</p> <p>Quick and Cool Facts</p> <ul> <li>Deer mice are widely spread across North America; however each of the five Channel Islands has its own distinct sub-species.</li> <li>Deer mice populations at Channel Islands National Park have been monitored since 1992.</li> <li>Island deer mouse population densities are higher, and fluctuate more, than anywhere else in the world.</li> <li>Deer mice exhibit population dynamics that differ markedly from mainland populations of the same species.</li> <li>Climate and predation (by island foxes on some islands, and owls on others) are the most important factors determining island deer mouse population fluctuations.</li> <li>Generally, more rain provides more food for the species, yet abundant rain with cold winters may in fact decrease the deer mouse population.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Deer mice from the Channel Islands have dark brownish-black tipped hairs on their back, a buffy band on their sides and then grey at the base. In general, island mice are darker than mainland mice. Deer mice are the prototype for \"field mice\" with large, bulging eyes, big ears, a bi-colored pattern and a long tail.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus is the most widespread North American rodent. It is found throughout southern Canada, the United States, and north and central Mexico, including Baja California. It is most commonly called the deer mouse, although that name is common to most species of Peromyscus. It is absent from the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastal plains of the United States, but its range does extend to the coast in east Texas. However, each of the Channel Islands are home to a different subspecies of deer mouse that is found nowhere else on earth.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Due to the diverse habitat of the Channel Islands, nesting is found in the natural cover of the landscape. The deer mouse will nest alone on most occasions but will sometimes nest with a deer mouse of the opposite sex. The deer mouse is generally a nocturnal creature.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Food selection is dependent on both habitat and season. Deer mice feed heavily on larvae from lepidopterans (includes moths and butterflies) and other insects in the spring. They can eat large volumes and are capable of ridding an area of many insects that may be detrimental to trees. In the fall, seeds become a major food source and are stored in caches for use during the winter.</p> <p>Island studies have shown that deer mice occasionally prey on eggs and nestlings of Scripps's murrelets on Santa Barbara Island. However, the annual reproductive success of murrelets was not related to deer mouse densities. Likewise, research on San Miguel Island showed that as seed predators, deer mice had limited impacts on giant coreopsis populations, especially when compared to the negative competitive effects of non-native annual grasses.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Deer mice on the Channel Islands have been found to show definite breeding seasons, with the majority of reproduction occurring during the spring and summer months with generally two litters produced. The normal gestation period range is from 22-35 days, with the average being 26 days, and mice are considered in their juvenile pelage from birth to 11 weeks, while sub adults are from 11-21 weeks.</p> <p>Park research has shown that island deer mouse population densities are higher than anywhere else in the world. However, population dynamics on different islands vary in response to numerous factors, including predator diversity, vegetation community structure, and climate.</p> <p>For example, monitoring data shows that deer mouse densities on San Miguel Island are strongly limited by the endangered island fox (Urocyon littoralis littoralis), whereas on Santa Barbara Island, where there are no foxes, mouse densities are much more variable. Predation by barnowls on Santa Barbara Island can drive th emousr population to extreme lows. Unlike the generalist island fox, barn owls are more specialized predators and do not switch to other prey species when their their primary prey (mice) decline.</p> <p>In addition, research has revealed that rainfall is a strong driver of deer mouse population dynamics. High winter rainfall encourages plant growth which provides food resources, while drought reduces plant growth and limits mouse productivity. However, abundant winter rain combined with cold temperatures may actually increase winter mortality and reduce the number of mice that survive from fall to spring.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The island deer mouse, peromyscus maniculatus, is listed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, tolerance of a broad range of habitats, occurrence in a number of protected areas, and because it is unlikely to be in decline.</p> <p>Deer mice populations at Channel Islands National Park have been monitored since 1992. Nine permanent grids have been established in various habitats on Anacapa, San Miguel and Santa Barbara Islands. These grids are sampled twice each year during the spring and fall seasons and mark/recapture methods are used to determine population densities.</p> <p>The objective of the monitoring is to identify trends in the deer mice population, evaluate the general health of the population utilizing weight, age, sex, and reproductive information and to increase our understanding of how island ecosystems respond to changing environmental conditions.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/16672/0\">International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List of Threatened Species</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/medn/assets/docs/resourcebriefs/MEDN_ResourceBrief_DeerMice.pdf\">Inventory & Monitoring Program Mediterranean Coast Network</a></li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Sceloporus occidentalis becki</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The island fence lizard, <em>Sceloporus occidentalis becki</em>, is endemic to the Channel Islands of California. It is found on the three most northerly islands in the national park. Although it is a distinct sub-species, it is physically similar in appearance to various mainland sub-species of the western fence lizard, which is one of the most common lizards in California. This species is sometimes called the \"blue belly lizard\", due to the vivid blue coloration seen on the abdomen of the adult male of the species.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Many authorities have already accepted research that concludes that <em>Sceloporus occidentalis becki</em>, the island fence lizard, is a unique species. However, since this conflicts with current taxonomy, the taxonomy of the entire species is likely to be revised in the future.</li> <li>A protein in the blood of the island fence lizard kills the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.</li> <li>The island fence lizard's tail detaches easily to distract a potential predator.</li> <li>Males defend their territory and try to attract females with head-bobbing and a push-up display that exposes the blue throat and ventral colors.</li> <li>Generally, fence lizards are active when temperatures are warm, and are inactive during periods of extreme heat or cold. However, the mild temperatures of the Channel Islands allow the island fence lizard to be active all year.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The island fence lizard is a fairly small lizard with keeled and pointed dorsal scales of equal size on the back, sides, and belly. Scales on the backs of the thighs are mostly keeled, and abruptly smaller, and the rear of the limbs is yellow or orange. The sides of the belly are blue. Color is brown, gray, or black with blotches. Sometimes light markings on the sides of the backs form stripes or irregular lines, and sometimes dark blotching may form irregular bands. The belly is light in color. Males have blue markings on the sides of the belly edged in black, a black patch on the throat, enlarged postanals, and a swollen tail base. Some scales on the back become blue or greenish when a lizard is in the light phase. Females have faint or absent blue markings on the belly, no blue or green color on the upper surfaces, and dark bars or crescents on the back. Juveniles have little or no blue on the throat and faint blue belly markings or none at all.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The island fence lizard is endemic to Channel Islands National Park's three northerly islands, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The island fence lizard prefers open sunny areas, including stream banks, beach driftwood, grassy hillsides, and human settlements. It can be seen in the early morning sunning on rocks, logs and on fences; the latter giving rise to its common name.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The island fence lizard eats small invertebrates such as crickets, spiders, ticks, and scorpions, and occasionally eats small lizards, which includes its species.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The island fence lizard mates in the spring. The female lays one to three clutches of eggs numbering from three to seventeen eggs from April to July. The eggs hatch in about 60 days, from July to September.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> This species is not included on the state's Special Animals List, which indicates that there are no significant conservation concerns for it in California. The World Conservation Union - IUCN Red List does not have the species listed. Additionally, the island fence lizard is regularly monitored to ensure its health and viability in the park. Annual monitoring in the park ensures that conservation issues for this species will be detected in adequate time for proper management.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/s.o.becki.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/s.o.becki.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_info.asp?thingid=55037\">http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_info.asp?thingid=55037</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/data_objects/14843145#cite_ref-ReferenceA_2\">http://eol.org/data_objects/14843145#cite_ref-ReferenceA_2</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.sdnhm.org/archive/fieldguide/herps/scel-occ.html\">http://www.sdnhm.org/archive/fieldguide/herps/scel-occ.html</a></li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong><u>Overview</u></strong></p> <p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Urocyon littoralis</em><br /> <br /> <strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The island fox only lives on six of the eight Channel Islands off the coast of southern California--they are found nowhere else on Earth. Each island population is recognized as a separate endemic or unique subspecies.<br /> <br /> The island fox, a descendant of the mainland gray fox, is the largest of the Channel Islands' native mammals, but one of the smallest canid species in the world.<br /> <br /> Although foxes have always existed at low population sizes, four island fox subspecies underwent catastrophic declines in the 1990s. On San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands at Channel Islands National Park, the decline was attributed to predation by golden eagles. The presence of non-native ungulates as a food source in addition to the DDT-caused decline of bald eagles, a natural competitor, facilitated the establishment of golden eagles as resident breeders on the islands. By 2000, predation on island foxes resulted in population declines to 15 individuals on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands, and less than 80 on Santa Cruz Island. In 2004, each of the park's island fox subspecies were federally listed as endangered.<br /> <br /> In 1999, Channel Islands National Park began an island fox recovery program that included captive breeding and reintroduction of foxes, removal of resident golden eagles, re-establishment of bald eagles, and removal of non-native ungulates. This coordinated, organized and highly focused strategy was able to reverse the certain extinction of an endangered population. Today, the population has recovered within the park. Population trend and annual survival are currently monitored to ensure that recovery continues and future threats to the park's island fox subspecies are identified.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>It is the only carnivore unique to California.</li> <li>Although the island fox is one of the smallest canids in the world, it is the largest native terrestrial mammal on the Channel Islands.</li> <li>The island fox is one-third smaller than its mainland ancestor, the gray fox. At 12 to 13 inches in height and 4 to 5 pounds, the island fox is about the size of a housecat.</li> <li>Some individuals have been known to live up to 15 years.</li> <li>Unlike nocturnal gray foxes, which hunt exclusively at night to avoid predators, island foxes have no natural predators, allowing them to be active duringdaylight hours with peaks in activity occurring at dusk and dawn.</li> <li>Visually, island foxes show signs of dominance or submission through facial expressions and body posture.</li> <li>They communicate by barking and sometimes growling.</li> <li>Their keen sense of smell plays an important role in the marking of territories. Island foxes are known to scent-mark their territories with a few drops of urine and tend to concentrate scats in particular areas, often conspicuously positioned on well-traveled paths.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Appearance</strong></p> <p>The island fox is one third smaller than its mainland ancestor the gray fox. Environmental and ecological factors such as overcrowding, reduction in predators, food limitations, and genetic variations could have contributed to the natural selection for a smaller size.</p> <p>The island fox has similar markings to the gray fox. They have gray coloring on the back, rust coloring on the sides,and white underneath. The face has a distinctive black, white, and rufous-colored patterns.</p> <p>On each of the six islands, a different subspecies occurs, distinguished by both genetic and physical differences. For example, San Miguel Island foxes have shorter tails, due to one less tail vertebra, and longer noses than the other island foxes.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Range</strong></p> <p>The island fox is found on six of the islands in the Southern California bight, including the three largest islands in the Channel Islands National Park (Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel islands). The other three islands which island foxes inhabit San Nicolas and San Clemente, owned by the US Navy, and popular Santa Catalina Island, which in large part is managed by the Catalina Island Conservancy.</p> <p>Older research on the island fox dated them back on the northern Channel Islands to 10,400 to 16,000 years ago. Yet, geologists believe the northern Channel Islands were never connected to the mainland. The most plausible and accepted theory for foxes crossing the water barrier of the Santa Barbara Channel is one of \"rafting.\" During the last ice age, 10-20,000 years ago, ocean levels were up to 400 feet lower than today's. The channel between the islands and mainland narrowed, perhaps to just four to five miles across. The northern islands became one large island we call Santarosae. The gray fox could have rafted on debris propelled by storms and/or currents. As the climate warmed and the ocean levels began to rise, Santarosae became the islands of Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel. Due to the lack of a fresh water source, the foxes did not persist on Anacapa, but the other three islands had suitable habitat for foxes.</p> <p>Recent archeological work, however, only dates the oldest island fox fossil at about 6,000 years before present, which is several thousand years after native people populated the island. This raises the possibility that gray foxes were brought to the islands by humans, and rapidly evolved into a smaller, separate species after that.</p> <p>Island foxes brought to the southern Channel Islands of Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, and San Clemente by the Chumash native people who traded with the Gabrielino people of the southern islands. The Chumash considered the fox to be a sacred animal--a pet of the sun, and possibly a dream helper. The island Chumash performed a fox dance and probably used the pelts of foxes to make articles like arrow quivers, capes, and headdresses.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong></p> <p>The climate of the California Channel Islands is semi-arid, and though rainfall amounts differ among islands the average rainfall across all islands is less than six inches per year. The native island vegetation is mostly coastal scrub, but these habitats have been heavily modified by the effects of introduced grazing animals and other human impacts. The northern islands (San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz) have significant areas dominated by non-native plant species, such as annual grasses and iceplant, whereas the southern islands (Santa Catalina, San Clemente and San Nicolas) have greater development impacts such as the naval bases and the town of Avalon. The larger islands (Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, and San Clemente) also have perennial streams that support riparian vegetation and tree species. Foxes are found in most of these habitats on these islands, but they prefer shrubby or wooded areas such as chaparral, coastal scrub and oak woodlands.</p> <p>Island foxes give birth to their young in simple dens, which are usually not excavated by the foxes themselves. By two months of age, young spend most of the day outside the den and will remain with their parents throughout the summer. Some pups disperse away from their natal territories by winter, although others may stay on their natal territories into their second year.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong></p> <p>Island fox diets vary based upon food item diversity of the individual islands. On San Rosa Island, where food item diversity is high, deer mice, Jerusalem crickets, beetles, and earwigs are the preferred food. On other Channel Islands, diets include plant items such as fruits from cactus, manzanita, saltbushes and seafigs, as well as insects and deer mice when they are present. Occasionally, foxes forage along the shoreline for crabs and other marine invertebrates.<br /> <br /> <strong>Reproduction</strong></p> <p>Island foxes are generally monogamous (mate for life), and breed only once a year. Pairs are seen together frequently beginning in January, and mating takes place in late February to early March. The gestation period is thought to be similar to the gray fox, which is around 52 days, and pups are born from late April through early May. Litter size ranges from one to as many as five pups, but two or three is considered average. Born in the protection of a den, pups are blind and helpless with short dark brown hair at birth. They emerge from the den at about one month of age, much furrier but still considerably darker than adults. They begin to resemble their parents by late summer.</p> <p>It is believed that island fox pups undergo a period of extended parental care. In a recent study of island foxes, scientists found adults and pups in the same trap on 22 occasions. In 24 traps containing only pups, they found killed mice and other prey items outside the traps, apparently left by the parents for their young. As with most wild canids, males play an important role in the rearing of young.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Conservation Status</strong></p> <p>The island fox, which only a short time ago was on the brink of extinction, provides an instructive example of how a coordinated, organized and highly focused strategy was able to reverse the certain extinction of an endangered population. Additional information about the strategies developed and implemented to reverse this situation may be found at <a href=\"http://www1.islandfox.org/p/about-island-fox.html\">Island Fox Conservation</a>.</p> <p>Due to these successful efforts, the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species now lists the island fox as near threatened.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/\">http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://islandfox.org/pdfs/foxfactsheet2.pdf\">http://islandfox.org/pdfs/foxfactsheet2.pdf</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/\">http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.islandfox.org/\">http://www.islandfox.org</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/goeachannel.htm\">http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/goeachannel.htm</a></li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong><u>The Decline of the Island Fox</u></strong></p> <p><strong>The Warning Provided by Monitoring</strong><br /> From 1993 to 1999 the National Park Service monitored the population of island foxes on San Miguel Island. Each summer, foxes were trapped and tagged. When each fox was first captured, it was implanted with a device about the size of a grain of rice called a passive integrated transponder tag, or \"PIT\" tag. The tag gives each fox a permanent, unique number that can be read with a special scanner and allows scientists to monitor individual foxes over the years.</p> <p>Park biologists estimated there to be over 400 foxes on San Miguel in 1994, but by 1995, an alarming decline had begun. With each passing year, fewer foxes were trapped in the monitoring grids. At the same time, rangers and visitors reported seeing fewer live foxes and more fox skeletons and carcasses. By 1998, the San Miguel population was down to a few dozen. Island fox populations on all three islands were naturally small and had historically fluctuated, but as far as was known had never been as low as they were during this period and had never come close to extinction.</p> <p>In fall 1998, National Park Service biologists initiated a radio telemetry study of island foxes on San Miguel Island to determine causes of mortality. Of 15 radio collared foxes tracked from 1998 to 1999, 5 were believed to be killed by golden eagles and 2 died of other causes. This confirmed the results of an earlier study on Santa Cruz Island where golden eagle predation was identified as the cause of death for 21 of 29 fox carcasses. Golden eagle predation was unprecedented, and was considered unnatural because golden eagles had not previously bred on the islands and were, until this time, rarely observed.</p> <p>Similar declines occurred simultaneously in the island fox populations on neighboring Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands Fox mortality rates due to predation were so high that by 1999 the San Miguel and Santa Rosa fox subspecies were nearing extinction; on each of those islands total abundance had declined from approximately 450 and 1,500, respectively, to 15.</p> <p><strong>Eliminating the Major Cause for Decline</strong><br /> While the threat of critically low island fox population size could conceivably be improved through captive breeding and reintroduction, such efforts would be futile unless the threat from golden eagles was eliminated. Historically, the native bald eagle most likely deterred golden eagles from exploiting the Channel Islands as a food source. Golden eagle did not colonize the islands until their larger fish-eating relatives were wiped out by DDT, hunting, and egg collection. With the golden eagle's sharp talons, swiftness of flight, and 4 times the body mass of a fox, they easily preyed upon the vulnerable fox.</p> <p>Interestingly, the first documented decline on San Miguel in 1995 coincided with the first golden eagle sightings on the island. Golden eagles had been live-captured and relocated from some areas in western North America to reduce depredation on livestock and it was surmised that similar translocation methods could be used to golden eagles from the Channel Islands. In late 1999 the National Park began working with its partners to relocate golden eagles to the mainland. Golden eagles nested on both Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands from the mid-1990s to as recently as 2006.</p> <p>In order to mitigate golden eagle predation on island foxes, The Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, with the support of the Park Service and The Nature Conservancy, trapped and relocated a total of 44 golden eagles, including 10 eaglets born on the islands to distant sites in northeastern California. Monitoring indicated that , none returned to the islands.5 Today the occasional golden eagle visits the islands, but the level of predation on island foxes is negligible; all three island fox subspecies in the park are recovering rapidly.</p> <p><strong>Additional Threats</strong><br /> Predation by golden eagles was the primary mortality factor for foxes on the northern Channel Islands, but there were other threats as well. Introduced diseases or parasites could conceivably devastate island fox populations. In 1999-2000, on privately-owned Santa Catalina Island, about 90% of the fox population was recently lost due to canine distemper virus.</p> <p>Due to their insular existence, island foxes have no built up immunity to parasites and diseases brought in from the mainland and are especially vulnerable to those a domestic dog might be carrying. In addition, it is extremely difficult to vaccinate against or treat foxes for these parasites and diseases in the wild. For this reason, pets are not permitted in Channel Islands National Park.</p> <p><strong>Eliminating Other Factors Contributing to the Decline</strong><br /> Domestic pigs had been brought to Santa Cruz Island in the mid-1800s as a food source, and subsequently became feral. By the mid-1990s the thousands of feral pigs on the island became a factor in the decline of island foxes. Golden eagles were able to successfully colonize the island, and begin breeding, because of the availability of piglets.</p> <p>Simply relocating the existing golden eagles would not assure island fox recovery. With the substantial prey base provided by island pigs, dispersing golden eagles would continue to breed on the island. It would therefore be necessary to implement longer-term actions that would prevent sustained use of the islands by golden eagles. This resulted in a strategy that would require the removal of the feral pigs on Santa Cruz Island beginning in 2004, in a project implemented by the NPS and The Nature Conservancy, its partner in management of Santa Cruz Island. By 2006, no pigs remained on Santa Cruz Island.</p> <p>In a similar manner, introduced mule deer supported golden eagle breeding on neighboring Santa Rosa Island. Deer and elk on that island were to be phased out as part of an agreement between NPS and the former owners of the island, and by 2012 non-native ungulates had been all but eliminated on Santa Rosa Island.<br />  </p> <p><strong><u>The Restoration of the Island Fox</u></strong></p> <p><strong>The Captive Breeding Program</strong><br /> Captive breeding was a necessary - and ultimately successful - recovery action for island foxes, and it also provided an opportunity to study island fox reproductive biology, which was previously unknown. When foxes were first brought into captivity on San Miguel Island just before the 2000 breeding season, mated pairs were established by placing together males and females that appeared likely to have been paired in the wild, based on information available at capture. Because there were more females than males, some females were housed together.</p> <p>In subsequent years as pups were born and reached maturity, they were assigned mates based on a computer program designed to prevent inbreeding in small populations, such as the fox, and maximize genetic heterozygosity (lack of similarity).</p> <p>The success of the island fox breeding program is evident in data given in the 2011 Island Fox Meeting Report. Considering the northern Channel Islands exclusively, numbers that include pups are as follows: Santa Cruz, 1302; San Miguel, 516; Santa Rosa, 292.</p> <p>As a result of research conducted during the captive breeding period, we now know that island foxes have induced estrus and ovulation, which is unique among canids and may be related to other distinctive features of their mating system. Island foxes differ substantially from wolves, the species perhaps best known for its complex social system, strong pair bonds, and solicitous parental care. All the canid species appear to be socially monogamous, but from there they diverge in terms of group size, degree of sociality, and age of dispersal of young. For example, male aggression toward females - something that appeared rather common even in the reproductively successful island foxes - is virtually unknown for other canid species, in which males tend to be very solicitous to females, especially during estrus and pregnancy. However, it is unclear whether this behavior is characteristic of free-ranging island foxes or merely an artifact of captive conditions. In another contrast with other canids, the reproductive rate was lower for captive-born island foxes, the opposite of what is usually observed in other canid species. This suggests that something, such as social experience during the juvenile period, might have been missing in the captive environment, something that apparently is less important to other canid species.</p> <p><strong>Reintroduction of the Bald Eagle</strong><br /> The process of bringing back the bald eagle to the northern Channel Islands led authorities to believe that they might prove to be a natural deterrent to the colonization of the golden eagle. In 2006 a bald eagle was observed escorting a golden eagle out of its territory on Santa Rosa Island. Newly released bald eagles were also seen chasing golden eagles off of a carcass provided for them. Historical evidence and studies have shown that the natural bald eagle food sources are marine fishes, seabirds and pinniped carcasses, suggesting that bald eagles pose little threat to the island fox.</p> <p>From 2002-2006, the Institute for Wildlife Studies (IWS) released 61 bald eagles on Santa Cruz Island. In 2006, the first known nesting attempts occurred in the northern Channel Islands. Two pairs of eagles successfully fledged one chick each from nest at Pelican Harbor and Malva Real on Santa Cruz Island. Since 2006, there have been successful hatchings and Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands. As of 2012 there are over 50 bald eagles on the California Channel Islands and over 30 known eagles on the northern Channel Islands.</p> <p><strong>Encouraging Native Plants</strong><br /> Island foxes evolved in an environment thick with native shrubs that later dwindled after the introduction of livestock grazing. Without shrubs for hiding cover, the foxes were especially easy for the golden eagles to catch. Today, the removal of nonnative grazers is showing astonishing results. Lush shrubs and wildflowers are coming back. Restoring the island's vegetation benefits the foxes and all native wildlife.</p> <p><strong>An Ecosystem Solution</strong><br /> Without the ecosystem-level changes of pig removal and bald eagle restoration, fox recovery was not assured. That those two ecosystem level actions were implemented in conjunction with island fox recovery actions was fortuitous. The two actions had been planned and funded separately from island fox recovery, but the value of those planned actions to island fox conservation was recognized when the complicated relationship among foxes, pigs, and eagles became apparent. The success of those ecosystem-level actions was facilitated by the islands' isolation and their limited, more defined ecosystems: once pigs were removed from the islands, there was little chance of them returning. The success of these ecosystem-level actions for island fox conservation underscores the importance of considering ecosystem-wide conditions in endangered species management.</p> <p><br /> <strong><u>The Current Status of the Island Fox</u></strong><br /> An affiliated group of management agencies, landowners, academics, and non-profits concerned with the conservation of the island fox has convened since 1999 to exchange information regarding the status and trend of the six island fox subspecies, and to work cooperatively on island fox conservations issues in such areas as captive breeding, wild population management, veterinary issues, and educational/outreach. In the most recent 2011 meeting of this group, the Island Fox Working Group, data was presented that indicated that 4 of the 6 island fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis</em>) subspecies were stable or increasing, with high survival, though island foxes still face potential threats from pathogens and predation.<br /> <br /> <strong>Current Status on Santa Cruz Island</strong><br /> <em>Recovered.</em> Captive breeding ended in 2008 for the Santa Cruz Island Fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis santacruzae</em>) and all foxes were returned to the wild. Survival remains very high, and the populaiotn has increased steadily. Some areas now show less increase (fewer pups) as the population nears historic density.<br /> <br /> <strong>Current Status on Santa Rosa Island</strong><br /> <em>Recovered.</em> Captive breeding continued for the Santa Rosa Island fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis santarosae</em>) until 2008 when all foxes were returned to the wild.The annual survival rate climbed to 90% in 2007-2009, but the incidental arrival of three juvenile golden eagles in spring 2010 caused survival to dip in that year. Since then survival has climbed above 90% and the fox population continues to increase.<br /> <br /> <strong>Current Status on San Miguel Island</strong><br /> <em>Recovered.</em> Captive breeding continued for the San Miguel Island fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis littoralis</em>) until 2007 and all foxes were returned to the wild. The population continues to increase by about 25% per year with a high annual fox survival rate, 90%. As of 2011 the population had reach pre-decline levels (close to 400 adults) and can be considered biologically recovered. As the population has reached known historical levels, biologists are watching to see how the population stabilizes. Monitoring foxes via radio telemetry collars has also provided early identification of predation or disease threats. Annual vaccination of 60 - 100 individual foxes is protecting a larger potential survivor group in the event of introduced rabies or distemper virus.<br /> <br /> <strong>Future Prospects of Threats to Species</strong><br /> The IUCN Red List of Endangered Species still lists the Island Fox as critically endangered as of a 2008 assessment. The US Fish and Wildlife Service will likely release a draft island fox recovery plan in 2012. Monitoring and mitigation of known threats (eagle predation and canine disease) will be a prominent recovery action in the plan. Island foxes may be vulnerable to impacts of future global climate change. Such impact could be direct, such as changes in acceptable temperature ranges, or indirect, such as impacts on floral or faunal food sources for the fox. Alternatively, global climate change may affect the distribution or virulence of pathogens, such as bacteria or parasites.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em><em>Lanius ludovicianus anthonyi</em></em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The island loggerhead shrike is an endemic, genetically distinct sub-species of loggerhead shrike found on Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands in the northern Channel Islands and on Santa Catalina Island in the south. The island loggerhead shrike is a robin-sized bird that hunts like a small hawk, preying on insects and small animals, including small birds. Populations on all three islands are greatly diminished from historical populations. A close relative, the endemic San Clemente Island loggerhead shrike (<em>Lanius ludovicianus</em>), is found only on San Clemente Island and is federally listed as endangered.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The name \"loggerhead\" means of possessing a head that is disproportionately larger than the rest of the body.</li> <li>Another name for the shrike is \"butcher bird\", owing to its tendency to impale their prey on thorns. The reason appears to be due to their lack of talons that would accommodate holding their prey while consuming it.</li> <li><em>Lanius</em>, the scientific name for the shrike, is derived from the Latin word meaning \"butcher\". Historically, the Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands population of island loggerhead shrikes was variously reported as \"extremely common\" to \"comparatively common\" and \"fairly common.\"</li> <li>Recent surveys indicate that the island loggerhead shrike occurs in very small population sizes.</li> <li>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been petitioned to list the subspecies under the Endangered Species Act, the objective of a 2009-2010 project was to obtain a rigorous and defensible estimate of northern island loggerhead shrike abundance on both islands.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The island loggerhead shrike is a robin-sized bird. It is the darkest of all forms of this species. It is similar in coloration to the mainland loggerhead shrike, but the gray of upper parts is still darker (nearly slate color) especially on the top of the head, and more uniform, the shoulder feathers, almost wholly deep gray; white spot at the base of primary wing feathers much smaller; under parts of body much more strongly tinged with gray, becoming distinctly gray on sides and flanks; lateral tail feathers with much less of white, this extending slightly less than an inch for the tip on inner web of exterior tail feathers.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Although loggerhead shrikes are widely distributed throughout the continental United States, the island loggerhead shrike is an endemic, genetically distinct subspecies of loggerhead shrike found on Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Santa Catalina Islands.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Like other shrikes, island loggerhead shrikes require rather open areas for hunting, with sufficient vertebrate and invertebrate prey, but also adequate perches, and enough shrub cover nearby for nesting. They prefer grasslands, open coastal sage scrub habitats on terraces, and brushy canyon slopes (Collins 2008).</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Island loggerhead shrikes are efficient search-type predators; their diet apparently is related more to prey abundance, detectability, and size than to specific prey type. Although the diet of the island loggerhead shrike has not been studied, it is likely similar to that of the San Clemente loggerhead shrike an endemic subspecies of shrike that occurs only on San Clemente Island in the southernChannel Islands (Collins 2008). That shrike feeds on a wide variety of prey, including various aerial and ground-dwelling arthropods (crickets,grasshoppers, beetles, earwigs, lepidopteran larvae, flies, truebugs, ants, bees, and wasps), small ver­tebrates (lizards, birds, and mice), molluscs (land snails), isopods (pill-bugs), arachnids (spiders and scorpions), chilopods (centipedes), thysanurans (silverfish), and diplopods (millipedes). For foraging, shrikes require open and semi-open habitats with scattered taller vegetation. Shrikes generally search for prey from a variety of perches from 3 to 45 feet above the ground.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Protection of nests against predation is important. On the islands, shrike nests are susceptible to predation by island foxes, and, on Santa Cruz Island, by the islandscrub-jay. Therefore, nests typically are placed in a variety of arborescent shrubs, includ­ing lemonade berry, California sagebrush, Catalina cherry, toyon, blue elderberry, and various oaks. Pairs generally raise a single brood and will renest following nest failure. Island loggerhead shrikes have an extended breeding season, which enables pairs to raise two broods in some years.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Although loggerhead shrikes are widely distributed and abundant, the northern island subspecies is classified as a species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game and has been petitioned for federal listing under the Endangered Species Act.</p> <p>Recent exhaustive surveys on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands provided the first reliable estimates of island loggerhead shrikes (Stanley et al. 2012). Estimated population size in 2010 was 240 on Santa Rosa and only 42 on Santa Cruz, and historical shrike populations may have been much higher (Collins 2008). Higher shrike numbers on Santa Rosa may reflect higher habitat quality on that island. There may be more habitat with short vegetation, which shrikes prefer, on Santa Rosa Island. Shrikes also require adequate perches from which to hunt, and suitably thick shrubs in which tonest. Changes in vegetation due to removal of non-native ungulates will have as-yet undetermined effects on shrike habitat.</p> <p>Very little is known about the ecology of the island loggerhead shrike. Basic information is lacking concerning breeding biology, habitat relations and the importance of predation. Because of this, the reasons for its apparent decline and the difference in population size between Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands remain unclear.</p> <p>The island shrike's cousin, the San Clemente Island shrike, was listed as Endangered in 1977 and at one point was considered the most endangered animal in North America. In 1998 there were only 12 adults remaining in the wild. The population has since increased due to captive breeding and reintroduction, coupled with innovative predator control: predatory island foxes were fitted with shock-collars to prevent them from depredating shrike nests (Cooper et al. 2005).</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://birds.audubon.org/birds/loggerhead-shrike\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">BirdLife International</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&frm=1&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CDEQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fscience.nature.nps.gov%2Fim%2Funits%2Fmedn%2Fassets%2Fdocs%2Fresourcebriefs%2FLOSHSummaryFINAL_2012.pdf&ei=PIFyUrTLIsS5iwLUhYDIDg&usg=AFQjCNEIMxCOhHhoyX-yReW-CqsCVVenrw&bvm=bv.55819444,d.cGE\">Northern Channel Islands Loggerhead Shrike Study</a></li> <li>Collins, P.W. 2008.

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Xantusia riversiana</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The island night lizard is a very unique, medium-sized endemic reptile found only on the Channel Islands off the coast of southern California, where it occurs on Santa Barbara, San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands. Island night lizards are the most morphologically distinct of the endemic vertebrates on the Channel Islands, indicating they have been isolated from the mainland for a long time.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>In the park, the island night lizard is found only on Santa Barbara Island.</li> <li>Studies on Santa Barbara Island has shown that the island night lizards are not nocturnal as suggested by their name, but instead are most active at midday, with little activity in the cool early morning or late afternoon, and none at all at night.</li> <li>The island night lizard gives birth to live young (as opposed to laying eggs), which is not common among reptiles.</li> <li>Island night lizards are slow growing and long-lived, with some individuals reaching at least 25 years of age.</li> <li>During the course of their long lives, they accumulate a lot of injuries including regenerated tails, scale, and miscellaneous cuts, missing toes, eye injuries, infections and the presence of cactus spines.</li> <li>All larger lizards have some injuries, while only about 1/3 of the smaller lizards do.</li> <li>With their unusually low metabolic rate, the lizards do not have high energy demands and can live on about half the food that other similar-sized lizards require. Therefore, they have very small, overlapping home ranges.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The island night lizard is a medium-sized lizard, with adults ranging from 2 ¾ to 4 inches in body length. It is endemic to the Channel Islands off the coast of southern California where it occurs on Santa Barbara, San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands. Both the color and pattern of the back of adult island night lizards are highly variable. Though these patterns grade into one another, there are serveral distinct types of which the mottled pattern is the most common (44% of the lizards). Less frequent patterns include plain, blotched, striped, broken stripes, ocellated, and finely mottled. Lichen-covered rocks and ground which make up their habitat and appear to provide good camouflage. Such cryptic coloration is oftern associated with the sort of sedentary lifestyle that the lizards have. However, the variety of colors and patterns present among the lizards is unusual. Few other terrestrial vertebrates show the marked color and pattern differences seen in island night lizards. In those that do, it is generally seen as geographic variation over a comparatively large range.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Island night lizards are an endemic Channel Islands reptile, known only to occur on Santa Barbara Island in the park and on San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands. They are the most morphologically distinct of the endemic vertebrates on the Channel Islands, indicating they have been isolated from the mainland for a long time.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The island night lizard is veru very secretive, preferring habitats with dense vegetation cover, such as boxthorn and prickly pear cactus, as well as cracks and crevices in and around rock outcrops and surface boulders. These areas provide protection from predators. They are also often found under rocks, driftwood, and fallen branches. Suitable habitat on Santa Barbara is in all of the canyons and on some of the sea cliffs, especially on the south side of Signal Peak. Island night lizards are very sedentary and have very small home ranges, averaging about 183 square feet.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Island night lizards feed on a wide variety of terrestrial spiders and insects, but they also eat an unusually large amount of plant material for a small lizard. Common animal food items include ground-dwelling spiders, pillbugs, a ground beetle (Amara sp.), moth larvae, and ants. Common plant food items include fruits of Australian saltbush, flowers, fruits and leaves of boxthorn, fruits of iceplant, and composite (Asteraceae) flower parts.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Night lizards have a low reproductive rate compared with other lizards, likely because they are so long-lived. Only about half of the adult females bear young in a given year and a female may not have her first brood until she is nearly five years old. Seasonal activity peaks in the spring when mating takes place, then continues at a lower level through the summer and fall. Island night lizards breed in April, and 2 - 9 young are born fully developed in September. Giving birth to live young (as opposed to laying eggs) is not common among reptiles. Young of the year are active throughout the year, while adults are active primarily during the spring and summer.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The island night lizard is listed as Threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, due to habitat alteration and predation resulting from introduction of alien species (e.g., feral cats, goats, pigs, and rabbits). However, according to the Channel Islands Species Recovery Plan of 1984, habitat on the islands \"probably has not been altered to the detriment of the [island night] lizards by grazing mammals\". Goats and pigs have recently been removed from San Clemente Island. Today, the island night lizard is not thought to be in imminent danger of extinction, and could be a candidate for delisting. Santa Barbara Island is part of the Channel Islands National Park. The entire island of San Clemente, used for military training, has been designated as Critical Habitat.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.werc.usgs.gov/Project.aspx?ProjectID=148\">USGS WERC Projects - Island Night Lizard Population Ecology on the Channel Islands</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/23095/0%20-%202007\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/23095/0%20%20-%202007</a></li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Aphelocoma insularis</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Of the over 500 species of birds that breed in North America, only one, the island scrub-jay, occurs on a single island—Santa Cruz Island in Channel Islands National Park. This makes it the only island endemic bird species in North America. Compared to its mainland cousin,the California scrub-jay, the island scrub-jay is larger, darker blue in color, and has a distinctive call, making it the most differentiated of all the island endemic birds. This species is the only scrub-jay on the Channel Islands and occupies more habitats than do scrub-jays on the mainland.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The island scrub-jay lives only on Santa Cruz Island, which means it has the smallest range of any North American bird species.</li> <li>The island scrub-jay belongs to the family Corvidae, which includes crows and ravens, are remarkable for their intelligence, memory and curiosity.</li> <li>A genetic analysis indicates that this species diverged from its closest relative, the wide spread California scrub-jay about 150,000 years ago.</li> <li>Island scrub-jays are monogamous and may stay with a mate for their entire lives.</li> <li>The island scrub-jay can live as long as twenty years.</li> <li>The island scrub-jay is noticeably larger than its mainland related species of scrub jays.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Measuring 13 inches, the island scrub-jay is distinguished from other scrub-jays by its larger size—almost 1/3 larger than its mainland counterpart. This species is also brighter and more vibrant blue than other scrub-jays. It has a broad head with ultramarine-blue nape, crown, upper wing and tail, a white upper breast, chin, and throat, and a large gray-brown patch on the upper part of its back. Other characteristics include a distinct blue collar below the throat which is nearly complete, and a disproportionate large black bill, and a long tail typical of most other jays. Juveniles are grayish-white overall, but have blue wings and tail. Island scrub-jays have a raspy \"shreep\" call and a undulating flight pattern.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The island scrub-jay is restricted to Santa Cruz Island, the largest and most topographically diverse of the Channel Islands. Santa Cruz Island is 18 miles off the coast of California and directly south of Santa Barbara. The Channel Islands are uniquely important for the preservation of this endemic bird and others. There are no recent records of scrub-jays occurring on other islands, but a fossil jay bone has been found on nearby Santa Rosas Island, and an ornithologist from the Smithsonian Institution who visited Santa Rosa Island in 1892 noted that the rancher there reported jays on the island. It is unclear at what point jays went extinct on Santa Rosa Island (Collins 2009).</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> This species breeds in coast live oak woodland or chaparral dominated by scrub oak. On the park property of Santa Cruz Island island scrub-jays are commonly seen in in upper Scorpion Canyon and at Prisoners Harbor. Most foraging and other maintenance activities occur inside territory boundaries, with territory boundaries being stable from year to year. Agonistic behaviors for defending territories include mostly vocalizations and chasing, although dominant jays have been observed pecking subordinate individuals.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The large bill of the island scrub-jay is related to its diet, of thick-shelled acorns which they bury, or cache, in the fall and eat months later. They also eat insects, spiders, snakes, lizards, mice, and other birds' eggs and nestlings.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> These birds are monogamous, often having the same mates all their lives. They are also territorial. Breeding habitat appears to be saturated on the island, causing young individuals to delay breeding for up to several years. Until breeding space becomes available, unmated individuals use marginal habitats not suitable for breeding. Non-breeders do not defend territories, but rather forage and roost in loose groupings or on their own.</p> <p>Nesting peaks during the last two weeks in March when the chaparral plants are flowering and growing new leaves. This period also coincides with an increase in arthropod abundance, indicating that this may be a strong influence on the timing of nesting in island scrub jays. Nests are located in dense bushes and trees and are often well-concealed. Nests are constructed of coarse sticks, lined with finer twigs and rootlets, and can be placed anywhere from ground level to 40 feet off the ground.</p> <p>Females lay two to five eggs in a nest that they incubate for about twenty days. While the female sits on the eggs, the males spends time hunting and defending the nest from predation by gopher snakes, island spotted skunks, island foxes, common ravens, and other island scrub jays. In fact, nest predation is the biggest limit onisland scrub-jay reproductive success, and the extent to which a nest isconcealed affects the likelihood of predation (Caldwell et al. 2013). Vegetation recovery on Santa Cruz Island may eventually reduce the impact of predation. Once the chicks fledge, average life expectancy is 4.8 years and can be as long as twenty years.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Since the island scrub-jay occurs only on one island that makes it susceptible to any major disaster, a disease outbreak, or widespread land-use changes, any of which could potentially extirpate the species or cause a severe population decline. The island scrub-jay is classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.</p> <p>The uniqueness of this jay is the focus of an ongoing research and monitoring effort by personnel from the Smithsonian Institution, Colorado State University, the UC Davis WildlifeHealth Center, and The Nature Conservancy. The most insidious threat to island scrub-jays is the possible introduction of West Nile Virus to Santa Cruz Island. The island scrub-jay's mainland cousin,the western scrub-jay, is extremely susceptible to West Nile Virus, which is carried by certain species of mosquitoes. Ambient temperatures on Santa Cruz Island are currently to low to support those mosquito species, but would be high enough to support those species when global warming occurs. The threat of this has prompted some conservation biologists to propose establishing a second, redundant population of island scrub-jays on Santa Rosa Island (Morrison et al. 2011). Another possible mitigation for West Nile Virus is annual vaccination of a core group of island scrub-jays against the disease, though the expense and availability of an appropriate vaccine and the difficulty of recapturing jays for booster shots make this less attractive as a treatment (Boyce et al. 2011, Wheeler et al.2011).</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"tp://birds.audubon.org/species/islscr\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">BirdLife International</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/106005688/0\">The ICUN Red List of Threatened Species</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/migratorybirds/featured_birds/default.cfm?id=302\">The Smithsonian National Zoological Park</a></li> <li>Boyce, W.M., W.

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Spilogale gracilis amphiala</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The island spotted skunk is endemic to the two largest California Channel Islands, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa. Unlike the island fox and the island deer mouse, the island spotted skunk shows little differentiation between the two islands as well as the mainland subspecies, suggesting recent colonization of the species. In recent times, the species was limited in numbers. However, island spotted skunk populations on both islands began increasing in the late 1990s, coincident with the decline in island foxes caused by golden eagle predation. As the only two terrestrial carnivores on the islands, skunks and foxes are natural competitors.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Island spotted skunks on the two islands differ only slightly, with those on Santa Rosa spotted skunk being slightly longer than those on Santa Cruz.</li> <li>Island spotted skunks are only about a third as large as their competitor, the island fox.</li> <li>They are more carnivorous than foxes, and more nocturnal. However, their diet became a little more omnivorous in the absence of the fox, during the late 1990s.</li> <li>Skunks may live only one to two years in the wild.</li> <li>Historically, skunks have been classified as a subfamily in the weasel family, the Mustelidae. Recent genetic data has resulted in skunks being reclassified into its own family, <em>Spilogale</em>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The island spotted skunk can be identified by its complex pattern of white markings on a blackbackground consisting of four to six broken white stripes, a triangular white forehead patch, a series of shorter white stripes resembling spots, and white on part of the abdominal surface and tip of the tail.</p> <p>It is distinguished from spotted skunk subspecies on the mainland by its shorter tail and less white abdominal coloration, slightly larger size, broader skull, and proportionately less white and blacker in the fur. Like the mainland subspecies, the island spotted skunks exhibit sexual size differences, with males averaging 28% larger than females. This skunk is considerably smaller than striped skunks on the mainland and has softer, glossier fur.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Channel Islands spotted skunks currently occur only on Santa Cruz and Santa RosaIslands where they are widely distributed. Spotted skunks occurred on San Miguel Island, probably until the late nineteenth century. Fossil material has been collected on San Miguel Island and a spotted skunk was reportedly collected from San Miguel Island sometime during the 1870s. However, there have been no records of skunks on San Miguel since then.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Spotted skunks on the Channel Islands show habitat preferences similar to those reportedfor the mainland subspecies. Based on radio telemetry studies, spotted skunks on Santa Cruz Island showed a preference for chaparral-grassland, open grassland, fennel-grassland, and ravines. On Santa Rosa Island, spotted skunks were found to be associated with rocky canyon slopes, cactus patches, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, open woodland, other scrub-grassland communities, and riparian habitat along streams. On both islands, the species has also been recorded in or under human dwellings and ranch outbuildings. The elevational range of the Channel Islands spotted skunk extends from sea level to approximately 2000 feet.</p> <p>Channel Islands spotted skunks are nocturnal. Activity begins at dusk, peaks during the early evening, and continues intermittently until dawn. On Santa Cruz Island, spotted skunks nest in cavities, burrows, and other natural crevices, as they do on the mainland. Dens are constructed in roots and earth under shrubs, cavities in rocks, open grassy areas, road cuts, human-made structures, and trunks and roots of oaks. Individuals use several dens distributed throughout their home range; some dens are used by two or more individuals either sequentially, or for females, simultaneously.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Spotted skunks on the Channel Islands have similar diets as those reported on the mainland. Studies on Santa Cruz Island showed skunks to be carnivorous, consuming primarily island deer mice and insects along with occasional lizards. Jerusalem crickets were the most frequent prey, but other prey included grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, caterpillars, earwigs, and ants. Seasonally available fruits and berries were collected on Santa Cruz Island consisting of grapes, summer holly stems and berries.</p> <p>In recent years skunks have begun preying on seabirds nesting in sea caves on Santa Cruz Island. Expansion of skunk foraging to sea caves is likely a result of their substantial population increase following decline of foxes.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The breeding season for spotted skunks on the islands is probably similar to spotted skunks on the mainland. Western spotted skunks mate in September and October, and following delayed implantation and a 210-310 day gestation, give birth in April and May to 2-6. Counts of three and five uterine scars were recorded from two skunks collected at Santa Cruz Island in September.</p> <p>On Santa Cruz Island, California, in a 1994 study of 47 dens used by island spotted skunks, 29.8% were under shrubs, 21.3% in open grassland, 21.3% in cavities in rocks, 10.6% in road cuts, 10.6% under human structures, and 6.4% in cavities in roots and trunks of trees.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the IUCN Red List (2008), the Western Spotted Skunk is listed as Least Concern as they are widely distributed in a variety of habitats including human altered habitats. The species may be declining in parts of the United States but not at a rate fast enough to be threatened. In contrast, prior to the recent upswing in skunk numbers on the islands, the island spotted skunk was thought to be rare, and was listed as a Species of Special Concern by the state of California. when the Island Spotted Skunk had a small population and was not well-studied, the skunk that time was designated as a species of concern. However, recent surveys now show a remarkable recovery in the species. On Santa Rosa Island, skunks are marked and counted during annual population monitoring for island foxes, and as of 2011 there were approximately 3,000 skunks on Santa Rosa Island.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/sudden-increase-rare-endemic-carnivore-ecology-island-spotted-skunk/\">Ecology of the Island Spotted Skunk</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.dfg.ca.gov/wildlife/nongame/ssc/docs/mammal/species/46.pdf\">Channel Islands Spotted Skunk</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_skunk\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_skunk</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136797/0\">ICUN Red List</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.

In one spot, a series of ship's knees (massive braces that tie a vessel's deck to the side of the hull-think shelf brackets) juts from the sand. Further east 80 feet of massive timbers, tied together with thick iron pins (\"drifts\" in nautical speak) form the remnants of a massive backbone (or keelson).<br /> <br /> These are the remains of the <em>Jane L. Stanford</em>, the largest wooden ship to wreck within Channel Islands National Park. Over 215 feet long and 41 feet wide, Hans Bendixen made the Jane L. Stanford specifically for carrying lumber across the Pacific Ocean to destinations such as South Africa and Australia. The ship was rigged as a four-masted barkentine, with square sails on her foremast.<br /> <br /> By 1926 the <em>Jane L. Stanford</em>, no longer competitive in her original trade, became a fishing barge off Los Angeles and then Santa Barbara, a typical fate for older sailing ships. In 1929 a steamer entering Santa Barbara rammed the ship. Damaged beyond repair but unsinkable, the hulk was a serious navigation hazard. The Coast Guard cutter <em>Tamaroa </em>towed her near Skunk Point where 26 naval wrecking mines blew the wreck apart over four days, scattering wreckage along two miles of beach. The distant explosions precipitated numerous calls to the Santa Barbara police, thirty miles away.<br /> <br /> The <em>Jane L. Stanford</em> is just one of over 140 documented shipwrecks in the waters of Channel Islands National Park and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. The significant number of shipwrecks within these boundaries can largely be attributed to prevailing currents and weather conditions, combined with natural hazards.<br /> <br /> The shipwreck remains of the Channel Islands reflect the diverse range of activities and nationalities that traversed the Santa Barbara Channel. European sailing and steam vessels, California-built Chinese junks, American coastal traders, vessels engaged in island commerce and a Gold Rush-era sidewheel steamers have all been lost in these waters.<br /> <br /> Today, park and sanctuary archeologists and partners study shipwrecks to learn more about these relics of history, shedding new light on the remarkable stories of our maritime heritage.<br /> <br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a huge expanse of soft white sand, on the western end of the beach at Skunk Point. Jutting up from the sand, like the teeth in a comb, are about 100 rusted iron rods, forming a line about 100 feet long. These rods stick up about two to three feet in height, and most are about two to three inches in diameter. The rods are uneven in thickness, as if they have been eroded. A few narrow down to a point near the tip, capped by a wider, flat section, like the flattened tip of a matchstick.<br /><br />Most rods are straight, but a few are bent and curved. Most of the rods are single file, in a long line, one rod deep. Near one end of the row, however, rods stick up in pairs of two, some penetrating large, deeply weathered wooden beams that sit between and on either side of the bars, running parallel to the line. The beams are half-buried in the sand. The beams are so weathered that ends are broken and jagged, and the surfaces are uneven and wavy, with deep grooves that follow the layers of the wood's grain and knots, like a topographic 3-D model. <br /><br />A few smaller clusters and short rows of iron rods and wooden beams can be found nearby, from 10 feet away to about a hundred yards away, all partially buried in the sand. <br /><br />The ocean is so far away, across this very deep beach, that is only visible as a thin blue line above the white sand, near the horizon line, stretching around you in a distant half circle.<br /><br /><br />",

Today the area has been revegetated and serves as the gateway to backcountry beach camping.<br /> <br /> <b>Post-War Military Facilities</b><br /> In moves to upgrade post-war readiness, and accelerated by Cold War tensions with the USSR and China after World War II, the branches of the military used the momentum gained in wartime research and development of detection and weapons systems to establish new defense and communication systems throughout the world. The West Coast saw much of this development, especially in missile technology and radar communications, and these relatively new disciplines would be represented on the Channel Islands from the 1940s through the 1990s. On Santa Rosa Island, the Air Force and Navy established complex communications systems that followed in the footsteps of the relatively primitive World War II-era facilities there.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>US Navy Operations</strong> </b><br /> In 1952, the US Naval Air Missile Test Center installed a communications station (including receiver and transmitting building and barracks) on Navy Hill on Santa Rosa to track missiles fired from its installations at Point Mugu and San Nicolas Island. After 1985 the Navy abandoned the site and removed the buildings. However, as late as 1993 an unmanned EATS (Extended Area Test System) Ground Reference Station sat on Black Mountain, under the operation of the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, successor to the Pacific Missile Test Center.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>Santa Rosa Island Air Force Station at Johnson's Lee</strong> </b><br /> The US Air Force activated the 669th Aircraft Control and Warning (ACW) Squadron on May 5, 1950, at Fort MacArthur. The squadron's mission would be to detect, identify, and track air traffic in southern California as a defense against enemy invasion. The detection system would be directly linked to armed air defense stations throughout the area that could respond instantly to any attack or threat. After tests, Air Force officials chose Santa Rosa Island for the operations site, making use of the protected area on the central southern shore called Johnsons Lee.<br /> <br /> Completed in 1952, the station consisted of the radar, transmitting, and receiving facilities located at the top of what is now referred to as Vail Peak (elevation 1,589 feet) and a cantonment area for personnel near the shore at Johnson's Lee. The cantonment included five two-story barracks for the airmen, dining hall, training and recreation buildings, offices, warehouses and maintenance facilities, dispensary, concrete pier, modern paved road between the Johnson's Lee facilities and the communications station, and landing strip.<br /> <br /> Los Angeles Times feature reporter Charles Hillinger and photographer Howard Maxwell visited the island in 1956, as the first representatives of the press allowed to tour the secret facility. According to Hillinger, the station was staffed by up to 300 men, including about 30 civilians. Personnel worked seven days a week, six hours on and twelve hours off, during an eighteen-month tour of duty with three days a month leave. Upon arrival via a 78-foot PT boat from Port Hueneme, men were off-loaded in a cage, lowered and raised to the boat deck by a crane.<br /> <br /> Men were assigned duty depending on their training and skills. Most did technical work, involving monitoring air traffic on large scopes, while others performed guard duty and patrol. Civilians took care of most maintenance and repair.<br /> <br /> The cantonment included numerous venues for entertainment and relaxation, according to Hillinger: \"Hobby shops, recreational facilities, television (with reception exceptionally good on all the Islands), nightly movies, fishing trips on calm days in four light boats, archery, badminton, baseball and tennis provide activity for lonely hours. The camp library, stocked with donated books, rates high in popularity. \"<br /> <br /> Hillinger noted that lack of women was the only drawback to many of the men. Vail & Vickers prohibited women and children to take up residence at the base. The lease prohibited \"any person of school age, unless such person be an active member of the Armed Forces . . . . There are no schools on Santa Rosa Island, and therefore, Owner does not pay any school tax.\" Otherwise, morale was \"surprisingly good.\"<br /> <br /> The Air Force Base and cattle ranch interacted well, according to most sources. Ed and Al Vail visited the station regularly and Air Force men came to the ranch headquarters. The facility had a bar that attracted island workers. Once Ed and Al Vail, after receiving \"first class invitations,\" dressed in tuxedos and brought the Vaquero II around for a formal party with the \"big brass.\" The Air Force invited island cowboys to the movies and to beer parties on the beach. The commanding officer allowed the ranch to take parts and tires from the motor pool and shared stores. Diego Cuevas recalled receiving a huge four-foot wheel of cheese given as a gift for ranch workers.<br /> <br /> In 1962 an Air Force study concluded that cost of support and operation at the station was just too high and recommended that the operation could be moved without significant sacrifice of radar coverage to a site at Point Conception. In 1963, the station was closed and the The Islander, the squadron's newsletter, published its last edition with its headline reading \"Santa Rosa Island Bids a Fond Farewell\" and reporting of the base closing party, complete with \"delicious\" steak dinners, softball, tug-of-war, and relay races.<br /> <br /> The Air Force then abandoned the facility, leaving all buildings, utilities, and much equipment to Vail & Vickers. At the time of abandonment by the Air Force, the site consisted of at least forty buildings and structures. Vail & Vickers soon made use of their bounty. Ranch workers used salvaged materials all over the island for buildings, including the new foreman's residence and replacement bunkhouse and roundup corrals. Cowboys used the guardrail left on the military road as railing at all the roundups, resulting in some of the sturdiest corrals existing in California. The Air Force left the water plant, heating and steam systems, cots, mattresses, lamps and the like. In the motor pool the cowboys found an abandoned compressor, car lift, fuel tanks, and pumps.<br /> <br /> Not all of the staggering amount of materials and buildings could be used, and the facilities lay deteriorating for more than 30 years, used as occasional shelter by boaters, and continually picked over by the ranch crew for odds and ends. After a few years of NPS use as island headquarters, from about 1987 to 1990, the site was abandoned except for one building. In the late 1980s the Army Corps of Engineers removed asbestos and underground storage tanks, and the NPS then burned most of the buildings. After completing environmental and historical studies, in 1991 and 1992 the National Park Service buried the remaining foundations of the facility, removed the pier ruins, and revegetated the terrain. Only one building of the base remains in place, Building 147, the auto maintenance shop, which is now used by park personnel as a remote storage and study base.<br /> <br /> <strong>For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the </strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> _</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Kayaking (excluding personal watercraft-see <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/management/lawsandpolicies.htm\">Laws and Policies</a> for more information) is a unique and rewarding way to experience the pristine marine environment of Channel Islands National Park. You will find solitude and splendor. Here you will also face new challenges and may encounter unexpected dangers. This section is designed to help in planning a safe, enjoyable, and environmentally sound kayaking trip in the park.</p> <p><em>Click</em> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/upload/kayak-2022-v2.pdf\">here</a><em> to</em> <em>download a PDF site bulletin file of Santa Cruz Island kayaking information with a map. This file requires</em> <a href=\"https://www.nps.govhttp//www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html\">Adobe Reader</a><em>.</em></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Planning Your Trip</strong><br /> Sea kayaking is a high risk activity that has caused the death of park visitors and annually numerous near fatal incidents with sea kayakers occur in the park. The challenging and quickly changing weather and at times extreme sea conditions and dangerous sea caves greatly add to the risks of sea kayaking in the park. Sea kayaking on your own in any area of the park should not be attempted by novice or first time kayakers or anyone who is not properly experienced, trained, conditioned and equipped.</p> <p>Visitors may kayak on their own or with a park authorized guide/outiftter. The National Park Service strongly recommends for your safety that sea kayaking be done with one of the park's authorized guide/outfitters. The guided trips are moderate to strenuous in nature, but some do not require previous kayaking experience.<br /> <br /> For the authorized kayak guide and outfitting concession in the Scorpion Anchorage area on Santa Cruz Island visit: <a href=\"http://www.sbadventureco.com/adventures/channel-islands/#Sea-Cave-Kayaking\">Channel Islands Adventure Company</a>. For kayak guide and outfitting services in other areas of the park (excluding Scorpion area), visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/parkmgmt/visitor-services-list.htm\">Visitor Services List.</a></p> <p>Visitors with their own kayaks who would like to explore the park may contact the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/island-transportation.htm\">park concessioners</a>, who will transport kayaks on their public trips for an extra fee. The concessionaires offer year-round transportation to the islands for day visits and camping trips.</p> <p>Sea kayaking opportunities are available throughout the park. To help you decide which island to visit, specific island information is available at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/placestogo.htm\">Places To Go</a> or from the visitor center through publications, exhibits, and the park movie.</p> <p>The area of the park that is most popular for sea kayaking is centered around Scorpion Beach on East Santa Cruz Island. This location is a world class destination for sea kayaking because of easy beach access, clear ocean waters, nearby camping, readily available concessionaire boat transportation service and a spectacular shoreline with beautiful sea cave and cliffs to explore.</p> <p>Sea kayaking at San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands is recommended to only the most highly experienced (expert), skilled, conditioned kayakers with all necessary safety equipment due to the consistently extreme weather and sea conditions that regularly dominate these areas.</p> <p>Due to the many hazards of crossing the channel from or to the mainland to the park islands the National Park Service does not recommend this be attempted by sea kayakers.</p> <p>Detailed kayaking information about the channel and islands may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG) \"Local Notice to Mariners\" publication by contacting the Coast Guard at (510) 437-2981. Kayaking guides and nautical charts to the Channel Islands are available from local marine stores and online bookstores. Refer to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Ocean Survey charts 18720, 18721, 18725, 18727, 18728, 18729, and 18756.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Weather</strong><br /> Conditions in the Santa Barbara Channel and around the islands are variable and the ocean is unforgiving. Only experienced kayakers with vessels capable of withstanding severe weather are advised to make the cross-channel passage.</p> <p>Kayakers should obtain the latest weather broadcast provided by the NOAA Weather Service by calling (805) 988-6610, visiting Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary's <a href=\"http://channelislands.nos.noaa.gov/focus/kiosk.html\">Internet Weather Kiosk</a> and by monitoring weather radio on VHF-FM 162.475 MHz (weather station 3) for marine forecasts and VHF-FM 162.55 MHz (weather station 1) and VHF-FM 162.40 MHz (weather station 2) for land-based observations.</p> <p>Weather conditions vary considerably in the channel. Extreme weather conditions may be encountered at any time and the sea conditions may become dangerous without warning. The calmest winds and sea conditions often occur August through October. The other months are subject to a much greater chance for adverse wind and seas with sudden unexpected changes. High winds may occur regardless of the forecast. Forty-knot winds are not unusual for Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands. Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands have more moderate winds.</p> <p>Winds are often calm in the early morning and increase during the afternoon. Generally the wind comes from the northwest, but kayakers must be also be prepared for strong east or Santa Ana winds at anytime, especially from September through April.</p> <p>Dense fog is common during the summer months, but may occur at any time, making chart and compass navigation mandatory. Ocean currents of considerable strength may be encountered both near and offshore from the islands. Ocean water temperatures range from the lower 50s (°F) in the winter to the upper 60s (°F) in the fall.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Safety</strong><br /> Due to challenging weather conditions, kayaking should not be attempted by the novice or anyone who is not properly trained, conditioned, and equipped. Safety requires good planning and common sense. Sea kayaking is potentially hazardous, even for experienced kayakers. Please follow these saftey recommendations:</p> <p><u>Use the buddy system.</u><br /> There are no lifeguards on duty. Kayaking is at your own risk. Stay together and paddle within the skills of the least experienced paddler in the group.</p> <p><u>Obtain current weather and sea conditions.</u><br /> The conditions around the islands are considered \"open ocean.\" Extreme weather conditions may be encountered at any time and sea conditions may become dangerous without warning.There is no place where visitors will be kayaking in a protected cove. Always observe and evaluate sea conditions before entering the water. Be alert to wind, wave, and currents at all times.</p> <p><u>Do not travel down wind (with the wind) as you will have to return into a headwind.</u><br /> Wind and waves typically come out of the northwest or west. Winds tend to increase in the afternoon. Morning hours can be a better time for kayaking, and other watersports. Challengin Santa Ana or east winds may occur at anytime, but are most common from September through April.</p> <p><u>Do not exceed your skill level.</u><br /> If you are new to sea kayaking or other watersports, stay close to your launch area and paddle with an experienced kayaker. Ask National Park Service personnel or kayak guides if you have questions concerning weather, safety, etc. Be capable of re-entering your kayak from the water.</p> <p><u>Let someone know where you are going and when you expect to return.</u><br /> Kayakers should always file a float plan with family and/or friends and inform them of your departure and return. The float plan should include: 1) the number of boats and boaters on the trip as well as the color, size, and type of craft used; 2) names and addresses for the boaters , as well as emergency phone numbers; 3) any survival and special emergency equipment should be listed (EPIRB, VHF, food rations, flares, etc.); and 4) the place, date, and time of departure and return should be logged as well as destination(s). This information can be invaluable for a search operation if something goes wrong. Remember to be flexible with your plans. Weather should always determine your course of action.</p> <p>If you are kayaking across the channel, kayakers should also file a formal float plan with the harbormaster before departing and contact island rangers at the beginning and end of the paddle.</p> <p><u>Carefully select and equip your paddlecraft.</u><br /> Craft should be of a sea kayak design and kayakers must have the following items:</p> <ul> <li>Lifejackets-all paddlers must have lifejackets.</li> <li>Helmets-always wear a helmet when paddling below cliffs and in sea caves.</li> <li>VHF radio, tow line, compass, throw bag, first aid kit, signaling device (airhorn, whistle, or signal mirror). Carry these items with you and know how to use them.</li> <li>Wetsuits are highly recommended. Water temperatures remain cold throughout the year.</li> </ul> <p><u>Sea Caves</u><br /> Sea caves can be very dangerous-large waves or swells can fill a cave unexpectedly. Even on calm days, the wake from large ships in the channel can pose a danger to kayakers in caves. Be extremely careful and wear a helmet at all times when exploring sea caves. Always observe and evaluate sea conditions before entering any sea cave.</p> <p><u>Shipping Lanes</u><br /> Major shipping lanes lie between the islands and the mainland. Kayakers should be aware of their location and use caution when crossing them. All kayakers should listen to the USCG notice to mariners broadcast on VHF channel 22 since the waters in and surrounding the park are sometimes closed for military operations.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Regulations</strong><br /> In addition to the regulations listed below please see <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/parkmgmt/lawsandpolicies.htm\">Laws and Policies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/limiting-your-impact.htm\">Limiting Your Impact</a> for additional information.</p> <ul> <li>You may not exit your kayak while in the sea caves.<br />  </li> <li>Do not disturb wildlife within caves. It is illegal to feed, touch, tease, frighten, or intentionally disturb wildlife.<br />  </li> <li>Please avoid use of artificial lights in caves.<br />  </li> <li>Stay off rocks. Scorpion Rock on Santa Cruz Island and all other off shore islets in the park are off limits.<br />  </li> <li>The Santa Cruz Island shoreline between Arch Point (northwest of Scorpion Anchorage) and the east boundary of Potato Harbor is closed to landing to protect nesting seabirds.<br />  </li> <li>Other island shorelines and beaches may be closed to landing to protect pinnipeds and seabirds.

However, a landing permit is required to land on The Nature Conservancy (TNC) property on Santa Cruz Island.</p> <p>There are closed and restricted areas on each island. Please note that rocks or islets on or near any of the islands are closed year-round to any landing and pets are not allowed in the park. Please refer to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/management/lawsandpolicies.htm\">Laws and Policies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/limiting-your-impact.htm\">Limiting Your Impact</a> for more information on regulations and guidelines.</p> <p>Kayakers may land according to the following procedures:<br /> <br /> <strong>Santa Barbara Island</strong>: A permit is not required to land or hike on Santa Barbara Island. Access to the island is permitted only at the landing cove. The landing dock is available for unloading purposes only. No craft, including kayaks and inflatables, should be left moored to the dock.</p> <p><strong>Anacapa Island:</strong> A permit is not required to land or hike on East Anacapa Island or at Frenchys Cove. West Anacapa (except Frenchys Cove) is a protected research natural area and is closed to visitors. Visitors are allowed on Middle Anacapa by permit only and when accompanied by a park ranger.<br /> <br /> The landing dock is available for unloading purposes only. No craft, including kayaks and inflatables, should be left moored to the dock.</p> <p><strong>Santa Cruz Island:</strong> Boaters may land and hike on the eastern 24% of Santa Cruz Island without a permit. This area is owned by the NPS and is east of the property line between Prisoners Harbor and Valley Anchorage. Due to surf and swell conditions, boaters should use extreme caution when making surf-landings at any beach, especially Smugglers Cove and those beaches facing south and southeast between San Pedro Point and Sandstone Point.</p> <p>A permit to land on the other 76% of Santa Cruz Island is required from TNC. A fee is charged and no overnight island use is permitted. Contact (805) 642-0345 x510 or <a href=\"http://www.nature.org/\">www.nature.org/</a> for a permit; allow 10-12 days for processing.</p> <p><strong>Santa Rosa Island:</strong> Boaters may land along coastline and on beaches without a permit for day-use only. From March 1 to September 15, the back beaches and sand dunes between and including Skunk Point to just north of East Point are closed to hiking to protect the nesting area for the snowy plover, a federally listed, threatened shorebird. Please remain on the wet sand (below mean high tide) or the road throughout this area. The beaches around Sandy Point are closed year-round. A pier is available at Bechers Bay.</p> <p><strong>San Miguel Island:</strong> Kayakers may land only on the beach at Cuyler Harbor. San Miguel Island is owned by the U. S. Navy and open for landing only when National Park Service personnel are on the island. The island was a former bombing range and there are possible unexploded ordnance.<br /> <br /> If kayakers are not traveling to San Miguel Island with Island Packers, it is the responsibility of the kayakers to contact the park to ensure the island is open before coming ashore. A permit (including liability waiver) is required to visit the island. Kayakers can obtain these forms at a self-registration station at the Nidever Canyon trail head entry on San Miguel Island. If you are traveling to San Miguel Island with Island Packers they will provide the forms to you upon your reservation.<br /> <br /> Visitors are required to be escorted beyond the ranger station. Visitors may explore Cuyler Harbor beach, Nidever Canyon, the Cabrillo Monument, and the Lester Ranch site unescorted. No off-trail hiking is permitted.<br /> <br /> If you are traveling to San Miguel Island with Island Packers for the day or to camp, park staff will already be scheduled on the island and usually available to provided escorted hikes. Kayakers traveling on their own are required to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/common/utilities/sendmail/sendemail.cfm?o=488DD2A8A2D7A6AF84BA07ACF137A5BD55D341804A&r=/chis/planyourvisit/kayaking.htm\">e-mail us</a> prior to their mainland departure to arrange for an escorted hike by a ranger. Provide your name, phone number, vessel name, and dates of requested escorted hike. Park staff will then reply with available dates and instructions.</p> <p> </p> <br />  ",

All that remains today is what you see before you-piles of rubble, hardware and metal pieces, two cement-lined excavations considered to be a cistern and a root cellar, collapsed chimney and fireplace, and the remains of a fig tree.<br /> <br /> <b>Island Ranching History</b><br /> For a summary of ranching history on the island, please see the guided tour stop 5. What follows is a detailed account of ranching history on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> Sheep ranchers occupied San Miguel Island for almost 100 years. Little is known about the first, a person named Bruce, but the succession of settlers to follow included George Nidever, a prominent California pioneer, William G. Waters, an eccentric entrepreneur, and the well-publicized family of Herbert Lester, whose isolated existence was made charming by Lester's personality and the perseverance of his wife and young daughters. Lester's life on the island ended tragically, but his family's story is one of the more interesting in the history of the California coast.<br /> <br /> <b>George Nidever's Sheep Ranch, 1850-1870</b><br /> It is not known when sheep first grazed on the island but reports indicate a date prior to 1850. The only source of information regarding mid-century grazing is the narrative dictated at 76 years of age by California pioneer George Nidever, the mountain man and trapper who settled on San Miguel Island in 1850. Nidever bought a schooner in San Francisco in early 1850 and soon \"bought out the interest of a man by the name of Bruce\" who had been grazing sheep on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> Nidever imported 45 head of sheep, 17 head of cattle, two hogs and seven horses and by 1862 the stock had increased to 6,000 sheep, 200 head of cattle, 100 hogs and 32 horses. During the severe drought in 1863 and 1864 Nidever lost most of his livestock (\"5,000 sheep, 180 cattle, a few hogs, and 30 horses\"). The later Nidever period on the island marked the beginning of the destruction of the rich native flora on the island, as Nidever's sheep denuded much of the island, leaving just sand dunes and drifts. Only eight years after leaving the island, Nidever related that he had been told that the island \"is almost covered with sand.\"<br /> <br /> Nidever and his sons occupied an adobe house located in an arroyo up from Cuyler Harbor in the west tributary of what has been called Nidever Canyon.<br /> <br /> Nidever took his schooner over to San Nicolas to hunt for sea gull eggs in April of 1852 and discovered the footprints of an old Indian woman who had been left on the island when the rest of the Indians were removed. In July of 1853 he returned there and \"rescued\" the woman. Nidever took the \"lost woman\" of San Nicolas to his Santa Barbara home where his wife cared for her until she soon died.<br /> <br /> <b>The Heyday of Sheep Ranching</b><br /> The mysterious Bruce and then the Nidever family established sheep ranching on the island, but it was their successors who transformed it into an industry, albeit on a small scale. Although minor in scope, sheep ranching brought the first Euro-American settlers to the island and was the most significant and long-lasting historical use. The subsequent destruction of the island's vegetation by sheep would have far-reaching ramifications, not only in limiting the success of ranching but in paving the way for preservation and restoration by government agencies of the 20th century.<br /> <br /> Following Nidever, the Mills brothers and their Pacific Wool Growing Company grazed their sheep on the island's grasses and packed wool for sale to mainland markets for 17 years. William G. Waters and his sheep then occupied the island for almost 30 years, during which the federal government affirmed its ownership of San Miguel Island. Robert Brooks held a government lease for another 30 years but did not reside there; he installed Herbert Lester, an intelligent and colorful man who raised a family on the isolated island and garnered a great deal of national publicity in the process. Lester's occupation ended in tragedy, and soon sheep ranching gave way to occupation by the United States Navy and a new era in island history. Sheep ranching dominated the history of San Miguel Island and, while not a major contributor to the state's agricultural economy, is made significant more by its protagonists, the Nidevers, Mills', Waters' and Lesters, whose stories are told below.<br /> <br /> <b>Mills Brothers Ranch, 1870-1887</b><br /> The Mills brothers, Hiram and Warren, operated a sheep ranch on San Miguel Island for the same number of years as Nidever had, and continued to contribute to the destruction of the island's flora. They and their partners formed a business called Pacific Wool Growing Company and built an undetermined number of wood frame buildings in the canyon above Cuyler Harbor. Theirs was the first organized business enterprise on the island.<br /> <br /> Hiram Mills purchased an undivided half of the island on May 8, 1869 from the Nidevers for $5,000, and then bought the rest on April 26 of the following year for $10,000, including the livestock, personal property and improvements. Mills and his partners called their enterprise the Pacific Wool Growing Company and had an office in San Francisco. Mills has been credited with building a two-story frame house in the canyon east of Nidever's adobe but apparently visited the island only occasionally. After surviving the collapse of the wool market in 1876 the Pacific Wool Growing Company continued in business, likely with caretakers on the island living in the house. Other activities, including otter and seal hunting and abalone harvesting, were pursued on the island during those years.<br /> <br /> Visitors to the island in the 1870s described a sheep operation out of control as the animals grazed the vegetation down to the sand. In 1874 William Dall of the Coast Survey visited the island and wrote, \". . . there are no young trees . . . as the omnipresent sheep crop every green thing within their reach to the ground.\" Coast Survey employee and archeologist Paul Schumacher spent four days on the island and later wrote of starving sheep, calling the island \"a barren lump of sand.\" Wheeler noted drifting sand in 1879 as he described the island as barren and extremely desolate.<br /> <br /> <b>William G. Waters at San Miguel Island, 1887-1916 </b><br /> In November of 1887 Captain William G. Waters bought a half interest in the island and the livestock that were on it for $10,000 from Mills. As of January 1888 the ranch supported 4,000 sheep, 30 head of cows and horses, an undisclosed number of pigs, turkeys, chickens, one dog and two cats. Waters would be the longest-lived resident of the island, spending almost thirty years there. Waters continued the day-to-day business of sheep ranching, but added flavor to the island lore with stories of his eccentricities and fondness for publicity.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Waters' carefully kept diary described the island as a productive farm. For example, in January 1888, the men commenced to harrow at least two fields and in February planted 47 acres in barley. In the winter during which she wrote, rain was plentiful, filling the rain barrels and evidently bringing forth good crops all around, as she wrote of following her husband to the grain fields in the spring and of the two of them cutting and stacking the hay, at one point in a pile 30 feet high. During the winter and spring Waters bought a mowing machine and a reaper for the barley hay. Waters had a barn for grain at \"the top of the hill\" and built a tool house in January. They grew their own vegetables, had a fenced potato patch in the sand above the house, built a grape arbor, and churned butter. Dairy products, poultry, eggs and pigs were abundant although they did depend upon the supply boat for flour and fruit.<br /> <br /> William Waters and his hired hands worked hard six days a week. The men built a road from the beach at the harbor to the top of the island, blasting rocks and making a fine but narrow grade for hauling supplies up and products down. The road remains as a hiking trail today, and some of the men's rockwork is evident.<br /> <br /> They also maintained a boathouse at Cuyler Harbor by regularly salvaging lumber off the island's beaches. The ranch was equipped with a forge, as Mrs. Waters wrote of Jimmie making irons for the cart. The family traveled to the west end for good water, considering the water in the canyon to be unpalatable.<br /> <br /> Waters hired sheep shearers on the mainland every spring, who worked in the shearing sheds and bunked in the ranch house. In a traditional practice, a shearer would be given a ficha, a punched, metal token marked \"San Miguel Island\" and on the other side \"W. G. Waters / one sheep\" for each sheep shorn which he would trade in for payment at the end of the day or shearing period. According to later reports, a ewe brought a nickel and a ram a dime.<br /> <br /> By 1889 Waters had been cultivating parts of the island. Documents showed that he owned hay farming implements that year, and the following year, when Waters took sole possession, the island supported 3,000 sheep, 150 cattle, ten horses and mules, as well as hogs, goats and poultry. Waters owned wagons, carts, plows, harrows and mowing machines. A map of the island made by C. D. Voy around 1893 depicted cultivated fields on the mesa lands above Cuyler Harbor.<br /> <br /> During Waters' term on the island a geological event changed the topography of the island and its surrounding waters. Observers noted that sand beaches were increasing in size and number in the 1890s, and the Coast Survey reported great sand dunes spilling into Cuyler Harbor from the west, causing the destruction of the large kelp bed in the harbor noted by Forney in 1871. Then in March of 1895, a huge landslide occurred, as reported by Waters in the San Francisco Examiner shortly after the event:<br /> <br /> \"There has been quite a commotion over here. The land that formed those high bluffs back of the boathouse has sunk more than sixty feet perpendicularly and forced itself into the harbor, raising the beach and rocks which have lain at the water's edge for thirty years some thirty feet above. This upheaval extends up and down the beach more than 1,000 feet. The boathouse is in a depression, and the sand and stones in front of it are over thirty feet high. This must have happened Saturday, March 8th. I felt a shock, but as the wind was blowing strong thought nothing of it. It must have come very suddenly, as lots of fish and small crabs were caught in the upheaval and left high and dry out of the water.<br /> <br /> The extent of this upheaval covers over twenty acres, and as it is continually on the move I cannot tell what the next change will be. Whether this extends far under the water in the harbor I do not know. It will leave huge stones on the west side of the harbor and change the landing. My boats and those of Captain Ellis are all right. The land was raised in the boathouse, while the posts remained as they were.<br /> <br /> It is a strange and peculiar upheaval. Some scientific man should see it. I give it up. I shall be obliged to remove my corral to the other side of the spring and rocks. The boathouse is now about 300 feet inland. Captain Dally will tell you all about it. I went all over it, but as it was on the move I thought I had better return to solid land and await events.\"<br /> <br /> Waters found the boathouse pointing north/northeast instead of east, with a bluff between it and the water about 100 yards wide and 60 to 70 feet high. The movement at Cuyler Harbor, considered by modern geologists as a large rotational slump-landslide, obliterated the many tide-level caves in the southwest harbor and caused the U. S. Coast & Geodetic Survey to re-survey Cuyler Harbor that November and produce a new chart of the harbor reflecting the significant changes in the harbor bottom and the land topography.<br /> <br /> The following year, 1896, brought conflict between Waters and government surveyors. Newspapers had earlier reported that, since San Miguel Island had not been mentioned in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, it was not a United States possession and thus could be used by England as a coaling station. The government determined to investigate and assembled a party of surveyors to map the island. Considering the island to be his, Waters would have none of it and threatened to shoot the invaders. U. S. Marshal Nicholas A. Covarrubias then put together a party of 22 men, composed of the surveyors and a contingent of armed men, and armed himself with orders from President Grover Cleveland to admit the survey party. Covarrubias and his contingent left Santa Barbara on July 7, 1896. According to a newspaper account, Waters met the marshal on the beach, protested the entry, but did not resist the order when shown it. He stipulated that the party could not kill his sheep, but that Waters himself would provide meat for the party and transport of their equipment and provisions. In an interview made more than 25 years later, Covarrubias had a different view of the events. He said that he had \"set about recruiting an army, chartered a vessel and rounded up a formidable bunch of deputies, armed them to the teeth, and set sail for the island. When Waters saw them in the offing, he decided that the Army was much too strong, and he surrendered at discretion. He was invited aboard and proved his friendship by eating prodigiously of the good things which had been secured for the Army.\"<br /> <br /> Whatever the true story of the landing, apparently all went smoothly with the survey, and the party returned to the mainland days later without incident. Waters did, however, file a protest that was placed on file at the Surveyor General's Office in Washington.<br /> <br /> Sand drifts reportedly covered Waters' old ranch house in upper Nidever Canyon around 1906. Around that year under Waters' guidance, resident manager John Russell built a new ranch house out of salvaged wood from shipwrecks and cargoes of lumber schooners that had come to grief on San Miguel Island. For example, the J M Colman had gone aground in 1905 just inside Point Bennett; Russell hauled the redwood lumber it carried up from the ship to the ranch house site with Mexican burros. The house was 125 feet long, 16 feet wide, and double-walled to withstand the winds that blew almost perpetually and reached velocities up to 100 miles an hour. Later another leaseholder, Robert Brooks, and Russell built a fence erected at an angle to the westerly wind to shield the house from wind and sand. As lumber drifted ashore from shipwrecks (for instance, the Comet), the house was rebuilt, fences and outbuildings repaired. Waters and Russell also constructed a blacksmith shop/harness room and a tool shed, and a new well, cistern and root cellar.<br /> <br /> Waters and Russell used tongue-in-groove hardwood for the interior finish of the house and designed the north side so that it could resist the northwest winds, although portholes afforded a view of the mainland. One historian surmised that the men built the house one room at a time as materials became available. The house had an interesting roofline, being a long shed with a gabled room on the east end and a hipped-roof room addition on the other. A long porch ran the length of the interior courtyard and numerous windows and doors opened on this courtyard. Two dormer windows on the roof slope faced the Channel and mainland. The house contained eleven rooms, with another added at an unknown time. From east to west the rooms were: a bathroom; a bedroom with anteroom and small closet; a dining room; three small bedrooms, reportedly used at times for shearers during the season; a serving room; a kitchen with a chimney, pantry and closet; a storage room; a small room with a closet; a laundry room with a meat cooler; and an added hallway or entranceway with a revolving door.<br /> <br /> A Santa Barbara newspaper noted the improvements: \"Recently Mr. Waters has erected a fine eight-room house on the island. The building has running water in every room and compares favorably with any city dwelling in the number and quantity of its modern conveniences. There is also a fine sheep shearing shed on the island.\"<br /> <br /> On November 18, 1908, a clipping from the San Francisco Call, date-line Santa Barbara, related that title to the whole of San Miguel Island was at stake in a suit coming up the following day in Los Angeles. The case, it read, had been pending for four years. The island, it claimed, was transferred from Elias Beckman to W. G. Waters in 1892. Beckman now argued that the transfer was made only by a deed of trust, so he took the matter to court and sued so as to prevent a transfer of the land to the San Miguel Island Company. Waters and the Company argued that it was a complete transfer. In the last line the article included the information that the state also had a claim on the property. The General Land Office was called upon for guidance, and in its correspondence it mentioned no leases and recited that the island was not covered by any land claim. The court ordered the company dissolved and the assets distributed among the stockholders. Apparently this was done, and Waters ended up in sole possession of the business once again.<br /> <br /> In 1909, President Taft ordered San Miguel Island to be reserved as a lighthouse reservation. On February 9, 1911, Waters wrote to Taft asking that he revoke the Executive Order and instead allow him to stay on the island. He argued that he had come to California in 1877, bought an interest in San Miguel in 1887, and lived there ever since. He had made many improvements and had been a volunteer weather observer; and, since he was an old soldier having served at the front in the Civil War, it would be an undue hardship at his age to remove his buildings and leave. He had been informed that a lighthouse would be built on this island that he said was only good for sheep. A lighthouse, if any, he wrote, should be constructed on Richardson's Rock seven miles west of San Miguel. He then referred to his bout with the survey team, which had tried to land on the island during President Cleveland's administration. Then he argued anew that he had consulted his attorney and had been advised that no mention was made of the island in the treaty between Spain and Mexico.<br /> <br /> A formal brief supplied by attorneys for the Department of Commerce found Water's claim without any foundation whatever. Still, it pointed out, the Department was not under legal obligation to lease the island to the highest bidder or to solicit competitive bids, and a satisfactory disposition of the matter might be to issue Waters a revocable license to use the island for five years. Waters was awarded a five-year lease on November 1, 1911, at $5 a year. In signing the lease, Waters acknowledged ownership by the U.S. Government.<br /> <br /> Waters entered into a contract with Robert L. Brooks and J. R. Moore on January 9, 1917. For $30,000, at one-third down, Brooks and Moore received his livestock including some 2,500 sheep and some cattle, improvements including the house and barns, and his lease that was valid until November of 1921. Waters died shortly after on April 26, 1917, after thirty years of \"owning\" San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> <b>Robert L. Brooks Lease</b><br /> The entry of Robert Brooks into the San Miguel Island lease opened a new era in the island's history that would last 30 years. Brooks loved the island and the work there, although he lived comfortably on the mainland. He hired men to tend the island sheep ranch, and his employment of Herbert Lester would provide one of the most interesting and well-documented periods in Channel Islands history. The Lester occupation ended suddenly in 1942 and six years later, the sheep ranching period on San Miguel Island came to a close.<br /> <br /> Brooks thrived on hard outdoor work where he rubbed elbows with the ranch hands. At the end of the day he loved to drink and talk and spin tales with them, and he kept pictures of himself and these friends. San Miguel Island contributed perhaps half of his annual income, but the island was far more important than income to Brooks. It supplied the romance he needed, a place to talk about, and a place to go and work at shearing time. Shearing time was a huge event, and the whole family got up in the middle of the night to see him off. His shearing hands consisted of several professional shearers and unskilled workers, the latter he referred to as \"the bums of Santa Barbara.\" He cleared the county jail of convicts each year and claimed the city fathers loved him for it. Then he took them out on Joe Castagnola's boat or one of Vail's, and dragged along a barge. The ranch had well-constructed shearing pens, a wool house, and a blacksmith shop. But each year the old wharf had to be torn out and replaced because the waves damaged it badly. New chutes had to be built to bring the sheep down to the wharf where they were loaded on to the barge, 55 at a time, and taken to Port Hueneme, unloaded and transferred to Brooks' ranch at Camarillo. Sheep grazing on San Miguel went well. There were no predators on the island, lambing was considered 100%, and the tax records at Santa Barbara County indicate that none of the unsecured property on San Miguel was ever taxed.<br /> <br /> The head count of sheep increased during Brooks' first ten years on the island. By 1921 the island supported more than 4,000 sheep. He sold mutton to the San Antonio Packing Company, R. L. Bliss Packing Company and Hauser Packing Company, and wool to the Standard Felt Company. Not all went well for Brooks. He lost an entire shipment of 50 Shropshire bucks that he had brought to the island. The drought in 1924 caused Brooks to remove all but 500 head from the island, and the following year, in attempting to restock, lost half of the sheep he had imported from Santa Cruz Island to locoweed and lupine. He claimed in a letter to Captain Rhodes of the Lighthouse Bureau that only the native sheep of the island were \"enured [sic] to avoid the loco and lupin\" and so he had to keep the native ewe lambs to increase the herd rather than selling them. Brooks spent a \"considerable\" amount of money on Australian Salt Bush seed, which he successfully planted on about 1,500 acres of the island. He wrote that \"it started growing in every section of the island where it was sown . . . [it] will grow on the very worst part of the island.\" Brooks also fenced part of the south side for pasture control, dug a new well and installed a new windmill and piping, and asked for permission to build a new dock. The expenses mounted up, and by 1928, the operation was no longer profitable.<br /> <br /> In 1929 Brooks needed long-term help on the island so he called on a friend he had made in the Army and convalesced with at Walter Reed Hospital, Herbert Steever Lester. Lester, an educated and traveled man, suffered from shell shock following the war. Although he was in most ways recovered, he wanted relief from the incessant demands of civilization, and he found ranching on San Miguel completely satisfying.<br /> <br /> <b>The Lester Years on San Miguel Island, 1929-1942</b><br /> Herbert Lester moved to the island in 1929 and in 1930 Lester brought his bride Elizabeth, a librarian from New York, to the island and their legendary lifestyle persisted until his death in 1942. Lester was commissioned as a deputy sheriff and dubbed himself King of San Miguel, occasionally wearing makeshift insignias to carry out the role. Mrs. Lester recorded these years in a book, The Legendary King of San Miguel. Her writing provided a vivid picture of isolation on the island with their two children, made livable through attention to things civilized: building and repair; food preparation for themselves, guests and the shearers; educating the girls; and entertaining the famous and the plain people who came because it was San Miguel Island and because the Lesters themselves attracted them.<br /> <br /> Herbert and the new Mrs. Lester arrived on the island in late March 1930, aboard Vail & Vickers (owners of Santa Rosa Island) cattle boat Vaquero that deposited the newlyweds and their things (including her library of 500 books) on the beach. Mrs. Lester soon met the island's Indian sheepherders, Clemente Watchina and Buster, who brought the belongings up to the ranch on a sled while the couple walked. Finding the ranch house outfitted for men (its decorations mainly consisted of arrowheads, fossils and guns), she noted its lack of hot water and determined to make it into a comfortable home. Her addition of books, curtains, pictures helped, and Lester built a fireplace (using bricks from the old ranch house) and installed hot water heaters. The Lesters named it Rancho Rambouillet after the sheep on the island and a favorite place of Herbert's in France.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Lester described the house as a \"wooden caterpillar,\" part of a \"stockade\" closed in by a high fence and a row of utilitarian buildings: a harness room; a blacksmith shop; and an empty structure that Lester eventually remodeled into his famous \"Killer Whale Bar\" in which he entertained visitors and workers alike. Rain barrels provided part of the water supply. Fleas were rampant. She wrote: \"On my first day as an island housewife, I lost no time in getting acquainted with the eccentricities of this historical and fascinating lodge from the notorious trap-door which led from the master bedroom into the gloomy attic which ran the entire length of the house-a matter of one hundred and twenty feet-to the porthole windows-windows which could bear the brunt of the winds. Then the romantic and sheltered cloistered corridor-\"monks walk\" as John Russell called it, which extended the length of the house on the outside and to which all rooms opened. The front door, which no one ever seemed to use, was a revolving door-one which could survive banks of sand suddenly gusting against it. The quaint dutch door leading from our bedroom, sheltered by a garden, was a romantic thought inspired by a woman, I am sure; a woman who tired of bracing herself every time she opened a window to freshen the air on the opposite side of the house.\"<br /> <br /> The garden consisted of a \"straggling arrangement of hardy vines and two fig trees . . . a small sheltered square of wind-free rustic pursuit with some rough, hand-wrought benches and chairs for its furnishings.\" An attempt at vegetable gardening ended with island birds wreaking havoc. But Mrs. Lester reveled in the island with its \"meadows of waist-high grass\" and beautiful wildflowers.<br /> <br /> Shearing time twice a year brought colorful crews of sheep shearers from the mainland. San Miguel Island was the last stop for the itinerant shearers, who slept and ate in the ranch house and worked hard during their stay. The shearers continued to be issued a ficha for every sheep, although by the Lester era a sheep brought ten cents and a ram twenty-five. Lester partook in the shearing activities, castrating lambs, weighing wool and sewing closed the huge sacks, and cleaning up after all had left. The sheep were put on a small barge from the impromptu pier and shuttled to the Vail & Vickers cattle boat Vaquero for shipment to the mainland.<br /> <br /> One seasonal employee, Arno Ducazau, decided to stay and remained with the Lesters until the family left the island: \"His days for arduous labor were over, but he chose remote San Miguel and us to a mainland existence for his declining years. This quiet but mirthful old man became my right hand and revered friend in more than one crisis. After our two children came, he was their warden and companion, along with his other responsibilities-all volunteered.\"<br /> <br /> Mrs. Lester traveled to the mainland to give birth to two girls: Marianne Miguel Lester and Elizabeth Edith Lester. She returned after each birth and raised the two on the island. When Marianne reached school age, Mrs. Lester arranged with a teacher friend and the Santa Barbara County schools to teach them on the island, in a tiny schoolhouse made from a playhouse the Vails of Santa Rosa Island had given them. The girls took regular lessons and excelled at their studies. The family exchanged learning opportunities with schools on the mainland, whose pupils would learn about the island and life there and help the girls with their studies about the mainland.<br /> <br /> Herbert Lester held a passionate interest in the island's natural and cultural history and made researchers welcome on the island, sharing their knowledge and enthusiasm. Dr. Ralph Hoffman of the Santa Barbara Museum came to the island to study its botany, only to lose his life falling from a cliff east of Cuyler Harbor. Lester erected a wooden cross in Hoffman's honor at what is now referred to as Hoffman Point. Lester happily toured visitors about and made people feel welcome; his wife called him a \"one-man Chamber of Commerce.\"<br /> <br /> In 1932 Charles M. Potter landed an airplane in the sheep corral, the first to do so. He told his friend, George Fisk Hammond, about the island and its colorful occupants. Hammond, a young man who loved to fly and could afford the luxury, made more trips to San Miguel than any of the other visitors. He made his first landing in the sheep corral near the ranch house on July 22, 1934. Taking off from his family estate, Bonnymede, along the beach south of Santa Barbara, he could reach the island in less than half an hour.<br /> <br /> On Hammond's first visit Lester, who he described as \"an astonishingly likable man,\" greeted him. He shortly began to make regular trips to San Miguel taking groceries, supplies, mail in a special mail pouch and just plain treats the Lesters had been doing without. New friends Hammond and \"Herbie\" developed a 918-foot landing field east of the ranch complex where they laid out boundary markers, a wind sock and a sign; when the U. S. Coast & Geodetic Survey team came over on December 9, they added it to the official map. Hammond Field appeared on Aeronautical charts until 1965 when its disuse and poor condition prompted the Navy to have it removed from the charts. Lester kept a danger flag ready to fly on the ranch flagstaff if landing conditions were poor. An alternate landing field was found on a 1,500-foot-long dry lake near the west end but it was only available during dry months. Hammond claimed to have landed on many field sites on the island, and once landed on the beach. Between 1934 and the end of 1941, Hammond estimated that he had flown to the island more than 200 times, sometimes more than twice a week.<br /> <br /> Despite the luxury of having an impromptu personal pilot, the Lesters still had to be largely self-sufficient. They scoured the beaches for building materials and made do with few extravagances. A two-way radio provided contact with the mainland, over which the Lesters sent official weather reports to Santa Barbara and Los Angeles for the Weather Bureau. The Lesters entertained hundreds of people in the house as their fame grew. Lester kept a guest book in which every visitor signed and left a comment. The family, especially the girls, received letters and gifts from all over the country, and when visiting the mainland would often have news reporters following them.<br /> <br /> The national press made much of the Lester years, and stories of San Miguel Island were often printed on the front page. Life magazine called them a \"Swiss Family Robinson.\" On June 23, 1937, the Santa Barbara News-Press carried an article headlined, \"Man's Life Saved by Island King.\" Los Angeles papers followed along with the headline, \"Millionaire's Life Saved by Crude Surgery on Island.\" Robert Brooks had gone to the Island for the annual shearing, and two weeks prior to the news story had been tearing out the landing from which the lambs were loaded for market, preparatory to erecting a new one for the year's shipment. He stood on a slippery rock as he worked, lost his footing, and fell. A rusted bolt extending from one of the piles caught his thigh and tore into his flesh. The wound had to be sterilized and closed or Brooks could have bled to death. Lester had no medical training, but he had army experience and knew the thread he would use had to be strong. Using a curved needle and fish line cleansed in boiling water and Lysol, he stitched the wound closed. There was no anesthetic to ease Brooks' pain, so he simply bore it. Then came the problem of getting Brooks off the island, and since there was no radio, they hoisted the flag upside down to attract a passing ship. None saw the signal. The Vaquero approached two weeks later, four days ahead of its regular schedule. Thanks to Lester's medical care, no infection developed, and when Brooks finally visited a mainland doctor, there was little additional treatment needed. In fact, Brooks told his family that the doctor refused to take any pay as Lester had completed all the treatment necessary.<br /> <br /> While the Lesters were in residence on the island, President Franklin D. Roosevelt transferred the control and jurisdiction of San Miguel Island and Prince Island to the Secretary of the Navy for naval purposes on November 7, 1934. The following year Robert Brooks signed a lease with the Navy at $600 a year. The Navy, under pressure for the overgrazing on the island, placed a limit on the number of sheep to be grazed: in 1938, it was 1,200, but it was later reduced to 1,000.<br /> <br /> The events surrounding the United States' entry into World War II brought the Lester reign on San Miguel Island to an end, and in a tragic way. Shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Hammond's flights were outlawed, shortages of supplies loomed, and on January 10 the Navy assigned three young enlisted men to act as coastal lookouts. Having no facilities of their own, the men were, in Lester's words, \"dumped in our home.\" The bored young men became a burden on the Lesters, showing no interest in the unique island life and causing small amounts of trouble to the family. Lester became more frustrated with the situation, and one day accidentally chopped off two fingers while cutting wood in anger. Treatments for the wound caused worrisome side effects and Lester became depressed.<br /> <br /> On June 18, 1942, a day when the Vaquero would bring Robert Brooks to the island with supplies and mail, Lester wrote a note and left the ranch house. After failing to return Brooks and others searched the island for him. Mrs. Lester found the note, which told her of his intention to commit suicide and where to find his body.<br /> <br /> The family's twelve enjoyable and fulfilling years on San Miguel Island came to an abrupt close. The two girls were taken off the island that day, and Herbert Lester was buried in his favorite island spot according to his wishes. A newspaper reporter wrote, \"What led him to end his life is as mysterious as the force that impelled him to go to the island originally.\"<br /> Mrs. Lester remained for two weeks packing up their belongings and saying goodbye to her once-happy home. On July 4, 1942, a Coast Guard boat took her to the mainland where she found a job and a house. She did not visit the island again, but her daughter Betsy has made a habit of visiting and sharing her memories of growing up on the island; Betsy, along with Marianne's grown daughters Jennifer and Barbara Stafford, brought her mother's ashes to the island to lay them next to Herbert Lester in 1981. Mrs. Lester closed her book with this thought about Herbert: \"He created a life and a world for himself, and for us on San Miguel. It is all buried, as he is buried, out there, but not alone. Now that I am an old woman, I am glad I had the privilege of sharing it all-for in his imagination we dwelt on our island paradise, the King, the Queen and the two little Princesses. We are still there in spirit, for those who seek us-those who have the skill to dream of what it must have been.\"<br /> <br /> <b>The End of Island Ranching</b><br /> In 1948 the Navy revoked its lease and ordered Brooks to remove his sheep and other property off the island so that guided missile and bomb targets could be placed on San Miguel. Brooks had 72 hours to accomplish this. He hauled in camping supplies by plane and set up camp for a party of men who covered the island by foot or by horseback looking for sheep in the rugged barrancas. The men drove the sheep down to the Cuyler Harbor dock and into the barge. Some furniture was moved out of the ranch house, but the time was too short. Brooks had to leave over 500 sheep and four horses behind.<br /> <br /> In June 1950, he got permission to return and remove his stock. The Los Angeles Times joked that \"mutton and munitions don't mix,\" as their reporter described how four men and four horses were working against a deadline to herd \"the unshorn critters through the rugged barrancas of the mist-muddied terrain into corrals and onto barges headed for the mainland.\" Their first task involved herding the four now-wild horses to participate in the roundup; this took three days. The four herded about 100 sheep at a time, the animals moving slowly because of their heavy coats of wool. Every other day they had enough sheep collected to ship them off by barge, destined for Stearns Wharf at Santa Barbara and markets at Oxnard. But again in the time allotted, every sheep could not be rounded up and the renegades would graze the island unattended for another eighteen years.<br /> <br /> The 1960s finally brought an end to sheep grazing on San Miguel Island. Grazing had been much restricted since 1948 when Brooks removed most of his flock, but the restrictions were too late. Once the sheep had removed the protective ground cover, San Miguel suffered severe wind and water erosion. The verdure, trees, and brush hinted at by Cabrillo's log on the islands were gone, but by 1967 some recovery had taken place, a result of the 1948 and 1950 sheep removals.<br /> <br /> However, a breeding nucleus remained. In June 1966 the Director of the National Park Service sent the Navy Department \"A Suggested Plan for the Management and Protection of Values of San Miguel Island.\" The report stated that the most pressing need was total elimination of the sheep. The Navy responded with an all out effort from July 17-20 to do away with all of the sheep. Research Biologist James K. Baker of Joshua Tree National Monument flew over the island with a ranger and Navy personnel who hunted down the sheep. By the last day 148 sheep had been sighted through aerial search at near ground level up and down canyons and by criss-crossing the Island from one end to the other. All were disposed of bringing to an end 117 years or more of continuous sheep grazing on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> In November of 1967, the Lester ranch house burned. Reportedly a Navy aircraft dropped a flare to warn off unauthorized visitors during hazardous naval operations and inadvertently set off the fire. Island ranger Reed McCluskey reported on a conversation with Robert Fromfield and a Mr. Moore in 1983 where the men claimed that they had been regularly trespassing in their planes during the 1960s and 1970s (eventually being convicted for trespass). According to the men, they had landed on the island only to be ordered to leave by a Navy plane that dropped a wooden box, which hissed and emitted smoke. The flare started a fire, which the men on the ground put out. They moved to another part of the island, near the ranch house, where the Navy dropped another warning flare. This also started a fire that the trespassers were unable to extinguish. They fled in their plane as the ranch house, barns and grassland burned.<br /> <br /> While the sheep ranching industries on San Miguel Island held no local or state economic significance, its legacy was in the lives of the families that pursued them under great hardship. While little detail is known of Nidever's activities on the island, the fact that he chose such an endeavor while enjoying the life of a prominent pioneer in the comfort of Santa Barbara is of interest. The Waters era on the island makes for some good stories, and yet its significance is not great; Waters and his companions were typical of settlers throughout the west, yet with an island-bound twist that cannot be duplicated elsewhere. Herbert Lester personified the rugged individualism made so popular in the pages of Life magazine, and contributed to the culture of the west in his exploits, which could be called heroic in that he chose to bring a family into the harsh realities, and so the dangers, of survival on a weather-beaten and most isolated island. While few physical resources remain from the ranching period, the life stories of the occupants provide historic significance to San Miguel Island.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Island Plant Adaptations Guide Stop 6</b><br /> <br /> Wind is an ever-present factor in the climate of San Miguel Island, and coastal goldenbush has adapted to this windy environment in several ways. The plant's low-growing form offers minimal wind resistance, while its deep roots and tough woody stems help it remain firmly anchored in the soil. Thick, leathery leaves help to prevent desiccation. Wind also plays a role in the natural spread of coastal goldenbush. The seeds of this plant have many hair-like bristles that act like tiny wings to aid in wide dispersal.<br /> <br /> Another wind-adapted plant is the San Miguel Island sagebrush. This plant's low-trailing branches and needle-like foliage reduce the physical damage and moisture loss that accompanies windy conditions.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The .5-mile, round trip hike provides views of the last permanent lighthouse built on the West Coast. The light was turned on in 1932, and remains on to this day, to warn vessels of Anacapa's rocky shores.<br /> <br /> At 11:00 pm on December 2, 1853, a frightening jolt woke the passengers aboard the side-wheel steamer Winfield Scott. Rushing on deck, they discovered that the ship had run aground in dense fog. Water poured into the ship's hold through two gaping holes in its wooden hull. Boarding the lifeboats, the passengers rowed to safety on Middle Anacapa Island, but the Winfield Scott was lost. Its remains lie submerged off the island's north shore.<br /> <br /> Despite the wrecking of the Winfield Scott and other ships off Anacapa's coast, a light was not placed on the island until 1912. Because of Anacapa's isolation, and the difficulties of building and supplying such a remote station, the first light was an unmanned, acetylene beacon placed atop a fifty-foot-tall metal tower.<br /> <br /> Responding to requests for better navigation aids along the Santa Barbara Channel, the Bureau of Lighthouses replaced the beacon with a lighthouse containing a 3rd-order Fresnel lens in 1932. The lens is now on display in the Anacapa Island Visitor Center.<br /> <br /> Buildings to support the lighthouse were constructed in the Spanish Revival style, characterized by tile roofs, stucco walls, and arched openings. The light station resembled a small town, with four residences flanking a main street that led to the powerhouse, oil house, general services building, fog signal building, lighthouse, water tank building, and other support structures. A series of ninety steps with two landings and a crane were built to transport people and gear from the landing cove to the top of the steep cliff.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Lighthouse Timeline</strong></p> <p>- On December 2, 1853, the side-wheel steamer <em>Winfield Scott</em> collided with Middle Anacapa Island. The wreck's notoriety led President Franklin Pierce to sign an executive order the following year, reserving Anacapa for lighthouse purposes.<br /> <br /> - The island's rugged terrain made the cost too high for immediate construction. Charles Hillinger, in the The California Islands, wrote that when members of the U. S. Coast Survey team visited Anacapa in 1854 they reported that it was an ideal but impossible site for a light station. Quoting a report, Hillinger wrote, \"It is inconceivable for a lighthouse to be constructed on this mass of volcanic rock-perpendicular on every face, with an ascent inaccessible by any natural means . . . .\"<br /> <br /> - In 1874, Congress funded a less expensive mainland station at Port Hueneme.<br /> <br /> - At the turn of the century, increased shipping traffic heightens the need for an Anacapa light. In 1911, Congress funded an automatic acetylene beacon mounted on a 50 foot metal tower at the eastern edge of Anacapa. In clear weather, the light could be seen from 20 miles in the distance. A whistling buoy was also anchored 5/8 of a mile offshore.<br /> <br /> - An estimated nine-tenths of all vessels trading up and down the Pacific Coast passed through the Santa Barbara Channel by 1920. Members of the American Association of Masters, Mates and Pilots demanded a fog signal as well as a light. A permanent lighthouse, however, required authorization by Congress. When the tank steamer <strong>Liebre</strong> grounded on the east end of Anacapa Island on February 28, 1921, directly under the light tower, local inspectors blamed the inadequate station and the capsized whistling buoy.<br /> <br /> - In 1928, the Bureau of Lighthouses allocated funds for an Anacapa lighthouse, the last major light station on the west coast. The Bureau of Lighthouses Annual Report for 1929 gave an estimated total for the entire project of $186,000.00. It included station residences, service buildings, hoisting derricks, a fog signal, radiobeacon, and miscellaneous improvements for the water supply, sanitation, and grounds improvement.<br /> <br /> - Construction was carried out in two phases--landing facilities and roads, followed by the tower and support buildings. The engineering fete was completed in 1933 at a cost of $110,490. The new station provided beacon and foghorn service plus weather and radio monitoring.<br /> <br /> - The new lighthouse's keeper, Frederick Cobb, lit the first light on March 25, 1932. Located on the highest point of East Anacapa Island, the Anacapa Island Lighthouse became an indispensable resource to shipping and passenger boats. At the top of the 39-foot concrete cylindrical tower flashed a third-order Fresnel lens, one of the most advanced lighthouse beacons in the world.<br /> <br /> - From 1931 through the 1960s, the light station housed a crew of between 15 and 25 people who maintained the lens, fog signal and tower, hourly weather and radar monitoring and reports, and a radio tower.<br /> <br /> - In 1938, Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands were established as Channel Islands National Monument.<br /> <br /> - In 1939, the U.S.Coast Guard replaced the Lighthouse Service.<br /> <br /> - The Anacapa light is blacked out during World War II, when the facilities were used as a coastal lookout station by the U.S. Navy.<br /> <br /> - In 1961 the U.S. Coast Guard modernized the light station by replacing the fog signal system and installing electrical appliances. The following year, however, a new plan was outlined to automate the Anacapa Island Light Station and to establish a rescue facility at Point Hueneme Light Station.<br /> <br /> - U.S. Coast Guard tender crews were phased out in the early 1960's. By 1967, Anacapa's light is fully automated and was able to be operated from the mainland.<br /> <br /> - In 1966, orders were approved to demolish three of the dwellings, the engine equipment building, shops, water tank house in one phase. Phase two removal included: the hoist house on the lower landing, the lower derrick and hoist equipment, burning the general services building, converting the power building to emergency quarters for servicing personnel, and burning the remaining quarters building. In May 1967, three of the houses were demolished.<br /> <br /> - In 1970, the U.S. Coast Guard and National Park Service signed a cooperative agreement. The lighthouse and fog horn continued under U.S. Coast Guard jurisdiction. The other facilities were to be maintained by the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> - With the addition of Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands, Channel Islands National Park was established in 1980.<br /> <br /> - The light and fog horn were converted to solar power in 1989. An acrylic lens (airport beacon) replaced the original Fresnel lens, which was carefully relocated to the Anacapa Visitor Center. These modern lenses are small versions of Augustin Fresnel's invention, using the same technology employed by the nineteenth-century physicist.<br /> <br /> - The Anacapa Island Light Station was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Twelve buildings and structures listed as contributing resources in the nomination form were: lighthouse tower; fog signal building; assistant keeper's residence; general services building; tank house; derrick building; oil house; power house; lower landing; upper derrick landing; landing stairway; and concrete watershed (rainshed).<br /> <br /> - In 1993, a conservation project restored the Fresnel lens to its original lustre. Guided by the NPS Archaeological Preservation Office, the lens was disassembled, polished to remove corrosion, lacquered, waxed and reassembled by park personnel.<br /> <br /> - In 1995, the lighthouse was restored by the U.S. Coast Guard.<br /> <br /> - Today, while the park manages the island, the U.S. Coast Guard continues to operate the lighthouse and fog signal building as an active aid to. For safety reasons, visitors to Anacapa Island are not permitted to tour the lighthouse.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Fresnel Lens</strong></p> <p>Constructed in 1932, the Anacapa Island Light Station featured a third-order Fresnel lens, the most advanced example of lens technology at the time.<br /> <br /> In 1822 the Frenchman Augustin Fresnel (fray-nel) improved the dioptric, or refractive, lens used in many lighthouse beacons. Resembling a giant beehive surrounding a single lamp, the glass prisms at the top and bottom refracted the light, sending it out in a narrow sheet. The dioptric section is a round bull's-eye panel that produces the bright flash of the light. The light appeared brighter and more concentrated, giving it a much more effective and farther range. In the United States Fresnel lenses were made in seven sizes, or orders, the first-order being the largest.<br /> <br /> In 1932 a rotating, catadioptric, third-order Fresnel lens with a 1000-watt incandescent bulb assembly was installed in the Anacapa Lighthouse. Manufactured between 1900 and 1903 by the Chance Brothers Company in England, it was transported to the United States and stored with other lenses to be used in west coast lighthouses. As each lighthouse was built, a lens was taken out of storage and installed in the lighthouse tower. Powered by diesel generator, its 600,000 candlepower had a visibility of 24 miles!<br /> <br /> Until the 1960s the light station required a crew of 15 to 25 people to care for the lens and tower. The lighthouse was automated to run for several months at a time in the 1960s. An automatic lamp changer halved the number of times a tender would have to change a burned-out bulb. The brass structure of the lens was painted black because it was no longer regularly polished.<br /> <br /> In 1989, the U.S. Coast Guard replaced the original Fresnel lens with a plastic, solar-powered unit now used in the lighthouse. These modern lenses are small versions of Augustin Fresnel's invention, using the same technology employed by the nineteenth-century physicist.<br /> <br /> You can see the original Fresnel lens on display at the Anacapa Island visitor center. In 1993, a conservation project restored the Fresnel lens to its original lustre. Guided by the NPS Archaeological Preservation Office, the lens was disassembled, polished to remove corrosion, lacquered, waxed and reassembled by park personnel.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Fog Signal</strong></p> <p>The original diaphone fog signal once stood on the roof of this one-story building, but now the automated electronic device is less conspicuous.<br /> <br /> Funds had been allotted for fog signal diaphones and their installation in late 1931. Power would be generated on the island. Technicians set the two-tone diaphone to blast for three seconds on a 30 second cycle. The resonators of the diaphone were depressed slightly in order to counteract the usual upward bending of the sonic beam.<br /> <br /> The S. S. Golden Sun of the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company reported in 1933 that this was one of the best fog signals it had ever experienced. On the negative side, however, the S. S. Lightburne reported that the \"Anacapan [sic] fog signal is 3 second blast and 27 second silent and Pt. Hueneme fog signal is 4 second blast and 26 seconds silent period, consequently naturally having expected to make Anacapa we thought had done so and hauled ship NE'ly. to pass light to Starboard hand. About this time fog lifted slightly and we seen that fog signal was on Pt. Hueneme and proceeded on our voyage accordingly. Comment in question is that since the blast and silent per periods of the Lights mentioned have a difference of only one second it is confusing in identifying either in a fog.\"<br /> <br /> At this, the Port Hueneme characteristic was changed.</p>",

With the help of Navy experts, the house and its contents were burned, leaving only the outhouse, which was stabilized, repaired, placed on a new foundation, and reroofed by NPS in 2003.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> </strong></p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing between a row of eucalyptus trees and a wooden fence that runs the length of ranch corral area. Tucked between the trees is a small outhouse with wood plank siding. The wood is the color of faded wood, but some red stain can be seen in the cracks between the siding planks. The outhouse is a tall structure, is about four feet wide, four feet deep, and 7 and one half feet tall in front, sloping down to about 6 feet high in the back. The slanted roof is covered with corrugated metal. The front of the building has a framed doorway. The door is gone but rusted metal hinges remain on the frame. A rusted, postcard sized, metal panel with rounded corners, about, is nailed to the wall at the upper left of the doorframe. On the sides of the outhouse, at about five and one half feet high, are small framed openings, lined with torn screen.<br /><br />Inside the outhouse, along the back wall is a build in bench about three feet high. At the center of the bench is a plate-size opening. Below it is a deep hole. A wooden cover for the opening is mounted behind it, tilted up to lean against the back wall. In the right corner is a pipe, about 5 inches in diameter, that runs up through the bench into a hole in the ceiling. <br /><br />Outside the outhouse, the gnarled trunks and branches of the surrounding eucalyptus trees are all bent to an extreme angle, which makes them appear to be growing almost horizontally. The foliage at the ends of the branches looks like a thick bushy broom. The leaves are narrow, sickle-shaped, and dark shiny green.<br />",

Some of the interesting landforms seen in the canyon are a result of a hard crust forming at the surface of the outcrop, probably from calcite deposited by groundwater or surface water.

A block slide is one in which the slide body remains relatively intact. This slide has moved about 100 feet in a northeast direction. The leading edge of the slide is found in Lobo Canyon about 1,000 feet downstream from the road, where it supports a dense growth of oaks and toyons and a year-round spring.The slide also dammed Lobo Canyon as evidenced by ponded sediment upstream from the slide at the trail head.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a dirt road in a canyon, surrounded by rocky hills that are covered grasses that are often brown, with patches of grey-green scrub brush and coreopsis with thick branches topped with tufts of feathery green leaves and yellow, daisy-like flowers in springtime, and a shaggy, brittle, brown mop of dead leaves in the drier seasons. <br /><br />Near the start of the trail, small trees are clustered along the bottom of the canyon. A wooden sign on a wooden post reads,<br /><br />Lobo Canyon Trail<br /><br />Nearby, under some coast live oaks, with small oval grey-green leaves, are two picnic tables. As you start down the road, it narrows a thin trail, and the view dramatically changes. The canyon grows steeper and narrower, and greener and lusher along the canyon bottom. The trail passes under many oak trees, draped with lace lichen, which looks like long, thin, gray, lacy shawls of fabric, that drape down from the branches. Here, a variety of plants thrive, including toyon, with long green oval leaves and clusters of buds, flowers or red berries, depending on the season; willow, with a sweeping canopy of light green leaves that turn yellow in the fall; cattails, with tall thin green leaves, and brown cylindrical spikes shaped like broom handles; blackberries, with prickly green leaves; and horsetails, with tall hollow green stalks with ringed sections. As you descend along the trail, in many seasons, a stream will flow by your side, curving along just to the right of you. The shady oaks give way to shrubs and grassland bordered by magnificently carved sandstone cliffs. These steep tan-colored cliffs are made of horizontal layers of rock within a curving vertical face, as if a giant stack of pancakes, had been carved away with many spoons. Above the curved cliffs, the top layer of earth projects out, like a little lip. The hillsides above the cliffs have the same kinds of plants seen on the hills at the start of the trail, with the addition of coastal prickly pear, a broad cactus with grey and green pancake-shaped leaves covered with thorny spines and, in season, pear-shaped red fruit, also covered in spines. <br /><br />About half way down the trail, a side trail takes you to a cathedral-like side canyon, surrounded by the carved sandstone cliffs, with a bowl-shaped base, and many alcoves and caves to explore. As you go further down the trail, cool ocean breezes tell you when you're getting close to the beach. At the mouth of Lobo Canyon, the creek often forms a small lagoon just before the beach. <br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>The main ranch house, also known as the Upper House, or Vail & Vickers Ranch House, was most likely built after 1869 during the More era.<br /> <br /> The original form of the house was a two-story, gable-roofed rectangle with a one-story shed running the full length of the west side, forming an almost square floor plan. The roofs were clad with wood shingles. A brick chimney served a fireplace in the north bedroom on the second floor. At least two outbuildings stood adjacent to the house, a kitchen with a tall brick chimney, which was later absorbed into the mass of the house, and an outhouse. The Mores planted Monterey cypress trees as a windbreak to the north and east and planted two trees directly in front of the house, framing the porch.<br /> <br /> A writer in 1893 described the \"cozy ranch house, behind a group of high-shouldered Monterey cypress, squeezed out of shape by the wind. . . . Here the owner of the island lives while at home in his island kingdom.\" Another writer who visited the island in the 1890s described the \"hacienda or ranch house of the Mores standing near a grove of cypress trees distorted and beaten down by the strong trade winds. From here one can look out on a little village made up of the various buildings appertaining to the business of shearing sixty thousand sheep-one of the largest herds in Southern California . . . .\"<br /> <br /> When Vail & Vickers purchased a share of the island in 1901 the picturesque two-story ranch house became the family headquarters, with generations of both families lodging there during visits and work periods. The Vail family, possessing the active role in running the island ranch, had the most impact on the life of the old house, performing maintenance and making the most use of it.<br /> <br /> With the original floor plan, one entered the front door to a narrow hallway. Immediately on either side were doors into the two front bedrooms. At the end of the hall was a door into the living room, a long rectangular room across the back of the house with a woodstove in the northeast corner. The bathroom was equipped with a tub and a hot water tank.<br /> Water was heated in pipes that ran through the wall and through the woodstove in the living room and stored in the water tank in the bathroom.<br /> <br /> On the south side of the living room, there was a breezeway with a wood washbasin. The kitchen was a small, gable-roofed building attached to the south side of the ranch and had a woodstove with brick chimney. Upstairs in the house there were two bedrooms; the northern (larger) one was heated by a fireplace with a hung brick chimney.<br /> <br /> Beginning in 1950 the Vail family made a number of alterations to the ranch house. The most notable included changing the interior layout, expanding the kitchen, and adding a cabin on the south side.<br /> <br /> Additional maintenance by the NPS has included painting, reroofing, burying electrical services, replacing the front porch posts and flooring, foundation, and repairing and stabilizing the 1873 outhouse in the yard behind the house.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> </strong></p>",

Each has a bench near the door. These two buildings are connected by a white, wooden fence, about 6 feet tall and 6 feet wide.<br /><br />One of these smaller buildings butts up against the third, a larger two-story building. This building has an extension with a shed-style sloped roof, and another small extension, with a dormer roof, on the second floor. It has double French doors, leading to a small patio with a barbeque grill. All of the windows and the French doors have multiple glass panes separated by thin wooden mullions. <br /><br />Behind the houses are grassy rolling hills, with a few scrubby shrubs.<br /><br />",

    "audioDescription": "You are standing near the south end of the row of eucalyptus trees, in a grassy field. Here stands a rusty corrugated metal shed. This one story building has a corrugated metal shed-style roof, flat, with a slight angle downward on the back side. <br />The corrugated metal is a sheet of metal that is curved into rows of parallel ridges about 2 inches high and 4 inches apart, like ripples on water or rows in corduroy cloth. The front of the building faces south. It has four large sets of double doors, also covered with corrugated metal, that open outward. <br />The doors are attached to the door frames with three metal hinges. They latch together in the center with a simple, pivoting latch bar that drops down into a bracket. <br />The back and sides of the building have no windows or doors. A few large bushes have grown in front of some of the doors and on the ends of the building.<br />A pole with an orange windsock is mounted to the top of the east, or ocean, front corner of the shed. It is a narrow cone of light windproof material, about 4 feet long, with a metal ring circling the one-foot wide opening. It is mounted sideways, like a flag, and it pivots on the top of the post, so that the wide part is always facing into the wind, and the tail is always pointing in the direction the wind is blowing.<br />On the ground just outside the shed is a long metal device, like a plow or till, resting on top of two cement blocks. The longest metal beam is about 6 feet wide. Secured to it are three flat metal bars: one at each end and one at the center. Each bar extends over the beam and curls into a spring-shape-it loops twice and then curves down toward the ground. Bolted at the end of each rod, is a v-shaped piece of a metal, like a bird with its wings opened wide. At the center of the metal bar, on the opposite side of the bar, is a triangular metal bracket, about two feet wide on each side. The top sticks up into the air, ending with two metal bars that jut up side by side, each has a hole about an inch down from the top.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Middle Anacapa Island is set aside for wildlife and is not open to the public.<br /> <br /> <b>Sheep Ranching On Middle Anacapa Island</b><br /> Around 1885, E. E. Elliot had a sheep camp on Anacapa Island around as evidenced by photographs in the Santa Barbara Historical Society collection. Elliot constructed a number of buildings on the middle island that became known as \"The Houses\" and planted eucalyptus trees that remain. He eventually abandoned his operation due to problems with poaching by fishermen. Elliot apparently had no government lease.<br /> <br /> The earliest lease recorded in lighthouse files was that awarded to Louis le Mesagner by the Department of Treasury for $25 a year beginning April 1, 1902. Charles Holder, who visited the islands at about this time, called it a sheep ranch and reported that several hundred animals found sustenance there even in the summer. A herder volunteered that although there was no water, there was an abundance of fog. The moisture from this was soaked up by the sheep's coats and in the morning they licked each other to obtain water, a somewhat dubious story heard on other islands as well. In the spring, Indians and Mexicans were hired by the sheep owners to go to the island and shear the sheep.<br /> <br /> The Department of Commerce and Labor leased Anacapa Island to former island seal hunter and long-time Ventura resident Heaman Bayfield Webster on April 1, 1907, for $31 a year. The lease read \"All the Island of Anacapa . . . consisting of three islets . . . and known as the Anacapa Light Reservation . . . for grazing and farming only.\" He could place on it no permanent buildings, and the lease noted that previous sheepherders had left an old cistern. Webster's sheep herd increased to about 600 through breeding but depredations by fishermen, eagles and drought resulted in continuous losses.<br /> Webster established residence on the middle island with his wife Martha and two sons, Morris and Harvey. They built or reused five shacks to each of which they affixed a name: Camp Felicity, Camp Simplicity, Camp Capacity, Camp Intensity and Camp Necessity, the latter being an outhouse with a toilet flushed by sand. Camps Felicity and Simplicity had roofs, floors and furnishings while the others were less substantial. The location was apparently the one occupied by Elliot in the 1880s, marked by eucalyptus trees.<br /> <br /> Webster constructed a water storage tank, which he kept filled with water imported from the mainland in five-gallon cans. The family spent summers and two winters on the island tending the flock of sheep, and a caretaker stayed during the Websters' absences. The Websters welcomed vacationers who arrived in their own boats or on one of Bay Webster's charters. Early on the newspapers referred to him as the \"King of Anacapa Island.\" In the fall of 1911 Webster set up a school in a tent for his children, and hired a governess for them. \"He is pretty sure that he is the first man to ring a school bell on the island,\" wrote a reporter, \"which he calls a strip of rock six miles long and something over an inch wide.\"<br /> <br /> Webster obtained his income from tourism and wool sales. He sold no more than 50 sheep during the ten years on the island but concentrated on breeding and shearing. He herded the sheep from the west island towards the east where they were sheared, either hog-tying them for the inter-island trip in a boat or forcing them to swim the distance.<br /> <br /> Various lessees continued to ranch on the island after Webster. However, by the 1930s the sheep had destroyed most of the native plants useful to them and had begun to eat the endemic Astragalus miguelensis. From this many sheep died, taking the profit out of sheep herding and bringing to an end to sheep ranching when Anacapa became part of Channel Islands National Monument in 1938.</p>",

In the 1960s the military built a photo-tracking station that was used until the mid-1960s.<br /> <br /> More Information<br /> The bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 was followed by enemy attacks from submarines, anti-personnel bombs, and balloon attacks on the shores of the Pacific frontier. These caused the Navy to immediately establish a coastal lookout system with stations on each of the Channel Islands, including Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> The Navy completed construction of the Santa Barbara Island Coastal Lookout Station on August 12, 1942. It consisted of a wooden tower, antenna pole, a transmitter and roads; a small-gauge steel rail tramway with metal car ran from the dock to the quarters, operated by an electric-powered winch in a shed. Previously, on May 27, 1942, a state of emergency was declared throughout the Western Sea Frontier, and a special line of patrol boats was established well to seaward to guard against enemy attacks. Lookouts would, hopefully, spot enemy vessels or aircraft that sneaked through this barrier. All eight offshore islands had Coastal Lookout Stations in place and manned by this time.<br /> <br /> Santa Barbara Island also became one of the Pacific Coast Aircraft Warning Radar Stations in 1942 and was equipped with an L-35 type SCR-588 radar. The 588 was already in production when the war broke out; it operated in the 200-megahertz frequency region and provided for height-finding as well as range azimuth indication for ground control of interception at medium range.<br /> <br /> Cal Reynolds, interviewed in 1979, recalled his half-year stationed with coastal lookout personnel beginning in June of 1942. The Navy sent Reynolds and his fellow enlisted men from San Pedro; they reported by radio (island call number NCX 12) to headquarters in San Diego. An Army aircraft lookout group from Fort MacArthur joined them on the island. Duties included spotting submarines and reporting all passing vessels. Reynolds told of tearing down the Hyder's house in order to build two side-by-side barracks buildings, connected by an enclosed hallway. A kitchen with a cook provided food service for the enlisted men. A trail led from the barracks to the lookout tower on Signal Peak; both Army and Navy personnel shared the trail, barracks and tower for their respective duties.<br /> <br /> Reynolds described duty at the station as \"very hang loose . . . not a lot of regimentation, we stood our four on and eight off . . . it was a small island, there wasn't a lot to do on it.\" The men worked two weeks on the island and then received one week of leave. They kept chickens and rabbits in pens, fished and tended lobster pots: \"[we] always had hot buttered lobster.\" The men didn't keep a garden because of the lack of water. The Navy had constructed a water storage tank and pumped water up from the dock. A weekly boat brought supplies and transferred men on and off the island. \"It was a good life,\" Reynolds recalled, \"an enjoyable experience.\"<br /> <br /> After the Battle of Midway in June 1942, the perceived danger of enemy attack decreased on the West Coast and development of lookout stations ceased. The stations continued to be manned, however. Patrol boats serviced the stations and provided logistical support, such as relief of personnel, medical aid and delivery of supplies. No station activity beyond the routine disturbed life on the islands according to the messages sent to the Section Base in San Pedro. While some of the Coastal Lookout Stations extended their activities to include Army flash reports and transmitting vessel reports, Santa Barbara Island personnel reportedly only maintained the blackout capabilities of the lighthouses there.<br /> <br /> The Coastal Lookout System was abolished July 1, 1945 and on July 17, the Commandant of the 11th Naval District took thirteen lookout stations out of service, including Santa Barbara Island. Most of the structures at Santa Barbara Island were removed and the remaining buildings and equipment on Santa Barbara Island was transferred to the Coast Guard. Records show these to be:<br /> <br /> Landing: Posts for the frame landing were set on concrete bases sunk into the rock of the beach above which the landing was built. There were two levels, the first that was reached by a vertical ladder from a small boat. Large boats could not get close to the landing because of the shallow water and shore structure. The second level was connected to the lower landing by stairs. The upper landing had an open shed used for storing gear, a large I-beam with a trolley for hoisting heavy loads, and the lower section of a rail tramway.<br /> <br /> Tramhoist: A hoisting unit for the tram car was located at the top of the bluff at the upper station of the rail tramway. The prime mover was a Ford V-8 engine. The hoist was equipped with about 250 feet of 1/2\" steel wire rope. The free end of the rope was attached to the tram car.<br /> <br /> Tanks: There was one steel tank of 500 gallon capacity, 9' 9\" in diameter by 6 feet high, and one pine tank 12' 6\" in diameter by 10 feet high of 10,000 gallon capacity. The filler pipe, of galvanized iron and 1 1/2\" in diameter, ran about 500 feet from the landing to the tank.<br /> <br /> Buildings: Two barracks buildings 16' by 36' made of plywood with tongue and groove floors were supported on three sills 4' by 6\" each. The sills were set on 6' 6\" posts. The roof was composition roofing over sheathing. These two buildings were joined together by a short hall about 4 feet wide at the middle of the 36' sides. There was also a galvanized iron building 7' 3\" by 11', a small generator building 6' by 6' and an outside head. At the top of the island was the glassed observation tower with a small generator building and outside head.<br /> <br /> Garage: A 12' by 14' garage was constructed of old packing cases. It was used to house a piece of automotive equipment and a trailer.<br /> <br /> Other Equipment: There was a trailer with iron wheels. Electric power and telephone lines ran from the landing to the lookout tower. The electric light line ran from the lookout tower to the north light.<br /> <br /> The Coast Guard concluded after an inspection of the above that the portions of value to them were the landing with all its equipment, the rail tramway, including car and hoist, the garage building, and the iron wheeled jeep trailer. However, it recommended that all the buildings be left in their present locations for the time being and that a jeep be procured for the use of the light tenders and be kept in the garage.<br /> <br /> By 1948 the structures were \"relatively intact\" according to a park service report. By 1950 vandals had stolen the winch motor and the wooden water tank, and removal of plywood walls of the barracks resulted in their collapse. The landing platform was in good condition although the tramway was inoperable because of the loss of the motor.<br /> <br /> When a party of park personnel visited Santa Barbara Island in May of 1953, they found the former Navy structures in bad repair. The inclined railway was almost useless: the motor had been stolen and the winch shack demolished. What remained of the two Navy barracks was nearly obliterated since vandals had burned the structures. The Coast Guard shack was standing but the door had been blown off. The observation tower and shack on Signal Peak still stood.<br /> <br /> In the early 1960s the Naval Ordnance Test Station, China Lake, installed a photo tracking station on Santa Barbara Island to record the flight of test rockets. The Navy constructed two 48-foot by 20-foot Quonset huts and three cement camera pads, installed two water tanks with a pipeline to the shore, extended the existing railway, and enlarged the previous trails to road width. The new road extended from one side of the island to the other so that jeeps could travel between the camera pads and to the Quonset huts. When the Navy left the island it surplussed the camera pads, eight to ten generators, and the two large Quonset huts to the National Park Service.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "If you are standing at the flagpole, facing the Santa Barbara Island Visitor Center, you are on a high bluff, and the ocean is far below, on your left. You are in the middle of a coreopsis forest. Depending on the season, the coreopsis, with a thick, bare trunk, topped by a shaggy mop of yellow flowers and feathery green leaves, shaped like fluffy ostrich feathers. In late summer, fall or winter, the coreopsis will turn into waist-high brown stalks that look dead.<br /><br />The single-story beige building, has a roof made of overlapping curved red tiles. On the wall, facing you, are two wooden signs with white lettering. The one on the ocean side reads, \"Visitor Center.\" The one on the land side reads, \"Private Residence.\" Between the signs are two narrow vertical windows. Below the windows, running the length of the building are several dense shrubs. An open patio extends out on the ocean side of the building, but watch your step, as it is about ten inches above ground. Just off this patio is the door to the visitor center and a tall window with a view into the exhibit. The patio has a picnic table and an outdoor panel about sea bird habitat, described separately. Beyond this first patio is another, gated, patio, blocked by a brick wall. On the opposite side of building-the \"Private Residence\" side- is a walkway running the length of the building. <br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>Nearby the Lester ranch site lies the scant remain of the two-room Navy barracks building that was constructed as part of the Lookout Station on San Miguel during World War II.<br /> <br /> The United States' military forces saw potential defensive capabilities in San Miguel Island in the 1930s that led to its exclusive use as a U. S. Navy training zone. The island was used for a short time as a radio communications outpost during the 1930s, as a coastal lookout post during World War II, a bombing range and, most significantly, as a key training and testing area for the Navy's Pacific Missile Range, a key component in the nation's Cold War defense system. The military uses of San Miguel Island resulted in an unmeasured amount of resource damage, ranging from road building to the effects of bombing and target practice. Today, the Navy retains legal possession of the island and may in perpetuity.<br /> <br /> <strong>U. S. Marines Temporary Radio Outpost, 1933</strong><br /> Tensions in the Pacific led the U. S. Marines to establish a radio outpost on San Miguel Island in 1933. The post would mount a continuous watch for the enemy and maintain radio communications with the commander of the base force. Authorities assigned the San Miguel Island outpost to the battleship Tennessee in Los Angeles harbor. One of the men, Wallace M. Greene, recounted his experiences on the island in the Marine Corps Gazette more than 50 years later, on which this account is based.<br /> <br /> On February 6, 1933 eight Marines and two \"blue jackets\" (civilians) under command of a second lieutenant boarded the tug Algorma for the night trip to San Miguel Island. The men off loaded into a whale boat at Tyler's Bight and unloaded their gear on the beach: \"tents, heavy radio parts, food, bedding, firewood and 60 tons of fresh water had to be passed by hand up a 40-foot sand bank to the top of the bluff and from there packed up the hill to the camp,\" recalled Greene. They constructed a camp site \"on a well-drained grassy slope in the lee of a steep ridge about 300 yards from the beach,\" over a mile from the site of the radio station to be erected on the western point. After digging a latrine trench and a garbage hold, and setting up a field range composed of a three-foot-square boiler plate with a fire pit beneath, the men christened their new home on San Miguel Island, \"Camp Tyler.\"<br /> <br /> Having settled in, the men then packed the radio equipment to the site at Point Bennett. Consisting of a Navy field radio set including transmitting and receiving units, the radio station also required a gasoline motor, generator, hand generator, calibrator, antenna poles, spare parts, gasoline, oil, water, two tents and other equipment. It took ten hours to set up the station and contact the base ship some 100 miles away. The men christened the radio outpost \"Camp Hardpan\" in honor of the frustrating conditions encountered while driving stakes for the antenna and tents.<br /> <br /> The camp commander put two sentries on 24-hour watch, requiring five watches of one eight-hour and four four-hour stints. The radioman on watch listened to an assigned frequency for 15 minutes each hour. In off-hours the men explored the island and collected abalone.<br /> <br /> The men put up with blowing sand which covered their camp fires (one sandstorm lasted three days), and wind that threatened the tents which had been double-guyed and staked: \"their sides bulged like sails, but they held.\" Sand continually clogged the carburetor of the gasoline engine, which required cleaning \"at all times.\"<br /> <br /> The Marine outpost on San Miguel Island was short-lived. An emergency-reportedly an enemy aircraft carrier spotted in the Santa Barbara Channel, later considered to be a phantom or spurious sighting-caused a rapid abandonment of the camp on February 18, when the men were picked up by the Tennessee. Camp Hardpan existed for less than two weeks.<br /> <br /> <strong>Transfer to U. S. Navy Administration</strong><br /> President Roosevelt transferred the control and jurisdiction of San Miguel Island and Prince Island from the Secretary of Commerce to the Secretary of the Navy for naval purposes on November 7, 1934. The Order reserved for use by Commerce sites to be selected for aids to navigation and for incidental facilities.<br /> <br /> On January 5, 1939, Newton B. Drury, Director, National Park Service, Washington, requested a study of San Miguel. The resultant report summarized the overgrazing in these words: \". . . The present number of sheep (1,100) would undoubtedly represent a conservative stocking under normal conditions, nature now is forcing man to pay the penalty for gross malpractice committed many years ago. For this reason, 1,100 sheep now are destructive of the remnant of the island's resources, although originally such a number might have been pastured there indefinitely with little or no harm.\"<br /> <br /> As a result of the report, recommendations to transfer the island to the National Park Service and stop the grazing were submitted in 1939, but the Washington NPS office took no action until November 5, 1941. On December 7 the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. Action finally came in response to a request for information by NPS Regional Director John C. Merriam. The NPS Director in Washington stated that San Miguel was considered worthy of monument status but that the Navy declared it already protected, and that secondly any transfer in status at that time was extremely doubtful, in fact foolish, even to discuss. In January 1942, the NPS summarized the report recommendations of 1939 and sent them to the Navy Department. They included removal of all livestock, all cats, and a well thought out program of replanting; however, grazing continued for twenty-five more years.<br /> <br /> <strong>World War II Coastal Lookout Stations</strong><br /> The Coastal Lookout Stations, Offshore Patrol and Inshore Patrol, which made up the Local Defense Force, communicated through an operational battle circuit. Each Station was allotted one portable radio, a transmitter to be placed on a roof or tower, and one receiver. By December 30, 1941, the Inshore Patrol had twelve vessels and the Offshore Patrol three. Among the latter was the Hermes, which had long patrolled the islands and served as free transportation for island dwellers. During the war it was credited with sinking a submarine outside San Pedro Harbor.<br /> <br /> In January 1942, Coast Guard Inshore Patrol Boat 411 carried Commander H. O. Hill, Officer in Charge, Coastal Lookout Stations, on a tour of the Channel Islands to reconnoiter and to plan development of the Stations. Of the several islands he visited, San Nicolas and San Miguel gave the most trouble in landing their 17-foot surfboat. This experience convinced him that all provisioning would have to be done in summer months.<br /> <br /> At this time San Miguel had no pier and Hill envisioned that building equipment, provisions and men would be landed through the surf at Cuyler Harbor. Hill wrote that the \"island had a passable airplane landing field [Hammond Field] about 1800 long. It is well marked and has the standard wind sock.\" The field was smooth, he reported, and because of the forceful winds, airplanes of a fairly large size could land.<br /> <br /> Hill chose 830-foot San Miguel Peak, the highest point on the island, as the new site for the Lookout Station, which at the time of his visit was temporarily situated in the Ranch House. He recommended that a road be built from the Ranch House to the planned site and described it as a simple matter. Hill also wanted a road leading from Cuyler Harbor to the top of the mesa resurfaced as the Lester's sled road would not do to transport supplies and equipment of any great weight. A request for permanent structures at the Lookout Stations was turned down in February 1942, so locally manufactured prefabricated buildings were used throughout the war. San Miguel received a two-room barracks building with glass windows, which was set up near the Ranch House on the east side. Photos showed a shack beside the observation tower.<br /> <br /> When Hill visited San Miguel, the Lesters were billeting Navy men at the Ranch House. They climbed to the roof to stand their watches and had a 25-watt radio transmitter and a receiver. Hill mentioned that it was possible to reach the planned new site by automobile even without the road. He had perhaps ridden in the Lester's old Ford given to them by a newspaper publisher. Hill was impressed with Lester, a man he described as \"distinctly of a high type of intelligence.\"<br /> <br /> Eventually the Navy bulldozed a road from the ranch to the wooden lookout tower and on to Point Bennett; service men called it the Road to Mandalay. Telephone lines completed the basic improvements of the San Miguel Lookout Station.<br /> <br /> On May 27, 1942, a state of emergency was declared throughout the Western Sea Frontier, and a special line of patrol boats was established well to seaward to guard against surprise attacks. By this time, lookouts were located at nine island stations: Anacapa Island; Santa Barbara Island; Pyramid Head, San Clemente Island; Wilson Cove, San Clemente Island; San Miguel Island; San Nicolas Island; Santa Catalina Island; Santa Cruz Island; and Santa Rosa Island.<br /> <br /> Anacapa's radio telegraph call sign was NSK1, San Miguel's NPK4. San Miguel by then had a 100-watt transmitter. All lookout stations were supplied with sidearms and/or rifles and binoculars, and their personnel were trained for night lookout and for recognition. San Miguel and the other islands had no gun emplacements, a fact noted by a map in the Fort MacArthur Library published by their Engineer's Office. It showed batteries and searchlights up and down the coast, but the Channel Islands were not even drawn on the map. After the Battle of Midway in June of 1942, military leaders were convinced that the west coast was out of danger. This thinking is reflected in the lookout stations: development up to that date but none after.<br /> <br /> Patrol boat reports throughout the war recorded the logistical support they provided for the stations: relief of personnel, medical aid, and deliveries of supplies. No station activity beyond the routine disturbed life on the islands according to the messages sent to the Section Base in San Pedro. While some of the Coastal Lookout Stations extended their activities to Army flash reports and San Clemente transmitted vessel reports, neither Anacapa, San Miguel, nor Santa Barbara Islands were assigned these duties.<br /> <br /> The Navy abolished the Coastal Lookout System on July 1, 1945. Then on July 17, the Commandant of the 11th Naval District at San Diego took thirteen lookout stations out of service. These stations included seven island stations, among them San Miguel, Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands. The order asked for deletion of radio call signs and transfer of radio equipment to San Diego. San Miguel, however, received a new call sign for official weather reporting. Coast Guard Cutters including the Hermes, which had so long served the islands, resumed regular peacetime activities. Most of the poles and wire of the communication line installation at San Miguel were removed from the island, but the tower and temporary buildings near the ranch house remained on the island after the war.<br /> <br /> <strong>B-24 Crash, 1943</strong><br /> A military aircraft accident brought tragedy to San Miguel Island during World War II. On July 5, 1943, a B-24 bomber crashed on the north side of Green Mountain, killing all 12 men aboard. The \"Liberator\" was part of a fleet of new bombers that eventually numbered 18,000. The air armed forces used dozens of Liberators for training, using mostly young and inexperienced crews, which led to numerous crashes. \"It had a long, thin, high lift wing which made it suitable for long distance bombing missions . . . generally it was not regarded as the safest aircraft in the sky,\" wrote crash historian R. W. Koch. \"Yet, it played a major role in helping to win the war in Europe and Asia.\" The 56,000-pound planes were equipped with four 1,200 horsepower engines, had a maximum speed of 303 mph and a range of 3,200 miles. The B-24-E Liberator in question was built by the Ford Motor Company in Michigan and was new; its personnel was assigned to the 2nd Air Force, 34th Bomb Group, 7th Bomb Squadron at Salinas Army Air Base in Salinas.<br /> <br /> The plane, with a crew of 12 aboard, had been searching for ten crew members of another B-24 that had crashed near Santa Barbara the day before after the crew had bailed out somewhere near the coast. The search plane left Bakersfield towards Santa Barbara, and was to continue to Point Conception and Salinas, but disappeared after reporting over Santa Barbara at 8:00 a.m. Evidently, the B-24 flew too low in foggy conditions while approaching Point Conception; the ceiling that day was 300 to 500 feet and the plane had no radar. The bomber struck the side of 831-foot Green Mountain and practically disintegrated, killing all aboard and spreading wreckage over an area of up to ten acres. Although the crash site was only a short distance from the Coastal Lookout Station, it was at least two miles from the barracks and no one heard the impact and no one saw the wreckage.<br /> <br /> Robert Brooks came on the wreckage some time later when he was gathering sheep near Green Mountain, although government records state that sailors based at the island's radio/weather station found it on March 19, 1944. Whatever the date, the late discovery reflected on the diligence and state of readiness at this lookout station at the time of the crash. Stan Sokolis and Robert McKee, stationed on the island radio unit, reportedly assisted in the task of removing the bodies and salvaging important plane parts, although much of the scattered wreck was left on the site.<br /> <br /> In 1954 some hikers found the wreckage and human bones. Authorities were notified who could not find a record of the wreck; they dispatched an investigation team on a Coast Guard cutter in the night. Unfortunately, the cutter collided in the darkness with the yacht Aloha off Point Mugu, killing two aboard. After rescuing three survivors the cutter returned to Los Angeles, then again commenced its mission to San Miguel Island. There they found the wreckage but soon received a radio message stating that records of the wreck had been located and that the investigation was off.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Post World War II: Bombing Range Established</strong><br /> Pacific Coast facilities and personnel took a major role in national defense efforts during World War II (1941-1945). The military used the Channel Islands and adjacent mainland areas to a limited extent for armed defenses but mainly as supply depots for the Pacific war effort and for surveillance and detection of incoming enemy ships and aircraft. Continued activities after war's end saw the southern California area become one of the nation's leading locations for testing and innovations in new war technology.<br /> <br /> In 1948 the Commandant of the 11th Naval District, based in San Diego, administered San Miguel Island. Robert L. Brooks held a revocable grazing lease on San Miguel Island, the one he had held continuously for 33 years. In July 1948, the Navy exercised its right to revoke and gave Brooks 72 hours to remove his sheep and other property from the island. He was told the Navy would begin immediately to use the island as a bombing range.<br /> <br /> <strong>Joint Use: Navy and Air Force</strong><br /> The San Miguel Island Bombing Range Danger Area appeared in the Coast Guard Notice to Mariners December 17, 1948, and in the following year was subject to joint use by both Air Force and Navy. Pressure on it was so heavy that scheduling had to be made on a weekly basis even though squadrons were asking for use on an indefinite basis. Moffett Field found it most satisfactory for its squadrons that required the use of a high altitude target. Castle Air Force Base at Merced wrote that the practice bombing they conducted at San Miguel included dropping of 4,000 pound light case bombs at altitudes up to and including 30,000 feet.<br /> <br /> The 11th Naval District records contained numerous reports of unauthorized surface craft \"fouling the waters surrounding San Miguel Island\" and interfering with the bombing missions. For example, in October 1949 private boats around San Miguel were so frequent that the commanding officer of the 93rd Bombardment Wing stationed at Castle Air Force Base complained they almost prevented use of the bombing range. Fishing craft ignored attempts of the pilots to signal them out of the area and the planes would return to base, at great cost in dollars to the American public. To solve this the Coast Guard was asked to include San Miguel in its patrol pattern but it had no forces available for such patrols on a regular basis.<br /> <br /> Squadrons had to resort to red flares for range clearance or to dropping message blocks close aboard the surface craft. The Bombing Range users were particularly annoyed because range time came on a priority basis, and once lost had to be rescheduled. Fleet squadrons used live bombs. Acting Commander Harper of Composite Squadron Five, Naval Air Station, Moffett Field wrote that even when they attempted to warn boats away by low passes with bomb bays open the signal was not understood by boats. Composite Squadron Six at Moffett Field, practicing high altitude bombing, used Prince Island as an aiming point for radar bombing and dropped 100-pound General Purpose type bombs. The commanding officer observed that most violators were in Cuyler Harbor. Four of his planes had to circle the area for over an hour before they were able to clear the area of pleasure craft and begin to carry out their mission. In April 1950 the San Miguel Island bombing range was included in the Permanent Danger Area by the Coast Guard in its \"Notices to Mariners\" which was issued in addition to the weekly Notice. Further, warning signs were posted on the island.<br /> <br /> San Miguel Island Bombing Range was closed June 16, 1950 to July 9, 1950 so that Robert L. Brooks could come out to the island and remove his livestock. The curator of geology and anthropology at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, Phil C. Orr, his assistant Richard Finley, and Mr. David Gray volunteered to herd sheep in order to study the natural history of the island. Don Butler and the Brooks ranch hands combed the hills and ravines on horseback driving the sheep into corrals and to the loading pier. On June 25, 1950, and while the range was closed, the Korean War broke out thus giving cause for greater impact on scheduling time for the island bombing range. Carrier based squadrons such as those stationed at North Island were prime users.<br /> <br /> <strong>Condition of San Miguel Island in 1961</strong><br /> Bombing continued through the 1950s, and when scientists came on the island in the early sixties they reported finding shrapnel and bomb casings all over the island. E. R. Blakely, who was there in April 1961, said they landed their plane on the airstrip near the Ranch House. During World War II, the army had graded the strip and used it for big planes, but in 1961 it had large trenches across it, one especially large and dangerous. The observation tower on San Miguel Peak still stood, and the wreckage of the B-24 bomber that had crashed in 1943 lay on the northeast slope of Green Mountain. Both burros and sheep roamed the island, but they were being run down and shot whenever possible by Navy personnel.<br /> <br /> Blakely found leaks in the Ranch House roof, but vandals had not really gotten to it as books and china were in place and people lived in it now and then. The wall next to the house had fallen down. Blakely found the walls papered with newspapers interesting to read. The barn was partially standing and the pre-fabricated Navy barracks of two rooms was good enough to stay in.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Pacific Missile Range Administration and Use</strong><br /> In 1961 the Navy refused to give up San Miguel Island to a National Park plan then being drafted for several of the Channel Islands. A letter in 1962 from Kenneth E. Be Lieu, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, to Secretary of the Interior Steward Udall clarifies why they would not release it in the foreseeable future: \"One of the most important aspects of the operations conducted from the facilities of the Pacific Missile Range is the launching of missiles into polar orbit. Flight paths go directly over and adjacent to San Miguel Island. The easterly impact limit of the azimuths required for these launches passes just west of Santa Rosa Island. All the area west of this line is subject to impact by missile pieces as a result of destructive action during missile launching operations. The Pacific Missile Range safety policy requires that all civilian and non-operating personnel be evacuated from within this danger area during southerly launchings. The current number of launchings already makes joint use impracticable and their number is increasing rapidly. \"<br /> <br /> In 1963 the Department of the Navy transferred all the plant account and security responsibility for San Miguel Island from the Eleventh Naval District to the Commander, Pacific Missile Range. This was the same year that Navy and Interior signed an agreement to jointly protect natural values and historic and scientific objects on San Miguel and Prince Islands. Both agreements recognized priority of military uses.<br /> <br /> The U. S. Navy uses of San Miguel Island evolved out of the country's early efforts in defense and surveillance, and saw its heyday during the Cold War era as the United States found itself at odds with the Soviet Union and China. After witnessing the destructive power of German buzz bombs on European cities and the United States' nuclear attacks on Japan, governments and military leaders came to realize that technological advance would define future warfare. The Navy, breaking with its own tradition of fiscal prudence and minimal research and development of new technology, began after the war to expand research into new defense technology. The Navy more than quintupled its expenditures for research and development in ten years' time which also brought a huge increase in lucrative contracts to defense industries. Missile technology, largely developed by the German military, came to the forefront of national defense, as control of the seas and air space became the focus of military strategies. The Pacific Ocean provided an ideal testing ground and the various Channel Islands fell into play as integral units to the successful testing and maintenance of the nation's guided missile defense systems.<br /> <br /> The U. S. Navy established a field test site for the Special Weapons Tactical Test and Evaluation Unit in 1943 at Point Mugu, a former swamp located south of Ventura and Port Hueneme; the location provided \"an overwater space through which missiles can be launched while data on their performance are being obtained in such a manner that correct evaluations of their performance can be made.\" Headquarters for the unit were located at Traverse City, Michigan. The use of airborne weapons had advanced during World War II to the point that military leaders realized the importance of such modern systems in global warfare and defense. On the urging of Navy Commander Grayson Merrill, the Navy created its Pilotless Aircraft Unit Detachment at Point Mugu in 1945 where engineers tested guided missiles such as the Loon using the expanse of ocean, which it called the Instrumented Sea Range, as a proving ground. The offshore islands provided locations for monitoring missile paths and, in some cases, acting as targets, dummy ships at sea as it were. According to Navy historian Maxwell White, the islands were a major consideration in the selection of Point Mugu as the location of the United States' first over-water missile testing range.<br /> <br /> During the 1940s the Navy tested a number of guided missile systems such as the Gargoyle, Gorgon, Lark, Little Joe and the Loon which figured in the ship-to-shore bombardment of Japan late in the war; systems tested in the 1950s and accelerated by the Korean conflict included the Regulus I, a submarine-to-shore missile; Regulus II, an early supersonic missile; and various versions of the Sparrow, launched from a plane for airborne targets. The government owned and controlled three of the Channel Islands. (San Miguel, San Nicolas and San Clemente) and made use of their entire landmasses for testing, targeting and facilities. The Navy also placed facilities on privately owned Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands.<br /> <br /> The U. S. Naval Air Missile Test Center (NAMTC), as the Pilotless Aircraft Unit had been renamed in 1946, made plans in 1948 for major facilities at Point Mugu and the Channel Islands. With the major installations to be constructed at Point Mugu and San Nicolas Island, plans included a radio communication center on Santa Rosa Island and a fully staffed \"observation site\" on Santa Cruz. Development of missile defenses expanded rapidly in the 1950s. The Bullpup air-to-surface bomb, the first \"smart\" missile which could attach itself to a target, was put into testing in 1953 and remained, in its many stages of development, an important weapon into the 1970s when it was supplanted by the Walleye that used television for homing in on its targets. By 1956 the NAMTC employed 4,800 people and operated out of a $50 million plant; it was, along with Navy's China Lake facility in the Mojave Desert, the military's most important missile testing facility.<br /> <br /> In 1957 President Eisenhower called for the national testing ranges to be available to all of the armed services. On June 16, 1958 the Navy joined with the Air Force's Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral and the Army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico to create the Pacific Missile Range (PMR), which became known as the Cold War's \"Keeper of the Pacific.\" The following year the Naval Missile Center was created exclusively to test and evaluate Navy missile systems, in effect splitting the mission of the old NAMTC. By the early 1960s the PMR owned or held interest in properties at Pt. Mugu, Pt. Arguello and six other mainland coastal sites, San Nicolas, Santa Cruz and San Miguel islands, two inland sites in Nevada and Utah and sites on Hawaii, Midway and Wake Islands. In 1963 the Air Force took over the facilities at Pt. Arguello and most Pacific range sites, but the Navy continued to control the PMR with its facilities at Point Mugu, San Nicolas Island and Santa Cruz Island. Following these developments, the PMR in 1963 took over San Miguel Island from the 11th Naval District.<br /> <br /> The following year, 1964, the Pacific Missile Range began some Land Mass Background studies and employed San Miguel Island. The first was to test radar guidance systems. They were testing surface-to-air and surface-to-surface weapons. The missile would be on a boat in the channel and launched southerly over the island into the defined range area to see how the radar guidance would react to land clutter. PMR made two launches of the Talos missile with this in mind in 1964. One missile used an active radar seeker in its final guidance phase. The problem lay in its being confused by a landmass. For example, the Russian Komar submarine would run in near an island and the radar on Talos would lose the Komar and try to hit the island; thus PMR was trying to improve the radar guidance so it would not leave its target when it made the test launches over San Miguel Island. Since the tests, the instrumentation has been improved. The radar locks onto a moving target and the landmass in the background will not cause it to break lock. PMR only ran two operations of this type but probably several rehearsals. The fact remained, however, that the requirement might arise for upcoming weapons and San Miguel had a unique location for such launches. Secondly, it could easily be cleared of people by the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> A second use for San Miguel by PMR was that of testing landfall when a ship target was anchored in front of it. Exercises were carried out to see if a missile could distinguish between the land (San Miguel Island) and the target. If the background confused the missile then it was not useful. Thirdly, the island served to test airborne systems. Radar has different characteristics over land than it has over water. PMR wanted to know if San Miguel's land mass would confuse the missile electronic systems and the radar of a plane that was pursuing another aircraft over ocean and then over land.<br /> <br /> February and March 1965, San Miguel, San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands were used in a major fleet exercise involving eighty ships and 70,000 Navy-Marine Corps personnel. By this time the Navy had installed a series of range poles near the west end to guide aircraft in sighting.<br /> <br /> On May 3, 1965, Channel 13, KCOP-TV carried a program called \"The Secret of San Miguel\" which by its nature encouraged people to go out to the island and search for buried treasure. This alerted PMR to the fact that no public announcement had ever been made to the public that there was a danger of unexploded ordnance on San Miguel. Captain H. S. Bergman suggested that the Navy would be in a better position to deal with such TV programming if it made a sweep for bombs, made a public announcement, and then wrote to the TV programmers. PMR proceeded rapidly with plans to sweep bombs from San Miguel, and during the period of May 17 to May 21, 1965, ordnance decontamination was conducted. The search was reported as a 100% surface coverage, but due to the continuous high winds and shifting sand it was believed additional items of ordnance might be revealed. The island was considered safe for personnel occupancy, but personnel should be advised of the hazards associated with unexploded ordnance.<br /> <br /> During the week of June 17, 1965, Bullpup missile operations started on the island. Initial Bullpup firings were aimed at a barge anchored in Cuyler Harbor 700 yards southwest of Bat Rock. Range officials reported that the island's \"varied terrain permitted targets to be concealed and protected as they would be in actual combat.\" Use of the tactical firing area on San Miguel was intended to provide Navy and Marine Corps pilots with experience in the use of the Bullpup missiles against combat type targets. PMR recited that in selecting sites for the land targets they had avoided areas of any archaeological and zoological interest. Before each mission, the island would be cleared of people and warning area notices would be issued to mariners and airmen. The first press releases mentioned five hundred pound live ordnance, but either due to public pressure or tactical changes, this terminology was deleted from releases on June 16, the day before the firings began. As a tactical target area for fleet training, San Miguel was perfect. Planes could approach the target area from any direction at 0-20,000 feet using various attack modes. A launch aircraft with a chase plane made the attack and called the hit based on visual observation. A helicopter or other aircraft performed surveillance and took photographs of the missile impact. Both practice and live warheads were approved.<br /> <br /> The Navy was anxious in 1965 to find the locations of archeological sites so that they could avoid destroying them when they set up targets for tactical bombing missions. A Navy helicopter flew Charles Rozaire and George Kritzman out to San Miguel August 19-27, 1965 to map archeological sites, and it was obvious from Rozaire's report that the Navy had habitually taken care of his transportation and made the photo lab at PMR available to him. Rozaire kept the Navy informed about the conditions of buildings and presence of vandals on the island. In that trip he found the Navy barracks or shack much deteriorated, the no trespassing signs torn down, and the roof of the Ranch House down.<br /> <br /> <strong>Danger Zone, 1965</strong><br /> The Navy eventually got tired of small boat owners who would not heed notices to stay out of San Miguel waters during tactical exercises and of vandals who came on the island and tore down metals signs bolted to steel posts, shot up the buildings, and used the seals for target practice. It was not the general public, but as one official put it, a small cantankerous group.<br /> <br /> August 12, 1965, the Navy applied to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which regulated navigable offshore waters, for a designated danger zone around San Miguel Island. Accordingly, October 11, 1965, Major Robert T. Ojendyk, Corps of Engineers, established a zone at the east end or half of the island plus a three-mile offshore area on all sides involved.<br /> <br /> According to the regulations, the danger zone was to be open to fishing and general navigation except during firing. Anchoring or loitering of vessels was prohibited within the zone. Landing or going ashore was prohibited without prior permission of the Commander, PMR. Firing information was made available and paid public notices were inserted in local newspapers (see map, \"San Miguel Danger Zone\").<br /> <br /> Letters opposing the establishment of a danger zone flooded the desk of Major Ojendyk: fishermen, abalone hunters, boaters, zoologists, archaeologists, Western Oil and Gas Association, the Sierra Club, and Department of Fish and Game, Yacht Clubs, and State Senator Alvin C. Weingard (D) of Santa Barbara. Only the City of Santa Barbara, it seemed, had no objection. The Sierra Club and the Santa Barbara Yacht Club wanted a radical solution: take San Miguel out of the Navy's control. Gas and oil interests desired drilling sites uninterrupted by hazardous operations. Conservationists wanted the public wholly excluded. Fishermen desired unlimited fishing. Yachtsmen wanted to anchor and go ashore. Thus, a solution for one group would offend another. PMR answered each group, emphasized that the zone was closed only during times of actual firing, and retained the zone.<br /> <br /> In 1966 PMR utilized San Miguel Island for fleet pilot training and for proficiency training in the Bullpup, FFAR (folding fin aircraft rocket), bombs, the Zuni Missile, and 20mm cannon weapons.<br /> <br /> In September 1966, PMR was preparing a training area on San Miguel for the Walleye, Condor, and other systems. It had a Nike target and inflatable Bullpup targets on shore. Simulated truck convoys, SAM sites, tanks, and revetted aircraft targets were being installed on the southeastern portion of the island between the escarpment and the beach. The latter was primarily for the aircraft squadrons of the First Fleet. Additional targets such as bridges and RF radiating equipment were planned for the near future. PMR reported to Naval Air Systems Command in Washington that installation of land targets would create increased use of the island by Fleet squadrons, also U.S. Marine Corps squadrons, who preferred the land targets to the barge targets. In 1966, Fleet missile firing ships were requesting shore targets for surface-to-surface missile testing and pilot spotting training. PMR correspondence argued that there were no practicable alternatives to the use of San Miguel Island. Com. R. N. Sharp, PMR, wrote on September 9, 1966:<br /> <br /> \"Areas such as San Nicolas Island, San Clemente, Chocolate Mountain, El Centro, Yuma, Twenty-Nine Palms, Mojave B. and the Naval Ordnance Training Station, China Lake are either already overly scheduled, contain populations which must be evacuated, lack adequate instrumentation or area, permit no offset firing, restrict approaches to one or two prescribed headings at fixed altitudes, or require ground control of aircraft at all times. While these areas are quite adequate for the purposes for which they were designed, they are unsuitable to the purposes now required for missile testing and practice firing. Among other things, the circumstances of firing are so artificial as to lack the realism necessary for much needed pilot training. San Miguel, on the other hand, is both unique and ideal. Situated as it is at the westerly end of an island chain, wholly unimproved and unpopulated, it presents a minimum safety hazard, while offering maximum security. With targets available onshore, just offshore, and 10 to 15 miles offshore, it provides realistic practice in a well-balanced instrumented area. No other target areas in the United States allow for attack by two or more aircraft at once, or permit pilots to determine their own altitude, range, angle, and release position. Logistics problems are non-existent, at least from El Toro, Alameda, Lemoore, also the Fleet. The area is accessible without the need to overfly populated areas. In final substance, it is the last such area left. \"<br /> <br /> As Captain H. S. Bergman pointed out in preparing the draft for the above, squadrons were coming to PMR from Norfolk and from Cherry Point only so that they could use San Miguel. Many young pilots preparing for a tour of duty in Vietnam were firing for the first or second time and needed realistic practice with the variability of approaches only San Miguel could offer them. The money spent by the American public on missile testing and on tactical missions was so great that to give up or curtail the use of San Miguel in the program seemed irresponsible.<br /> <br /> A second major reorganization occurred on July 1, 1975 merging the Naval Missile Test Center and the Pacific Missile Range into a single body, the Pacific Missile Test Center (PMTC). The following year the Departments of the Navy and Interior agreement regarding San Miguel Islands was amended to allow the National Park Service greater administrative latitude, including authorization to expend NPS funds for study and management of the island resources. San Miguel Island lay in a strategic portion of the PMR's Sea Test Range, within that area designated W-289N. On land, targets were no longer listed, and in 1976 the only Pacific Missile Testing Center asset on the island was an automatic weather station, powered by a twenty-five watt generator. This small device was protected by sturdy fencing from the ever-present threat of vandals on the island. A non-instrumented target barge was anchored approximately one mile south of the island's eastern tip. During tactical exercises, all boats and people were warned to stay out of the surface danger zone which surrounded the eastern half of San Miguel, but they were allowed to remain on the west end of the island.<br /> <br /> The number of air to surface exercises decreased during the 1970s and 1980s. Both the Point Mugu area and San Nicolas Island were heavily instrumented, thus defining the southwesterly geographic quadrant extending seaward from Point Mugu as essential to the Navy mission. Meanwhile, the Department of the Interior leased the oil industry about 33 square miles of the sea area southeast of Santa Rosa Island. At the time it was considered that if Navy squadrons were deprived use of the San Miguel Island area, 100 enroute miles would be added to 80% of all training sorties originally planning to use the San Miguel target. Squadrons originated from Miramar, North Island, Lemoore, Moffett Field, and other bases. Further, and of greater importance, it would place the training squadrons in direct competition with vital research and training programs for use of that mission-essential area previously described, thus derogating both efforts.<br /> <br /> In 1977 an Operations Officer at Lemoore stated that Attack Squadron 122 was scheduling operations at the Pacific Missile Test Center. The plane they used was the A-7, a single-engine jet, land or carrier based. Lemoore opened in 1961 at which time all training squadrons used the A04, a single-engine jet. In either case, students needed the type of training the San Miguel Island tactical mission provided to fulfill their syllabus work. Their training manual recited that live ordnance could be used only on San Clemente Island, so Naval air strikes at San Miguel were with inert ordnance called Blue Whistlers: a watersand filled thin shell twenty-five pound blue bomb with a spotting charge. The blue indicated its inert composition.<br /> <br /> The Navy considered that San Miguel Island could be defined as a strategic site for the installation of a tracking radar or a radar for tracking test missiles launched from PMR, and for a telemetry station to receive radio signals from a missile in flight to measure certain parameters such as acceleration, control angles, pressures and temperatures. However, changes in the needs of the Navy and the establishment of Channel Islands National Park in 1980 placed San Miguel Island under the management, although not ownership, of the National Park Service.</p>",

The trail to the north leads you to the Cabrillo Monument. The trail to the northeast heads to the campground. To the south is the trail to the airplane landing strip and the ranger station.<br /><br />Here, at the Lester Ranch Site, William Waters, who acquired ranching rights in the 1880s, constructed the island's largest ranch house. We are standing amongst its ruins. Work began in 1906. It was constructed out of materials salvaged from shipwrecks around the island. The house was 125 feet long and 16 feet wide with double-walls to withstand the strong winds. A blacksmith shop/harness room, tool shed, well, cistern, and root cellar were also constructed.<br /><br />The house was later lived in by the Lester Family from 1928 - 1942. It burned down in 1967 when the island was being used as a military testing range. <br /><br />All that remains of the house today is a stone and brick rubble, piled in messy mounds. The prominent pile of rubble is the living room chimney. Some of the brick mantelpiece is still visible. Rusty objects, pipes, a shovel, and a white ceramic corner sink lay half buried by the brush, rubble, and soil. <br /><br />Old concrete foundation walls, including those of the root cellar and the cistern, are intact, but cracked and crumbling. The ruins are covered with pale moss. Giant yellow Coreopsis, with thick branches topped with tufts of feathery green leaves and yellow, daisy-like flowers in springtime, and a shaggy, brittle, brown mop of dead leaves in the drier seasons, dried grasses, and low scrub brush grow amid and around the ruins. <br />",

Although the shearing of 90 sheep a day is the average, a great many will go as high as 110; and one man has been known to shear 125.<br /> <br /> Although no herding is necessary, about two hundred or more trained goats are kept on the island continually, which to all intents and purposes take the place of the shepherd dogs so necessary to mountainous districts where sheep are raised.<br /> <br /> To prevent the sheep from contracting disease, it is necessary to give them a washing twice a year. Moore [sic] having so many on hand, found it necessary to invent some way to accomplish this . . . After experimenting for some time, he had a ditch dug eight feet in depth, a little over one foot in width, and one hundred feet long. In this he put six hundred gallons of water, two hundred pounds of sulphur, one hundred pounds of lime, and six pounds of soda, all of which is heated to one hundred and thirty degrees. The goats lead the sheep into a corral or trap at one end, and the animals are compelled to swim through to the further end, thus securing a bath and taking their medicine at one and the same time.\"<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\"><strong>Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </strong></a><strong> </strong></p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a dirt road. On the west side of the road is the Vail and Vickers Ranch House site, with a two story house and an outbuilding, both with white clapboard siding and dark green trim and roofs. The dirt road continues toward the north, with a long wooden rail fence running near the right or eastern side of the road, and a row of eucalyptus trees just beyond that fence. About a quarter of a mile down that road is the ranch complex, a cluster of ranch buildings and corrals. <br /><br />On a side road that loops to the right, near the eucalyptus trees, is small chain link fence enclosure with a low shed with a metal roof: the pig pen. Back on the main road, just past that side road turn, are two single story wooden sheds: the scale house and the branding shed. Further along the main road are two large red wooden barns, the blacksmith shop barn and the horse barn. After this, the road curves right toward the east, passing a single story grey wooden bunkhouse, a small single story white school house, several wooden rail corral enclosures, and a cattle dipping vat. As the road approaches the edge of the bluff, a hundred yards to your left, or the north, is the foreman's house-a white single story structure, with dark green trim and roof. On the other side of the road are a rope house, a cattle chute and a pile driver.<br /><br />To the east of the road where you are now standing, on the other side of the wooden rail fence, and running parallel to it, is a long row of eucalyptus trees.<br /><br />To the south of you, the road continues toward a cluster of national park service buildings-white with green trim and roofs. <br />",

    "bodyText": "Santa Barbara Island became part of Channel Islands National Monument in 1938 and part of Channel Islands National Park in 1980. In 1991 the park constructed a new ranger residence and visitor center. Above the ranger building stands a maintenance shop with water storage and solar collectors. As has been the case for over 50 years, fresh water is pumped to the water system from boats at the landing cove.<br /> <br /> <strong>More Information</strong><br /> As early as 1932, the Bureau of Lighthouses suggested transferring Santa Barbara Island, as well as Anacapa, to the National Park Service for preservation and on April 26, 1938, the both islands became part of the newly designated Channel Islands National Monument. The Lighthouse Service reserved two parcels on Santa Barbara Island and rights of ingress and egress from the two parcels and the landing area.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service set to work evaluating Santa Barbara Island’s resources and developing a management plan. E. Lowell Sumner, Jr., Regional Wildlife Technician, and R. M. Bond of the Soil Conservation Service, submitted a report on the biology of the islands on June 28, 1939. They recommended that the park service obtain assistance from the Coast Guard and State Division of Fish and Game in patrolling the islands and adjacent waters, and stressed the importance of removing the “hordes of exotic house cats so that certain threatened species of animal life which constitute a unique feature of the island can return to their original condition.” Sumner illustrated the need to post the islands with signs proclaiming the island protected as a national monument: “Santa Barbara Island . . .should be posted at the earliest possible moment. Upon the arrival of our group, we found a party, brought by a fishing boat, already ashore with a gun. No shooting was heard, and the individuals involved promised that they would not go hunting again on the island. They professed ignorance of the recently changed status of the island and, in the absence of any signs indicating that the island was a national monument, such ignorance was not at all improbable. In former years considerable slaughter of sea-lions has taken place in this vicinity and the animals need just such a sanctuary as Santa Barbara Island affords. “<br /> <br /> In his report, Sumner described the familiar cycle of overgrazing on Santa Barbara Island: destruction of native vegetation, introduction of large numbers of noxious weeds, soil erosion and scarring. He counted approximately a thousand sea lions on the island, and noted brown pelicans and eagles. In March of 1940, Meryl B. Dunkle of Long Beach, then doing research for his doctoral thesis, visited Santa Barbara Island with the Los Angeles Museum’s Channel Islands Biological Survey. He covered the island “very thoroughly,” adding twenty species to the known flora, and observed an adult sea otter and two sea elephants. <br /> <br /> In 1949 the monument boundaries were expanded to include “the area within one nautical mile of the shoreline of Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands.” On Santa Barbara Island, this meant that the rocky beaches, offshore rocks and Sutil Island and Shag Rock would be protected.<br /> <br /> In 1950, biologist Lowell Sumner reported only two rabbits, noting that “the ecological effects of this new rabbit introduction were as yet scarcely evident.” But when Sumner filed his inspection report of the islands on May 27, 1953, the picture had changed dramatically. The native vegetation was destroyed almost to the point that the sheep had formerly destroyed it. Sumner wrote: “It is typical of such irruptions that they begin unobtrusively but after several years commence to snow-ball in their effects. The present one has now reached disastrous proportions. The rapidity with which such biological changes can take place on small islands where predators are largely absent illustrates the danger of allowing several years to elapse between biological inspections.”<br /> <br /> Beginning in 1954 the National Park Service began removing the estimated 6,000 rabbits in order to protect the island’s native vegetation and control excessive erosion and the spread of non-native plants. By 1981, all the rabbits were removed, check dames were in place to slow erosion, and fiber matting was laid down to hold seeds and seedlings of native plants. <br /> <br /> After Santa Barbara Island became part of the new Channel Islands National Park in 1980, the NPS determined that visitor numbers should be limited and relocated the campground and any future development to the small area above the landing cove. The NPS constructed a new dock with hoist and a boathouse. In 1991 the park constructed a new ranger residence and visitor center on the site of the Quonset hut. Above the ranger building stands a maintenance shop with water storage and solar collectors. As has been the case for over 50 years, fresh water is pumped to the water system from boats at the landing cove. ",
    "audioDescription": "If you are standing at the flagpole, facing the Santa Barbara Island Visitor Center, you are on a high bluff, and the ocean is far below, on your left. You are in the middle of a coreopsis forest. Depending on the season, the coreopsis, with a thick, bare trunk, topped by a shaggy mop of yellow flowers and feathery green leaves, shaped like fluffy ostrich feathers. In late summer, fall or winter, the coreopsis will turn into waist-high brown stalks that look dead. The single-story beige building, has a roof made of overlapping curved red tiles. On the wall, facing you, are two wooden signs with white lettering. The one on the ocean side reads, “Visitor Center.” The one on the land side reads, “Private Residence.” Between the signs are two narrow vertical windows. Below the windows, running the length of the building are several dense shrubs. An open patio extends out on the ocean side of the building, but watch your step, as it is about ten inches above ground. Just off this patio is the door to the visitor center and a tall window with a view into the exhibit. The patio has a picnic table and an outdoor panel about sea bird habitat, described separately. Beyond this first patio is another, gated, patio, blocked by a brick wall. On the opposite side of building—the “Private Residence” side— is a walkway running the length of the building.",

    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a dirt road near the ranch complex. On the west side of the road are three white buildings, all with vertical board and batten siding, dark green trim, and gabled, or simple peaked, green roofs. Two buildings are positioned in a row, about 10 feet apart, facing north. Both are about 24 feet deep. The one closest to the road is about 60 feet wide. The second is only about 20 feet wide. <br /><br />On the sides of both buildings are a square slatted vent opening, just below the eaves of the roof, and two windows at ground level. Each window is a double hung sash window, made of two panels that are offset, to allow one to slide up and down. There are 6 panes of glass in each panel, separated by thin wooden mullions. On the road side of the first building, there is also a doorway centered between the two windows, an outdoor light, and a wooden sign with embossed white lettering and an arrow that points upward, that reads, <br /><br />Restrooms <br /><br />On the front of the first, wider, building are three more of the same style windows; a red box about 1 foot high by 2 feet high by one and a half feet deep; and a dark green set of double doors, about 6 feet wide, with a light on top. The front of the second building only has a set of the same style of double doors and light, but no windows.<br /><br />In the alley between the two structures, on the wall of the larger building, is a spigot with a dark hose attached, and coiled on a loop nearby. A flat concrete pad fills the entire alley between the two buildings and extends out to the north. It runs from the double doors on the front of the first building all the way across the front of the second building, where there is a 3 foot tall, yellow metal post, mounted vertically at the far corner. This deep pad extends north about 15 feet, ending in a dirt parking area. A narrow sidewalk wraps around the building to the east side, closest to the dirt road.<br /><br />On the road side of the first building, just outside the door, the sidewalk extends out into another deep concrete pad, about 15 feet square, with four wooden picnic tables on it. <br /><br />On the south side, in back of the two buildings, is a large array of photovoltaic solar panels. These are tilted to face upward toward the south, stand about 8 feet tall, and run the full width of the two buildings. A short white rail fence extends from the edges of the buildings to the front edges of those panels.<br /><br />Beyond these two buildings, across a dirt parking area, and farthest from the road, is the third and smallest structure. This wooden restroom building faces the road. It has a green wooden deck with a wooden railing. A concrete sidewalk wraps around the deck. On the right, or north, side of the building, there is a ramp up to the deck level. In front of the building are two doors into unisex, single user, restrooms, indicated by plaques with an icon for a man and woman. The door closest to the ramp also shows an icon for a wheel chair. Both plaques read,<br /><br />Restroom<br />",

Total capacity for the nursery is approximately 5, 200 plants.<br /> <br /> <b>Seabirds on the Channel Islands</b><br /> The Channel Islands are vital habitat for seabirds, providing essential nesting and feeding grounds for 99% of seabirds in southern California. Twelve species of seabirds depend on the rich marine resources and the isolation of these offshore islands to provide food and undisturbed nesting grounds safe from predators. The islands host half of the world's population of ashy storm-petrels and western gulls and 80% of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets. In addition, the islands are home to the only major breeding population of California brown pelicans in the western U.S.<br /> <br /> The Channel Islands are critically important to seabirds, supporting:<br /> <br /> - the largest breeding colonies of seabirds in southern California<br /> - the only breeding colonies of California brown pelicans in California<br /> - the only protected colonies of California brown pelicans and Scripps's murrelets on the West Coast of the U.S.<br /> - the largest colonies in southern California of Cassin's auklet, western gulls, Scripps's murrelets, rhinoceros auklets, tufted puf fins, ashy storm-petrels, double-crested cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and black storm-petrels<br /> - over 30 years of seabird research<br /> <br /> <b>Impacts to Seabirds</b><br /> Seabirds in the park and throughout southern California are impacted by many factors including contaminants, oil spills, invasive species, and changes in the ocean environment. For example, the introduction of DDT, a long-lived pesticide, into the marine environment has severely impacted seabird populations at the islands. Before DDT was banned in the 1970s, California's brown pelican population suffered nearly complete reproductive failure.<br /> <br /> On land, predation and habitat disturbance by invasive species have impacted seabirds. On Anacapa, introduced black rats preyed heavily on seabird eggs and chicks severely depleting populations of Scripps's murrelets. Seabird habitat has also been severely impacted by grazing of non-native animals, including sheep and rabbits. Invasive red-flowered iceplant (intentionally introduced by the U.S. Coast Guard) resulted in further degradation of native plant communities.<br /> <br /> <b>Monitoring and Restoration</b><br /> Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners, including the California Institute of Environmental Studies and The Nature Conservancy, are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support seabird populations in southern California. Several of these projects have been funded by the Montrose Settlements Restoration Program, a multi-agency government program dedicated to restoring natural resources harmed by DDTs and PCBs released into the environment. Restoration accomplishments include:<br /> <br /> - Eradication of all non-native animals, including rats in 2002. Shortly after the eradication of rats, scientists recorded a substantial recovery of native wildlife and rare seabirds, including Scripps's murrelets and Cassin's auklets.<br /> <br /> - Removal of red-flowered ice plant on East Anacapa Island which once covered about 20% of the island. This effort by park staff, cooperators, and volunteers, paved the way for the return of native plants through restoration.<br /> <br /> - Between 2016-2019 four acres near the lighthouse were restored by transforming an area entirely dominated by invasive non-native crystalline iceplant to a diverse landscape of coastal sage scrub. Early results showed multiple benefits with additional species utilizing the restored habitat area, including seabirds such as western gulls, many species of migratory birds, and co-benefits including a thriving insect community within the structure of the restored shrub habitat and multiple terrestrial bird species feeding on and pollinating flowering native plants. The project also increased nesting habitat for murrelets by more than 50% on Anacapa.<br /> <br /> For 2020 through 2023, funding for restoration on Anacapa Island is provided by the Wildlife Conservation Board Pacific Flyway Conservation Program. This project will focus on restoring 3 acres of breeding habitat for the Scripps's murrelet and other migratory birds (seabird and terrestrial) by removing non-native invasive plant species and planting native species. This project will more than double available breeding habitat at Anacapa Island and increase available nesting habitat for murrelets by around 30% in California. Habitat restoration for seabirds such as the Scripps's murrelet, even in small acreages, can provide large benefits due to the colonial nesting behavior of these migratory birds that have high nest densities.<br /> This work will be accomplished by using the California Conservation Corps as well as an established base of volunteers and students. Volunteers assist with all aspects of the restoration program, including seed collection, weeding, nursery work, outplanting, and monitoring.</p>",

In the 1940s and 50s light-station residents brought red-flowered iceplant (Malephora crocea) to Anacapa for landscaping and erosion control. The plant spread rapidly in disturbed soil and overwhelmed native plants, reducing diverse natural vegetation and food sources on which native animals, including seabirds depend.<br /> <br /> In the past, this iceplant, with its thick fleshy green leaves and large red flowers, covered about 20 percent of east Anacapa like a red and green carpet. To restore Anacapa's native vegetation, park staff, cooperators, and volunteers removed red-flowered iceplant and replanted cleared areas with native plants grown from island-collected seed. Native species that were restored include coreopsis, alkali heath, gum plant, yarrow, needlegrass, California barley, giant ryegrass, live-forever, buckwheat, and goldenbush. To ensure the recovery of the island's native vegetation, the park will continue to remove other nonnative plants, including other species of ice plant, and replace them with a variety of native plants.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>More Native Plants</strong></u></p> <p>With the islands never being connected to the mainland, plants, seeds, and spores over millions of years were carried from the mainland by ocean currents, wind, and birds or in the fur of animals that reached the islands. Due to continuous isolation from the mainland, many plant communities on the islands are unique, including the absence of some common mainland species and the presence of many island endemics (species that grow naturally only on one or more of the Channel Islands).<br /> <br /> Since the Chumash did not practice agriculture, they used native plants as a primary source of food and medicine. Native plants also provided important construction materials for canoes, houses, bows, arrows, nets, baskets, beds, clothing, footwear, ornaments, and a variety of other items used in daily life.<br /> <br /> With nonnative iceplant now removed, many native plants are starting to recover and reestablishing themselves throughout the island. Take time to look carefully and you should see some of the following species.<br /> <br /> <strong>Monkey Flower</strong><br /> Monkey flower is common in chaparral throughout California. Known as \"sticky\" monkey flower because the deep green leaves secrete a gluey substance, they bloom from January to May and were named for the monkey face that sometimes can be seen within the orange to pale yellow flowers. The island endemic species differs from the mainland species in the lack of sticky leaves and its bright red flowers.<br /> <br /> <strong>Lemonade Berry</strong><br /> Lemonade berry is a shrub with thick, leathery leaves. The Chumash would steep the sticky, lemon-tasting berries in water to make juice, or they would suck on them like candy. One should be careful, however, since lemonade berry belongs to the same family as poison oak and can trigger a skin rash in those sensitive to it.<br /> <br /> <strong>Coastal Prickly Pear</strong><br /> The coastal prickly pear is a cactus that blooms in May and June, producing a shiny yellow flower with dense layers of petals. The plant's shallow root system spreads over a wide area to extract maximum moisture while its sharp spines reflect the sun and wind to help protect the plant from deyhydration.<br /> <br /> The Chumash harvested the sweet prickly pear fruit and used its beet-red juice as a paint and dye. The long, sharp cactus thorns were used for decorative ear piercing and tattooing. Vertical and transverse lines were commonly tattooed on the cheeks and chin, although tattoo designs were applied also to the forehead, arms, and other parts of the body. To create a dark blue tattoo, the skin was pricked with a cactus thorn and the punctures rubbed with charcoal. When the wounds healed the pigment was sealed under the skin.<br /> <br /> <strong>Dudleya (Live-forever)</strong><br /> Perhaps no plant is more versatile in adapting to different habitats than dudleya. These low-growing, fleshy succulents with a waxy coating commonly grow on dry, rocky outcroppings.<br /> <br /> However, they also can be found on stabilized sand dunes, grasslands, and scrub habitats in conditions varying from full sun to shade. This adaptability is reflected in the variety of dudleyas found on the Channel Islands, including one species on Anacapa Island, sand-lettuce.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wild Cucumber</strong><br /> Another plant that evolved to deal with the dry conditions of southern California is the vine-like wild cucumber that often can be seen along the hillsides in the oak understory. This plant has an immense, poisonous, fleshy root, or underground tuber, that stores water and nutrients.<br /> <br /> Wild cucumber is one of the very first flowers to bloom from January to June. The plant sprawls over trees, shrubs, and the ground, leaving a tangle of dried stems and leaves by midsummer. In spring however, the wild cucumber forms large, egg-shaped, bright green fruits covered with big soft green prickles that turn hard and spiny as the fruits dry.<br /> <br /> Inside are large seeds. The Chumash made necklaces of these seeds, polishing them along their oiled bodies. They were used also as marbles by Chumash children.<br /> <br /> <strong>Giant Coreopsis</strong><br /> Each spring Anacapa's coreopsis, or tree sunflower, undergoes a marvelous transformation. For a few brief weeks in March and April the plant's tall, bare trunks disappear beneath masses of bright green foliage with showy yellow blossoms.<br /> <br /> Coreopsis survives the lengthy dry season-nine or ten months each year-by remaining dormant. The plant's brittle, seemingly lifeless stems are easily damaged or broken. Anacapa's isolation and the absence of large animals that might trample them protect coreopsis during this dormancy.<br /> <br /> <strong>Other Native Plant Species</strong><br /> Other plants to look for include giant coreopsis, scouring rush, coastal goldenbush, indian pink, island morning glory, gumplant, coastal sagebrush, and golden yarrow.</p>",

United States Coast Survey topographers noted the adaptability and location advantage of the island in the Southern California Bight, an area used heavily by maritime traffic since before the Gold Rush. Nonetheless, it would take 75 years to get a navigational aid built on Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> For unknown reasons the Bureau of Lighthouses ignored Santa Barbara Island for the last half of the 19th century. Only at the urging of the Lighthouse Board in 1903 did the government take action. An Executive Order by President Theodore Roosevelt reserved Santa Barbara Island for lighthouse purposes on August 24, 1905: \"It is hereby ordered that an unsurveyed Island, known as Santa Barbara Island, situated in the Pacific Ocean in approximate sections 1, 2, 12 and 13, township 8 south, range 21 west, San Bernardino meridian, containing approximately 638.72 acres, be and it is hereby reserved for light-house purposes.\"<br /> <br /> On July 27, 1928, the Bureau of Lighthouses authorized an automatic light on the northerly point of the island \"for the protection of inter-island navigation in general and particularly for the protection of the Hawaiian Island and trans-Pacific traffic, which follows a course passing six miles to the northward of the island.\"<br /> <br /> By this time, the Los Angeles Harbor had surpassed San Francisco in tonnage and became the principal terminus for trade on the whole west coast. The Commissioner of Lighthouses approved a light for Santa Barbara Island in letters of January and March of 1928, and an allotment was made by the Bureau in connection with funds for additional aids to navigation on Anacapa Island.<br /> <br /> The light would be a 375 mm AGA acetylene lantern equipped with a K130 flasher, S20 sunvalve, and one-foot burner (390 candlepower) adjusted to show a flashing one second light every six seconds; it would be powered by twelve A-25 accumulators, or tanks of acetylene gas. Structures included the light tower with an accumulator house, built at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Island and disassembled for shipment. The equipment and labor would cost $2,286.00. The white wooden pyramid was constructed on the island by the district carpenter; the light installed by the \"mechanician\" and assisted by the crew of the lighthouse tender anchored off shore. The tower was located 195 feet above the water and appeared on the 1929 Light List as unwatched. The location given was the northeasterly point of the island, 33 degrees 29\".3' latitude north and 119 degrees 01\".8' longitude west. A new trail from the landing cove offered access by foot and handcart.<br /> <br /> In 1934, a second light tower went up on the south end of the island, westerly side, located 486 feet above the water and visible for twelve miles. The light, a 480 candlepower unwatched beacon on a steel skeleton tower, was on a ten second cycle, two seconds of flash. Workers built a trail between the landing and the southern light.<br /> <br /> At the outbreak of World War II, the military ordered both lights temporarily extinguished. They were relighted in 1943 when the immediate threat to Los Angeles Harbor was felt to be over. During the war the Navy took over responsibility for U. S. Coast Guard activities, including aids to navigation, and instituted a program of timed blackouts of coastal lights in case of enemy attack. The Navy placed additional navigational buoys and developed a blackout system called ANRAC during the blackout in 1942, which was able to control acetylene and electric lights on buoys or fixed structures. The control station, located on the mainland, could control the remote lights now equipped with radio receivers and relays.<br /> <br /> However, the Coastal Lookout observers evidently operated the Santa Barbara Island lights on site; the Observer in Charge at the island in December 1944 wrote to his superior telling of a faulty switch resulting in a temporary failure of the light. In June of 1945 the Commandant of the 11th Naval District advised that both island lights would be replaced by acetylene or automatic lights, would be maintained by the Coast Guard, and would no longer be subject to blackouts. The ANRAC system was dismantled in September of 1945.<br /> <br /> After the war the Coast Guard maintained the lights on a regular basis. The major responsibility was replacing the accumulators, gas cylinders weighing about 150 pounds each. Coast Guardsmen visited the island on tender ships such as the Diligence, hauling supplies on carts and making any repairs as necessary. A tramway left by the Navy from its wartime occupation of the island was maintained and used by the Coast Guard to haul supplies up the steep hill to the trails leading to the lights.<br /> <br /> Instead of the jeep they had requested after the war, Coast Guard men had hoisted a stripped down Model A Ford up the tramway for use hauling the twelve heavy acetylene tanks to each light twice a year. Because the soft island soil provided poor traction, the men \"welded tractor lugs of heavy angle iron to the bare rims,\" thereby churning up the earth to get to their destinations.<br /> <br /> On July 10, 1959, a fire denuded over two-thirds of the island and destroyed the south light tower. Permanent discontinuance was published on October 16, 1959. The northeasterly light remained operational.<br /> <br /> By 1979 the pyramidal wooden Santa Barbara Island Light structure was in poor condition. The historic resource study published that year noted that it was \"critically in need of paint and general repair. The door is unlocked, but jammed, and the fittings are rusted and need replacement.\" As the oldest structure remaining on the island, the light \"presents a poor and deteriorating appearance.\" The light tower was subsequently removed, replaced by a modern steel tower with a solar-powered beacon in 1980.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing at the tip of a rounded plateau, near the edge of a steep drop off, at the end of the extension trail to Arch Point. The ocean lies far below. A large sea rock rising out of the ocean just off the shore. <br /><br />Near us, deep canyons cut into the hillside, widening as they approach the sea. In the distance is a taller rounded hill. Beyond it, a low curve of land stretches out into the sea. That is Arch Point, although the rock arch for which it is named is not visible from here. <br /><br />At your feet, the soil has small dark pebbles and broken shells. Dried low grasses and crystalline ice plant cover the hill. The ice plant is a low succulent, with small red rosettes and tiny white flowers-a starburst of white thin petals with pale yellow centers. <br /><br />Nearby is a white metal structure, about 6 feet high, with a triangular frame on three spayed legs. Attached to it are a white metal box and a solar panel-a flat dark glass panel with a grid of light-colored lines. Sticking up from the frame on short rods are two white objects that look like a stack of upside down bowls.

At the very top is a rotating torpedo-shaped object with a propeller at the tip. It swivels to face into the wind. <br /><br />Nearby, mounted in a cement base, is an 18-foot-high section of a dark wooden telephone pole, about one foot in diameter. A small disk sits on top of the pole, with a black cable running down the side of the pole and to a rounded white box near a solar panel, both sitting on the concrete base. Sticking out of the pole, on alternating sides, every two feet, are 8-inch wide metal rods. <br /><br />A few feet away are four cement piers under a twisted, bent, rusted metal frame.<br /> <br />Nearby, three large black plastic cylinders, with spigots on top, sit side by side. Behind them is a pile of black hoses.<br />",

These cliffs, their numerous caves, and the rest of Santa Barbara Island's coastline and neighboring islets are home to 13 different species of nesting seabirds and shorebirds. Ashy storm-petrels, Brandt's cormorants, Cassin's auklets, pigeon guillemots, black oystercatchers, and one of the world's largest colonies of Scripps's murrelets all make their home here.<br /> <br /> Santa Barbara Island, the other Channel Islands, and all of their associated islets and offshore rocks comprise one of the largest breeding centers on the west coast for seabirds and shorebirds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, as well as the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters surrounding them, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> However, the island's isolation was not able to protect some species of seabirds from human impacts. The destruction of native vegetation, importing of non-native species, gathering of eggs, disturbance of rookeries, and the spread of pesticides in the marine environment have all been detrimental.<br /> <br /> During the 1960s, the pesticide DDT nearly caused the extinction of the California brown pelican as a breeding species on the west coast of the United States. In 1970, only 552 nesting attempts were made on Anacapa Island (the largest colony on the West coast of the United States) and just one chick survived. On October 13, 1970, the brown pelican was listed as an endangered species.<br /> <br /> Cassin's auklets were once so abundant on Santa Barbara Island that in 1863 it was recorded that \"they had undermined almost every part of the soft, earthy surface with their burrows.\" Between 1897 and 1908, cats were introduced to the island, and by 1911, it was reported that the breeding colony had been entirely abandoned. To make matters even worse, the cats devastated the island's large Scripps's murrelet colony as well-biologists found only one egg.<br /> <br /> Today, these species are gradually recovering now that their isolated island home is protected within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of the island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of southern California's seabird populations.<br /> <br /> On Santa Barbara Island, these efforts have focused on restoring seabird nesting habitat, removing feral cats and non-native vegetation, revegetating with native plants, installing nest boxes, and closing areas to protect nesting seabirds.<br /> <br /> The most notable results of these efforts have been the successful recovery of the California brown pelican and its removal from the endangered species list in 2009, and Santa Barbara Island once more supporting the largest number of breeding seabirds on any of the Channel Islands.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a fairly flat plateau, near a rounded hillside called North Peak, at a branch on the Arch Point Trail. On a clear day, there are views of the ocean to the east and west. A narrow trail heads northwest, dropping below the North Peak hill and then heading north toward Elephant Seal Cove, a tan-colored rocky shoreline point that curves to the north. Elephant Seal Cove Trail is a loop trail. If you continue southward on that trail you will re-connect with the Arch Point Trail south of here, in the saddle between North Peak and Signal Peak. <br /><br />The ground around you is mostly bare and speckled with bird droppings, scattered feathers, and small dried twigs. A few scrubby bushes and low plants are seen in patches. Downslope, to the east and west, grasses and scrub brush are thicker. Circling above you are white sea gulls, with dark wings and tails. Their calls-a scratchy, hoarse mix of \"aow\" and \"ah-ah-ah\" sounds-are continuous. <br />",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Mirounga angustirostris</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The northern elephant seal, <em>Mirounga angustirostris</em>, is the second largest seal in the world. It is surpassed only by its relative the southern elephant seal. Due to its unique body structure, this mammal is an excellent swimmer and diver. Male elephant seals can be easily identified by their large proboscis, which resembles an elephant’s trunk (and is the source of their name). This impressive pinniped relies upon the Channel Islands National Park as an important part of its life cycle. San Miguel, Santa Barbara, and Santa Rosa islands all provide critical habitat. <sup>4, 7</sup></p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Populations of northern elephant seals in the U.S. and Mexico are derived from a few hundred individuals. This small group managed to maintain a foothold in Mexico, despite the fact that by the end of the 1800's they were nearly hunted to extinction for their blubber. <sup>7</sup></li> <li>Pups are nursed for about a month and can gain as much as 360 pounds in that time. <sup>7</sup></li> <li>It is estimated that the adult male northern elephant seal can weigh up to 5,000 pounds. The female, on the other hand, weighs about a third of the male, which is a dramatic example of sexual dimorphism, or physical size difference between the sexes of a species. <sup>7</sup></li> <li>Northern elephant seals dive almost continuously during the 6 to 8 months they spend at sea. They dive to depths of 300-800 meters and dives can last up to 2 hours. The deepest dive recorded was over a mile. <sup>7</sup></li> <li>Great white sharks and killer whales prey on northern elephant seals. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Elephant seals are the only known animals capable of filling collapsed lungs. Their lungs collapse during dives. The surfactant/lubricant responsible for this ability is being researched at the Scripps Institute in San Diego for the potential benefit to premature human babies with lung problems. <sup>3</sup></li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Northern elephant seals are large and imposing, with significant differences in size and shape between sexes (sexual dimorphism). In both sexes, the body is long and robust, and the neck very thick. Adult males may grow to over 13 feet in length and weigh up to 5,000 pounds while females are smaller, growing up to 10 feet and weighing up to 1,700 pounds.</p> <p>Mature adult males have an unmistakable large and fleshy appendage on their snout called a proboscis. The proboscis is inflatable;when relaxed, it hangs down in front of the mouth and when inflated, it resembles the trunk of an elephant and is the origin of the species' common name. Males begin developing this enlarged nose, or proboscis, at sexual maturity (about three to five years of age) and it is fully developed by seven to nine years.</p> <p>Northern elephant seals are uniformly grey, tan, or brown but color generally begins to fade after the annual molt. Many bulls become pale in the face, proboscis, and head with increasing age. The chest shield, proboscis, and certain areas of the face are often pink. Pups are born with a woolly black lanugo (downy hair) that is shed at about 3 weeks of age to reveal a silver-grey coat, similar to that of adults at about the time of weaning (28 days). Within a year, the coat will turn silvery brown. <sup>1, 7</sup></p> <p>Northern elephant seals are in the family <em>Phocidae,</em> the true seals. They lack external ear flaps and move on land by flopping on their bellies.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Northern elephant seals are found in the coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of Alaska down to Baja California. Males and females make separate biannual foraging migrations. Males journey north to the Aleutian Islands and the Gulf of Alaska, whereas females travel further west to the open ocean. The total linear distance migrated by these animals each year has been recorded at 12,800 miles. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> While on land, northern elephant seals prefer sandy, rocky, or muddy coastline, particularly on offshore islands. They typically aggregate in large groups while on land. These animals spend only 10% of their time on land, returning to reproduce and molt. The other 90% is spent in the water, diving and foraging for food, with only 11% of this time spent at the surface. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Northern elephant seals spend 90% of their lives in the water in order to feed. During their foraging migrations, they dive into the water repeatedly and continuously to find food, never stopping to rest or sleep for months at a time. Northern elephant seals are exceptional divers.—sometimes diving deeper than 4900 feet and remaining submerged for 1-2 hours. Males feed near the eastern Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska, and females feed further south, in the offshore waters of Washington and Oregon. The species eat squid, octopus, Pacific hake and other boney fishes, various cartilaginous fishes, and jawless fishes. Females feed on squid in the mesopelagic zone, which is below 650 feet it is surmised to avoid their predators.Males do not feed during breeding season. <sup>3</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The breeding season occurs from December through March. Each winter elephant seals arrive at their breeding beaches in Mexico and California. Males are the first to arrive, and they fight each other to establish dominance. During this time, dominant males will often inflate their noses and produce a noise that sounds like a drum to warn lesser males away. Females soon arrive and associate with dominant males. Several days after coming onto the beaches, the females give birth to the pups they have been carrying since last year. Pups weigh 75 pounds or more and are about four feet in length. The pups nurse for about 28 days, generally gaining about 10 pounds a day. At this time females will mate with one or more of the dominant males and then return to sea. For the next two months, weaned pups, called \"weaners<ins cite=\"mailto:Douglas%20Simpson\" datetime=\"2013-07-24T08:48\">\"</ins><del cite=\"mailto:Douglas%20Simpson\" datetime=\"2013-07-24T08:48\">,\"</del>remain on rookery beaches, venturing into the water for short periods of time, perfecting their swimming and feeding abilities. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Northern elephant seals are not presently endangered. At one time, however, this species was thought to have been hunted to extinction. They were presumed extinct by the 1880's, after being exploited by hunters and whalers seeking to use the animals' thick layer of blubber as an oil source. A few animals were then discovered in 1892 which were captured and killed for scientific study. Eventually, it was discovered that a population of about 20 to 100 individuals had survived. Studies have shown that all individuals of the current population, which has grown to over 170,000, are relatives of these few survivors. The population bottleneck that occurred during this time is of concern because genetic variation is reduced, creating the possibility for the population to be vulnerable to disease or reproductive failure. <sup>3</sup></p> <p>Based upon a 2009 assessment, the current population is 170,000 and is growing. The population is renowned for its remarkable growth during the 20th century, following virtual annihilation by sealers in the 19th century. In 2005, 42,589 pups were counted, an increase of 14,699 (53%) over the number observed in 1991. Total population size increased at a rate of 3% from 1991 to 2005. <sup>3</sup></p> <p>As stated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which is the world's main authority on the conservation status of species, the northern elephant seal has recovered from near extinction and population growth and is expected to continue over the coming decades. Due to its large and increasing population, expanding range and lack of foreseeable threats, the northern elephant seal is classified as Least Concern. <sup>6</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/northern-elephant-seal/\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/northern-elephant-seal/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Mirounga_angustirostris/\">http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Mirounga_angustirostris/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/328640/details\">http://eol.org/pages/328640/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=49\">http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/onms/park/Parks/SpeciesCard.aspx?pID=3&refID=1&CreatureID=49</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_elephant_seal\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_elephant_seal</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/13581/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/13581/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/pinnipeds/nelephant.php\">http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/pinnipeds/nelephant.php</a></li> <li>Marine Mammals of the World ID guide, Jefferson, Leatherwood and Webber</li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Callorhinus ursinus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> In the 1960s, northern fur seals (<em>Callorhinus ursinus</em>) successfully recolonized San Miguel Island after the local population was extirpated by hunting. San Miguel Island is now one of three American northern fur seal colonies and the southernmost breeding colony in the world. The first seals to arrive had flipper tags identifying them as being from the Pribilof or Commander Islands in the Bering Sea. Today the San Miguel colony numbers around 10,000 animals. 4 The northern fur seal's scientific name <em>Callorhinus ursinus</em> means \"bear-like,\" which reflects \"sea bear,\" the name originally given them by Europeans. Their common name alludes to the thick coat that is needed by the species for protection from the cold weather and frigid waters found in both their feeding grounds and the majority of their breeding grounds.<sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>A Northern fur seal bull will defend territory against any intruders including other bulls and even humans.<sup>5</sup></li> <li>Northern fur seal bulls can be more than 4.5 times heavier than adult females. <sup>3</sup></li> <li>Northern fur seals can spend extremely long periods in the open ocean. Before returning to the breeding colonies, many pups will remain at sea for up to 22 months. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>The northern fur seal has 300,000 hairs per square inch. <sup>2</sup></li> <li>A northern fur seal mother finds her pup by listening for its distinctive voice. <sup>5</sup></li> <li>Northern fur seals feed mainly at night, when prey species are closer to the ocean surface. <sup>5</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Beginning at birth, males are much larger than females. Adult females and sub-adults are moderate in build. Sexes are difficult to distinguish until about age 5. The neck, chest, and shoulders of adult males are greatly enlarged over those of females and sub-adults, although at the end of the breeding season males may be thin to the point of emaciation. Male pups weigh 12 pounds and grow to 385-605 pounds and seven feet in length. In comparison, female pups only weigh 10 pounds and grow to 66-110 pounds and 4.5 feet in length. <p>Adult females and sub-adults are medium to dark silver-grey above. The flanks, chest, sides, and underside of the neck are cream to tan. There are variable cream to tan colored areas on the sides and top of the muzzle, chin, and as a \"brush stroke\" running backwards under the eye. The fur of the outer part of the ear near the naked tip and the insertion is often pale. Adult males are medium grey to black, or reddish to dark brown all over. Adult males also have gray hair on the backs of their necks. The mane can have variable amounts of silver-grey or yellowish tinting on the guard hairs. Pups are born with a black pelt, which becomes dark brown with lighter coloration on the chest and belly. After 3 to 4 months, pups molt to adult female or sub-adult male coloring.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>The head of northern fur seals looks deceptively small because of the very short down-curved muzzle and small nose. The nose extends slightly beyond the mouth in females and moderately in males. Fur is absent on the top of the fore flipper and there is an abrupt look of a \"clean shaven line\" across the wrist. The hind flippers are about one-fourth of the total body length, the longest in any eared seal; they have extremely long, cartilaginous terminal flaps on all of the toes, beyond the position of the nails on the 3 central digits. <sup>6,7</sup></p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The full range of the northern fur seal extends throughout the Pacific rim from Japan to the Channel Islands of California, although the main breeding colonies are in the Pribilof and Commander Islands in the Bering Sea. Smaller breeding grounds exist on the Kuril Islands North of Japan, Robben Island in the Sea of Okhotsk, and on San Miguel Island. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Northern fur seals are pelagic, spending most of their lives in the open ocean and only using certain offshore islands for pupping and breeding. They rarely come ashore except to breed or pup and are almost never seen on mainland beaches unless they are sick. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Northern fur seal diet is well known from their range in the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean. They are carnivores that feed primarily at night without chewing their food;they swallow it whole or in large chunks. Northern fur seals eat a wide variety of small schooling fishes and squids. Diet composition varies between the six major breeding islands and changes during their annual migration. Sixty-three species of fishes and squids have been identified as part of the northern fur seal diet throughout their range. In the Bering Sea, northern fur seals primarily consume walleye pollock, squid, salmon, Pacific sandlance, northern smooth tongue, and Pacific herring. Between Alaska and California the primary prey species are northern anchovy, Pacific herring, squid, capelin, Pacific sandlance, Pacific whiting, salmon, Pacific saury, and various species of rockfish. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Northern fur seals often return to the rookery of their birth. Adult males establish territories in late May to early June and aggressively guard and herd 40 or more females. Pregnant females arrive at the rookeries in June and give birth one or two days later to a single pup. . The initial bonding of the female and pup is crucial;the female and pup must learn to recognize each other's smell and \"voice\" in order to find each other in the rookery after long periods of separation. Once the female and pup have bonded and nursed for 5-10 days, the female comes into estrus and is ready to mate once more, usually with the male in whose territory she gave birth.</p> <p>Once they have mated, females returns to the ocean for their first feeding trip after fasting for up to 10 days. During the next four months, nursing females make repeated trips to sea to feed, spending 7 to 10 days at sea and returning to land to spend time nursing their pups. Females deliver fat-rich milk to their pups, which depend on their mother for food until they are approximately 4 months old. Females, juveniles of both sexes, and pups begin to leave the islands in October to migrate south for the winter. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The northern fur seal is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species as Vulnerable. Referring to the population of animals in the Pribilof Islands, the IUCN states that \"[they have] experienced a significant, steep decline in recent years and [have] failed to recover despite the cessation of commercial harvesting. Although the global population is still over a million animals, the current downward trend in abundance remains a mystery.\" <sup>3</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li>http:// <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/pinnipeds/northernfurseal.htm\">www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/pinnipeds/northernfurseal.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/northern-fur-seal\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/northern-fur-seal</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/3590/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/3590/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_Island\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_Island</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/pinnipeds/northfs.php\">http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/pinnipeds/northfs.php</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_fur_seal\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_fur_seal</a></li> <li>Marine mammals of the world, Jefferson, T.A., S.

Other than a surface supply from Water Canyon, tapped by the Mores in the 1870s, developed sources of water on the island include only a remote spring and a system of wells located near the ranch complex.<br /> <br /> The More family developed a water system in the early 1870s to supply the ranch complex. A dam in Water Canyon, apparently no longer existing, impounded water that was delivered in riveted iron pipe for a distance of two miles.<br /> <br /> A circular, rock-lined reservoir at the ranch complex appears to have been fed by this line as well. Remnants of the original pipeline remain in Water Canyon, and the old reservoir is a landmark near the Russ Vail house, east of the south end of the eucalyptus windbreak. Part of the reservoir wall has been destroyed, and vegetation, including a eucalyptus tree, is encroaching.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers developed most of its cattle watering systems in the vicinity of the main ranch and Carrington Point. On the south side of the island, one small system was developed at Clapp Spring. While the island was well watered by natural sources (perennial streams), these sites needed development because of concentrations of cattle and lack of natural sources.<br /> <br /> The major source of water for ranch operations is located in the appropriately named Windmill Canyon west of the ranch house. At an unknown date before the 1930s someone drilled or dug a well and installed a windmill and a redwood storage tank. Water from this reliable source fed by gravity the ranch houses, outbuildings, and troughs in the ranch complex.<br /> <br /> For some time the Vails used a tractor or old Army vehicle on jacks to pump water from the well. Later the Vails built a pump house. As of 1984, two hand-dug wells, measuring four by four feet and 40 feet deep, were present; one was active, with a storage tank in place. In the late 1980s the NPS replaced and updated the well, windmill, and pump system. Water is piped from the sources in Windmill Canyon also to the NPS housing, campground, and main ranch residences.<br /> <br /> Clapp Spring, near the top of San Augustin Canyon, produces a fine and reliable water source. Water from the spring runs by gravity through a pipe from the springhouse at the source to a concrete watering trough on the Sierra Pablo road. No one knows who found and developed the spring. Clapp Spring allegedly got its name from an incident when its pure water cured an old cowboy's venereal disease. True or not, the water is excellent. Ranch workers bottled it in five-gallon containers for drinking water.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> </strong></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Oreothlypis celata sordida</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> This endemic subspecies of orange-crowned warbler is a small, comparatively drab warbler of shrubs and low vegetation that is found on all of the Channel Islands. It is different than other orange-crowned warbler subspecies owing to its shorter tail, longer broader bill, and darker plumage.</p> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong> <ul> <li>The orange-crowned warbler is divided into four subspecies that differ in plumage color, size, and molt patterns. The Channel Islands subspecies is the darkest green and is found only on the Channel Islands and locally along the coast of southern California and northern Baja California.</li> <li>Observant birders discover this cryptic warbler breeding in oak woodlands and giant coreopsis thickets across the islands, sometimes in astonishingly high densities.</li> <li>Typically, the orange-crowned Warbler is a ground nester, but the Channel Islands subspecies has adapted to select higher nesting sites in oak trees, giant coreopsis and lemonade bushes.</li> <li>Orange-crowned warblers are known for belting out a high-pitched trill, but males on the Channel Islands have a much more variable, melodic song than is typical of the species.</li> <li>Owing to the Channel Islands subspecies lack of a need to migrate long distances after breeding through unfamiliar terrain, (30 miles to the mainland) it has a have a much higher probability of surviving from one breeding season to the next than highly migratory populations.</li> <li>Only 45% of Alaska warblers lived one year, contrasted to 75% that lived to one year on Catalina Island.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Generally, the orange-crowned warbler is a small warbler with olive-green upper parts and faintly streaked, yellow under parts. Head has inconspicuous orange crown, broken eye-ring, and faint eye-line. Sexes are similar. What best distinguishes the Channel Islands sub-species is given by the original describer of the subspecies, C. H. Townsend (1890): \"Adult male: Entire plumage decidedly darker than <em>H. celata lutescens</em>. Feet and bill larger; wings slightly shorter. There is an appearance of grayness about the upper plumage, owing to a leaden tinge on ends of feathers. Throat and under parts slightly streaked.\"</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Research focused on orange-crowned warblers shows that the species as a whole is widely distributed, but the Channel Islands subspecies, is largely relegated to the Channel Islands because of intensive development on the nearby mainland. These warblers are one of many island endemics that have made the Channel Islands famous for their unique flora and fauna.</p> <p>Two of the largest islands – Catalina and Santa Cruz – are where long-term study sites have been established to follow the breeding activities of but the Channel Islands subspecies. The islands are in close proximity and are alike with respect to topography, habitat, and many other features. However, they differ in two key aspects: their predator community and the amount of rainfall they receive It is not known exactly where individuals that breed on the Channel Islands go after their February-June breeding season, but most leave the islands to spend their \"winters\" (July-January) on the coast of southern California and northern Baja.</p> <strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Gilbert et al. (2010) report that orange-crowned warblers on the Channel Islands prefer humid and shaded sites on slopes, in canyons gullies and sea-cliffs in chaparral, Torrey pine, coastal bluff and coastal sage scrub vegetation types.On Santa Rosa Island, orange-crowned warblers preferred coastal sage scrub, grassland and chaparral and avoided closed-cone pine and oak woodland.<br /> <br /> <strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Most warblers, including but the Channel Islands subspecies, exhibit migratory tendencies, taking advantage of the spring flush of insects in temperate zones, gleaning insects off leaves. Their diet includes insects and spiders, but it also includes seeds and fruit. Orange-crowned warblers rely on insects like caterpillars to feed their young. Astudy by the Catalina Conservancy, shows that but the Channel Islands subspecies consumes lesser quantities of fruit and nectar.<br />   <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Like many members of its genus, orange-crowned warblers are ground nesters with cup style nests. However, but the Channel Islands subspecies frequently nest off the ground ad well, mostly in oak trees, lemonade berry bushes, and giant coreopsis plants. The islands where off-ground nesting occurs are generally free from visually-oriented nest predators like jays, and these nests tend to have higher success than ones on the ground, which are more susceptible to snake and mammal predation.</p> <p>Average clutch sizes around 3 to 6 are typical. The orange-crowned warblers incubate their eggs for approximately 12 days. Once the eggs hatch, both the male and the female provide parental care to the offspring. They provision food in the nest for 11 days (nestling stage) and out of the nest for upwards of 2 months (fledgling stage) while the young grow and develop the necessary skills to fly and find food on their own. If at some point a predator finds the nest and eats the eggs/nestlings, the pair will usually start over again and build a brand new nest, hoping for better luck the next time.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The orange-crowned warbler, <em>Vermivora celata</em>, are a species of Least Concern by the IUCN Redlist. This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for \"Vulnerable\" under the range size criterion The population trend appears to be increasing, and the population size is extremely large, For these reasons the species is evaluated as \"Least Concern.\"</p> <strong>Additional Information</strong><br />   <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/orange-crowned_warbler/lifehistory\">All About Birds</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/153/_/Orange-crowned_Warbler.aspx\">What Bird</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://learning.colostate.edu/courses/ecology/lhe/index.html\">Colorado State University Study</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106009088/0\">The ICUN Red List of Threatened Species</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/migratorybirds/featured_birds/default.cfm?id=302\">The Smithsonian National Zoological Park</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Empidonax difficilis insulicola</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> A small yellowish flycatcher of shaded forests and streamsides, the Pacific-slope flycatcher is found throughout the Pacific Coast states, west of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges. The population of Pacific slope flycatcher breeding on the Channel Islands off southern California may actually be best treated as a distinct subspecies. It is larger than mainland populations, has a longer bill, a paler chest, slightly different vocalizations, and differs genetically.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The New World family of flycatchers, <em>Tyrannidae</em>, includes the Pacific-slope flycatcher is p, and 365 other species distributed over the Americas from the Canadian tree limit to Patagonia.<br />  </li> <li>The name <em>tyrannidae</em>, meaning tyrant, reflects the species pugnacity toward crows, hawks, and other large birds which they harass with great determination.<br />  </li> <li>The scientific name <em>difficilis</em>, which in the Latin is appropriate as it means \"difficult \". This species is extremely difficult to distinguish from the similar Cordilleran flycatcher.<br />  </li> <li>These two above species were formerly considered a single species known as the western flycatcher.<br />  </li> <li>Flycatchers characteristically feed by darting after insects from an advantageous perch.<br />  </li> <li>A group of flycatchers has many collective nouns, including an \"outfield\", \"swatting\", \"zapper\", and \"zipper\" of flycatchers.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Pacific-slope flycatchers on the Channel Islands are larger than individuals of mainland population. The species in the park also has a longer bill, a paler chest, slightly different vocalizations, and differs genetically.1 The Pacific slope flycatcher, Empidonax difficilis, found on the mainland has olive-brown upper parts, yellow throat and belly; and an olive-gray breast. Eye-ring is white and elongated. Its wings are dark with two pale bars. Bill is long with dark upper mandible and bright yellow lower mandible. Sexes are similar.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The island subspecies is considered a summer resident on Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa. Nests have been on the north facing slopes of West Anacapa. Middle and East Anacapa do not have the trees for their preferred nesting habitat. (Collins personal communication 2010) Pacific-slope flycatchers are spring and fall transients on the other two park islands (Jones, Collins, and Stefani 1999). While there are occasionally spring and fall transients of other Empidonax Flycatchers, the most common of these flycatchers is the Pacific-slope flycatcher. Transient sightings of other species of Empidonax Flycatchers are more common on Santa Barbara Island than on the northern park islands (Jones, Collins and Stefani 1999). These flycatchers migrate for the winter, probably to Mexico. Since the different Empidonax Flycatchers look so similar in the field, exact information about this subspecies's winter location is not available.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The Pacific-slope Flycatcher inhabits either coniferous or deciduous forests. In its range it enters mixed woods, douglas fir forests, redwood forests, and many other wooded environments including Riparian woodlands. A recent study found Pacific-slope flycatchers on Santa Rosa to prefer pine, chaparral, woodland and riparian habitats.<br /> <br /> <strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Like most flycatchers, Pacific-slope flycatchers are insect eaters and they can be seen watching from a perch, at any level within shady parts of the forest, and then flying out to catch insects in the air. Individuals also capture some prey (such as caterpillars and spiders) from foliage or twigs while hovering.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Nesting habitat in more open and drier habitats on Channel Islands for the distinct island flycatcher occurs among eucalyptus shade trees or in oak clumps in canyon bottoms, foraging over coastal scrub and opuntia cactus (Johnson 1980). Nests are placed on cliffs, earth banks, tree branch crotches, or building ledges, or in tree cavities, often along streams or near seeps or springs.</p> <p>Pacific-slope flycatchers breed once annually from mid-April through mid-July. On the average four eggs are laid per season with hatching occuring from 13 to 16 days. The female alone incubates the eggs but both sexes bring food to the fledgling young and remove fecal sacs. Typically, chicks will fledge within 14 to 16 days.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> While long term population trends have not been quantified, Pacific-slope flycatchers are a species of Least Concern according to the IUCN Redlist. They are not listed under the U.S. Endangered Species act or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. They are listed and protected under the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Pacific-slope flycatchers on Santa Rosa were found to exist at high densities over a 15-year period, with some annual variation in abundance. 8 Breeding Bird Survey data show no significant declines of this species between 1966 and 1996.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pacific-slope_Flycatcher/lifehistory\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pacific-slope_Flycatcher/lifehistory</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/171/overview/Pacific-slope_Flycatcher.aspx\">http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/171/overview/Pacific-slope_Flycatcher.aspx</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://ibc.lynxeds.com/ssp/pacific-slope-flycatcher-empidonax-difficilis-insulicola\">http://ibc.lynxeds.com/ssp/pacific-slope-flycatcher-empidonax-difficilis-insulicola</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/flycatcher.aspx\">http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/flycatcher.aspx</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.planetofbirds.com/passeriformes-tyrannidae-pacific-slope-flycatcher-empidonax-difficilis\">http://www.planetofbirds.com/passeriformes-tyrannidae-pacific-slope-flycatcher-empidonax-difficilis</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/917414/details\">http://eol.org/pages/917414/details</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.

The entrance, located in 30 feet of water, reaches upward 160 feet above the water level to its ceiling, and is almost 100 feet wide. A large boat can be taken into its entrance with room to spare. The name \"painted\" is derived from naturally occurring colors created by various rock types, lichens and algae. Marine organisms, harbor seals, sea lions, and several species of birds inhabit this cave.<br /> <br /> <b>Ethnographic Island Place Names</b><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

The trees stand out as a landmark on the scenic beach at Cuyler Harbor.<br /> <br /> Nevertheless, San Miguel Island did play a role in Mutiny On the Bounty. In 1935 producer Irving Thalberg put his talent to work on one of the greatest sea stories ever filmed: Mutiny On the Bounty. To film it, he used several locations. A camera crew went to Tahiti twice for the crowd shots and scenic background. The major scenes were shot in Catalina, and for rough seas he used the waters off San Miguel Island. He sent out an old 200 foot three-master with the outside reworked to match the period and shot footage for a storm sequence, but the pitch and toss of the angry ocean was not convincing. Then someone suggested that they build a smaller model of the Bounty so that the contrast with the large waves would produce more drama. The result was the Baby Bounty, an 18-foot exact replica, just big enough to hold two men to steer it. It was towed to sea by the mother ship, and all the crew was sworn to secrecy so that the public would never know the difference. Finding heavy seas off San Miguel was no problem, and they began to shoot; but the rough seas soon separated Baby from the larger Bounty and the small ship could not even be found. Afraid to call the Coast Guard because it would get into the newspapers, Thalberg hired several private ships to comb the waters. Two nights later the Baby Bounty and its two occupants were rescued.<br /> <br /> Thalberg was particularly alarmed by this event because he had already lost an assistant cameraman while they were shooting a scene on a barge. The barge, W T Co #3, was a good-sized affair with a replica of the aft end of the Bounty built on one end of it. By taking on ballast at the other end, they could cause the partial replica to tip up and down as if it was about to sink. The cameraman, Glen Strong, was working with his camera on a tripod when the barge was suddenly swamped by a wave that washed his equipment and some valuable footage overboard. In attempting to save the equipment, Strong was drowned. Mrs. Lester recalls some Tahitian scenes being shot on the island, but this was not part of the original production schedule. Using San Miguel's waters for the rough-water shots helped add realism in the production of a memorable sea film that won the Academy Award for 1935's Best Picture of the Year.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Phalacrocorax pelagicus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> This seabird is a small member of the cormorant family and is also known as Baird's Cormorant. Analogous to other smallish cormorants, it is also occasionally called the pelagic shag. Being one of the least social or gregarious cormorants, Channel Island National Park, due to its isolation from the mainland, provides an ideal environment for its breeding on all five channel islands. This seabird lives year round along the coasts of the Pacific; during winter it can also be found in the open ocean.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Their North American breeding range extends from Alaska to the Baja Pacific Islands in Mexico.</li> <li>Pelagic cormorants are the smallest of the North American cormorants.</li> <li>During the breeding season the skin under their eyes turns a vivid magenta.</li> <li>The pelagic cormorant is among the least gregrious or social of the cormorants, nesting on steep cliffs along rocky and exposed shorelines, either in loose colonies or far from nearest neighbors.</li> <li>A typical nest has between three and five eggs.</li> <li>The pelagic cormorant uses its own guano to solidify its nest materials and to cement its nest to the cliff face.</li> <li>They prefer to forage near kelp beds or among rocks.</li> <li>The feet of these expert divers are located far back on the body to give them forward thrust underwater.</li> <li>Pelagic cormorants can dive as deep as 100 feet.</li> <li>They can spring straight up out of the water into the air and fly.</li> <li>Pelagic Cormorants are not naturally water-proof and must spend time preening and grooming their feathers with oil collected from a gland at the base of the tail.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The pelagic cormorant is the smallest and most delicate of the north Pacific cormorants. It is slender in appearance, with a long tail, a slim dark bill, and a head that is no wider than its neck. When in flight, the head and neck are held out in a straight profile parallel to the water. Basic plumage is black with a glossy iridescent green and violet-bronze on the body, and violet-purple on the neck. Breeding plumage is similar to basic plumage but also includes white flank patches, red facial skin at the base of bill, double head crests, and white plumes along the neck and upper-back region. Immature birds are dark brown, with the same proportions as adults. Other coastal cormorants are bulkier, with slower wingbeats.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The pelagic cormorant's range extends from the Chukchi and Bering Seas south along the North American Pacific coast to Baja California, and along the Asian coast to southern China. The breeding range extends from north Alaska to the Aleutian Islands and south along the North American Pacific coast to Baja California, as well as, from the Bering Sea to Kurki Island and north Honshu, Japan. Its wintering range is from the Pribilof Islands to the Aleutian Islands and south along the North American Pacific coast to Baja California, as well as from the south Bering Sea along the eastern shores of Kamchatka and south to Hong Kong.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The pelagic cormorant in central and southern California breeds on the rocky shores and cliffs along the coast, but substantial colonies breed on San Miguel, Santa Barbara, Anacapa, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz islands from March to August. It is rarely seen farther than a few kilometers from land. As with all cormorants, due to their vestigal preen gland, their plumage is not waterproof. Thus, the birds return to a safe roost after foraging to preen and dry their feathers, typically adopting a spread-winged posture.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Cormorants have high energy needs for swimming and flying, and they cannot fast for long periods or store much body fat. The pelagic cormorants energy needs are further exacerbated due to its small size, which demands that its roosting and nesting sites are in close proximity to its foraging sites. The Pelagic Cormorant feeds mainly on nonschooling medium sized fish, but also consumes invertebrates, maine worms and crustaceans. It forages near shore along rocky substrate, and in California it is frequently seen along the fringes of kelp forests. It feeds only during the day and for short periods of time. To catch prey it dives deeply; birds have been taken in fishing nets at depths of 180 feet. This species' small size enables it to spring directly from the water, rather than paddling along the surface as other cormorants are required.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> About 25,000,pelagic cormorants breed along the Pacific coast of North America, excluding Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. About 60% of these are found in California. The initiation of pair formation and nest building varies geographically and relies heavily upon food supply. The southern range usually experiences earlier inititation dates, but on average breeding plumage is usually seen in February and nest building commences shortly thereafter.</p> <p>The male will select a nest site and start nest construction and is then assisted by the female. Nest sites may be used for successsive years but may also change between years. Nest sites are usually on narrow ledges on steep rocky cliffs. Nesting material consists of mainly grass and seaweed, and material will be added to the nest until the chicks fledge. Nests are usually conpact and saucer shape, and guano acts as a cement to hold it together and to the cliff. The nest is repaired and improved in each season if need be; it can thus grow up to 5 ft., but it usually does not grow from year to year.</p> <p>Egg laying usually takes place from early to late spring. Eggs are incubated between the feet and belly, and both sexes share incubation, brooding, and feeding duties. The clutch can range from 3 to 7 eggs but an average clutch is 3 to 4 eggs. Incubation lasts 3 to 4 weeks.</p> <p>At hatching, the young weigh somewhat more than an ounce and are naked, but they soon grow sooty-grey down feathers. In normal years, all young of a typical clutch may be raised successfully and fledge at 40-50 days after hatching. They reach sexual maturity at two years of age, and a maximum age of almost 18 years has been recorded in the wild.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Birds that breed from Washington southward are permanent residents, but birds breeding farther north migrate to winter in northern Washington waters. Breeding colonies disperse but pelagic cormorants south of the Monterey Bay area do not migrate but continue to forage along the rocky coastal areas following the most abundant prey.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Despite the fact that the population trend for the pelagic cormorant appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for vulnerable status. This numerous and widespread species has a very large range and is not considered threatened by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). The bulk of its population is found in the relatively inaccessible waters of the Bering Sea region; about 50,000 each breed in the Kuril Islands, the Bering Sea islands, and the U.S. state of Alaska and its offshore islands (including the Aleuts). Regardless, local populations may be all but wiped out temporarily by oil spills, and on a larger scale competition with gillnet fisheries and drowning in such nets is putting a limit to its stocks. The impact of El Nino on weather and food may also affect the local populations as previously evidenced by historical records. Intrusion in nesting areas by fishermen, kayakers and divers can also be disruptive. Fortunately, most breeding sites in southern California, including Channel Islands National Park are protected areas for this bird.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/nature/pelagic-cormorant.htm\">Bird Life International</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/nature/pelagic-cormorant.htm\">Birds of North America</a></li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Falco peregrinus anatum</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Peregrine falcons (<em>Falco peregrinus</em>) have one of the widest distributions of any falcon species, occurring on all continents except Antarctica. The American subspecies, , <em>F. p. anatum</em>, inhabits western north America, from Mexico to Canada and Alaska. This falcon species was a resident on the Channel Islands in years past, but largely disappeared due to harassment, shooting, egg stealing, and reproductive failure caused by organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT. However, this species has made a comeback due to reintroduction efforts. Peregrines were reintroduced on the islands in the 1980s and as of 2013, there are 45 active peregrine falcons on the eight Channel Islands.</p> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong> <ul> <li>The peregrine falcon is one of the most widespread birds in the world. It is found on all continents except Antarctica and on many oceanic islands.</li> <li>The name \"peregrine\" means wanderer, and the peregrine falcon has one of the longest migrations of any North American bird.</li> <li>People have trained falcons for hunting for over a thousand years, and the peregrine falcon was always one of the most prized birds.</li> <li>Formerly called the \"duck hawk\", peregrines are formidable hunters that prey on other birds (and bats) in mid-flight.</li> <li>Peregrines hunt from above and, after sighting their prey, drop into a steep, swift dive, or stooop, that can top 200 miles an hour.</li> </ul> <br /> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> This raptor is identified by its long, pointed wings and a long tail. Its shape as well as its size makes it stand out—the long primary feathers give the peregrine a long-winged shape. As with most raptors, males are smaller than females, so peregrines can overlap with large female merlins or small male gyrfalcons. Adults are blue-gray above with barred underparts and a dark head with thick sideburns. Juveniles are heavily marked, with vertical streaks instead of horizontal bars on the breast. Despite considerable age-related and geographic variation, an overall steely, barred look remains. <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The peregrine is found on all continents except Antarctica and on many oceanic islands. Within Channel Islands National Park, a 2011 survey revealed that peregrine falcons are found on all five islands in the park. Although the numbers are not large, historic evidence shows that the peregrine was sparsely distributed on the islands. Owing to factors relating to the imperative of protecting nesting sites, peregrines tend remain in the Channel Islands for life.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Habitat for the peregrine is closely associated with the nest territory and their foraging areas. On the Channel Islands this generally would generally include coastal strands, bodies of water, and shorelines.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Foraging areas are associated with the nest territory. This generally includes coastal strands, bodies of water, shorelines, open grasslands, marshes and wooded areas. Peregrines hunt in the air, and the usual method of hunting prey is by attacking flying birds from above or chasing them from behind (Recovery Plan, 1982). Prey consumed by California peregrines is highly varied, nevertheless, they feed primarily on other birds, such as songbirds, shorebirds, ducks, and, in urban areas, starlings and pigeons. Flying high above their intended prey, peregrines will \"stoop\" or dive and strike in mid-air, killing the prey with a sharp blow. At no nest sites do peregrines concentrate on a single prey or few species. Peregrines are generalists which hunt the large variety of prey that occur in their home range (Walton, 1997).</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Generally speaking, peregrines are monogamous, mate for life, and breed in the same territory their entire life. On the Channel Islands, pairs remain in the area around the nest cliff enough from July to January (i.e. the non-breeding season) to maintain possession of the nest site and drive out competitors (Walton, 1997).</p> <p>Peregrines do not make stick nests; although they may use old common raven (<em>Corvus corax</em>) or great horned owl (<em>Bubo virginianus</em>) stick nests. The cliff usually has a small cave or overhung ledge large enough to contain three or four full-grown nestlings. Several holes or ledges that can be used in alternate years are apparently not an absolute requirement but probably increase the suitability of the cliff (Recovery Plan, 1982).</p> <p>Peregrine falcons generally reach breeding maturity at 2 years of age. Usually, the male arrives at a nesting site and begins a series of aerial acrobatic displays to attract a mate. An average clutch of four eggs is laid in the spring, hatching about a month later. Peregrines vigorously defend their nests, although they may abandon them if severely or continuously harassed.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The use of DDT as a pesticide during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s resulted in a precipitous decline of peregrine falcons in North America. During this period of DDT use, eggshell thinning and nesting failures were widespread in peregrine falcons, and in some areas, successful reproduction virtually ceased.</p> <p>As a result, there was a slow but drastic decline in the number of peregrine falcons in most areas of its range in North America. By the time peregrine falcons were listed as endangered in 1970, the eastern population of the American peregrine falcon was gone and the populations in the west had declined by as much as 90 percent below historical levels. By 1975, there were only 324 known nesting pairs of American peregrine falcons.</p> <p>An aggressive recovery program began in 1974 and resulted in over 6,000 falcons being reintroduced to the wild. Now there are about 3,000 breeding pairs of American peregrine falcons in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Territory occupancy, nest success, and productivity are all at levels considered normal for healthy peregrine falcon populations.</p> <p>In August 1999, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the American peregrine falcon from the list of endangered and threatened species, marking one of the most dramatic successes of the Endangered Species Act. Post-delisting monitoring will continue until 2015.</p> <p>Surveys in 2013 recorded a total of 45 peregrine falcon territories on the eight Channel Islands, and 27 of those territories had eggs or chicks by the end of April 2013. In 2013 there were 5 territories on Anacapa, 16 on Santa Cruz, 13 on Santa Rosa, 9 on San Miguuel, and 3 on Santa Barbara (Sharpe 2013).</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/Peregrinefactsheet.pdf\">Peregrine Falcon Fact Sheet, US Fish and Wildlife</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Peregrine_Falcon/lifehistory\">All About Birds</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=19000\">Comrack, Lyann A. and Randi J.

Once the historic workshop, also designed in Mission Revival style white stucco, this long rectangular building has a gable roof with terra cotta shingles. Two perpendicular gable roof sections that look like garage fronts frame the east and west ends. Four windows and three doors all with green trim and panes alternate across the front face of the building while benches line the walkway. A picnic area is directly in front of the building.<br />The entrance to the visitor center is on the west end and has interior exhibits, a passport station and houses the original Fresnel lens. The east end of the building is now a bunkhouse and storage area for staff.<br />Outside on the east corner is a welcome kiosk and the main trailhead.

    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a dirt road that runs next to a row of eucalyptus trees. Tucked into a break in the row of trees are pig pens. Grass grows around and inside of the pig pens. The entrance is through a tall wooden frame, made of two upright posts with a long horizontal beam connecting them at the top. Within this frame is a chain link fence gate that is secured to one post, with a sliding metal bar extended across the other post. On the gate is a rusted metal sign that is illegible. A 6 foot tall chain link fence runs along the front and sides of the front pen. The back fence also has barbed wire along the top, creating an enclosure about 20 feet wide by 20 feet deep.<br /><br />In the middle of this back fence is a second chain link gate that leads to other pens. There are small pens on either side, each surrounded by a broken wood rail fence. In between these two pens is an alley, or chute, with a wood plank flooring, that leads to a low wooden shed with a roof covered with bent and rusty sheets of metal. <br /><br />Through the break in the trees, the pig pen has an ocean view, of Bechers Bay, in the distance.<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Cepphus columba</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The pigeon guillemot is a North Pacific seabird belonging to the auk family which includes guillemots, puffins, auklets, and murrelets. The Channel Islands National Park, owing to its isolation and protected environment, provides ideal habitat for the pigeon guillemot breeding colonies. The park's generally abundant food sources are ideally suited for a bird who dives directly to the sea bed, probing rocky recesses and vegetation with their bills for fish and invertebrates. This bird is found along rocky shores in small colonies or isolated pairs. The pigeon guillemot nests in burrows or under rocks, often on small islands that provide protection from predators.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Pigeon guillemots have an extensive breeding range along the western North America coast from Alaska to California.</li> <li>This seabird can scale vertical rock faces by flapping its wings and using its sharp claws.</li> <li>Pigeon guillemots dive into the water to feed on fish and invertebrates.</li> <li>The usually lay their eggs in rocky crevices and cavities along cliffs.</li> <li>Pigeon guillemots will lay one to two eggs.</li> <li>They usually return to their natal colony to breed.</li> <li>Both parents incubate a single egg.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The pigeon guillemots are stocky birds with rounded wings and bodies, and straight bills. In breeding plumage, adults are solid black with white wing patches. The bird's striking red-orange legs and mouth lining play a role in courtship during breeding season. Non-breeding adults and juveniles have white bellies and are mottled gray-and-white above. In all plumages, the birds have bright red feet.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Pigeon guillemots are distributed in subtidal and intertidal marine habitats and on rocky shores from the Russian Pacific coast, to Alaska and down through California. The widest distribution, (as shown on the map), is in the northwestern part of the North American continent. Santa Barbara Island is at the southern edge of their range. Adults are present from February to late August on the Channel Islands.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The pigeon guillemot needs rocky, undisturbed shoreline for nesting, and access to nearby marine waters for feeding. It feeds in shallower waters than most auks, puffins, or murrelets. Although it is known to dive to depths of greater than 150 feet, it feeds best in waters of only 35 to 65 feet in depth.The pigeon guillemot, when not feeding, often rests on sea cliff ledges, or on the surface of coastal waters. By vigorous flapping of its wings combined with the use of its sharp claws on its webbed feet, it often scales vertical rock faces.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> During the breeding season, the pigeon guillemot subsists largely on small fish. It pursues and captures fish in water near coast or island shores. Besides fish, it is also reported to eat small crabs and shrimp as well as mollusks, crustaceans, and polychaete worms. It is reported that parents bring young an average of 16 food loads a day, typically bringing a single fish each time.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Pigeon guillemots nests in cliff crevices and talus slopes, or occasionally in burrows. They also use human-made structures such as pipes, culverts, or crevices in wharves. Eggs are laid within these crevices on bare soil or rock, or sometimes on a loose bed of shells and pebbles. The guillemot is monogamous. It generally forms loose colonies with a few pairs dispersed over suitable nesting habitat, but occasionally a pair will nest solitarily. Clutches usually contain two eggs with an incubation period of 30-32 days. Parents share incubation duties by trading off every 1-2 hours. Nestlings are semiprecocial and downy; nestling period lasts 35-45 days. Fledglings leave the nest at about 90% adult weight. On the Channel Islands, they lay eggs from mid-April through mid-June, with a peak in early May. Chicks hatch from mid-May through mid-July, with a peak in early June. Young fledge from late June through late August, with a peak in mid-July.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Winter range of California's breeding population is unknown. However, individuals banded on the Farallon Islands have been recovered mostly in the north, as far as British Columbia, which suggests a northward movement.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> They readily abandon their nest if disturbed during incubation or brooding. Because they spend much time on inshore waters where oil exploration and development are centered, they are vulnerable to oil pollution. Historically, warm ocean temperatures have produced dramatic nesting failures, such as during the 1983 breeding season. The global population of this bird is estimated to be around 470,000 individual birds. It is believed unlikely that the population trends for this species will soon approach the minimum levels that could suggest a potential decline in population. Therefore, population trends for the pigeon guillemot have a present evaluation level of Least Concern.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pigeon_Guillemot/sounds\">The Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a></li> </ul>",

Today harbor seals and sea lions regularly breed on Anacapa's rocky beaches. Their protected populations are nearly recovered from centuries of slaughter.<br />  </p> <p><strong>An Ocean Park and Sanctuary</strong><br /> From this incredible overlook, one has the opportunity to gaze upon another part of the park-the marine environment. One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park, and six nautical miles around each island form Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.<br /> <br /> The Channel Islands lie within a large embayment known as the Southern California Bight-an area just below Point Conception where the California coastline turns sharply to the east. Within this area, the seafloor is composed of canyons, banks, escarpments, sea mounts, and deep basins (the Santa Cruz Basin is deeper than the Grand Canyon). Nutrient-rich waters upwelling from these depths mix and mingle with cool waters from the north (California Current) and warm southern waters (California Countercurrent), creating the Santa Barbara Gyre-a swirling eddy that circulates nutrients and supports a wealth of marine plants and animals, from giant kelp forests and blue whales to tiny crabs and plankton. Here, northern and southern species overlap, creating a transition zone between the Oregonian and Californian marine biogeographic provinces.<br /> <br /> <strong>Kelp Forests</strong><br /> The isolated islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in southern California, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of alga that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing organisms on Earth-it can grow two feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales feasting on plankton.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but also those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use toothpaste are all using a little bit of seaweed as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredient called algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine algae and plants such as kelp provide Earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the 20th century.<br /> <br /> However, with the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls, fishing regulations, research, and public education, some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> <strong>Marine Protected Areas</strong><br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provides a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 marine reserves (including two on Santa Rosa Island-around Carrington and Skunk Points), recreational fishing and commercial harvesting are prohibited; limited fishing and harvesting are allowed in two marine conservation areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.</p> <p> </p>",

Entering this area without a ranger is a violation of federal law.</strong></em><br /> <br /> Seals and sea lions can be seen from several viewpoints on San Miguel Island that can be reached on ranger-guided hikes. Northern elephant seals can even be seen on the beach at Cuyler Harbor where visitors land on the island. however, the most famous and diverse pinniped viewing location on San Miguel Island is Point Bennett.<br /> <br /> Walking to Point Bennett on the western tip of San Miguel Island requires some stamina, for it is a fifteen-mile roundtrip hike. About halfway across the island, however, there is something that will help spur you on and encourage your feet to keep moving. That something is a sound-faint at first, but gradually getting louder and louder. The noise is a sort of rumble, low and rolling. What can be making this strange sound?<br /> <br /> As you come over the rise at Point Bennett you find your answer. There are thousands of elephant seals on the beach-flipping up sand over their huge torpedo-shaped bodies, moving like globs of JELLO over the sand, and carving out territories to call their own. The originators of the noise that you have been listening to are the gigantic males with their long proboscises that give the species its name. You are witnessing a timeless ritual of which sound is just a small part.<br /> <br /> The elephant seal is one of four species of pinniped (or \"wing or feather-footed\") marine mammals that are commonly sighted at San Miguel Island. Other species include California sea lions, northern fur seals, and harbor seals. At one time, two other species were found here in abundance--Steller or northern sea lions and Guadalupe fur seals. While only an occasional male Steller sea lion has been seen since the 1980s, a few Guadalupe fur seals have occassionally pupped.<br /> <br /> Nevertheless, not only are more species sighted at this remote island than at anywhere else on the planet, but this gathering represents one of the largest congregations of wildlife in the world. Staggering populations of over 70,000 California sea lions, 5,000 northern fur seals, 50,000 northern elephant seals and 1,100 harbor seals breed and pup on the island each year.<br /> <br /> The diversity of pinnipeds is part of a larger picture of biological diversity found in the Santa Barbara Channel. San Miguel Island lies in an area of water that overlaps two currents-a cold current moving down the Pacific coast from Alaska and a warm current moving up the Pacific coast from Mexico. Those two currents meet and intermingle not only water, but many of the species associated with corresponding cold and warm currents.<br /> <br /> Islands also bring diversity by providing shelf areas where sunlight can penetrate the water, and plants, such as the giant bladder kelp, can grow. The dense kelp forests around the islands provide food and shelter for many varieties of plants and animals. Diversity is also linked to upwelling conditions that exist near San Miguel Island. Upwelling sucks cold nutrient-rich water that normally lies at the bottom of the ocean to the surface, providing food for hundreds of species.<br /> <br /> Finally, the isolation of the islands also plays a role. A beach all to themselves with no disturbance from people must be very enticing for seals and sea lions. Therefore, the Santa Barbara Channel, the islands, and Point Bennett, specifically, provide all the necessary ingredients that they need--wide sandy beaches, plenty of food, and others of their kind.<br /> <br /> Researchers from the National Marine Fisheries Service, in cooperation with the park, have been studying the seals and sea lions of San Miguel since 1968. Long-term behavior studies on marked animals provide information about reproductive behavior as well as migratory and feeding patterns. Current studies focus on population assessment and demographics, diseases, and parasites.<br /> <br /> These pinnipeds are protected by spending at least part of their lives in a national park-or are they? Some threats to these animals know no boundaries. Threats made by water pollution, plastics and debris in the ocean, gill net entanglement, oil spills, overharvesting of fisheries, toxins, and pesticides affect even isolated areas like Point Bennett. These threats can also affect people. Without protection, the spectacular rituals performed on the beaches of Point Bennett can become a thing of the past. Generations to come may only experience the grandeur of Point Bennett through stories and photographs.<br /> <br /> People can make sure pinnipeds of the park and world survive into the future. Simple things like recycling plastics can make a difference to a curious young sea lion looking for something to play with. That plaything does not need to be a piece of plastic webbing that may strangle it.<br /> <br /> The most important action people can take is to visit Point Bennett. Discover the world of the pinnipeds for yourself-then tell others how important it is to keep the rituals continuing.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Visit the animal section for more information on individual pinniped species found at Point Bennett.</strong></em></p>",
    "audioDescription": ": If you standing at the end of the Point Bennett trail, you are on a tall sand dune, covered with scattered low succulent plants, overlooking the western tip of the island. Below you is a white sandy beach that stretches out a mile or so into the distance toward two large sea rocks just beyond the shoreline. The beach is deep, at least a football field in width. Depending on the time of year, the beach is filled with hundreds, and often thousands, of pinnipeds, which are torpedo-shaped sea mammals with flippers, and heads shaped like a dog's, but with tiny or invisible ears. More pinnipeds swim just off shore-some hunting; some \"body-surfing\" the waves. The whole scene is accompanied by a vast, almost deafening chorus of their varied calls-from bellows and bleats to snorts, barks, and creaks. You can hear the rumbling cacophony of the pinnipeds from five miles away, if the wind is right. <br /><br />Here, at Point Bennett, the pinnipeds generally include California sea lions, northern elephant seals, and northern fur seals. They are all here to breed, give birth, raise their young, and sometimes to molt, or shed, their fur. With so many competing groups of mammals on the crowded beach, this breeding colony, or rookery, is often a chaotic mix of fighting, sex, sleep, terror, play, and death; sometimes happening all at once. <br /><br />Adult male elephant seals are the largest animals on the beach. These brown animals have short, bulbous snouts, are about 12 feet long, and can weigh as much as 5,000 pounds. They often rest, almost motionless, on the beach, but during the breeding season the males battle one another for females. Known as \"bulls\", the male elephant seals make snorting sounds while slamming their massive bodies together and gouging each other with their short, carrot-shaped tusks, until their necks are red with blood. The females, which are about 10 feet long, and weigh up to 1,800 pounds, form harems around the winners of the battles. Each harem numbers between 10 and 50 females. When born, the babies, called pups, are 3 to 4 feet long, and weigh only about 70 pounds, or 1.5 % the size of the bull elephant seals. As the adult males continue to defend their group against other male competition, pups are sometimes accidentally injured or killed. So, scattered around the beach a few dead pups may be seen, in various states of decay; some being eaten by sea gulls. <br /><br />The California sea lions have large front and back flippers, and are more agile on land than other pinnipeds; roaming up to a mile inland. The mature males are dark brown, about 7 feet long, and weigh up to 1,000 pounds. Females are golden brown, about 6 feet long, and weigh about 200 pounds. Pups are dark brown and about 16 pounds at birth, but their coats become golden brown after about 5 months. After about 5 years, the male's fur changes to a dark brown color once again. Males have a bellowing bark, that sounds like \"Aarh!.\" They fight other males to defend their territories. <br /><br />Females will fight other females to defend their pups. In order for females and their pups to find one another, the pups call out in a bleating, \"Baah\" sound, like that of a baby lamb. Their mothers call back in a creaking, \"Ahh\" sound. <br /><br />The older pups wander farther from their mothers, with many cavorting together in groups in a sandy lagoon a hundred yards back from the shoreline. Aggressive sea lion males will occasionally chase and crush pups that wander too far from another male's harem, leaving a few more carcasses, and their attending seagulls, on the beach. <br /><br />Northern fur seals have very large front and back flippers and tiny ears. Males are grey to black, and between 300 - 600 pounds. They declare their territories with a bellowing sound, almost like a cow's \"moo\", and vigorously defend their turf by chasing away intruders. Females are light brown on the back with a reddish brown chest, with a light patch. They weigh about 100 pounds. These mothers and pups also find one another through distinctive calls.<br /><br />Further inland, the sand dunes become covered with low plants. White seagulls dot the green landscape, spaced about 20 feet apart from one another.<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong><em>There is no beach access to Potato Harbor. The cliffs surrounding the harbor are steep and dangerous.</em> </strong><br /> <br /> Once you have reached the overlook at Potato Harbor you can probably guess as to how this harbor received its name-its oval shape resembles that of a potato. From the overlook you also have a magnificent view to the west and the rest of Santa Cruz Island. Santa Cruz Island is the largest island off the west coast of the U.S. At 96 square miles, around 62,000 acres, it is about four-times the size of Manhattan. Over 75 percent of the island is owned by The Nature Conservancy, a private, non-profit organization, with similar goals as the National Park Service-the preservation of the islands' natural resources. The National Park Service and The Nature Conservancy work together to ensure the protection of these island resources.<br /> <br /> <b>Diatomaceous Earth</b><br /> As you followed the road to Potato Harbor, you probably noticed areas of bright white sedimentary rock that have been exposed on the hillsides due to erosion. This is the same rock type that is evident along the Cavern Point trail. It is known as diatomaceous earth. It is derived from very small single-cell sea plants called diatoms, which are made of silica (silicon dioxide). As these plants die, their silica skeletons settle down to the various marine sediments at the bottom of the ocean, often enmasse. Diatomaceous earth is mined throughout the world for use in filters, such as pool filters, and as an insecticide.<br /> <br /> <b>The Giant Kelp Forest</b><br /> From this vantage point, one also has the opportunity to gaze upon another part of the park-the marine environment. One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park (six nautical miles around each island is part of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary).<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm below one may be able to see or hear California sea lions. These playful animals are often spotted just to the west of Potato Harbor, hauled-out on the rocks. Sea lions, along with a variety of other marine species, depend upon the extensive kelp forests that can be found around Santa Cruz Island and the other Channel Islands. While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California coastal mainland, the islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of algae that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing plants on earth-it can grow 2 feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales seeking a plankton snack.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use tooth-paste are also using a little bit of kelp as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredientcalled algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine plants such as kelp provide the earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have completely altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the century.<br /> <br /> <b>Marine Protected Areas</b><br /> However, with the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls and fishing regulations, transplantation of kelp, public education, and various research programs some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provide a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 Marine Reserves (including the Scorpion Marine Reserve in the waters below you from Potato Harbor to Scorpion Rock), recreational fishing and commercial harvest are prohibited; limited fishing and harvest are allowed in two Marine Conservation Areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.</p>",

With no stores, phones...everything has to be fashioned from whatever is on hand; it's the art of making do.</strong></em><br /> <em>-Gretel Ehrlich, Cowboy Island: Farewell to a Ranching Legacy</em><br /> <br /> <br /> While the isolated island offered ranchers several advantages over the mainland, including no predators and the world's best fence (the ocean), it created special challenges as well. Supplying such a remote outpost was probably the most considerable of these. The transportation of supplies and stock on and off the island was always an adventure-the distance to the mainland, rough seas, and high expense made it very difficult. However, ranchers adapted to the challenges of island life through self-reliance and, as one ranch foreman wrote, \"learning to make do with what [they] had.\"<br /> <br /> No one was better suited to this island life than Alvin Hyder, who lived on Santa Barbara Island along with his extended family from 1914 to 1922. According to Alvin's son, Buster, \"The ol' man got up with a lantern and went to bed with a lantern. Eight hours was just getting' started. He worked all the time. He was a hard-working man who never knew when to stop.\"<br /> <br /> In order to produce income and be as self-sufficient as possible, the Hyders developed a diverse operation: they raised various crops (barley, corn, and potatoes), maintained a vegetable garden, and imported different animals, including sheep from Santa Cruz Island, horses, mules, pigs, goats, rabbits, chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys.<br /> <br /> Not all of these enterprises succeeded. \"Too much guano in the ground...burned [the potatoes].\" High winds wreaked havoc on the chickens and geese: \"We watched more gosh darn chickens and turkeys and our stuff blow out in that ocean--blow 'em clear out.\" One terrible year, the Hyders even lost their entire hay harvest: \"We sold our hay to this guy [in San Pedro], and he went bankrupt. We lost all of our feed and all our work...we got skunked.\"<br /> <br /> Raising sheep for wool and meat eventually became the mainstay of the Hyder operations. But even this had its challenges. One of the biggest was transporting the sheep and supplies to the top of the island. To accomplish this difficult task, the Hyders constructed a wooden track with a sled that ran between the Landing Cove and the house. A horse pulled the sled up the track, and people lowered it by hand. The horse, named Dan, listened for a signal from below to start hauling, and stopped when the load was exactly at the barn.<br /> <br /> To supplement the family income, Alvin ran rum during Prohibition along the Southern California coast and transported animals and supplies to and from other islands aboard his boat, Nora. The family also fished and collected sea gull eggs which were boiled because they were so oily. Occasionally, hunger and lack of supplies would drive family members to eating mice and brushing their teeth with green coreopsis branches, a practice Buster describes: \"When [the coreopsis] were green I used to break them off and scrub my teeth with them. No kiddin'. We had no toothbrushes...and no toothpaste. So I used to clean my teeth with the things. It's just like eatin' an apple, and it keeps your teeth slick and clean. Maybe that's why I got all my teeth still.\"<br /> <br /> The lack of fresh water also posed a challenge. Since the island had no springs or flowing water, the Hyders constructed a system of reservoirs. They built two large concrete cisterns at the house and brought water from the mainland on Nora II in twenty-five 50-gallon barrels. This water was then pumped to the house reservoir. They also collected water from the building roofs and constructed two water catchment basins on the island for the livestock and crops. To ensure water quality, Buster had the job of removing dead mice from the drinking water supply every day.<br /> <br /> Despite these actions, water remained a precious resource as Buster recalled, \"You had to limit your drinking water. It had to last a year. Then it got stagnant. Many times when it was raining I'd drink water out of horse tracks. No kiddin'. Boy, it was hard to drink it. But when you don't have anything else, you have to drink it.\"<br /> <br /> Besides the lack of fresh water, the Hyders also lacked natural resources for construction materials. With no trees on the island, all supplies for facilities had to be brought from the mainland. The Hyders built a two-room wooden ranch house above the Landing Cove for the families of both Alvin and his brother, Clarence, to share. A barn, stable, and a chicken coop were located nearby. Alvin's other brother, Cleve, and his wife built their own small house half way up from the Landing Cove. At one time around 1915 some 15 people lived on this little island.<br /> <br /> With all of these difficulties and setbacks, it may come as no surprise that the Hyders finally decided to leave the island in 1922, after years of hard work and frustration. They tore down the buildings for lumber and removed their animals with the exception of the rabbits and a mule. The Hyders were the only family to permanently reside on this isolated island.<br /> <br /> After the Hyders, only government activity occurred on the island. From 1942 through 1946, the island served as a military coastal lookout station, which consisted of a lookout tower, radio antenna, roads, boat landing with tramway, and barracks. A staff of seven men on 24-hour duty kept a lookout for all passing vessels and submarines. Two unmanned navigational light towers were also constructed, one of which is still operational and can be seen near Arch Point.<br /> <br /> As you might expect, military life was a little different on an isolated island. Cal Reynolds remembered his 1942 duty time at the station as \"very hang loose . . . not a lot of regimentation, we stood our four on and eight off . . . it was a small island, there wasn't a lot to do on it.\" The men worked two weeks on the island and then received one week of leave. They kept chickens and rabbits in pens, and fished and tended lobster pots: \"[we] always had hot buttered lobster.\" Even though the Navy had constructed a water storage tank and pumped water up from the dock, water was still scarce and the men were unable to keep a garden. A weekly boat brought supplies and transferred men on and off the island. \"It was a good life,\" Reynolds recalled, \"an enjoyable experience.\"<br /> <br /> Even today, the isolation of this island still affects visitors and the National Park Service. Public boat trips for park visitors are limited to only a few days each month during the summer and visitors must bring (and carry up to the top of the island) all their own food and water. Park staff must import food and water as well, and have established a solar power system for energy. Like so many who visited and resided here before, we must learn to make do with what we have.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Visit the Hyder Ranch site pin for more information. </strong></em></p>",

These cliffs, their numerous caves, and the rest of San Miguel Island's coastline and neighboring islets are home to 13 different species of nesting seabirds and shorebirds. Prince Island, which lies at the entrance to Cuyler Harbor, hosts the most diverse seabird colony on the west coast with all 13 of these species. Ashy storm-petrels, Brandt's cormorants, Cassin's auklets, pigeon guillemots, California brown pelicans, and common murres all make their home here.<br /> <br /> San Miguel Island, the other Channel Islands, and all of their associated islets and offshore rocks comprise one of the largest breeding centers on the west coast for seabirds and shorebirds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, as well as the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters surrounding them, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> However, the island's isolation was not able to protect some species of seabirds from human impacts. The destruction of native vegetation, importing of non-native species, gathering of eggs, disturbance of rookeries, and the spread of pesticides in the marine environment have all been detrimental.<br /> <br /> During the 1960s, the pesticide DDT nearly caused the extinction of the California brown pelican as a breeding species on the west coast of the United States. In 1970, only 552 nesting attempts were made on Anacapa Island (the largest colony on the West coast of the United States) and just one chick survived. On October 13, 1970, the brown pelican was listed as an endangered species.<br /> <br /> Cassin's auklets were once so abundant on San Miguel Island that in 1863 it was recorded that \"they had undermined almost every part of the soft, earthy surface with their burrows.\" Between 1897 and 1908, cats were introduced to the island, and by 1911, it was reported that the breeding colony had been entirely abandoned. To make matters even worse, the cats devastated the island's large Scripps's murrelet colony as well-biologists found only one egg.<br /> <br /> Today, these species are gradually recovering now that their isolated island home is protected within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of the island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of southern California's seabird populations.<br /> <br /> On San Miguel Island, these efforts have focused on restoring seabird nesting habitat, removing feral cats and non-native vegetation, revegetating with native plants, installing nest boxes, and closing areas to protect nesting seabirds.<br /> <br /> The most notable results of these efforts have been the successful recovery of the California brown pelican and its removal from the endangered species list in 2009, and San Miguel Island once more supporting the largest number of breeding seabirds on any of the Channel Islands.</p>",

Plus you paddle into the wind on the way out and with it at your back on the return. Snorkeling is not great in this area but eel grass beds are to found around the pier and more rocky reef conditions on the west side of the harbor. No lifeguard on duty.<br /> <br /> <strong>Place Name</strong><br /> The name \"Prisoner's Harbor\" comes from an interesting historical incident in 1830. During this time the Mexican government used Alta California as a place of exile for convicts. In February 1830 the Maria Ester brought about eighty prisoners from Acapulco to California. After being refused entry at the presidios in San Diego and Santa Barbara, Captain Andrew Christian Holmes decided that thirty of the worst convicts would be taken to Santa Cruz Island. The harbor where the prisoners were left with supplies was the island's main harbor and was subsequently called \"Prisoner's Harbor.\" As to what happened to those prisoners, there are different accounts. Most accounts state that they somehow made it back to the mainland (possibly by building rafts and sailing across the channel to Carpinteria) and integrated into society. However, some accounts report that the prisoners did not survive the trip across the channel.<br /> <br /> The following article was written by Michael Redmon. He is a columnist for The Santa Barbara Independent newspaper, in which this piece originally ran:<br /> <br /> Prisoner's Harbor, on Santa Cruz Island’s north coast, now serves as a port of entry for visitors arriving by boat. The name of the harbor commemorates a series of events in 1830 that almost transformed the island into a local version of Australia’s infamous Botany Bay penal colony. Accounts of these events are sketchy and at times contradictory, but the following is a rough outline of what occurred.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island lay deserted for several years after the native Chumash had been removed to the mainland in the early 1800s. Fishermen, hunters and travelers occasionally stopped or squatted on its shores. After gaining independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government wished to expand its presence and increase its population in Alta California.<br /> <br /> In February 1830, the U.S. brig Maria Ester dropped anchor off Santa Barbara. Its captain, John Christian Holmes, then sought out Romualdo Pacheco, comandante at the presidio, to request permission to discharge his cargo, a boatload of some 80 convicted criminals. Holmes had the license to transport the convicts to Alta California, part of a plan by the Mexican government for a penal colony.<br /> <br /> This was not the first time the plan had been broached. In 1825, a small group of prisoners had been transported to California with the intent of “improving the morals of the convicts and for colonizing California,” according to historian H. H. Bancroft. This created a storm of protest in California, and the government eventually dropped the scheme.<br /> <br /> Five years later, the authorities tried again. Stalling for time, Pacheco accompanied Holmes back to his ship to inspect the “cargo.” He was shocked by the pitiful state of the prisoners. They were living in vermin-infested filth and appeared half-starved, and their clothes were in tatters. Pacheco refused to allow the prisoners to disembark. He soon learned that Holmes had initially tried to dump the criminals at San Diego but had been turned away.<br /> <br /> This stalemate continued for a number of weeks. Finally, José de la Guerra, the pueblo’s most prominent citizen, convinced Pacheco to allow a handful of prisoners ashore to perform odd jobs. De la Guerra saw to it that these men were bathed and properly clothed, reportedly earning their everlasting gratitude.<br /> <br /> In April, with the approval of California governor José Echeandia, Holmes transported around 30 convicts to Prisoners Harbor with provisions supplied by the padres at the Old Mission. The fate of the balance of the prisoners remains unclear. Those on Santa Cruz initially fared somewhat well, constructing crude shelters against the elements.<br /> <br /> In November, a fire destroyed their camp. Building rafts from whatever material was at hand, the men determined to return to the mainland. Without sails or any oars or paddles to speak of, they were at the mercy of wind and currents. They might have drifted endlessly if not for a storm that eventually pushed them ashore in the area of the Carpinteria Valley.<br /> <br /> Local authorities rounded them up in fairly short order. Imprisoned for a time, some reportedly were flogged for daring to escape their island prison. Eventually, they were released and were absorbed into society.<br /> <br /> It was not the last time that Santa Cruz was considered as a possible prison. In the 1880s, the U.S. Army suggested exiling especially troublesome members of the Apache tribe to the island. Nothing came of the idea, and today only the name, Prisoners Harbor, reminds us of the rather bizarre events of over 180 years ago.</p>",

An 1869 photograph shows a substantial wharf at Prisoner's Harbor. It was the first large wharf built in Santa Barbara County and was the artery through which essential goods and supplies have flowed to and from the island ever since.<br /> <br /> Justinian Caire (an island investor from 1869 to 1880 and the sole owner beginning in the 1880s) also realized the importance of Prisoner's Harbor as the only good landing for supplies and set to work improving the small area known as La Playa (the beach) as the entrance gate to his island enterprises. To maintain the pier Caire imported a pile driver to the island and planted eucalyptus groves in the canyon for use as wharf pilings when the need arose. During a 1903 pier renovation, the pier was measured at 582 feet long.<br /> <br /> During the Stanton era (1937-1987), the pier would continue to be modified and repaired until being destroyed during winter storms in 1942 to 1943. Shortly after, a new 360-foot pier was built to replace this destroyed pier. In 1966 the Navy assumed responsibility for the maintenance and repair of the pier, renovating it in 1966 and again in 1993. After the transfer of 8,500 acres of eastern Santa Cruz Island from The Nature Conservancy to the National Park Service in 2000, the deteriorated pier was removed and replaced with a new pier in 2002.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>During the Caire era, the area at the mouth of the CaÃ±ada del Puerto was landscaped with grasses and trees planted in rows. Workers straightened the creek with the aid of stone retaining walls, diminishing the lagoon that had formed at the mouth of the drainage. Laborers planted more eucalyptus trees in a row behind the warehouse and sheep pens and stone pines near the foot of the pier. The rugged but picturesque Prisoners Harbor was molded into a welcoming scene for guests and workers.

A second-story balcony, with island-made ornamental wrought iron rail faced the channel, and small decorative balconies in the same wrought iron pattern adorned the side windows and French doors framed in brick on the upper story. A garden stretched in front of the house surrounded by more wrought iron work. A separate kitchen building stood near the house for many years. The Caires either replaced or remodeled it into a more substantial gable-roofed building. A stone well with a windmill pumped water to a tank on the hill above the house. The stone well remains, although the water tank and windmill have disappeared.<br /> <br /> Research shows that the only official post office on the northern Channel Islands may have been located in the ranch house. The Post Office Department commissioned Arthur J. Caire as postmaster of La Playa on March 28, 1895. It remained in service for eight years, closing on June 30, 1903.<br /> <br /> A barn, which stood across the creek at the bottom of the hill on the east side of the valley, was used to store hay and alfalfa brought from the Campo Avuelo, Las Peras, Segundo and Tercero fields to the east.

The wetland most likely served as a resting and feeding stop for migratory birds and nesting habitat for resident waterfowl.<br /> <br /> Over the past 150 years many changes were made to the area-the creek was rerouted and channelized; the wetland was filled in with rock and gravel; non-native plants such as eucalyptus, stone pines, and kikuyu grass were introduced; and a berm, buildings, roads, and corrals were constructed. These changes degraded the wetland ecology and compromised its effectiveness as a natural floodplain.<br /> <br /> To restore the natural function and ecology of the wetland, the National Park Service and its partners removed the historic corrals and scale house in the fill area, removed the fill material, reshaped the landscape into wetland habitat, and removed 250 feet of artificial berm to allow the wetland to flood naturally. In addition, non-native species such as eucalyptus were removed and native riparian and woodland species were planted.<br /> <br /> The value of this project is significant as coastal wetlands in California are increasingly rare-over 90% have been eliminated. The restored wetland will provide important habitat for wildlife and native plants.</p>",

    "bodyText": "Private boaters may land on all five islands within the park throughout the year.<br /> <br /> Boating (excluding personal watercraft--see <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/management/lawsandpolicies.htm\">Laws and Policies</a> for more information) is a unique and rewarding way to experience the pristine marine environment of Channel Islands National Park. You will find solitude and splendor. Here you will also face new challenges and may encounter unexpected dangers. This section is designed to help in planning a safe, enjoyable, and environmentally sound boating trip in the park. Private boaters may land on all five islands within the park throughout the year.<br /> <br /> <strong>Planning Your Trip</strong><br /> To help you decide which island to visit, specific island information is available in this app, on our website at [Places To Go](https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/placestogo.htm) or from the visitor center through publications, exhibits, and the park movie.<br /> <br /> Detailed boating information about the channel and islands may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG) \"Local Notice to Mariners\" publication by contacting the Coast Guard at (510) 437-2981. Cruising guides to the Channel Islands and nautical charts are available from local marine stores and online bookstores. Refer to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Ocean Survey charts 18720, 18721, 18725, 18727, 18728, 18729, and 18756.<br /> <br /> Visitors may boat on their own or with a [park authorized commercial service operator](https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/management/visitor-services-list.htm). Due to challenging weather conditions, boating should not be attempted by the novice or anyone who is not properly trained, conditioned, and equipped. Currents, shifting swells, fog, and strong winds can change quickly in the channel. The trip to the islands also takes the boaters across some of the busiest shipping lanes in California. Ship speeds of 25 to 35 knots present a special hazard to boaters while crossing the channel.<br /> <br /> There are no public moorings or all-weather anchorages around the islands. It is recommended that one person stay on board the boat at all times. Boaters are responsible for any damage to the resources caused by their boat.<br /> <br /> <strong>Weather</strong><br /> Conditions in the Santa Barbara Channel and around the islands are variable and the ocean is unforgiving. Only experienced boaters with vessels capable of withstanding severe weather are advised to make the cross-channel passage. Boaters should obtain the latest weather broadcast provided by the NOAA Weather Service by calling (805) 988-6610, visiting Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary's Internet Weather Kiosk and by monitoring weather radio on VHF-FM 162.475 MHz (weather station 3) for marine forecasts and VHF-FM 162.55 MHz (weather station 1) and VHF-FM 162.40 MHz (weather station 2) for land-based observations.<br /> <br /> Weather conditions vary considerably in the channel. The calmest winds and sea conditions often occur August through October. The other months are subject to a much greater chance for adverse wind and seas with sudden unexpected changes. High winds may occur regardless of the forecast. Forty-knot winds are not unusual for Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands. Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands have more moderate winds.<br /> <br /> Winds are often calm in the early morning and increase during the afternoon. Generally the wind comes from the northwest, but boaters must be also be prepared for strong east or Santa Ana winds at anytime, especially from September through April.<br /> <br /> Dense fog is common during the summer months, but may occur at any time, making chart and compass navigation mandatory. Ocean currents of considerable strength may be encountered both near and offshore from the islands. Ocean water temperatures range from the lower 50s (°F) in the winter to the upper 60s (°F) in the fall.<br /> <br /> <strong>Safety</strong><br /> Due to challenging weather conditions, boating should not be attempted by the novice or anyone who is not properly trained, conditioned, and equipped. Currents, shifting swells, fog, and strong winds can change quickly in the channel. There are no public moorings or all-weather anchorages around the islands. It is recommended that one person stay on board the boat at all times.<br /> <br /> <u>Float Plans:</u> Boaters should always file a formal float plan with the harbormaster before departing. Family and/or friends should also be informed of your float plan. Names and addresses for the boaters, as well as emergency phone numbers, should be listed. Plans should also include the number of boats and boaters on the trip as well as the color, size, and type of craft used. Any survival and special emergency equipment should be listed (EPIRB, VHF, food rations, flares, etc.). The place, date, and time of departure and return should be logged as well as destination(s). This information can be invaluable for a search operation if something goes wrong. Remember to be flexible with your plans. Weather should always determine your course of action.<br /> <br /> <u>Shipping Lanes:</u> Major shipping lanes lie between the islands and the mainland. Boaters should be aware of their location and use caution when crossing them. All boaters should listen to the USCG notice to mariners broadcast on VHF channel 22 since the waters in and surrounding the park are sometimes closed for military operations.<br /> <br /> <u>Sea Caves</u>: Sea caves can be very dangerous-large waves or swells can fill a cave unexpectedly. Be extremely careful and wear a helmet at all times when exploring sea caves. See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/management/lawsandpolicies.htm\">Laws and Policies</a> for sea cave closure information.<br /> <br /> <strong>Landing Permits and Procedures</strong><br /> There are no landing permits required for the islands administered by the National Park Service (NPS). However, a landing permit is required to land on The Nature Conservancy (TNC) property on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> There are closed and restricted areas on each island. Please note that rocks or islets on or near any of the islands are closed year-round to any landing and pets are not allowed in the park. Please refer to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/management/lawsandpolicies.htm\">Laws and Policies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/limiting-your-impact.htm\">Limiting Your Impact</a> for more information on regulations and guidelines.<br /> <br /> It is recommended that boaters contact the park ranger on each island before landing for an orientation, information on daily events, island safety, landing instructions, weather conditions, or camping check-in. Park rangers occasionally monitor VHF Channel 16. Channel 16 is a hailing frequency only, and rangers will instruct you to switch to another channel upon contact. If you cannot hail the park ranger on the island on which you plan to land, try contacting one of the other island rangers on a neighboring island, as island canyons and mountains sometimes obscure radio transmission.<br /> <br /> Boaters may land according to the following procedures:<br /> <br /> <u>Santa Barbara Island:</u> A permit is not required to land or hike on Santa Barbara Island. Access to the island is permitted only at the landing cove. The landing dock is available for unloading purposes only. No craft, including kayaks and inflatables, should be left moored to the dock. Please lift your inflatables up to the upper landing.<br /> <br /> <u>Anacapa Island</u>: A permit is not required to and or hike on East Anacapa Island or at Frenchys Cove. West Anacapa (except Frenchys Cove) is a protected research natural area and is closed to visitors. Visitors are allowed on Middle Anacapa by permit only and when accompanied by a park ranger.<br /> <br /> The moorings near the landing cove at East Anacapa Island are reserved for use by the NPS, the USCG, and the park concessionaire only. Private boaters must anchor a reasonable distance from these moorings. This is not an all-weather anchorage. It is recommended that one person stay on board the boat at all times. The landing dock is available for unloading purposes only. No craft, including kayaks and inflatables, should be left moored to the dock. Please lift your inflatables and kayaks up to the lower landing.<br /> <br /> <u>Santa Cruz Island</u>: Boaters may land on the eastern 24% of Santa Cruz Island without a permit. This area is owned by the NPS and is east of the property line between Prisoners Harbor and Valley Anchorage. The shoreline between Arch Point (northwest of Scorpion Anchorage) and the east boundary of Potato Harbor is closed to landing to protect nesting seabirds. No buoys are available at any landing area. Buoys are reserved for the NPS and the USCG. A pier is available at Scorpion Anchorage and Prisoners Harbor. Due to surf and swell conditions, boaters should use extreme caution when making surf-landings at any beach, especially Smugglers Cove and those beaches facing south and southeast between San Pedro Point and Sandstone Point.<br /> <br /> A permit to land on the other 76% of Santa Cruz Island is required from TNC. A fee is charged and no overnight island use is permitted. Visit <a href=\"http://www.nature.org/cruzpermit\">nature.org/cruzpermit</a> to obtain a permit. Allow at least 10 business days for processing.<br /> <br /> <u>Santa Rosa Island</u>: Boaters may land along coastline and on beaches without a permit for day-use only. From March 1 to September 15, the back beaches and sand dunes between and including Skunk Point to just north of East Point are closed to hiking to protect the nesting area for the snowy plover, a federally listed, threatened shorebird. Please remain on the wet sand (below mean high tide) or the road throughout this area. The beaches around Sandy Point are closed year-round. A pier is available at Bechers Bay. However, boaters may not use the mooring buoys in Bechers Bay. They are reserved for the NPS, the Coast Guard, and the park concessionaire.<br /> <br /> <u>San Miguel Island</u>: Overnight anchorages are restricted to Cuyler Harbor and Tyler Bight. Visitors may land only on the beach at Cuyler Harbor. San Miguel Island is owned by the U. S. Navy and open for landing only when National Park Service personnel are on the island. The island was a former bombing range and there are possible unexploded ordnance.<br /> <br /> It is the responsibility of private boaters to contact the park to ensure the island is open before coming ashore. A permit (including liability waiver) is required to visit the island. Private boaters can obtain these forms at a self-registration station at the Nidever Canyon trail head entry on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> Visitors are required to be escorted beyond the ranger station. Visitors may explore Cuyler Harbor beach, Nidever Canyon, the Cabrillo Monument, and the Lester Ranch site unescorted. No off-trail hiking is permitted.<br /> <br /> Private boaters are required to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/common/utilities/sendmail/sendemail.cfm?o=68ADF288A2FFA0BB9DA807A6FA048BA3568E088853A0&r=/chis/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">e-mail us</a> prior to their mainland departure to arrange for an escorted hike by a ranger. Provide your name, phone number, vessel name, and dates of requested escorted hike. Park staff will then reply with available dates and instructions.",

The early records of the various ranch foremen describe these projects. The stone retaining wall supporting the road out of Scorpion Valley towards Smugglers Cove is notable for its massive size, number and large size of rocks used to build it, and the difficulty of constructing such a large structure in its steep hillside location. Walls are still visible today along the Scorpion and Smugglers stream beds and along the Cavern Point trail.<br /> <br /> Check dams were built in the drainages leading into the developed valleys to slow the force and amount of water entering these valleys and to capture the eroding sediment. Evidence of flooding at Scorpion Ranch has been found as far back as 1916; the dams and retaining walls were an effort to protect the ranch structures from flooding. Some of the best examples of these dams can be seen along the trail to Cavern Point.<br /> <br /> Many of the retaining walls and check dams have deteriorated over time from erosion, flooding, and lack of maintenance. In an effort to preserve this slice of history, the National Park Service began repairing these dry stone structures in 1999. Nearly 100 retaining walls and check dams have been repaired during this period.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Retaining walls and check dams were constructed throughout the island for erosion control and road support. Some of the low retaining walls are made of hand stacked stones of varying size, rise three feet high and span long lengths of roadside. Other stone structures are called check dams - tall walls of stone built into the rugged hillsides within the crevasse of a small drainage. Much like a dam between the banks of a river, check dams slow and direct water to protect the ranch area from floods.",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Aimophila ruficeps obscura</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The rufous-crowned sparrow is a small American sparrow that is found mostly across South-western USA and Mexico. An endemic subspecies of the rufous-crowned sparrow, <em>r. obscura</em>, first described in 1923 by Donald Dickey and Adriaan van Rossem, resides in the national park on Anacapa and Santa Cruz islands.This endemic subspecies was formerly found on</p> Santa Catalina Island . <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Rufous-crowned sparrow pairs remain on their territories year-round and stay bonded for life.</li> <li>The rufous- crowned sparrow was first described in 1872 from specimens taken in Arizona. From 1886 to 1915 it was not recorded in the state.</li> <li>This secretive little bird spends most of its time on the ground, but if startled it will investigate by flying to a nearby perch. An exception is during spring mornings when this bird sings from the tops of boulders or another similar perch.</li> <li>This sparrow is awkward in flight and primarily uses running and hopping to move.</li> <li>Nesting sparrows have been observed using three kinds of displays to distract potential predators for their nest;the rodent run, the broken wing, and the tumbling off the bush.</li> <li>They have been known to live for up to three years, two months.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> This sparrow has a chestnut-brown rufous crown, brown back with dark streaks, brown wings and a long, brown tail. It has a pale gray face, back of neck, chest, belly, and underparts. It also can be identified by its brown, rufous eyestripe and conical black bill. Another key identifier is its conspicuous black \"whisker\" mark on side of its chin. The sparrow also has pink legs and feet. The sparrow's young have diffuse streaks on their breast and flanks. Both sexes of the rufous-crowned sparrow are similar in appearance and their size ranges from 5 to 6 inches in length.The endemic subspecies, <em>r obscura</em>, is darker in color, has a heavier bill, longer tarsi, and heavier toes.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> This subspecies of rufous-crowned sparrow is found year-round on Santa Cruz island and West and Middle Anacapa. While this bird does not nest on East Anacapa, it can occasionally be seen there (Collins 2008).</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Habitats favored by the rufous-crowned sparrow on the islands are coastal-bluff, coastal sage and open coyote-brush scrub, often rocky in nature and located in steep ravines and canyons. These birds are both ground nesters and ground feeders. On Santa Cruz, the sparrow’s prime habitat includes grassy hill slopes and canyon walls with scattered bushes or clumps of cactus.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> These sparrows forage primarily on the ground, generally under the protective cover of vegetation, and only rarely in open areas, in foli¬age, or on branches of taller woody vegetation. The fall diet of rufous-crowned sparrows in California is 88.4% vegetables, which are primarily small grass and forb seeds, fresh grass stems and tender plant shoots. The rest of its diet, amounting to 11.6%, is animal matter of which insects such as ants, grasshoppers, ground beetles, and scale insects make up that small percentage for the fall and winter diet.Animal matter is generally taken in higher proportion during the breeding season.</p> <p>It is unknown whether this species obtains adequate water from its diet or if dietary water must be supplemented by drinking. Individuals have been observed drinking from and bathing in pools of water in rock crevices following rainstorms.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> There are no data on the characteristics of nest placement by island sparrows, but they probably select settings similar to those used by<em>A. ruficeps</em>on the main land. Their nests generally are in grass or against shrubs or grass tussocks either on or flush with the ground in a natural depression or hole in the ground or, infrequently, up toa foot and a half off the ground in a low bush. Pairs will raise two and possibly three broods and will ren est following nest failure. Breeding occurs from late March to late August.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Rufous-crowned sparrow habitat on the islands was adversely affected by the heavy grazing that occurred on Anacapa and Santa Cruz Islands, and birds were likely more vulnerable to native and non-native predators such as island scrub-jays, foxes, and spotted skunks. However, recent work suggests that the species has benefited from the removal of sheep and other grazers, and may be increasing in both distribution and abundance.</p> <p>According to the IUCN Red List status of Globally Threatened Birds, this species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion. Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion. The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size. For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=19951\">https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=19951</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/rufous-winged_sparrow/lifehistory\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/rufous-winged_sparrow/lifehistory</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.prbo.org/calpif/htmldocs/scrub.html\">http://www.prbo.org/calpif/htmldocs/scrub.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.bird-friends.com/BirdPage.php?name=Rufous-Crowned%20Sparrow\">http://www.bird-friends.com/BirdPage.php?name=Rufous-Crowned%20Sparrow</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=9023\">http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=9023</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.avianweb.com/rufouscrownedsparrows.html\">http://www.avianweb.com/rufouscrownedsparrows.html</a></li> </ul>",

Entering this area without a ranger is a violation of federal law.</b></em> </strong><br /> <br /> <b>Geographical Isolation</b><br /> As you reach the island's highest peak, 831-foot San Miguel Hill, take a moment to look across the island. You may notice the broad, elevated coastal plain stretching in front of you. This plain is a remnant of what geologists call a \"marine terrace\"-an ancient shoreline carved flat by wave action and exposed through changes in sea level and tectonic uplift of the land. A future marine terrace (called a wave-cut platform) is being created today by wave erosion at the base of the sea cliffs.<br /> <br /> The islands' first shoreline was created around five million years ago, when compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in folding and faulting of marine sediments and volcanic rocks (deposited between 15-30 million years ago) and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today. Earthquakes are quite common and all the islands continue to be uplifted.<br /> <br /> Ever since these compressional forces caused the islands to emerge from the sea, they have been separated from the mainland. For decades, scientists assumed that the two were connected by a land bridge, but as bathymetric information (or topography) of the sea floor improved, it revealed that even during periods of lowest sea levels (about 17,000 years ago), the islands still remained isolated by at least four miles of ocean. It is this continuous geographical isolation that has shaped island life.<br /> <br /> <b>World War II Lookout Site </b><br /> The Navy erected a Coastal Lookout Station on the summit of San Miguel Hill in 1942. The station consisted of a wooden observation tower and radio communication facilities. A barracks for the staff was built adjacent to the Lester Ranch. Only a small amount of wreckage remains from the tower site, including hardware, broken glass, wire and pieces of wood. A modern remote-controlled weather station operated by the Navy (Point Mugu) stands adjacent to the tower site; concrete foundation pads from an earlier, nuclear powered weather station should not be confused with the World War II lookout. On the trail to the lookout on the east slope of San Miguel Hill are two utility poles likely dating from World War II for telephone communications between the barracks and lookout tower. One has fallen and the other remains standing. The poles have an angle cut off the top where a hole provides evidence of hardware for holding the wire.<br /> <br /> Today a weather station sit atop San Miguel Hill.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "On the crest of San Miguel Hill is a tall array of metal antennas and equipment, with solar panels. On a clear day, many island features can be seen, in the distance. Most are covered with low scrubby bushes. To the north is Harris Point. To the northeast, offshore, is small, rocky, Prince Island. To the east is Cardwell Point and, across an ocean channel, Santa Rosa Island. To the south is Crook Point and the open ocean. To the west, is a white-colored patch of land, called the Caliche Forest. Beyond that is a hill called Green Mountain.<br /> <br />The trail is made up of sand mixed with small pebbles. San Miguel Hill is covered with clusters of green plants, some of which have thick branches, topped with tufts of green leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers (seasonal) and grasses. Between the clusters are patches of sand and pebbles. The equipment on the crest of San Miguel Hill is connected to a metal triangular frame on three spayed legs, with a metal box attached to its side. Also attached to this frame are two rods. The shorter one pokes out from the frame horizontally and has six vertical bars. The taller one stretches high above the frame, topped by a horizontal arm with a cannister at the end. Sometimes this cannister is spinning. Three smaller solar panels are also attached to the frame, angled upward, in the same direction. Two are small-about the size of iPads- and mounted to the upper frame. The third is about 2-feet square, propped against the ground near the base of the frame.<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p><em>tuqan is the Chumash word for San Miguel Island. It means 'a small piece,' but it is suspect this is more of a descriptive explanation than a translation of the word.<br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> Wind and weather constantly sweep across the North Pacific to batter the shores of the westernmost of all the islands, San Miguel. This extreme weather creates a harsh but profoundly beautiful environment. The 9,500-acre island is primarily a plateau about 500 feet in elevation, but two 800-foot rounded hills emerge from its wild, windswept landscape. Although lush native vegetation covers this landscape today, a century's worth of sheep ranching and overgrazing caused scientists in 1875 to describe the island as \"a barren lump of sand.\" With the grazing animals removed, vegetative recovery is in progress. Giant coreopsis, dudleya, locoweed, lupine, buckwheat, coastal sagebrush, and poppies are all recolonizing the island to their former extent, returning San Miguel to its more natural state.<br /> <br /> Also making a comeback, after years of hunting, are the thousands of pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) that breed, pup, and haul out on the island's 27 miles of isolated coastline. Hikers who make the all-day, ranger-guided, 16-mile round-trip hike across the island to Point Bennett will never forget seeing one of the world's most spectacular wildlife displays-over 30,000 pinnipeds and up to five different species hauled out on the point's beaches at certain times of year.<br /> <br /> Other wildlife include the island fox and deer mouse. Both of these little creatures are endemics-they are found only on the Channel Islands. The island fox, the size of a house cat, is the largest land animal on the island. In the waters surrounding San Miguel, the marine animals get much larger. Dolphins and porpoises are often spotted along with gray whales, killer whales, and the largest animals of all, blue whales.<br /> <br /> In the spring and summer the skies are filled with birds. Boaters entering Cuyler Harbor receive a greeting from western gulls, California brown pelicans, cormorants, and Cassin's auklets that nest on Prince Island. Black oystercatchers, with their bright red bills and pink feet, feed along the beach. Terrestrial residents include the western meadowlark, rock wren, and song sparrow, an endemic subspecies. Peregrine falcons have recently been restored to the island and are nesting successfully once again after years of decimation by the pesticide DDT.<br /> <br /> In addition to the variety of natural resources, San Miguel hosts an array of cultural resources as well. The Chumash and their ancestors lived on San Miguel almost continuously for nearly 12,000 years. Today there are over 600 fragile, relatively undisturbed archeological sites. The oldest one dates back to 11,600 years before the present-some of the oldest evidence of human presence in North America. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo and his men laid eyes on San Miguel Island in 1542. Upon claiming the island for the Spanish crown, Cabrillo named it \"La Posesion.\" Some stories say that Cabrillo wintered and died on San Miguel Island. No one knows where Cabrillo is buried, but there is a memorial commemorating the explorer on a bluff overlooking Cuyler Harbor.<br /> <br /> Other outstanding island resources that visitors may experience on San Miguel include the caliche forest (sand-castings of ancient vegetation), fossil bones of the Pleistocene pygmy mammoths that stood four to six feet at the shoulders, 150 years of ranching history, and numerous shipwrecks. Whether you are interested in life of the past or life of the present, San Miguel Island has it in abundance. Visit, explore, and enjoy.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Island Facts</strong></p> <p>- Located in Santa Barbara County.<br /> <br /> - Seventy miles from Ventura; 26 miles to the nearest mainland (Point Conception); three miles west of Santa Rosa Island.<br /> <br /> - San Miguel is approximately four miles wide by eight miles long; 14 square miles; 9,325 acres.<br /> <br /> - Average rainfall-15 inches.<br /> <br /> - Tallest peak-San Miguel Hill, 831 ft.<br /> <br /> - Over a dozen Channel Islands endemic plants occur on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> - The endemic island fox and deer mouse and introduced rat are the only land mammals found on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> - Up to five different pinniped species and over 30,000 individuals can be found at Point Bennett, one of the largest concentrations of wildlife in the world.<br /> <br /> - One of the oldest known American Indian archeological sites (11,600 years ago) is on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> - San Miguel Island and its associated islets support one-third of the breeding seabirds in the Channel Islands.</p> <p><br /> <strong><u>Things To Do</u></strong><br /> One-day trips, multi-day boat trips, and overnight camping are all options when visiting San Miguel Island. However, this island is more challenging to get to and the weather can be windy at anytime of year-30 knots of wind is not uncommon. Therefore, visitors must be prepared for adverse weather. As with all the Channel Islands, visiting San Miguel Island is an exercise in preparation and self-reliance. Since there are no services on the islands, there are no remedies for poor planning once you have arrived.<br /> <br /> <strong>Access By Permit Only</strong><br /> A permit (including liability waiver) is required to visit the island. If you are traveling to San Miguel Island with Island Packers, Channel Islands Aviation, or Truth Aquatics, they will provide the forms to you upon your reservation. Private boaters can obtain the forms at a self-registration station at the Nidever Canyon trail head entry on San Miguel Island. It is the responsibility of private boaters to contact the park to ensure the island is open before coming ashore. Visitors are required to stay on the designated island trail system. No off-trail hiking is permitted. The island was a former bombing range and there are possible unexploded ordnance. In addition, visitors must be accompanied by a ranger beyond the ranger station. When not accompanied by a ranger, visitors may explore Cuyler Harbor beach, Nidever Canyon, the Cabrillo Monument, and the Lester Ranch site.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boat Transportation</strong><br /> Island Packers offers trips spring through fall. Travel time is about four hours. Strong winds and rough seas are possible. Landing is at Cuyler Harbor via skiff onto a beach. Visitors must be prepared to waterproof gear and possibly get wet. Multi-island, overnight boat trips frequently visit San Miguel Island as well.<br /> <br /> <strong>Plane Service</strong><br /> On a trial basis, Channel Islands Aviation offers trips year round. Travel time is about 60 minutes Landing is at a graded dirt airstrip above near the ranger station above Cuyler Harbor.<br /> <br /> <strong>Goods and Services</strong><br /> There are no goods, services, or accommodations (lodging) available on the island. Visitors must bring all their own food and supplies. Public phones are not available.<br /> <br /> <strong>Water</strong><br /> There is no water available on the island. Visitors must bring all their water with them.<br /> <br /> <strong>Picnicking</strong><br /> There are no tables available for picnicking on the island. If weather permits, many visitors enjoy picnicking at Cuyler Harbor beach.<br /> <br /> <strong>Visitor Center</strong><br /> There is no visitor center on San Miguel Island. Please check with a ranger or volunteer for island information or visit our visitor center in Ventura.<br /> <br /> <strong>Interpretive Programs</strong><br /> At Cuyler Harbor, rangers and volunteer naturalists offer guided hikes soon after the Island Packers boats arrive on the island. A variety of guided hikes are offered during weekends that Island Packers drops off campers. In addition, private boaters may arrange for a guided hike by contacting the San Miguel Island ranger on marine radio channel 16 or by contacting park headquarters at 805-658-5730.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Several trails traverse San Miguel Island providing visitors with spectacular hiking opportunities. While many parts of the island are closed to protect wildlife, fragile plants, and geological features, several areas are open for you to explore. Visitors may explore the two-mile long-Cuyler Harbor beach and one-mile-long trail to the ranger station on their own. To see other parts of the island, such as Point Bennett or the caliche forest, you must go with a ranger or volunteer. As described above, they are usually available to lead hikes. All hikers must stay on the trails to protect fragile vegetation and for visitor safety. No off-trail hiking is allowed.<br /> <br /> <strong>Camping</strong><br /> Primitive camping is only available at the established campground near the historic Lester ranch site (nine sites; $15 per night per site; reservations required). Picnic table, food storage box, windbreak, and pit toilet are provided. Water is not available and there is no shade. Distance from the boat landing at Cuyler Harbor beach to the campground is a steep, uphill over one-mile hike. Pack gear in backpacks for hauling uphill and waterproof for a possible wet landing. Campers should be prepared for a variety of weather conditions. Thirty-knot winds are not uncommon. Sturdy, low-profile tents, stakes, and line for securing tents to ground, table, or wind shelters are recommended. Fog can occur during any season producing cool, damp conditions. Due to the boat schedule, minimum stay is generally three days.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watersports</strong><br /> Due to the strong, persistent wind,swimming, snorkeling, diving, and kayaking are limited and recommended for the experienced visitor only. In addition, landing and beach access is only allowed at Cuyler Harbor. Despite the wind, Cuyler Harbor is one of the most scenic beaches in the park.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fishing</strong><br /> No fishing is allowed within the marine reserves located around the island. Fishing is allowed outside of these areas. To fish in Channel Islands National Park, possession of a valid California state fishing license with an ocean enhancement stamp is required and all California Department of Fish and Game regulations apply.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wildlife/Wildflower Viewing</strong><br /> The reward for enduring the long boat ride, the wind, and the fog is exceptional wildlife viewing. Although the guided, 16-mile roundtrip hike to Point Bennett requires some stamina, visitors get a chance to see one of the largest congregations of wildlife in the world-over 30,000 animals and up to five different species. Cuyler Harbor offers exceptional seabird viewing thanks to Prince Island that hosts 13 nesting seabirds, making it one of the most important and biologically diverse nesting habitats on the West Coast of North America. There is also very good seabird viewing on the boat ride over. Tell boat staff you are interested in seeing seabirds and they will help keep a lookout. Given the wind, landbirds are best spotted in Nidever Canyon. The island fox is secretive, but is occasionally seen around the campground area. San Miguel Island's native vegetation has made a remarkable recovery after years of grazing by nonnative animals. In some spots, the island coreopsis are head high. During a normal year of rainfall, wildflowers are best viewed in late winter and spring. In addition, some plants like gumplant, buckwheat, poppies, and verbena continue to bloom during the summer. Fortunately, the only accessible tidepool location on the island happens to be a very good one. No ranger escort is needed to hike to the tidepools at the eastern end of Cuyler Harbor.</p> <p><br /> <strong><em>Ethnographic Island Place Names</em></strong><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

From the dock, visitors must climb 200 feet along a ¼-mile trail to the top of the island.<br /> <br /> <b>Historical Information</b><br /> Around 1916, Alvin Hyder rebuilt the pier at the landing, where they unloaded supplies and equipment with a boom. Hyder rigged a sled on wood tracks down the steep slope between the landing and house. According to Buster Hyder, Alvin's son, \"We had a sled on the track that we let up and down with a long rope. That was all volcanic rock we had to drill to cement those spikes in for the track. Talk about workin'. We done it all with pick and shovel. The tracks went right up over the top of the hill. We used the sled for getting everything heavy to the top of the island or back down. The bottom of the track was set on the landing, and when the sled would come down, we would come down, we'd fill it up.\"<br /> <br /> Buster Hyder recalled keeping the rounded out two-by-four wooden tracks greased with oil. A horse pulled the sled up the track, and the people lowered it by hand. The horse named Dan, listened for a signal from below to start hauling, and stopped in just the right place when the load was at the barn. Hyder family members widened the existing narrow trail from the landing to the houses, breaking up the volcanic rock with picks; ten-year-old Buster was then assigned to keep it clear of rocks and dirt with a shovel.<br /> <br /> By 1942, the Navy, as part the Santa Barbara Island Coastal Lookout Station, completed the construction of a new dock and a small-gauge steel rail tramway with metal car that ran from the dock to the Quonset huts at the top of the cliffs above the landing cove. The tramway was operated by an electric-powered winch in a shed.<br /> <br /> The landing dock area had two levels, the first that was reached by a vertical ladder from a small boat. Large boats could not get close to the landing because of the shallow water and shore structure. The second level was connected to the lower landing by stairs. The upper landing had an open shed used for storing gear, a large I-beam with a trolley for hoisting heavy loads, and the lower section of a rail tramway.<br /> <br /> A hoisting unit for the tram car was located at the top of the bluff at the upper station of the rail tramway. The prime mover was a Ford V-8 engine. The hoist was equipped with about 250 feet of 1/2\" steel wire rope. The free end of the rope was attached to the tram car.<br /> <br /> The NPS updated the dock a couple of times prior to a complete reconstruction in the early 1980s when a new dock with a hoist and a boathouse were built. However, just like the Hyder and Navy dock, this NPS dock was frequently damaged by strong winter storms, including in 2016 and again in 2018.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "If you are standing on the steps, with the dock platform on your left, facing the water, you are looking into a small cove, surrounded by a steep, rocky slopes. At the shoreline, the slopes extended into flatter ledges that are often occupied by pinnipeds-furry, tan, torpedo-shaped sea mammals. Here, the pinnipeds usually include sea lions and much larger elephant seals. They all have dog-like heads, but tiny or barely visible ears, and make loud barking sounds. The sea lions have large flippers, and are more agile on land. The elephant seals have short flippers and short snouts on their heads. The pinnipeds are also often seen swimming and diving in the waters of the cove. Just offshore is a small sea rock, which often has more pinnipeds lounging about. <br /><br />To your left is the tall dock. It is supported by sturdy, upright posts, with some additional planks crossed like an \"x\" in between them. The dock's wooden platform is about 20 feet above the waterline. A wooden railing surrounds the edge of the platform. In the center of the platform is a single story building roofed with curved red clay tiles. The building has two small windows under the eaves of the roof. Two doors open onto the platform, facing the cove. Close to the edge of the platform is a large mechanical device. A rounded column about 3 feet in diameter and 5 feet high is bolted to the platform. On top of this is a giant hinge, like a shoulder, with a long metal arm extending outward. A spool of black cable is visible on top of the giant hinge. Various small boxes and other equipment are also located on the dock.<br /><br />Behind you, stairs, with a railing, continue up a steep, rocky hillside covered with grasses and scrubby plants. Depending on the season, you may see coreopsis, with a thick, bare trunk, topped by a shaggy mop of yellow flowers and feathery green leaves, shaped like fluffy ostrich feathers and yarrow with mounds of white flowers.<br /><br />In late summer, fall or winter, the grass will be brown, and the coreopsis will turn into waist-high brown stalks that look dead. <br /><br />At the top of the stairs, the path continues as a dirt trail. The climb from the landing cove to the ranger station is about 200 feet along a Â¼ mile trail.",

    "bodyText": "<p><em>siwotʰ is the Tongva word for Santa Barbara Island. It means 'captain.'<br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> <br /> The smallest of the Channel Islands is deceptive. From a distance, this one-square-mile island may look a bit barren. Upon closer examination, the island offers more than one would expect-an island of resting elephant seals, blooming yellow flowers, tumbling Scripps's murrelet chicks, and rich cultural history. Santa Barbara Island is the center of a chain of jewels, a crossroads for people and animals.<br /> <br /> Santa Barbara Island is 38 miles from the closest point on the mainland. The smallest of the California Channel Islands, it is only one square mile in size, or 639 acres. Formed by underwater volcanic activity, the island is roughly triangular in outline and emerges from the ocean as a giant, twin-peaked mesa with steep cliffs. In 1602 explorer Sebastian Vizcaino named the island in honor of the saint whose day is December 4th, the day he arrived.<br /> <br /> Visitors can witness the incredible recovery of the island's plant life and wildlife after years of habitat and species loss due to ranching and farming activities, including the introduction of nonnative plants, rabbits, and cats. Although nonnative grasses still dominate the landscape, native vegetation is recovering slowly with the help of the National Park Service's restoration efforts. After winter rains, the native plants of the island come alive with color. The strange tree sunflower, or coreopsis, blossoms with bright yellow bouquets. Other plants, like the endemic Santa Barbara Island live-forever, shrubby buckwheat, chickory, and cream cups, add touches of color to the island's palette.<br /> <br /> This recovery of native vegetation, along with the removal of nonnative predators, has aided in the reestablishment of nesting land birds. Today there are 14 landbirds that nest annually on the island. Three of these, the horned lark, orange-crowned warbler, and house finch, are endemic subspecies found only on Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the island's recovery did not come soon enough for the endemic Santa Barbara Island song sparrow. The destruction of this sparrow's sagebrush and coreopsis nesting habitat and the presence of feral cats led to the extinction of this species in the 1960s. This sparrow, which was found only on Santa Barbara Island and is now lost forever, was one of the smallest forms of song sparrow, differentiated by its very gray back.<br /> <br /> Seabird colonies have also benefited from the recovery of Santa Barbara Island. The island is one of the most important seabird nesting sites within the Channel Islands, with 11 nesting species. Thousands of western gulls nest every year on the island, some right along the trailside. Fluffy chicks hatch in June and mature to fly away from the nest in July. The steep cliffs also provide nesting sites for the endangered California brown pelicans, three species of cormorants, three species of storm-petrels, and one of the world's largest colonies of Scripps's murrelets.<br /> <br /> The rocky shores of Santa Barbara Island also provide resting and breeding areas for California sea lions, harbor seals, and northern elephant seals. These marine mammals feed in the rich kelp forests surrounding the island. The raucous barking of sea lions can be heard from most areas of the island. Overlooks, such as Sea Lion Rookery, Webster Point, and Elephant Seal Cove, provide excellent spots to look down on seals and sea lions. Visitors can also jump in the water to see what lies beneath the ocean surface. Snorkeling in the Landing Cove, visitors can see bright sea stars, spiny sea urchins, and brilliant orange Garibaldi fish. California sea lions and occasional harbor seals frequent the Landing Cove waters and the surrounding rocky ledges.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Island Facts</strong></u></p> <p>- Located in Santa Barbara County.<br /> <br /> - Fifty-four miles from Ventura; 38 miles from the nearest mainland (San Pedro); 24 miles from Santa Catalina Island.<br /> <br /> - Approximately 1.5 miles wide by one mile long; one square mile; 639 acres.<br /> <br /> - Average rainfall-12 inches.<br /> <br /> - Tallest peak-Signal Peak, 634 ft.<br /> <br /> - Home to 14 endemic plant species and subspecies that occur only on the Channel Islands. Forms of buckwheat, dudleya, cream cups, and chicory are found only on Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> - The endemic, threatened island night lizard occurs only on Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, and San Clemente Islands.<br /> <br /> - The island's cliffs offer perfect nesting habitat for one of the world's largest breeding colonies of Scripps's murrelets, rare seabirds.<br /> <br /> - Absence of freshwater led the Tongva and Chumash to use the island on a seasonal basis and as a stopover between Santa Catalina and San Nicolas Islands.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Things To Do</strong></u><br /> One-day trips and overnight camping are options when visiting Santa Barbara Island. However, this island is more challenging to get to due to the limited transportation schedule. As with all the Channel Islands, visiting Santa Barbara Island is an exercise in preparation and self-reliance. Since there are no services on the islands, there are no remedies for poor planning once you have arrived.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boat Transportation</strong><br /> Island Packers offers trips April through October. Travel time is about three hours. Landing is at the Landing Cove where visitors step from the boat onto a ladder to a small dock. From the dock, visitors must climb 200 feet along a Â¼-mile trail to the top of the island. More...<br /> <br /> <strong>Goods and Services</strong><br /> There are no goods, services, or accommodations (lodging) available on the island. Visitors must bring all their own food and supplies. Public phones are not available.<br /> <br /> <strong>Water</strong><br /> There is no water available on the island. Visitors must bring all their water with them.<br /> <br /> <strong>Picnicking</strong><br /> Picnic tables are available at the visitor center.<br /> <br /> <strong>Visitor Center</strong><br /> A small visitor center is located on the island. Features include displays on the natural and cultural resources of the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Interpretive Programs</strong><br /> On days that the concessionaire boats run to the islands, guided hikes may be offered by national park volunteers or concessionaire naturalists. If they are not available to lead hikes, self-guided interpretive trail booklets are available. Hikes generally begin 30 minutes after the concession boats arrive on the island. A variety of guided hikes may also be offered during weekends that Island Packers drops off campers.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Once visitors have scaled the rugged cliffs using the steep trail from the Landing Cove, they will find just over five miles of trails that meander over gentle slopes and low mountain tops to dramatic overlooks and magnificent coastal views. All hikers must stay on the trails for visitor safety and to protect fragile vegetation and nesting seabirds. No off- trail hiking is allowed. Portions of trails are subject to closure when pelicans are nesting from January through August.<br /> <br /> <strong>Camping</strong><br /> Primitive camping is available (10 sites; $15 per night per site; reservations required). Picnic table, food storage box, and pit toilet are provided. No water is available. Distance from landing to campground is a quarter-mile and includes a 200-foot climb. Due to the boat schedule, minimum stay is generally three days.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watersports</strong><br /> Santa Barbara Island is an ideal place for swimming, diving, snorkeling, and kayaking, but there are no lifeguards on the island. Since Santa Barbara Island is a cliff island, access to the water is only at the Landing Cove via a dock. There are no other accessible beaches unless you have a watercraft. Excellent watersports can be experienced at the Landing Cove. The underwater visibility is usually very good and the water is teeming with life. Kayaking north towards Arch Point or south towards the Sea Lion Rookery provides great wildlife viewing, sea caves, and arches. Experienced kayakers can circumnavigate the island's five-mile coastline.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fishing</strong><br /> No fishing is allowed within the marine reserves located around the island. Fishing is allowed outside of these areas. To fish in Channel Islands National Park, possession of a valid California state fishing license with an ocean enhancement stamp is required and all California Department of Fish and Game regulations apply.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wildlife/Wildflower Viewing</strong><br /> There is excellent wildlife viewing on Santa Barbara Island. A variety of seabirds can be seen throughout the year, including brown pelicans, cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and western gulls (gull nesting and chicks can be observed from the end of April through July). Seals and sea lions may also be viewed from Landing Cove and from the Sea Lion Rookery and Elephant Seal Cove overlooks. Santa Barbara Island is a great place to see the recovery of native vegetation with incredible wildflower displays. During a normal year of rainfall, wildflowers are best viewed in late winter and spring. The brilliant yellow coreopsis flowers usually peak between late January and March. In addition, some plants like gumplant, buckwheat, poppies, and verbena continue to bloom during the summer. Tidepools are not accessible from Santa Barbara Island. However, at a very low tide some intertidal plants and animals are visible from the dock or on the small shelf in front of the dock.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>History and Culture Overview</strong></u><br /> The smallest of the Channel Islands, Santa Barbara Island is about thirty-eight miles from the mainland and is centrally located in relation to all eight of the offshore islands. Surrounded by sheer cliffs on all sides, the island sits alone in the sea with only little Sutil Islet and Shag Rock to the southwest and northeast respectively to keep it company. Few beaches are found on the island, and those that are prove to be rocky and often treacherous to reach. The island has a pastoral quality with rolling slopes and a wide saddle between twin peaks, the taller of the two reaching 634 feet. Santa Barbara Island is home to native seabird colonies, barking sea lions, and a rich cultural history.<br /> <br /> <strong>Native Occupation and European Contact</strong><br /> Due to the lack of fresh water and few terrestrial resources, Santa Barbara Island most likely did not support any permanent native settlements. Recent studies show evidence that occupation of the island dates back at least 4,000 years, suggesting seasonal visits to the island. Southern California Indians would have been drawn to the island by the rich marine life surrounding the rocky shores, being able to fish, harvest shellfish and hunt pinnipeds, as well as manufacture tools.<br /> <br /> Since early European explorers did not leave any indication of landing on the island, no information about native island use or occupancy of the island has come from those sources. Although the explorers did see the small island, it did not receive much documentation. Cabrillo's chroniclers dubbed the southern islands, which included Santa Barbara, the \"other islands of San Lucas.\" Sebastian Vizcaino gave the island its name in honor of the saint whose day was December 4, the day he arrived, in 1602.<br /> <br /> <strong>Early History</strong><br /> Santa Barbara Island came into the possession of the United States in 1848 and has continued in U.S. government ownership since that time. Early government surveys done in 1853 and 1871 provided a topographic map of the island and Signal Peak was given its name when a triangulation signal was used at its highest point. While no leases were recorded on the island prior to 1909, people did periodically occupy the island. In The Land of Sunshine, published in 1897, author J. R. Britton compared the island's profile to that of a camel; he wrote that \"upon the higher hump stands the decaying beacon of the U. S. Coast Survey.\" He also noted \"a narrow shelf where a crayfisherman has built a hut of lath and canvas.\"<br /> <br /> Fisherman and hunter Heman Bay Webster lived on Santa Barbara Island as a squatter in the 1890s. He built a cabin in 1896 near the arch on the island's northwest point that now bears his name, Webster Point. In a 1940 interview, he recalled \"abundant\" cats living on the island until disease diminished their numbers. Webster was at home with the elements, going barefoot and having interests in other islands, mainly Anacapa where he ran sheep. Other men made Santa Barbara Island a regular port around the turn of the century as well. Buster Hyder recalled that Carl Jergensen and Bert Johnson spent years fishing for lobsters at Gull Rock (Sutil Island) in Thor, a boat built by Hyder's father.<br /> <br /> The U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor began leasing the island for agricultural and recreation purposes in 1900, advertising the island for a five-year lease in newspapers along the coast. J.G. Howland, being the highest bidder, obtained the first recorded lease of Santa Barbara Island on July 6, 1909. Soon after, Howland sublet the island to C.B. Linton for the purpose of propagating pearls in abalone. After five years, Howland did not renew his lease on the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Hyder Family</strong><br /> In the spring of 1914, public notices were again posted for a five year lease of Santa Barbara Island. Two bids were received, T.D. Webster of Carpinteria and Alvin Hyder of San Pedro; Hyder made the higher bid of $250 a year and acquired the lease on June 16, 1914. The largest settlement of people on the island in historic times moved onto the island with Hyder. At one time around 1915, about fifteen people lived on the little island including Alvin's wife Nora and son Denton O., \"Buster\", as well as his two brothers and their wives.<br /> <br /> The year prior to the families' arrival, Hyder and his brothers had built a house near the edge of the island 100 yards south of and 150 feet above the landing. They anchored the house to the ground by cables so the wind would not blow it off the cliff. Hyder rebuilt the pier at the landing, where supplies and equipment were unloaded with a boom. To provide relief from carrying goods up and down 150 feet, he rigged a sled on wood tracks down the steep slope between the landing and the house.<br /> <br /> Since the island had no springs or flowing water, the Hyders constructed a system of reservoirs. They built two large concrete cisterns at the house and brought water on Nora II from the mainland. In 1918 they installed a Rambler auto engine to pump the water to the house from the landing. They searched the island for water sources, even looking for fresh water deep in sea caves, with no luck. Any collecting methods possible were used, no matter how disgusting. Buster recalled how \"you had to limit your drinking water. It had to last a year. Then it got stagnant. Many times when it was raining I'd drink water out of horse tracks. No kiddin'.\" Buster had the job of removing dead mice from the drinking water supply every day. \"Boy, it was hard to drink it. But when you don't have anything else, you have to drink it.\"<br /> <br /> In the early decades of the century, people made good money raising rabbits, marketing the meat and selling the pelts. Following the trend, the Hyders brought hundreds of pure black and pure white Belgian hares out to the island and turned them loose. They also brought about 300 sheep to the island in 1915, the first known sheep to graze there, where they would be fattened and sold for meat. The Hyders also had two horses, Dan and Charlie, and two mules, Jack and Beck, which they kept in a barn they built. Along with these animals, the Hyders also kept goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys and geese on the island.<br /> <br /> The Hyder lease expired in 1919 but they stayed on anyway. After seven years of hard work and frustration, they decided to leave the island in 1922. They took their twelve goats, 300 sheep, dogs and four horses to their homestead in Cuyama Valley north of Santa Barbara. Following the terms of the lease, they tore down the buildings and brought the materials to the mainland, although they failed to remove the main house. Reportedly Alvin Hyder tried to lease Santa Barbara Island for another term without success; an entrepreneur from Venice outbid him. Nevertheless, he took 250 sheep back to the island for fattening many years after their lease had run out.<br /> <br /> <strong>Government Activities on Santa Barbara Island</strong><br /> After the Hyders left the island, several attempts to lease and build resorts were made, but none succeeded. No major improvements were made to the island until the government built lighthouses. As early as 1853 government officers made note of the potential of Santa Barbara Island for lighthouse purposes. However, it would take 75 years to get a navigational aid built on Santa Barbara Island. On July 27, 1928, the Bureau of Lighthouses authorized an automatic light on the northerly point of the island \"for the protection of inter-island navigation in general and particularly for the protection of the Hawaiian Island and trans-Pacific traffic, which follows a course passing six miles to the northward of the island.\" In 1934, a second light tower went up on the south end of the island, on the westerly side, located 486 feet above the water and visible for twelve miles. When Santa Barbara Island became part of the Channel Islands National Monument in 1938, two parcels of land and right of entry were retained for by the government for lighthouse purposes.<br /> <br /> In April 1936, the Commandant of the 11th Naval District requested permission to install and maintain a range finder marker on Santa Barbara Island. The Navy built a tower about ninety feet tall at the highest point on the island, 634-foot Signal Peak, which was probably removed by 1942 when the Army Signal Corps installed radar on the island. At the outbreak of World War II, the military ordered both lights to be temporarily extinguished. They were relit in 1943 when the immediate threat to Los Angeles Harbor was felt to be over. During the war, the Navy took over responsibility for U. S. Coast Guard activities, including aids to navigation, and instituted a program of timed blackouts of coastal lights in case of enemy attack. The Navy also set up Coastal Lookout Stations on the island to help prevent attacks on the mainland.<br /> <br /> <strong>Santa Barbara Island and Channel Islands National Monument</strong><br /> As early as 1932, the Bureau of Lighthouses suggested transferring Santa Barbara Island, as well as Anacapa Island, to the National Park Service for preservation. Not until 1938 did the National Park Service respond, and on April 26, the island became part of the newly designated Channel Islands National Monument, encompassing Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands. On June 28, 1939 NPS biologists E. Lowell Sumner, Jr. and R. M. Bond submitted a report on the biology of the islands suggesting protection of the island by the Coast Guard and State Division of Fish and Game, as well as posting signs in order to alert visitors of the island's new Monument status.<br /> <br /> In 1949 the monument boundaries were expanded to include \"the area within one (1) nautical mile of the shoreline of Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands.\" On Santa Barbara Island, this meant that the rocky beaches, offshore rocks and Sutil Island and Shag Rock would be protected. The Channel Islands National Monument was moved from the supervision by Sequoia National Park to be overseen by Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego in 1957. Rabbits and vandalism became major problems on the isolated island, but by the time it became part of the Channel Islands National Park in 1980, the rabbits were gone and vandalism was declining.<br /> <br /> To help develop the island for visitor use, the National Park Service constructed a new dock and ranger residence on the island in 1991. Extensive habitat restoration efforts have been underway on Santa Barbara Island to increase the native plant and bird populations which were destroyed after years of rabbit and sheep grazing. Today, visitors can camp, hike trails covering the whole island, snorkel and kayak to see the beautiful natural environment this small, remote island has to offer.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>Ethnographic Island Place Names</strong></u><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Pituophis catenifer pumilis</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is a dwarf endemic species rarely exceeding three feet in length. Contrary to earlier reports of only existing on that island, it is also found on Santa Rosa Island. The species is related to king snakes and rat snake, and is harmless to humans. Its somewhat threatening behavior, mimicking the rattlesnake, will sometimes get individuals of the species killed unnecessarily.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is one of many endemic species in the national park.<br />  </li> <li>When threatened, the species will elevate and inflate its body, flatten its head into a triangular shape, hiss loudly, and quickly shake its tail back and forth to make a buzzing sound which may be a mimic of a rattlesnake rattle.<br />  </li> <li>A powerful constrictor; the gopher snake kills prey by suffocating them in body coils or by pressing the animal against the walls of their underground burrows.<br />  </li> <li>Due to the more limited fauna of the islands, Santa Cruz Island gopher snake has a less varied diet than other subspecies of gopher snakes.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake, <em>Pituophis catenifer pumilus</em> (<em>pumilio</em> is Latin for \"dwarf\"), is just as its Latin translation indicates, a dwarf race rarely exceeding 3 feet in length. By contrast, the Pacific gopher snake, its mainland cousin, can reach 7 feet in length. The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is the only dwarf form of the species, even though three other subspecies also occur on islands (<em>P. c. fulginatus, insulanus</em>, and <em>coronalis</em>).</p> <p>The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake has a rather narrow head that is only slightly wider than the neck and when compared to other races, has a short and flattened snout and a rounded rostral. The adult coloration is typically a light greenish or grayish-white background with a profuse pattern of gloss-black blotches, becoming \"muddied\" or less contrasting with age. Males tend to pull up some bright yellow on their anterior ventral surfaces as they grow. Hatchlings are highly contrasted, being a very light grayish-white with black patterning and range in length from 6.5 to 9 inches.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is found on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands. On the mainland, gopher snakes are found widely throughout western North America.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake, like its mainland congeners, is a habitat generalist. It can be found in all vegetation associations on the two islands, but it is most common in open areas such as grasslands, dry streambeds, and oak and chaparral woodlands.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Due to the more limited fauna of the islands, Santa Cruz Island gopher snakes have a less varied diet than other subspecies of gophersnakes. Their diet probably includes mice, lizards, birds' eggs, and nestlings. Juveniles probably take small lizards, mice, and possibly insects.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> In spring, juveniles and adults emerge from rodent burrows or rock fissures, where they hibernate during the colder months of fall and winter. Adults probably reproduce in May with females depositing clutches (generally, four to six eggs) from late June through July and hatchlings emerging in September and October.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The California Department for Fish and Game lists the Santa Cruz Island gopher snake as a California Species of Special Concern. The recent removal of feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island was beneficial for Santa Cruz Island gopher snakes. Feral pigs destroyed habitat for snakes and preyed on them as well.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/p.c.pumilis.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/p.c.pumilis.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/p_c_pumilis.html\">http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/p_c_pumilis.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.channelislandsrestoration.com/sci/gophersnakeinfo.htm\">http://www.channelislandsrestoration.com/sci/gophersnakeinfo.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://slitherbriggs.webs.com/pcpumilis.htm\">http://slitherbriggs.webs.com/pcpumilis.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/311573/details\">http://eol.org/pages/311573/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/species.html\">http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/species.html</a></li> </ul>",

It means 'in the ocean' or deriving from muwu which means 'ocean, or any large body of water.'<br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> According to legend, Santa Cruz Island was named for a priest's staff accidentally left on the island during the Portola expedition of 1769. A Chumash Indian found the cross-tipped stave and returned it to the priest. The Spaniards were so impressed that they called this island of friendly people \"La Isla de Santa Cruz,\" the Island of the Sacred Cross. Today the protection and preservation of Santa Cruz Island is divided between The Nature Conservancy and the National Park Service. The Nature Conservancy owns and manages the western 76 percent of the island, while the eastern 24 percent is owned and managed by the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> In its vastness and variety of flora, fauna, and geology, Santa Cruz Island resembles a miniature California. At over 96 square miles in size and the largest island in California, Santa Cruz contains two rugged mountain ranges; the highest peaks on the islands (rising above 2,000 feet); a large central valley/fault system; deep canyons with year-round springs and streams; and 77 miles of craggy coastline cliffs, giant sea caves, pristine tidepools, and expansive beaches. One of the largest and deepest sea caves in the world, Painted Cave, is found on the northwest coastline of Santa Cruz. Named because of its colorful rock types, lichens, and algae, Painted Cave is nearly a quarter mile long and 100 feet wide, with an entrance ceiling of 160 feet and a waterfall over the entrance in the spring.<br /> These varied landforms support more than 600 plant species in 10 different plant communities, from marshes and grasslands to chaparral and pine forests. There are 140 landbird and 11 land mammal species; three amphibian and five reptile species; large colonies of nesting seabirds, breeding seals, and sea lions; and other diverse marine animals and plants. Owing to millions of years of isolation, many distinctive plant and animals species have adapted to the island's unique environment, including the island scrub-jay and eight plant species found only on Santa Cruz and nowhere else in the world.<br /> <br /> The island is also rich in cultural history with over 10,000 years of American Indian habitation and over 150 years of European exploration and ranching. Santa Cruz Island, known by the Chumash people as Limuw (translates to \"in the sea\"), was home to a ten villages that housed over 1,200 people. Many of these islanders mined extensive chert deposits for making tools and produced \"shell-bead money,\" used as a major trade item by tribes throughout California. The largest village on the island as well as on the northern Channel Islands, Swaxil, occupied the area of Scorpion Ranch at the time of Spanish contact (1542). Large plank canoes, called tomols, provided transportation between the islands and mainland. Remnants of Chumash civilization can still be seen in thousands of shell middens on the island.<br /> <br /> Remnants of the ranching era also can be seen throughout the landscape of the island. Adobe ranch houses, barns, blacksmith and saddle shops, wineries, and a chapel all attest to the many uses of Santa Cruz in the 1800s and 1900s.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service, along with The Nature Conservancy, has made great efforts to preserve and protect these island resources, including stabilization of cultural sites, rehabilitation of historic buildings, removal of nonnative plants and animals, the recovery island foxes, reestablishment of bald eagles, and restoration of island wetlands. All of these efforts have made Santa Cruz Island one of the best places to experience the nationally significant natural and cultural heritage of coastal southern California.</p> <p><br /> <u><strong>Island Facts</strong></u></p> <p>- Located in Santa Barbara County.<br /> <br /> - Twenty miles from Ventura.<br /> <br /> - Santa Cruz is California's largest island, almost three times the size of Manhattan. Approximately 24 miles long and up to six miles wide; 96 square miles; 62,000 acres; 77-mile shoreline.<br /> <br /> - Average rainfall-20 inches. Temperature range-20Â° F to 100Â° F.<br /> <br /> - Diablo Peak (Devil's Peak) is the tallest peak on the Channel Islands at 2,450 ft.<br /> <br /> - Painted Cave is one of the largest known sea caves in the world.<br /> <br /> - Santa Cruz has the greatest number of plant and animal species of all the Channel Islands, including over 60 endemic, or unique, species.<br /> <br /> - The island scrub-jay is only found on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> - In spring 2006 Santa Cruz Island was home to the first bald eagle chick to hatch unaided by humans on the Channel Islands in over 50 years.</p> <p><br /> <u><strong>Things to Do</strong></u></p> <p>Santa Cruz Island is the perfect place for a one-day trip and short or long overnight camping trips. This is the easiest island to get to, has the best weather, and offers the most recreational activities. As with all the Channel Islands, visiting Santa Cruz Island is an exercise in preparation and self-reliance. Since there are no services on the islands, there are no remedies for poor planning once you have arrived.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boat Transportation</strong><br /> Island Packers offers trips year round. Travel time is one hour. Trips are either to Scorpion Anchorage or Prisoners Harbor. Landing is via a pier at both locations.<br /> <br /> <strong>Goods and Services</strong><br /> Channel Islands Adventure Company, the authorized kayak guide and outfitting concession in the Scorpion Anchorage area, operates guided sea kayak tours, limited convenience item sales (no food items), snorkel equipment rentals, and guided snorkel tours at Scorpion Anchorage on Santa Cruz Island only. There are no other goods, services, or accommodations (lodging) available on the island. Visitors must bring all their own food and supplies. Public phones are not available.<br /> <br /> <strong>Water</strong><br /> There is water available at Scorpion Anchorage. However, there is no water at Prisoners Harbor so visitors must bring all their water with them.<br /> <br /> <strong>Picnicking</strong><br /> At Scorpion Anchorage, picnic tables are available at the beach and near the ranch area. At Prisoners Harbor, tables are located near the beach.<br /> <br /> <strong>Visitor Center</strong><br /> A visitor center is located in the historic Scorpion ranch house. There are no other visitor centers on the island. The visitor center includes an orientation area that helps visitors plan a safe trip on the island and a variety of interactive exhibits that describe the island's tremendous biodiversity, rich cultural history, and current resource issues.<br /> <br /> <strong>Interpretive Programs</strong><br /> On days that the concessionaire boats run to Scorpion Anchorage and Prisoners Harbor, guided hikes may be offered by national park volunteers or concessionaire naturalists. If they are not available to lead hikes, self-guided interpretive trail booklets are available. Hikes generally begin 30 minutes after the Island Packers boats arrive on the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Several trails and roads traverse eastern Santa Cruz Island, providing visitors with spectacular hiking opportunities. These trails and roads range from the maintained, relatively flat, signed trails of Scorpion Valley to the unmaintained, rugged, mountainous paths of the MontaÃ±on area. While visitors may explore the national park property on Santa Cruz Island, no hiking is allowed beyond the national park boundary onto The Nature Conservancy property. The boundary is the property line (marked by a fence line) between Prisoners Harbor and Valley Anchorage.<br /> <br /> <strong>Camping</strong><br /> Primitive camping is available at the Scorpion Ranch Campground (31 sites; $15 per night per site; reservations required). Water, picnic table, food storage box, and pit toilet are provided. Shade is available. Distance from landing is a flat one-half mile. This is the most family friendly campground on the islands. Backcountry camping is available year round at the Del Norte campsite near Prisoners Harbor. This is currently the only backcountry campground on the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watersports</strong><br /> The mixed sand and cobblestone Scorpion Beach is a world-class destination for swimming, diving, snorkeling, and kayaking because of easy beach access, clear ocean waters, nearby camping, year-round Island Packers boat transportation, extensive kelp forests, and a spectacular shoreline with sea caves to explore. However, there are no lifeguards on the island. For snorkeling and diving, the easiest kelp beds to access are the ones near the pier and those to the eastern end of of the bay. Beach access is also available at Prisoners Harbor and by hiking over to Smugglers Cove, but the snorkeling is not as good at these locations. Kayaking east towards Scorpion Rock or west towards Cavern Point provides great wildlife viewing and sea caves. Kayaking from Prisoners Harbor is also very scenic.<br /> <br /> For the authorized kayak guide and outfitting concession in the Scorpion Anchorage area on Santa Cruz Island visit: Channel Islands Adventure Company. For kayak guide and outfitting services in other areas of Santa Cruz Island (excluding Scorpion area), visit the Visitor Services List.<br /> <br /> Several locations on Santa Cruz Island offer good surfing. Generally, the north shore is best during the northwest swells of winter/spring and the south shore is best during the south swells of summer/fall. However, all surf spots are remote and are best accessed by private boat due to the island's rugged terrain and the hiking distance from the designated landing areas.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fishing</strong><br /> No fishing is allowed at Scorpion Anchorage since it is within a marine reserve. Fishing is allowed on Santa Cruz Island outside of the marine reserves. Possession of a valid California state fishing license with an ocean enhancement stamp is required and all California Department of Fish and Game regulations apply.<br /> <strong>Wildlife/Wildflower Viewing</strong><br /> A variety of seabirds can be seen throughout the year (especially around Scorpion Rock), but most birders go to the island to see the endemic island scrub-jay-only found on Santa Cruz Island and no other place in the world. Best viewing is at Prisoners Harbor, but they are also spotted around the Scorpion area as well. Island foxes are often seen around the ranch and campground at Scorpion Anchorage. Remember that it is illegal to directly or indirectly feed animals in the park. During a normal year of rainfall, wildflowers are best viewed in late winter and spring. In addition, some plants like gumplant, buckwheat, poppies, and verbena continue to bloom during the summer. Tidepooling at Scorpion Anchorage and Prisoners Harbor is limited. Better tidepools can be found at Smugglers Cove.<br /> <br /> <u><strong>History and Culture Overview</strong></u></p> <p>Santa Cruz Island, the largest and most diverse of the eight Channel Islands, has a long and varied history that is tied closely to its physical attributes. Its vast grasslands, coastal scrub vegetation, oak woodlands, and rich coastline sustained the Chumash for millennia and they maintained a number of villages and seasonal settlements on the island. For most of the nineteenth century, mariners found shelter in its coves and hunters and fishermen exploited the marine life. Immigrant ranchers grazed livestock, and the military took advantage of the island's strategic location.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash Civilization and European Contact</strong><br /> Archeological investigations indicate that Santa Cruz Island has been occupied for at least 9,000 years. The island was home to the largest population of island Chumash and developed a highly complex society dependent on marine harvest, craft specialization and trade with mainland groups. The Santa Cruz Island Chumash produced shell beads that they used for currency, which formed an important part of the overall Chumash economy. Those living on the east end of the island mined chert from the numerous island outcroppings to make tiny blades for drilling holes to make the shell disc beads. Native villagers had no known contact with outsiders until the 16th and early 17th centuries. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who is credited with the first European exploration of the California coast, observed at least six villages, though he and his crew never stopped at the island. The villages were called Niquipos, Mazul, Xuga, Nitel, Macamo, and Nimitapal. Cabrillo named the island San Lucas, although the Chumash called it Limuw.<br /> <br /> In 1602, Sebastian VizcaÃ­no led the last Spanish expedition to California. His map named Santa Cruz Island the Isla de Gente Barbuda (island of the bearded people). Between 1602 and 1769 there was no recorded European contact with the island. Considering, however, the amount of traffic passing the islands, a number of unrecorded visits were probably made. Finally, in 1769, the land-and-sea expedition of Don Gaspar de la Portola reached Santa Cruz Island. Traveling with him were Father Juan GonzÃ¡lez VizcaÃ­no and Father Francisco PalÃ³u. Father PalÃ³u wrote of Father VizcaÃ­no's visit to the Santa Cruz village of Xaxas that the missionaries on ship went ashore and \"they were well received by the heathen and presented with fish, in return for which the Indians were given some strings of beads.\" Upon returning to their ship the missionaries soon realized that they had forgotten their staff in the village. Father PalÃ³u wrote:<br /> <br /> \"They immediately gave it up as lost, on account of the cross that it carried for it was of iron, and it was known how the Indians coveted this metal. But they were so honest that at daybreak it was discovered that one of the little canoes of the island was coming to the ship, and that one of the heathen was carrying in his hand the staff with the holy cross. Climbing on board he delivered it to the father and after being rewarded returned to the island. For this reason it was called the Island of the Holy Cross (Santa Cruz), and as such it has been known ever since.\"<br /> <br /> The island was considered for establishment of a Catholic mission to serve the large Chumash population. When the mission at San Buenaventura was founded across the channel in 1782, it commenced the slow religious conversion of the Santa Cruz Chumash. In 1822, the last of the Chumash left the island for mainland California.<br /> <br /> <strong>Maritime Commerce</strong><br /> Santa Cruz served as a base for otter hunters, fishermen, and smugglers. Smugglers Cove, for instance, derived its name from these illicit activities. The Channel Islands often provided smugglers and bootleggers with convenient and isolated hideaways in which to store their goods for a time.<br /> <br /> George Nidever recalled hunting otter at Santa Cruz in the winter of 1835-1836. Working from a base camp at Santa Rosa Island, he and two others obtained 60 skins that season. Fishermen encamped on the island, trading fish for other goods from passing boats.<br /> <br /> <strong>Early Ownership</strong><br /> With Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government asserted its control over California. In an effort to increase the Mexican presence, the government began sending convicted criminals to populate many areas. Around 40 prisoners were sent to Santa Barbara where, upon arrival, they were sent to Santa Cruz Island. They lived for a short time in an area now known as Prisoners Harbor. Read more about their interesting story by following this link.<br /> <br /> Through a land grant from the Mexican government, Captain Andres Castillero became the first private owner of Santa Cruz Island from 1839 to 1857. When California became a state in 1850, the United States government required that land previously granted by Spanish and Mexican governments be proved before the Board of Land Commissioners. For twelve years Castillero's claim to Santa Cruz Island was disputed, even after his property had been sold. During Castillero's ownership, Dr. James B. Shaw, an English physician, acted as manager of the island. He built the island's first ranch house by 1855 and is thought to have brought the first French Merino sheep to the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Ranching on Santa Cruz Island</strong><br /> Andres Castillero sold the island to William Barron, a San Francisco businessman and co-owner of the company Barron, Forbes & Co., in 1857. During the twelve years that Barron owned the island, Dr. Shaw continued manage it as superintendent and was charged by Barron to expand the sheep ranching operation begun during the Castillero era. The Civil War significantly increased the demand for wool and by 1864 some 24,000 sheep grazed the hills and valleys of Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Shaw's island sheep ranch was well known by 1869, the year he left Santa Cruz. He imported cattle, horses, and sheep to the island and erected one of the earliest wharves along the California coast at Prisoners Harbor by 1869. He built corrals and houses for himself and his employees and expanded the road system. Shaw was the first rancher to ship sheep to San Francisco by steamer, some selling at $30 per animal. The press frequently praised the quality of sheep and wool coming from the Santa Cruz Island ranch. In 1859, the Sacramento Daily Union published an article about the sheep in the Santa Barbara area:<br /> <br /> \"Sheep of a much finer quality can be found in this county, and we doubt if anything superior can be found in the State than those owned by Dr. Shaw, on the island of Santa Cruz. Judging from the number of persons who have purchased from the doctor, for the purpose of raising sheep, Santa Barbara Country bids fair, in a few years, to be one of the greatest sheep producing sections in the state.\"<br /> <br /> When Barron sold the island in 1869, Shaw left for San Francisco and Los Alamos where he continued ranching. At that time, the gross proceeds from the ranch on Santa Cruz Island were supposedly $50,000.<br /> <br /> <strong>Justinian Caire and the Caire Ranch</strong><br /> William Barron sold the island to ten investors from San Francisco for $150,000. One of the investors, Justinian Caire, was a French immigrant and founder of a successful San Francisco hardware business that sold equipment to miners. By the late 1880s Caire had acquired all of the shares of the Santa Cruz Island Company which he and his colleagues had founded in 1869. He continued a successful livestock and ranching industry on the island for many years.<br /> <br /> From the ranch headquarters in the central valley (also called Rancho del Medio for its central location on the island), Justinian Caire developed an impressive agricultural operation with satellite ranches on the east and west ends of the island and at Prisoners Harbor, as well as seasonal and short-term ranches on other parts of the island. Diversified production, including wool, beef, wine, fruit and nuts, in addition to sustainable gardens, orchards and flocks of fowl, decreased the need to import food and goods from the mainland and sustained the ranching operations through the boom and bust cycles of the livestock industry.<br /> <br /> Caire brought architectural styles and culture from Europe and, during its heyday, more than 100 workers, mostly Italian but including French, American, Mexican Californian, and Indian, were employed at the ranch and worked as blacksmiths, masons, carpenters, painters, sheep-shearers, team drivers, vintners, butchers, dairymen and sailors. Caire's legacy is visible on the island in brick and stone ranch buildings, the groves of ornamental trees and fruit and nut orchards, the numerous dry stone masonry structures walls and dams, and the road system. Descendents of Justinian Caire still reside in California and many are active in the preservation of the island history.<br /> <br /> An extended and complicated series of litigation among Caire family members resulted in the division of the island and the sale of most of it in 1937. Justinian Caire's descendents retained 6,000 acres on the east end of the island, on which they continued the sheep ranching operation. Other family members sold the remaining 90 percent of the island to Los Angeles oilman Edwin Stanton in 1937.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Stanton Ranch</strong><br /> Edwin Stanton's purchase of the major part of Santa Cruz Island brought a major shift in agricultural production on the island. After trying for a short time to continue the sheep operation, he decided to switch to beef production. At the time, the beef industry in California was growing rapidly, with Santa Barbara County among the top ten beef producers in the state.<br /> <br /> The Stanton Ranch was a major part of Santa Barbara County's cattle industry between the 1940s and 1980s and, at 54,000 acres, was the largest in size. Neighboring Santa Rosa Island exceeded Stanton's cattle numbers on similar acreage.<br /> <br /> Edwin Stanton's ranch on Santa Cruz Island saw changes that reflected the evolution of cattle ranching in a working landscape. While retaining most of the 19th century structures dating from the Caire period, Stanton constructed a few buildings to meet the needs of his cattle ranch, the most notable of which is Rancho del Norte on the isthmus. Pasture fencing and corrals were altered to suit the cattle operation and an extensive water system was added to provide water to the cattle.<br /> <br /> <strong>The End of Island Ranching</strong><br /> The Gherini family, descendents of Justinian Caire, continued their sheep ranching operations on the east end of Santa Cruz Island until 1984, using Scorpion Ranch as their base. They managed the island with resident managers and laborers and often worked as a family during shearing and during the summer. Production dropped during the 1970s and 80s and the expense of ranching on a remote island rose. By 1984 the last ranch lessee vacated the island and a newly formed hunting club called Island Adventures leased the facilities from the Gherinis. The hunt club used the ranch houses at Scorpion and Smugglers to house guests who came to hunt the feral pigs and remaining sheep.<br /> <br /> With Edwin Stanton's death in 1964, his widow and son, Carey, re-incorporated the Santa Cruz Island Company and continued the cattle operations on the island. Carey Stanton died unexpectedly in 1987 at the ranch and was buried in the family plot in the island chapel yard at the Main Ranch. His personal possessions on the island, some of which dated to the Caire era, were left to the Santa Cruz Island Foundation. The real property passed to The Nature Conservancy through a prior agreement that Carey Stanton had established with the non-profit organization. The Nature Conservancy rapidly liquidated the cattle operation and ended the ranching era on the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Military Uses of Santa Cruz Island</strong><br /> The military forces of the United States took notice of Santa Cruz Island during World War II, and since that time have constructed and maintained strategic installations in the name of national security. Like all its neighbors, Santa Cruz Island served as an early warning outpost watching for enemy planes and ships during World War II. The Cold War brought the communications station as a part of the Pacific Missile Range. This station remains in operation, although not at the levels of its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s.<br /> <br /> <strong>The National Park Service</strong><br /> While Santa Cruz Island did not attain National Park designation until 1980, visitors and previous owners of the island have understood the resource values of the island and contemplated preserving the property as a park for perhaps 100 years.<br /> <br /> In 1936 the Caire family reportedly offered their 9/10ths of the island for $750,000 to the state of California for use as a state or federal park. Nothing came of this proposal and the property was sold to Edwin Stanton. Stanton's son and heir was not interested in a government purchase of his beloved island and took steps to avoid such events by forging an agreement with The Nature Conservancy and the property was transferred to the organization upon his death. Although Santa Cruz Island is included within the boundaries of Channel Islands National Park, The Nature Conservancy portion of the island does not belong to the park. A transfer of 8,500 acres from the Nature Conservancy to the park was completed in 2000.<br /> <br /> Channel Islands National Park owns and operates approximately 24 percent of Santa Cruz Island. Today, a combination of organizations which includes The Nature Conservancy, the National Park Service, the University of California Field Station, and the Santa Cruz Island Foundation work to protect the island's natural and historic resources.</p> <p><br /> <u><strong>Ethnographic Island Place Names</strong></u></p> <p>Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p> <p><br /> <u><strong>Restoring Santa Cruz Island</strong></u></p> <p>Close to the mainland yet worlds apart, Santa Cruz Island is home to plants and animals that are found nowhere else on Earth. Like the Galapagos Islands of South America, the Channel Islands exist in isolation, allowing evolution to proceed independently, fostering the development of 145 endemic or unique species. Santa Cruz Island is host to 60 of these endemic species. Some, like the island jay and the Santa Cruz Island silver lotus, are found only on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this isolation has also made these species vulnerable to extinction. The melodic song of the Santa Barbara Island song sparrow and the crimson flower of the Santa Cruz Island monkey flower are no longer heard or seen within the park. The destruction of these species' habitats by non-native, exotic plants and animals has caused their extinction along with eight other rare and unique island species. Once found only on the Channel Islands, they have been lost forever.<br /> <br /> To save 10 other island species, including the island fox, from the brink of extinction as well as to protect more than 3,000 internationally significant archeological sites, the National Park Service and The Nature Conservancy embarked upon a multi-year program to restore Santa Cruz Island. This restoration program was part of the National Park Service mission, as mandated by Congress, to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. As owner of over 70% of Santa Cruz Island, it is the mission of The Nature Conservancy to preserve the plants and animals that represent the diversity of life on Earth by protecting the land and waters they need to survive.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Problem</strong><br /> The National Park Service, The Nature Conservancy, and natural and cultural resource experts identified non-native feral pigs and non-native fennel (an invasive weed) as the most significant disturbances to the island's sensitive resources. Both pigs and fennel caused major direct impacts to native plant communities, rare plant species, and archeological sites.<br /> <br /> Pig rooting caused massive destruction of native species, resulting in bare ground that is easily eroded and colonized by invasive weeds, especially fennel. This activity was a factor in the decline of nine island plant species listed as threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<br /> <br /> Pig rooting also damaged a large number of archeological sites on the island that are associated with the Chumash native people who occupied the island from at least 9,000 years ago until the early 1800s. The feral pigs rooted three feet deep at a number of sites, completely disturbing and desecrating these sacred sites and destroying their archeological value.<br /> <br /> In addition, feral pigs played a pivotal role in the catastrophic decline of island foxes. Piglets provided a year-round food source for golden eagles, allowing these formerly rare or occasional visitors to expand their range and establish resident populations on the island that then prey on island foxes. Golden eagle predation placed the fox on the brink of extinction on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Solution</strong><br /> The consensus among numerous experts was that the eradication of feral pigs was the most important action that can be taken to protect and restore Santa Cruz Island. The National Park Service has had tremendous success restoring other islands in the park through the removal of non-native animals. The eradication of European rabbits from Santa Barbara Island and sheep and burros from San Miguel Island resulted in tremendous natural recovery. Feral pigs were eradicated from Santa Rosa Island in a similar program. Pig eradication began on Santa Cruz Island in 2005 and was completed in 2007.<br /> <br /> Other management actions to initiate recovery of the island ecosystem were also been implemented. Golden eagles were captured and relocated to northeast California. A captive breeding program for island foxes was established as insurance against losses due to golden eagles. This program was so successful in reestablishing a wild population that the program was shut down in 2008 and the island fox was removed from the endangered species list. Monitoring of the island fox population still continues.<br /> <br /> Also, native bald eagles were reintroduced. This predator disappeared in the 1950s due to DDT poisoning. Bald eagles eat fish, seabirds, and animal carcasses, not live foxes, and are very territorial. Once they mature, they establish territories and drive off any newly arriving golden eagles. In 2006, this program paid off. For the first time in more than 50 years, two bald eagle chicks were hatched unaided from two separate nests on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> This multi-year program to remove golden eagles, reintroduce bald eagles, breed island foxes, eradicate pigs, and control fennel helped restore the balance to Santa Cruz Island's naturally functioning ecosystem offering visitors one of the last opportunities to experience the nationally significant natural and cultural heritage of coastal southern California.</p>",

It means 'something in the middle of two other things,' as wima is between tuqan and limuw.<br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> Santa Rosa Island was included as part of Channel Islands National Park upon the park's inception on March 5, 1980. However, it wasn't until December 1986 that the island came under the ownership of the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> Located 40 nautical miles from the Channel Islands National Park visitor center in Ventura, Santa Rosa is the second largest island in California at approximately 53,000 acres in size. The island's relatively low profile is broken by a high, central mountain range, rising 1,589 feet at its highest point. Its coastal areas are variable, ranging from broad, sandy beaches gently sloping toward a dynamic ocean to sheer cliffs plunging toward the turmoil of a sea intent on changing the contour of the land.<br /> <br /> As on its larger neighbor, Santa Cruz Island, these varied landforms support a diverse array of plant and animal species. About 500 plant species can be found within nine plant communities, including six plant species found only on Santa Rosa and nowhere else in the world. One of these species, the Santa Rosa Island subspecies of Torrey pine, is considered one of the rarest pines in the world-the last enduring members of a once widespread Pleistocene forest. A remnant, mainland subspecies of Torrey pine also can be found near La Jolla, California, at Torrey Pines State Reserve. Santa Rosa Island also hosts over 100 bird and three mammal species (including the island's largest native mammal, the endemic island fox); two amphibian and three reptile species; and colonies of seabirds, seals, and sea lions.<br /> <br /> Remains of an ancient endemic species, the pygmy mammoth, have been uncovered on Santa Rosa, along with Santa Cruz and San Miguel Islands. These miniature mammoths, only four to six feet tall, once roamed island grasslands and forests during the Pleistocene. The fossil skeleton discovered on Santa Rosa Island in 1994 is the most complete specimen ever found.<br /> <br /> Along with extensive paleontological resources, Santa Rosa Island has rich archeological resources. Home to the Island Chumash until approximately 1820, wima (as the Chumash refer to the island) contains thousands of significant and federally protected archeological sites. Archeological investigations on the island have enabled scientists to construct a more complete picture of Chumash life on the islands. Radiocarbon dating on some of these sites indicates that humans have been using the island for more than 13,000 years.<br /> <br /> Others have come to the island during more recent centuries to exploit its rich resources, sometimes making it their home. In addition to the native Chumash, European explorers, Aleut sea otter hunters, Chinese abalone fishermen, Spanish missionaries, Mexican and American ranchers, and the US military all have left their mark on the Santa Rosa landscape. Visitors can see relics of these occupations in remnants of fishing camps, water troughs and fence lines, the pier where cattle were loaded and unloaded, buildings and equipment of the historic Vail and Vickers ranch at Bechers Bay, and remains of the military installations.<br /> <br /> Surrounding the island are cold, nutrient- rich waters that sustain a diverse web of marine life, including pelagic fish, a variety of marine mammals, and extensive kelp forests.<br /> <br /> As on the other islands, the National Park Service has made great efforts to preserve and protect these island resources, including enforcement of marine protected areas, stabilization of cultural sites, rehabilitation of historic buildings, removal of nonnative plants and animals, recovery of island foxes, and reestablishment of bald eagles.</p> <p><br /> <strong><u>Island Facts</u></strong></p> <p>- Located in Santa Barbara County.<br /> <br /> - Forty miles from Ventura; 26.5 miles from the nearest mainland; three miles east of San Miguel Island and six miles west of Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> - Santa Rosa is the second largest island in California. Approximately 15 miles wide by 10 miles long; 84 square miles; 53,000 acres.<br /> <br /> - Average rainfall-15 inches.<br /> <br /> - Radar Mountain is island's tallest peak at 1,589 ft.<br /> <br /> - Six endemic plant species occur only on Santa Rosa Island.<br /> <br /> - Santa Rosa Island is home to only three native terrestrial mammals-the island fox, island spotted skunk, and island deer mouse. They are all endemic to the Channel Islands.<br /> <br /> - Reptiles and amphibians include the alligator lizard, Baja California tree frog, and three endemic species-the island gopher snake, island fence lizard, and Channel Islands slender salamander.</p> <p><u><strong>Things To Do</strong></u></p> <p>Santa Rosa Island may be visited on a one-day trip, multi-day boat trip, or an overnight camping trip. However, getting to this island is more challenging and the weather can be windy anytime of year-30-knot winds are not uncommon. Therefore, visitors must be prepared for adverse weather. As with all the Channel Islands, visiting Santa Rosa Island is an exercise in preparation and self-reliance. Since there are no services on the islands, there are no remedies for poor planning once you have arrived.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boat Transportation</strong><br /> Island Packers offers trips spring through fall. Travel time is about three hours. Strong winds and rough seas are possible. Landing is at Bechers Bay via a pier. Multi-island, overnight boat trips frequently visit Santa Rosa Island as well.<br /> <br /> <strong>Plane Service</strong><br /> Channel Islands Aviation offers trips year round. Travel time is about 45 minutes Landing is at a graded dirt airstrip in Bechers Bay.<br /> <br /> <strong>Goods and Services</strong><br /> There are no goods, services, or accommodations (lodging) available on the island. Visitors must bring all their own food and supplies. Public phones are not available.<br /> <br /> <strong>Water</strong><br /> There is water available in Bechers Bay at two locations-Water Canyon campground and the public bathrooms in the historic ranch area.<br /> <br /> <strong>Picnicking</strong><br /> In Bechers Bay, picnic tables are available at Water Canyon Beach (by the road cut at the end of the airstrip) and on the grass area of the historic ranch house.<br /> <br /> <strong>Visitor Center</strong><br /> There is no visitor center on the island. For information, check with island staff or the visitor center in Ventura.<br /> <br /> <strong>Interpretive Programs</strong><br /> On days that the concessionaire boats or planes travel to Bechers Bay, guided hikes may be offered by national park volunteers or concessionaire naturalists. If they are not available to lead hikes, self-guided interpretive trail booklets are available. Hikes generally begin 30 minutes after the concession boats or planes arrive on the island. A variety of guided hikes may also be offered during weekends that Island Packers drops off campers.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Several trails and roads traverse the island, providing visitors with spectacular hiking opportunities, including the relatively flat route to Water Canyon Beach to the rugged, mountainous path to Black Mountain.<br /> <br /> <strong>Camping</strong><br /> Primitive camping is available at Water Canyon campground (15 sites; $15 per night per site; reservations required). Picnic table, food storage box, windbreak, pit toilet, and water are provided. The campground is a flat 1 Â½-mile hike from the pier and a Â¼-mile from the airstrip and Water Canyon Beach. Due to the boat schedule, minimum stay is generally three days. Backcountry camping on Santa Rosa Island is currently limited to certain beaches between August 15th and December 31st. Hiking is along the beach and rugged, unsigned dirt roads or unmaintained animal paths. The closest beach for camping is 10 miles from the boat/plane drop-off location in Bechers Bay. Backcountry camping beaches can also be accessed via kayak or boat. Water is available year round in some of the island's canyons. All campers should be prepared for a variety of weather conditions. Thirty-knot winds are not uncommon. Sturdy, low-profile tents, stakes, and line for securing tents are recommended.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watersports</strong><br /> Due to the strong, persistent wind,swimming, snorkeling, diving, and kayaking are limited and recommended for the experienced visitor only. Despite the wind, Santa Rosa Island offers exceptional beach walking on white sand beaches. Access to one of the best beaches, Water Canyon Beach, is just over a mile from the pier in Bechers Bay and just down canyon from the campground. Beach access is also available near the pier. Surfing can be done at several locations on Santa Rosa Island. Generally, the north shore is best during the northwest swells of winter/spring and the south shore is best during the south swells of summer/fall. However, all surf spots are remote and are best accessed by private boat or by backcountry beachcamping due to the hiking distance from Bechers Bay.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fishing</strong><br /> No fishing is allowed within the three marine reserves located around the island. Fishing is allowed outside of these areas. To fish in the park, possession of a valid California state fishing license with an ocean enhancement stamp is required and all California Department of Fish and Game regulations apply.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wildlife/Wildflower Viewing</strong><br /> There is limited accessible wildlife viewing on Santa Rosa Island. A variety of common seabirds and shorebirds (cormorants, brown pelicans, gulls) can be seen throughout the year in Bechers Bay, but there is better viewing on the boat ride over. Tell boat staff you are interested in seeing seabirds and they will help keep a lookout. Given the wind, landbirds are best spotted in the canyons such Cherry and Water Canyons. Pinniped viewing is limited to remote locations on the island. Backcountry camping is required to access these spots. Island foxes and other terrestrial species are often seen. During a normal year of rainfall, wildflowers are best viewed in late winter and spring. In addition, some plants like gumplant, buckwheat, poppies, and verbena continue to bloom during the summer. Good tidepooling spots are located within Bechers Bay, including just east of the pier, the east end of Southeast Anchorage, and near East Point. Other tidepooling areas are located throughout the island but require backcountry camping to reach these areas.</p> <p><br /> <strong><u>History and Culture Overview</u></strong></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Societal values about people, places, cultures, and our landscapes shift over time. Santa Rosa Island has a deep history that illustrates this phenomenon.<br /> <br /> For more than 13,000 years Native American people were here, hunting, fishing, gathering, managing, and treasuring the island. The Island Chumash's economy collapsed during the Spanish Mission era and they were forced from wima (Chumash name for Santa Rosa Island) into the mission lifeways on the California mainland. Nevertheless, the Chumash people of today maintain strong cultural, spiritual, and historical ties to the island and their legacy is still embedded in the land.<br /> <br /> Within a single generation of Island Chumash departure, the island had been granted by the governor of Alta California to the Carrillo brothers. Thus began a 150-year period of ranching, during which first sheep and then cattle roamed and grazed the island.<br /> When Congress considered whether or not to include Santa Rosa Island as part of Channel Islands National Park, the open and undeveloped landscape perpetuated by ranching was a key determining factor in their decision. Four generations of the Vail family and their extended ranching \"family\" managed and cared for the island, preserving intact the last original and consistently operational Mexican land grant. The Vail family descendants of today have personal and vital connections to the island landscape and its ranching history.<br /> <br /> Santa Rosa Island is now managed by the National Park Service on behalf of the public for its natural, cultural, historical, and wilderness values. We encourage you explore the island and experience its full complexity, as a landscape that has been loved and lived in for thousands of years and continues to provide recreation, respite, and renewal for current and future generations.<br /> <br /> <strong>Overview</strong><br /> Located 26.5 miles from the closest mainland point, Santa Rosa Island is the second largest of the eight Channel Islands, with over 53,000 acres of sandy beaches, grasslands, steep canyons and occasional groves of trees, including the rare Torrey pine grove above Bechers Bay. Called wimal by the Chumash, the island's native inhabitants, Santa Rosa Island has a history of human occupation stretching back at least 13,000 years. Following the Chumash came European explorers, Chinese abalone fishers, sea mammal hunters and fisherman, as well as ranchers, sport hunters, oil companies and the military, all of them leaving traces of their use of the island<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on Santa Rosa Island and European Contact</strong><br /> Archaeologist Phil Orr's discovery of human bones in 1959 at Arlington Springs provided evidence of the oldest known habitation of the island. Recently radio-carbon dated to 13,000 years before present, these are among the oldest securely-dated human remains in North America. The age of the Arlington remains and a host of archeological sites on the Channel Islands that date to the late Holocene (10,000-6,500 years before present) indicate an early migration route from the Old World into North America along the West Coast.<br /> <br /> Santa Rosa Island and the other Channel Islands provided rich resources for seafaring peoples to thrive by hunting seabirds, sea mammals, fish and shellfish. With extensive trade networks on the mainland, the island Chumash were able to trade marine resources with mainland peoples for goods they could not harvest or produce on the island. With plentiful food and fresh water, the island supported several villages at the time of European contact.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo sailed up the coast of California in 1542, the first European to visit the Channel Islands, and documented three villages on Santa Rosa Island. A half-century later, Sebastian Rodriguez CermeÃ±o wrote about his interaction with the Chumash on the south side of the island on December 13, 1595, as he sailed southward along the coast:<br /> <br /> ...and there came alongside a small boat like a canoe, with two Indians in it rowing. And having arrived at the launch, they brought some eighteen fish and a seal and gave them to us, for which we gave them some pieces of taffeta and cotton cloth in order that they should bring more. They went on shore and returned in the same boat with three Indians and brought nothing, At this island we went fishing with lines and caught some thirty fishlike cabrillas [sea bass], which we soon ate on account of our great hunger....On both [Santa Rosa Island and Santa Cruz Island] the land is bare and sterile, although inhabited by Indians, there are no ports or coves in them in which to take shelter.<br /> <br /> <strong>Maritime Commerce</strong><br /> Following the removal of the Chumash from the island, there were no permanent island residents for the next twenty years. Passing mariners, fishermen and otter hunters visited Santa Rosa Island to exploit its marine resources.<br /> <br /> Desires for fine furs in China and Europe encouraged otter hunting along the Pacific coast in the late 1700s and early 1800s. English, Russian and American companies exploited this trade, employing Aleut and Hawaiian hunters to slaughter the animals. George Nidever, an American otter hunter, used a cave on the island at Bechers Bay as a headquarters for his two recorded hunting expeditions on the island. On his second trip Nidever and his crew collected sixty otter skins, but encountered armed conflict on the island. Nidever tells a legendary story of being victorious after an attack by a group of otter-hunting northwestern Indians working for an English company while he and his crew were hunting at Santa Rosa Island. Read Nidever's story here.<br /> <br /> <strong>Introduction of Ranching</strong><br /> Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, coming into possession of Alta California and the Channel Islands. In 1838, in response to the foreign otter hunting depredations, the government ordered the distribution of land grants to Mexican citizens to prevent incursions by foreign interests. This resulted in the grant of Santa Rosa Island to the Carrillo brothers, who were prominent residents of Santa Barbara. In October of 1843 Jose Antonio and Carlos Barrelo Carrillo gained ownership of the island but ended up selling it a month later.<br /> <br /> The Carrillo brothers sold the island to Carlos' married daughters and their husbands, Alpheus Thompson and John C. Jones, who had engaged in the otter trade and other entrepreneurial endeavors along the coast. According to the land grant, improvements had to be made on the island in order to maintain possession. Consequently, in December of 1843 Thompson had materials shipped to the island for a house and corrals, which were built in 1844. The first structures on the island were located between Skunk Point and East Point in an area now called Rancho Viejo or \"Old Ranch.\"<br /> <br /> Thompson and Jones brought the first livestock to the island in 1844: 270 head of cattle, 51 ewes, two rams, and nine horses. Thompson's employees took up residence on the island and supervised the grazing cattle, sheep and horses. During the following decade, numerous livestock, horseback and wagon trails were developed across the island. In 1855 the owners constructed a house and corral at Bechers Bay, which was more reliable for shipping conditions and provided more level land for ranching and agricultural activities. Drought and litigation between the two partners over control of the island led to the removal of most of the cattle and sheep by 1859.<br /> <br /> <strong>The More Era</strong><br /> In 1859, T. Wallace More purchased part of Jones's interest in Santa Rosa Island. That year, spurred by drought and litigation between the partners over control of the island, most of the sheep and cattle were removed from the island. More and two of his brothers began purchasing Thompson's shares in the island ranch until A.P. More acquired the last of the shares in 1870.<br /> <br /> Following a disastrous drought that devastated California's cattle industry during 1863-1864, the Mores commenced development of a huge sheep ranch on the island, eventually owning between 40,000 and 80,000 head. They erected miles of redwood fences and planted crops. The Mores abandoned the East Point ranch site, developing their headquarters at Bechers Bay. By 1873, they had constructed a wharf at Bechers Bay, a two-story house and barns at the ranch site. They reported that 40,000 sheep were sheared that year.<br /> <br /> As a result of a severe drought in 1876-78, the Mores were forced to slaughter tens of thousands of sheep, but managed to profit from the situation by installing two large boilers in one of the barns, which were used to render the carcasses for fat. The Santa Barbara Press reported on the matanzas (killings) saying that \"25,000 sheep are to be killed, which will leave from 15,000 to 20,000 on the island. The matanza works erected by the firm are said to be among the largest and most complete on the coast.\"<br /> <br /> A.P. More acquired full interest in the island in 1881 and continued to increase the number of sheep on the island. A contemporary writer claimed that 80,000 sheep grazed on the island in 1888. During an 1892 visit to the island, a reporter from Overland Monthly described the island's shearing operations. He noted that sheep at the More ranch were clipped by about forty seasonal shearers who bunked in the loft of the horse barn. During the shearing process, each shearer would place his fleece on a table to be collected and call out his tally number. An experienced shearer could produce up to 100 fleeces every day.<br /> <br /> The death of A.P. More in 1893 led to litigation and the eventual sale of Santa Rosa Island. More's heirs began to sell their shares to Vail & Vickers Co. in 1901. By 1902 Vail & Vickers owned the entire island.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Vail & Vickers Ranch</strong><br /> Walter L. Vail and J.V. Vickers were both prominent cattle ranchers in Arizona. By the turn of the century, they had developed a partnership and expanded their operations to southern California. Vail & Vickers began introducing more cattle to Santa Rosa Island while removing the sheep, running a large \"stocker\" operation where young cattle were brought to feed on the island grass for one or two years, and then sold to buyers on the mainland.<br /> <br /> The ranch headquarters in Bechers Bay comprised the ranch house, bunkhouse and two barns, dating to the 1860s or '70s. A small schoolhouse and other outbuildings were added in the 1900s. Vail & Vickers purchased a new boat, repaired buildings and fences, and built additional fences and corrals. They used the old sheep pasture divisions, enhancing them for cattle use and avoided overgrazing by moving the cattle from pasture to pasture and regulating numbers according to the amount of available feed and water. All pastures, roundups and perennial streams were identified by name, most of which were place names that carried over from the nineteenth century.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers stocked the island on a double season strategy, giving cattle two full feed seasons for growth. Depending on the season and forage quality, between 3,000 and 7,000 head of cattle grazed on the island at any given time. Round-up corrals were located at Arlington, Las Cruces and China Camp by 1929. Vail & Vickers owned the cattle boat Vaquero to transport their cattle to and from the island. When the government confiscated the boat for use in World War II, Vail & Vickers replaced her with the Vaquero II in 1959. The boats were equipped with pens to hold the cattle and the island pier had a loading chute allowing the cattle to be loaded and unloaded on the boat. Cattle leaving the island were held in the ranch corrals at the head of the pier and were run down the pier and loaded onto the boat before sunrise.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers did not develop many roads on the island until the late 1940s. Ranch superintendent C. W. Smith blasted out a road along a cattle trail into the steep canyons on the north side of the island during the 1920s and 30s. Oil companies constructed roads in 1932 and the 1940s for exploratory drilling. The military built roads during the 1950s.<br /> <br /> Members of the Vail family managed the ranch operations from Los Angeles and later Santa Barbara, and regularly visited the island. After Walter Vail's death in 1906, his son N.R. managed the ranch. In 1943 N.R.'s brother Edward took over management until 1962, when his nephew Al succeeded him. Al Vail, the third generation of Vails to manage the ranch, continued ranch operations until the ranch shut down in 1998. The Vail & Vickers cattle operation ended in 1998 with the removal of the last herds of cattle, nearly 100 years after they purchased the island ranch.<br /> <br /> <strong>Other Uses of Santa Rosa Island</strong><br /> The Vails began importing deer and elk to the island for sport hunting around 1910, although there are accounts of deer and elk on the island prior to that date. Elk were reportedly shipped from the San Joaquin Valley, Yellowstone National Park, and the Rocky Mountains. Deer were introduced in 1929 and came from several sources, primarily the Kaibab National Forest. Until the 1970s, hunting was primarily done by the cowboys, Vail & Vickers family members, friends and guests, and included active efforts to rid the island of the feral pig population. Commercial hunting began in 1977 and ended in 2011 with the end of the Vail's reservation of use and occupancy on the island.<br /> <br /> When the Santa Barbara area was discovered to be a rich source of oil, oil companies sought to drill exploratory wells on the islands. Standard Oil Company developed a well in the high elevations of the island in 1932, but was unsuccessful. Signal Oil and its partners also drilled for oil in a number of locations and were not successful. The oil companies constructed roads to their wells that became important routes on the island in later days.<br /> <br /> After the United States joined World War II, the military negotiated a lease with Vail & Vickers in 1943 to set up an early warning radar facility on the south side of the island. The Army Corps of Engineers built a radar system at a location now called Signal Hill and a cantonment about three miles away. The site was closed as the war ended and the buildings and materials were left to be used by the ranch.<br /> <br /> As a consequence of the Cold War, in 1950 the Air Force leased 336 acres on the south side of the island to house the 669th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. They constructed an advanced technical outpost on a high peak and established a residential, maintenance and administrative area for over 200 personnel, along with a pier, at Johnson's Lee. The Navy added missile-tracking facilities on Navy Hill in 1952. The Air Force base closed in 1963 when advancing technology made it redundant. The buildings and materials again were left for the use of the ranch, which made use of the guardrails for corral construction and windows, doors and building materials for new buildings around the ranch.<br /> <br /> <strong>Channel Islands National Park</strong><br /> Legislation creating Channel Islands National Park in 1980 expanded the boundaries of the 1938 National Monument to encompass Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and San Miguel islands. In December 1986, the National Park Service purchased the island from Vail and Vickers. Vail & Vickers retained a twenty-five year reservation of use and occupancy of about seven acres in Bechers Bay and negotiated a special use permit to continue their cattle ranching and commercial deer and elk hunting on the island.<br /> <br /> The Park Service set up its island operations at Johnson's Lee and began improvements to the island's water and wastewater systems. The park established a campground, constructed a generator facility and photovoltaic system, improved the pier at Bechers Bay and opened the island to visitor use. In the mid-1990s the park moved its operations to the ranch area and constructed park housing and a maintenance facility on a hill above Bechers Bay.<br /> <br /> Cattle ranching ended on Santa Rosa Island with the last of the cattle being shipped to the mainland in 1998. The twenty-five-year use and occupancy reservation expired in 2011, leaving the entire island under the management of the National Park Service. Approximately 20,000 visitors come to Santa Rosa Island each year to explore the world of the native Chumash, walk the shores where European explorers landed, visit the island ranch complex, and see coastal California as it might have been hundreds of years ago.</p> <p><br /> <strong><u>Ethnographic Island Place Names</u></strong></p> <p>Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p> <p><br /> <strong>More Information on the Chumash Name wima</strong><br /> Fernando Librado stated that \"It is here, where the wim̓a does not grow and is hard to get, that the Indians made good board canoes. wim̓a is driftwood, mostly redwood, which floats down the coast after a storm on the sea and comes from the west into the channel... Redwood was the best of the wim̓a from which to make a board canoe.\"<br /> <br /> Harrington noted that wim̓a was essentially synonymous with redwood, and the usages described here are confidently attributed to Sequoia. The Spanish term Pino Colorado may sometimes refer to at least one kind of pine and perhaps to other coniferous trees as well.</p>",

A \"V/V\" didn't last long because it was graphically too complicated. After the war the managers used \"VR\" (Vail-Rogers), reflecting Ed Vail's partnership with Jimmy Rogers (son of the famous Will Rogers) on the Jalama Ranch near Lompoc.

    "audioDescription": "You are standing at the scale house, a small wooden red building at the edge of one of the corrals. The building is about 16 feet wide by 40 feet long, with vertical board and batten siding, and a peaked roof covered with corrugated metal sheeting. On both ends of the building, is an opening about the size of a single car garage door. A large outdoor light is attached above one of these openings, near the eaves of the building. <br /><br />Inside the building is a large, unusual enclosure. Along one side of the building and level with the ground, is a rectangular concrete footing about one foot thick, that wraps around a rectangular opening about 12 feet wide by 30 feet long. Inside of this concrete, also at ground level, is a platform made of wooden planks. There is a gap of an inch or so between the platform and the entire concrete perimeter. Along the length of the wooden platform are six-foot high wooden walls, made of 2-inch thick horizontal planking. At both ends is a wooden gate made of 2 by 6 planks, reinforced with z-shaped bracing of more 2 by 6 planks. The gates have hefty latches at the top and bottom, each made of a metal reinforced notch in a 2 by 6 plank that slides into a large metal bracket. The corral fence connects very close to the gated openings to the enclosure, so that it is essentially within the corral. Near one gate latch, laying on the ground, are five metal disks, shaped like small pies, 4 to 6 inches in diameter. Two disks have letters carved into them that seem to read \"J\" \"M\".<br /><br />Next to this enclosure, a dirt floor walkway runs the entire length of the other side of the building. At about the center of this walkway is a rectangular hole in the ground, several feet deep, with concrete walls 6 to 12 inches thick. Wood planks partially cover the opening. <br /><br />At the top of the entire structure, five x-shaped wood plank braces support the roof. The corrugated metal roof is rusted near the eaves, where there is a small gap between the roof and the upper walls, with daylight coming through.<br /><br />Mounted to the building exterior is a red metal box on two support posts, with a slanted top. The box has a rectangular opening near the top, about the size of a postcard. Several curved grey conduit pipes or hoses loop down below the box. Another short one, painted red, sticks up from the top, with several thin wires extending from it up under the eaves of the roof and into the building. The box is flanked by two sturdy wooden poles, that look like sections of telephone poles.<br /><br />The branding shed is located on the inland side of the corrals area. It is a simple red wooden shelter with white trim. The roof is angled, sloping down to a solid back wall made of vertical planks. The building is open on the other three sides.<br /><br />The interior of the shed from back to front:<br /><br />Hanging on the back wall is a 3-foot long metal pole with a c-shaped curve at the end, and a 12-foot long, curved metal blade, with triangular \"teeth\" along one side. In a corner is a tall white wooden cabinet.<br /><br />Near the back wall is a branding chute-a long narrow metal cage, located at the end of a long narrow corridor, with sturdy 2 inch thick wooden plank fencing on either side. The walls of both the cage and the corridor slant outward from about 2 feet wide at the bottom to about 5 feet wide at the top. The metal cage has a rusted red frame made of round poles, that resemble a brass bed frame, with a curved arch from end to end, and, below it, a row upright poles, spaced about 1 foot apart. The lower part of the front and side walls are made of 2 inch thick horizontal planks of wood. The front of the cage has a thick metal plate with a triangular opening in the center. Two vertical poles are side by side in the center of the triangle, splayed outward on the top. Some overhead ropes and chains connect the front panel to the rest of the cage frame. On one side there appears to be a hinge, connecting the front to a side wall of the cage. The back of the cage has a metal gate across it. On the ground, near that gate, is a raised plank step, about one foot high.<br /><br />Hanging from the outside of the frame are long handled cups. <br /><br />Six feet away from the branding chute, on the tallest side of the building, is a wooden workbench, with two shelves. On the upper shelf is a metal pan, a long bolt, a rusty wrench, a rope, and a metal can. Behind the workbench is a rusty 50-gallon metal drum, with broken wooden planks sticking out of it.<br /><br />Nearby is a small wooden table with metal legs, and a small section of wall. Mounted on the wall are a 5-foot long metal pole with a c-shaped curve at the end; metal clippers with a wooden handle; and a white wooden cabinet.<br /><br />Just outside the building is a rusted 50-gallon metal drum, leaning on its side against a wooden box.<br />",

So a school was created in one of the small, older buildings on the ranch, possibly the same one that had served as a school during the More period on the island. However, E. K. Smith, former ranch employee who was born on the island, believed that his father, former ranch foreman C.W. Smith, and a Santa Barbara carpenter converted a small generator building into the school in the early 1920s.<br /> <br /> Whatever the origin of the schoolhouse, a number of teachers were hired from Los Angeles, lived in their own room in the bunkhouse, and held classes for grades one through nine in the small one-room building.<br /> <br /> During the 1920s and early 1930s, eight to ten children attended the school, including E. K. According to Woolley, \"it was a little room . . . with a bunch of old desks, inkwells and all that. . . . Dad had a teacher for the youngsters of the workers there, like the Smiths and the Lopezes and the Gomezes . . . it was just a standard school, but it was one gal taking care of all of â€˜em!\"<br /> <br /> Smith remembered it as \"just like a regular school:\"<br /> <br /> \"We would go to school at 8 o'clock, and we had a recess and then went home at 3:00 or 3:30. At recess we'd play baseball in the corrals and stuff. We were assigned desks. They were the kind that we would just shove all our books in from the back end. My dad made the desks when he made the school. They taught us everything: penmanship, typing-they had two typewriters-and all the regular stuff: math, spelling, geography and history.\"<br /> <br /> The school closed around 1932 when many of the students reached high school age. E. K. Smith recalled the difficult transition from the small island school to a big Santa Barbara High School: \"We were the last graduating class-1932. After that, they sent us over to the mainland for high school. It was hard at first. Those mainland kids gave me a rough time. Laughing at me, you know, because I was island-born. It took a long time to get used to that life.\"<br /> <br /> After the school was discontinued, it was used for guest quarters and to house ranch workers. A room was added in the early 1960s to make a more comfortable home. It was occupied by cowboys with spouses until 1999.<br /> <br /> By 2017, the building was restored to its original schoolhouse state, a small ranch exhibit was added inside, and it was opened to the public.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> </strong></p>",
    "audioDescription": "The school house is a white single story building with a peaked roof. The roof is shingled. The building is long and narrow with clapboard siding. A two-step cement platform leads you to the front door. The white wooden door is framed and has horizontal wooden pattern on it. Above the door is a wooden plaque, with white embossed lettering that reads,<br /><br />School House<br />Ranch Exhibit<br /><br />To the left of the door is a paned window. The right side of the building has a smaller paned window about midway and two larger paned windows. The back of the building has a door on the right side. Near the back of the house, about 8 feet away, is a white wooden fence.<br /><br />If you are facing the front of the school house, to the left of the building are three picnic tables and a tall round wooden post, topped with a metal pole extending upward another couple of feet. Sticking out from the pole at about 18-inch intervals, from bottom to top, are a series of foot-long rods, alternating from one side to the other. Adjacent to the pole you can see the wooden fence of the first corral and the ranch complex buildings, including the barn, the scale house and branding shed. To the right of the school house is a dirt road. In the distance are rolling hills dotted with shrubs. <br /><br />Standing in the doorway of the school house facing inward, the interior is about 16 feet long and 8 feet wide. The walls and ceiling are finished with narrow vertical wooden slat paneling, painted white. The ceiling has a framed inset panel, to access the attic, and a white ceramic ceiling lamp, with a brass mount. The wooden plank floor has a glossy polish. Moving into the room, along the left wall, you will find a framed window with thin wooden mullions containing 12 glass panes; a mounted metal box; a clear plastic pamphlet holder; an information panel; two larger exhibit panels with a low wooden green bench below them; six exhibits with large photographs; and a wall plaque that reads,<br /><br />Acknowledgements<br /><br />Images of Santa Cruz Island, Santa Rosa Island and Nuestra Senora del Refugio<br />Commemorating Early Land Grants on Both Sides of the Channel<br /><br />An exhibition organized by the Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation<br />Exhibition Sponsors: The Henry W.

According to John Gherini in his book Santa Cruz Island: A History of Conflict and Diversity (p. 103), \"The freight was unloaded onto a pontoon, and a heavy rope ran from the schooner to a deadman on the beach. The crew working on the pontoon would guide it to shore as a team of horses on the beach would pull the lighter ashore.\"<br /> <br /> Eventually a pier was constructed in the center of the beach at Scorpion Harbor in the early 1930s, using the thick trunks of eucalyptus trees as pilings for the wharf. \"With a pier in place,\" states Gherini, \"ranch hands herded the sheep (about 1,000 to 1,500 annually) onto the rickety wharf, through the wooden corrals and into the loading chute which hung precariously over the side of the pier. The sheep often leaped from the chute onto the boat which frequently moved with the surging currents. The boat, loaded with sheep, sailed for Santa Barbara with deckhands moving among the packed sheep and lifting up the animals who had fallen to prevent them from suffocating. The trip ended at Stearns Wharf where the sheep were off-loaded. In later years, the boats cruised down to Port Hueneme in Ventura County, which was better equipped to handle livestock. From the mainland ports, the sheep were moved into waiting trucks and driven to the livestock yards and slaughtered for meat.\"<br /> <br /> After this first pier was destroyed by winter storms, Pier Gherini constructed a combination concrete and wood wharf in 1938 and, later, a steel pier was erected in 1966. Violent winter storms destroyed the wharves, no matter what the design. In summer 1999, the National Park Service took its turn at building a pier. A concrete abutment was constructed on the shore and a flatbed railroad car was laid down, connecting the new abutment to the historic concrete block. Unfortunately, this too was damaged by winter storms in 2015. In 2016, the flatbed railcar was replaced with an elevated aluminum gangway. as a short-term solution.<br /> <br /> In 2021, the construction of a new pier was completed. The new pier improved the safety and efficiency of loading and offloading passengers and cargo with a gangway for landing visitors and more reliable access during low tide conditions. It is located about 300 feet to the south of the existing landing and is longer, wider, and higher. It measures at 18 feet wide by 300 feet long and is supported by steel piles and a superstructure designed to handle storm events and wave action.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><em>pasʰyǝmu pʰmihi̇ swaxǝɬ is the Chumash word for Scorpion Canyon and creek. It means 'the trail of fresh water at swaxǝɬ.'   <br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> <b>Geology of Scorpion Canyon</b><br /> Above the canyon lies a layer of the Monterey Formation, a siliceous shale. Within the canyon, erosion has exposed the volcanic rocks lying underneath. These rocks reveal a fascinating story about the formation of the Channel Islands. Between 15-30 million years ago, lava flows and volcanoes covered much of the area that now comprises the northern Channel Islands and the western Santa Monica Mountains. In some places the lava accumulated to as much as 10,000 feet thick. A certain type of lava, pillow lava, found in some of these rocks is evidence that much of the volcanic action took place below the surface of the ocean. In other places, oyster shells and other marine fossils are found embedded in the lava. At times, the buildup of lava was great enough that volcanic islands formed. These islands probably were short lived and were eroded to below sea level after the volcanic action ceased.<br /> <br /> The reason for these volcanic eruptions can be found within the magnetic particles in the rocks. As the rocks were cooling, magnetic particles within the rocks would have been set in line with the magnetic poles of the earth. However, magnetic measurements now taken in these same rocks show that they do not line up. In fact, they are off by about 100 degrees, with the oldest rocks showing the largest discrepancy. Geologists believe that when these rocks were formed, the platform on which the islands rest lined up in a north-south direction along the southern coast of California, with San Miguel Island's position lying just offshore from San Diego.<br /> <br /> As the Pacific plate made contact with and began to slide past the North American plate, forming the San Andreas fault, this platform was rotated in a clockwise direction to its present east-west position. As it rotated, the crust of the ocean thinned and the resulting reduction of pressure allowed molten magma to form and ascend from the mantle, erupting under the sea as lava.<br /> <br /> Around 5 million years ago, compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in folding and faulting of these marine sediments and volcanic rocks (deposited between 15-30 million years ago) and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today. Earthquakes are quite common. A major fault that runs through the center of the island has moved nearly 100 feet in the last 30,000 years, and all the islands continue to be uplifted.<br /> <br /> Ever since these compressional forces caused the islands to emerge from the sea, they have been separated from the mainland. For decades, scientists assumed that the two were connected by a landbridge, but as bathymetric information (or topography) of the sea floor improved, it revealed that even during periods of lowest sea levels (about 17,000 years ago), the islands still remained isolated by at least four miles of ocean. It is this continuous geographical isolation that has shaped island life.<br /> <br /> <b>Ethnographic Island Place Names</b><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",
    "audioDescription": "This moderate to strenuous scenic loop hike to the interior of the island is 4.5 miles round trip with extremely rocky conditions. The trail begins as a six-foot-wide compacted dirt path near the Upper Campground and narrows to a single path trail as it meanders through the rocky canyon, coyote bush and other vegetation line both sides of the trail. Bright white chalky sedimentary rock outcroppings mark the grass covered hillsides. <br />Before leaving the canyon and heading up the hillside, turn off the trail and descend into the rocky canyon bottom to explore the ravine where low growing, rock loving plants cling to the cliffs edges. While on the trail, steeply ascend the hillside to the top of the canyon. Up top there are spectacular views of the surrounding ocean, the Montanon Ridge, and Scorpion Canyon below. The trail continues to the plateau above Scorpion Canyon and eventually descends into the mouth of the canyon at Scorpion Anchorage. <br />",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>The Scorpion Ranch house was constructed in 1886-1887 and was rehabilitated in 2004-2005. In 2008, exhibits were installed and it was opened as a visitor center. </strong><br /> <br /> According to early unpublished maps and diaries, the ranch at Scorpion was in full operation by 1885 with a work force of 8 to 12 men. Scorpion Ranch played a significant role in the development of Justinian Caire's island-wide enterprise:<br /> <br /> \"Early maps depict many buildings, sheds and other structures at the Scorpion ranch including a residence, wood sheds, carpenter shop, a blacksmith shop, baking ovens, wool sheds, a bakery, a granary, a general storage building, a matanza, a butcher shop, tallow furnaces, a garden store, barns, stables, corrals, a wagon shed, a chicken yard, wells, windmills, a water tank, water troughs, and a concrete reservoir..... [and] vineyards and large vegetable gardens.\" (John Gherini, <strong>Santa Cruz Island: A History of Conflict and Diversity</strong> , p. 97)<br /> <br /> The first reference to the still standing two-story ranch house was made in 1887, by the company foreman, when he wrote in his diary that there is \"work on the attic of the new house.\" Although often referred to as an \"adobe,\" ranch staff built this building of rubble masonry, using island rocks held together by a lime and cement mortar. Only part of the interior walls are constructed of adobe blocks. Gherini describes the bread oven as one of the most prominent features of this building:<br /> <br /> \"...located on the west end of the building in a small room...(the oven) was used to store flour, bake bread and keep the finished bread. Margaret Eaton (in Diary of a Sea Captain's Wife) observed that the large oven was made of white bricks and had a large iron door. With a four-foot-long wooden spatula, the cook put the loaves into the piping hot oven which could bake twenty-five loaves at a time.\"<br /> <br /> Although this room is no longer used for bread making, it still has an important role in providing the appropriate environmental conditions (temperature, light, access, etc.) for a maternity roost during the spring and summer for Townsend's big-eared bats. With the species in decline in general, and with recent documented loss of maternity colonies in California, maintenance of this colony and protection of the roost site at Scorpion is important for conservation of the species in California.<br /> <br /> This historic ranch house has been rehabilitated with special efforts made to protect this roosting site. The downstairs is now open as a visitor center.<br /> <br /> <b>More Ranch History: Preserving the Past</b><br /> While the isolated island offered ranchers several advantages over the mainland, including no predators and the world's best fence (the ocean), it created special challenges as well. Supplying such a remote outpost was probably the biggest challenge. The transportation of supplies and stock onto and off the island was always an adventure-the distance to the mainland, rough seas, and expense made it very difficult. However, as former ranch superintendent Clifford McElrath wrote in his memoir On Santa Cruz Island, ranchers would adapt to the difficulties of isolated island life through self-reliance and by \"learning to make do with what [they] had.\" Pier Gherini, former owner of the eastern portion of the island, wrote a humorous story in \"Island Rancho\" about the self-reliance of Joe Griggs:<br /> <br /> \"Joe could do most anything, except write. An expert rider, huntsman, and general ranch worker, Joe also was a mechanical whiz. He once took a 1915 Waterloo Boy tractor that had been \"mothballed\" because the early workmen wouldn't touch it, and used the parts to make a sawmill. The fact that we didn't need a mill in no way detracted from the ingenuity and skill that went into its making. All of these people had one common characteristic. They knew and loved the Island. Each in his own way was rugged and self-reliant. They took its beauties and hardships in stride.\"<br /> <br /> Although livestock ranching on Santa Cruz Island began in the 1850s, it was under the direction of Justinian Caire beginning around 1880 that a variety of agricultural and ranching endeavors were developed in an effort to create a self-sufficient operation on the island.<br /> <br /> In California's Channel Islands, Marla Daily writes that, \"Buildings including several ranch houses, bunkhouses, barns, wineries, a chapel, mess hall, blacksmith shop, and saddle shop were constructed. Wherever possible, native island materials were used. Kilns were built for the manufacture of bricks and limestone mortar. Stones were quarried and cut to shape on the island. A resident blacksmith forged wrought-iron fittings, railings, and hinges used on many of the buildings. Employees included masons, carpenters, dairymen, team drivers, vintners, a wagon maker, cobbler, butcher, seasonal grape pickers and sheep shearers, a sea captain and sailors to run the company's 60-foot schooner. Hay, vegetables, and over a dozen varieties of grapes were grown, in addition to almond, walnut and other fruit and ornamental trees. Sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs were raised.\"<br /> <br /> Since the island was too large to manage from the one main ranch in the Central Valley, other facilities, or out-ranches like the one at Scorpion, were developed. Completed in 1887, the two-story Scorpion ranch house, and later, the wooden bunkhouse (ca 1914), were home to ranch hands who tended the flocks of sheep and cattle and the crop fields on the broad plateaus and rich black soils on this eastern end of the island. Known as the \"granary of the island,\" the Scorpion and Smugglers ranches were the bases that supplied much of the food and hay for the island operation.<br /> <br /> Sheep ranching for meat and wool by descendants of Justinian Caire, the Gherini family, continued on the eastern end of Santa Cruz Island between 1926 and 1984. The Gherini era ended in February 1997 when the National Park Service acquired the last interest from the family. Today, the National Park Service is preserving the historic area so visitors always will have the chance to remember and understand this unique part of the island's past.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Living on the Edge</b><br /> Before sheep, cattle, and pigs were introduced to the island, a lush plant community, including such plants as the island morning glory, island monkey flower, live-forever, island buckwheat, yarrow, coastal sagebrush, gumplant, and goldfields, covered the marine terraces upon which you now are standing. Once, huge stands of giant coreopsis blanketed the bluffs, emerging every spring from their summer dormancy with thick green foliage and bright, yellow flowers. But years of grazing left these plants literally living on the edge, growing only on the inaccessible ocean cliffs below you. On The Nature Conservancy portion of the island, where the sheep have been removed since 1985, the coreopsis and other plants have spread beyond the cliffs and established themselves in many parts of the island. With the removal of the sheep and pigs, it is hoped that the east end of the island will experience a similar revival of native flora.<br /> <br /> <b>An Ideal Isolated Home</b><br /> A cool, salty mist fills the air as you approach Scorpion Rock overlook. The ever-present western gulls and graceful pelicans often can be sighted soaring along the steep, rugged volcanic cliffs. These cliffs, their numerous caves, and the rest of Santa Cruz Island's coastline and neighboring islets are home to eleven different species of nesting seabirds and shorebirds, including ashy storm-petrels, Brandt's cormorants, Cassin's auklets, pigeon guillemots, and black oystercatchers.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island, the other Channel Islands, and all their associated islets and offshore rocks are vital habitat for seabirds and shorebirds, providing essential nesting and feeding grounds for 99% of seabirds in southern California and important wintering areas and stopover points for shorebirds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, and the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> Thirty shorebird and twelve seabird species have been recorded, including: half of the world's population of ashy storm-petrels and western gulls; 80% of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets; the only major breeding population of California brown pelicans in the western U.S.; and the the largest colonies in southern California of Cassin's auklet, western gulls, Scripps's murrelets, rhinoceros auklets, tufted puf fins, ashy storm-petrels, double-crested cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and black storm-petrels.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>Impacts to Seabirds</b> </strong><br /> Seabirds in the park and throughout southern California are impacted by many factors including contaminants, oil spills, invasive species, and changes in the ocean environment. For example, the introduction of DDT, a long-lived pesticide, into the marine environment has severely impacted seabird populations at the islands. Before DDT was banned in the 1970s, California's brown pelican population suffered nearly complete reproductive failure.<br /> <br /> On land, predation and habitat disturbance by invasive species have impacted seabirds. At Anacapa, introduced black rats preyed heavily on seabird eggs and chicks severely depleting populations of Scripps's murrelets. Black rats still prey on seabird populations on San Miguel. At Santa Barbara Island, seabirds were decimated by cats and habitat has been marginalized by years of over grazing by introduced livestock and rabbits. Seabird habitat has also been severely impacted by grazing of non-native animals on Santa Cruz Island. On Scorpion Rock, but human disturbance caused the entire colony to be abandoned by the 1930s.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>Seabird Monitoring and Restoration</b> </strong><br /> Today, the gradual recovery of these species continues as their isolated island home is ensured protection within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of the seabird populations in southern California.<br /> <br /> On Santa Cruz Island, these efforts have focused on closing off public access to certain habitat critical sea caves and restoring seabird habitat on Scorpion and Orizaba Rocks. These rocks are important nesting islets for burrow-nesting seabirds. To restore seabird habitat on these islets, restoration efforts have included removing non-native vegetation, revegetation with native plants, installation of nest boxes, and closures to protect nesting seabirds.

Within this area, the sea floor is comprised of canyons, banks, escarpments, sea mounts, and deep basins (the Santa Cruz Basin off the island's south coast is deeper than the Grand Canyon). Nutrient-rich waters upwelling from these depths mix and mingle with cool waters from the north (California Current) and warm southern waters (California Countercurrent), creating the Santa Barbara Gyre-a swirling eddy that circulates nutrients and supports a wealth of marine plants and animals, from giant kelp forests and blue whales to tiny crabs and plankton. Here, northern and southern species overlap, creating a transition zone between the Oregonian and Californian marine biogeographic provinces. Santa Cruz Island lies in the middle of this transition zone. The western half of the island harbors numerous northern species, while southern species are more common on this eastern end of the island.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island also serves as the meeting ground for seabirds and shore birds that rarely occur together, such as black oystercatchers from the north and American oystercatchers from the south. Both species, as well as hybrids between the two, have nested at Fraser Point on the island's west end. Other northern birds, such as pelagic cormorants and pigeon guillemots, overlap with additional southern species, such as Scripps's murrelets and California brown pelicans.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>The Giant Kelp Forest</b> </strong><br /> From this vantage point, one also has the opportunity to gaze upon another part of the park-the marine environment. One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park (six nautical miles around each island is part of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary).<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm below one may be able to see or hear California sea lions. These playful animals are often spotted just to the west of Potato Harbor, hauled-out on the rocks. Sea lions, along with a variety of other marine species, depend upon the extensive kelp forests that can be found around Santa Cruz Island and the other Channel Islands. While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California coastal mainland, the islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of algae that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing plants on earth-it can grow 2 feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales seeking a plankton snack.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use tooth-paste are also using a little bit of kelp as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredientcalled algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine plants such as kelp provide the earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have completely altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the century.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>Marine Protected Areas</b> </strong><br /> However, with the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls and fishing regulations, transplantation of kelp, public education, and various research programs some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provide a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 Marine Reserves (including the Scorpion Marine Reserve in the waters below you from Potato Harbor to Scorpion Rock), recreational fishing and commerci;al harvest are prohibited; limited fishing and harvest are allowed in two Marine Conservation Areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.</p>",

The ever-present western gulls and graceful pelicans often can be sighted soaring along the steep, rugged volcanic cliffs. These cliffs, their numerous caves, and the rest of Santa Cruz Island's coastline and neighboring islets are home to eleven different species of nesting seabirds and shorebirds, including ashy storm-petrels, Brandt's cormorants, Cassin's auklets, pigeon guillemots, and black oystercatchers.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island, the other Channel Islands, and all their associated islets and offshore rocks are vital habitat for seabirds and shorebirds, providing essential nesting and feeding grounds for 99% of seabirds in southern California and important wintering areas and stopover points for shorebirds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, and the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> Thirty shorebird and twelve seabird species have been recorded, including: half of the world's population of ashy storm-petrels and western gulls; 80% of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets; the only major breeding population of California brown pelicans in the western U.S.; and the the largest colonies in southern California of Cassin's auklet, western gulls, Scripps's murrelets, rhinoceros auklets, tufted puf fins, ashy storm-petrels, double-crested cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and black storm-petrels.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>Impacts to Seabirds</b> </strong><br /> Seabirds in the park and throughout southern California are impacted by many factors including contaminants, oil spills, invasive species, and changes in the ocean environment. For example, the introduction of DDT, a long-lived pesticide, into the marine environment has severely impacted seabird populations at the islands. Before DDT was banned in the 1970s, California's brown pelican population suffered nearly complete reproductive failure.<br /> <br /> On land, predation and habitat disturbance by invasive species have impacted seabirds. At Anacapa, introduced black rats preyed heavily on seabird eggs and chicks severely depleting populations of Scripps's murrelets. Black rats still prey on seabird populations on San Miguel. At Santa Barbara Island, seabirds were decimated by cats and habitat has been marginalized by years of over grazing by introduced livestock and rabbits. Seabird habitat has also been severely impacted by grazing of non-native animals on Santa Cruz Island. On Scorpion Rock, but human disturbance caused the entire colony to be abandoned by the 1930s.<br /> <br /> <u>Seabird Monitoring and Restoration</u><strong> </strong><br /> Today, the gradual recovery of these species continues as their isolated island home is ensured protection within Channel Islands National Park.

J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

The Scripps's Murrelet breeds within the park, while the Guadalupe Murrelet visits after breeding season. However, there are unconfirmed accounts of breeding on Santa Barbara Island)</em></p> <p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> Synthliboramphus scrippsi</p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> This unique small bird of coastal Pacific waters is among the world's rarest seabirds. The park is the nesting location for about a third of the world's population. It is also among the most threatened, nesting in as few as 10 locations. Rarely seen from the coast, Scripps's murrelets prefer the deep, warm offshore waters of the Pacific.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Scripps's murrelet come ashore only to breed, remaining at sea the rest of the year.</li> <li>The park has 80% of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets.</li> <li>Santa Barbara Island has the largest Scripps's murrelet colony in the United States, and possibly the world.</li> <li>Scripps's murrelets nest primarily in natural rock crevices along steep edges around the periphery of islands.</li> <li>Females lay two eggs containing 22% of her body weight which are incubated for about a month.</li> <li>The chicks emerge from eggs fully feathered and well developed.</li> <li>The chicks spend fewer than 48 hours at the nest site and are not fed.</li> <li>A Scripps's murrelet chick will leave the nest for the open ocean at two days old tumbling down steep slopes and cliffs to reunite with parents in the water.</li> <li>The Scripps's murrelet was listed as a threatened species by the state of California on December 22, 2004.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Scripps's murrelet is a small bird. At under 10 inches in length, it is slightly smaller than an American robin. Adults have a 15-inch wingspan and weigh only six ounces. Black above and white on the chin, throat, and belly, Scripps's murrelet is very similar in appearance to Craveri's murrelet, a species that shares a similar range. The two are most easily separated in flight by the distinct white underwing of the Scripp's.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> This species is fond of warm, southerly climates. During the breeding season, the entire Scripps's murrelet population is concentrated within a fairly small region off the coasts of southern California and Mexico. However, birds disperse after breeding, sometimes as far north as British Columbia. Over eighty percent of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets (33.5% of the world's population and the only breeding ground north of Mexico) occurs on the Channel Islands, while the Mexican population nests primarily on the Baja California islands of San Benito, Coronado, and San Jeronimo.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> During the breeding season, southern California's Scripps's murrelets, who are crevice and burrow nesters, lay their eggs on the steep slopes and cliffs of Anacapa, Santa Barbara. and San Clemente islands. They prefer areas with sufficient vegetation for cover. Away from the breeding season, the birds move far out to sea, preferring the deep waters beyond the continental shelf.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Scripps's murrelets feed by diving and swimming underwater in pursuit of small fish and crustaceans. Interestingly, they are nearly always observed feeding in pairs rather than in flocks. Adults are active at the colony only at night. This curious feeding strategy takes place year-round, including during the breeding season. Since one member of each breeding pair is at the nest throughout the breeding season, unrelated birds may pair up to feed cooperatively.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> In early spring, females lay two eggs directly on the ground, usually in a rocky area concealed by dense vegetation. No actual nest is constructed. For about 34 days, both parents take turns incubating the eggs, which vary widely in color, from pure white to blue, green, or even dark brown. Some are heavily spotted, while others are unspotted. The eggs are also extremely large, weighing up to a quarter of the mother's total body weight-among the largest parent-to-egg size ratio of any bird. The chicks emerge fully feathered and well developed. They generally spend fewer than 48 hours at the nest site, during which time they are not fed. By the second or third night, the parents coax the chicks away from the nest site, then fly out to sea, leaving the chicks to find their own way to the ocean. The chicks' path often involves a daunting climb over rough terrain, and down steep, rocky slopes. Scripps's chicks have been seen leaping from cliffs as high as 200 feet into the waters below. Once in the ocean, the chicks find their parents, who wait beyond the surf, calling for them constantly. Reunited, adults and chicks swim out to sea, where the parents continue to tend to the chicks for several months.</p> <p><em>Please see Scripps's murrelet nestcam video at bottom of page.</em></p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Once the breeding season ends, the birds move out to sea, following the warm offshore California Current. Though most remain off the coast of central California, a few occasionally relocate as far north as British Columbia. This movement is generally regarded as a post-breeding dispersal rather than a true migration. Young birds are flightless and slow moving at this time.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature - 2010 Red List of Threatened Species, this species is considered to have a vulnerable status because of its limited range and small, declining population. Several colonies have gone extinct, and introduced predators are causing declines in some of the remaining nine colonies. Channel Islands National Park has implemented several restoration projects to reverse these declines. On Santa Barbara Island, after feral cats were removed in 1978, numbers of Scripps's murrelets increased to approximately 1,500 in 1992. Additional work on Santa Barbara Island includes restoring seabird nesting habitat by removing non-native plants and planting native vegetation. On Anacapa Island, the National Park Service eradicated the introduced black rat population that had decimated the population of nesting Scripps's murrelets. Notably in 2009 the number of Scripps's murrelet clutches on Anacapa increased 61% over the previous year.

Hypochondriaca</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Baja California treefrog is found on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and Catalina islands. These are the only native frogs known to inhabit the Channel Islands off the coast of southern California. However, the tree frog is probably the most abundant frog found in California as well as the western United States.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>You can find the extended family of treefrogs in your backyard, along the beach, in the Mojave Desert, in woodlands, in grasslands or pastures, and even at 11,000 feet on Mount Whitney.</li> <li>Baja California treefrogs change color based on the air temperature and humidity.</li> <li>Baja California treefrog's color change is to reduce the likelihood that it will become a meal for a bullfrog, raccoon, heron, snake, or other predator.</li> <li>Baja California treefrogs have special \"sticky pads\" on their feet that help them climb.</li> <li>Treefrog are the only frog in the West that makes the classic \"ribbet\" vocalization - the sound that Hollywood film producers have made familiar around the world.</li> <li>Frog music is heard most often in the spring, but treefrogs vocalize all year unless the temperature dips below freezing.</li> <li>Interestingly, the treefrogs coordinate their vocalizations, creating a frog chorus. One male acts as the \"chorus master\" and starts calling. Other males in the vicinity gradually join in as the chorus swells.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Male Baja California treefrogs are just under 2 inches long and generally green or dark gray, with a creamy underside. Females are gray or brown and a bit larger than the males. The color of both sexes can vary, but you can verify the Baja California treefrog identification by looking for a dark brown or black band that runs from the eyes to the shoulders and white underside.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Even though the Baja California treefrog exist on Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and Catalina islands, the range of this frog is not clear, due to the small number of specimens sampled for the study that described the species. It is apparently found throughout southern California, south of Santa Barbara County and Bakersfield and on the offshore islands, excluding most of the southeast deserts. It ranges farther east into Nevada, and south into Baja California.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> This species utilizes a wide variety of habitats, often far from water outside of the breeding season, including forest, woodland, chaparral, grassland, pastures, desert streams and oases, and urban areas. Although, in the breeding season, shallow bodies of water act as habitat due to its component in the laying of eggs. During active periods, adults are most commonly found in close proximity to and along stream channels. During the daytime, individuals seek refuge in cavities or small depressions on the surfaces of the boulders lining streams, often fully exposed to direct sunlight. These perches are usually within a few jumps from the nearest pool.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The Baja California treefrog eats a wide variety of invertebrates, primarily on the ground at night, including a high percentage of flying insects. During the breeding season, they also feed during the day. Typical of most frogs, prey is located by vision, and then the frog lunges with a large sticky tongue to catch the prey and bring it into the mouth to eat. Tadpoles are suspension feeders, eating a variety of prey including algaes, bacteria, protozoa and organic and inorganic debris.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Breeding is aquatic. Fertilization is external. Breeding and egg-laying occurs between November until July, depending on the location. Adults probably become reproductively mature in their first year. Males move to breeding waters and begin to make their advertisement call. These calls attract more males, then eventually females. Males call while in or next to water at night, and during daylight during the peak of breeding when calling can occur all day and night. Some males and females have been observed staying only a few weeks at a breeding site. Some males have been observed moving to another site. And others have been observed staying at a site the entire breeding season.Males are territorial during the breeding season, establishing territories that they will defend with an encounter call or by physically butting and wrestling with another male. Satellite male breeding behavior has been observed - a silent male will intercept and mate with females that are attracted to the calling of other territorial males.</p> <p>Females lay on average between 400 - 750 eggs in small, loose, irregular clusters of 10 - 80 eggs each. Egg clusters are attached to sticks, stems, or grass in quiet shallow water. The eggs hatch in two to three weeks. Eggs appear to be resistant to the negative effects of solar UV-B radiation and even to increased water acidification. Eggs can also survive freezing temperatures for a short time. Tadpoles aggregate for thermoregulation and to avoid predation.</p> <p>Tadpoles metamorphose in about 2 to 2.5 months, generally from June to late August. In summer, there are often large congregations of new metamorphs along the banks of breeding pools. Metamorphosed juveniles leave their birth pond soon after transformation, dispersing into adult habitats.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Baja California treefrog is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and because it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. This frog is not included on the Special Animals List, meaning there are no significant conservation concerns for it in California according to the Dept. of Fish and Game.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bioeco/ptreefrog.htm\">https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bioeco/ptreefrog.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://amphibiaweb.org/index.html\">http://amphibiaweb.org/index.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2008/06/creature-feature-pacific-treefrog\">http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2008/06/creature-feature-pacific-treefrog</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/islands/caislandherps.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/islands/caislandherps.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/</a></li> </ul>",

It is the national bird and symbol of the United States of America. This sea eagle has two known sub-species and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. Bald eagles typically can be found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting. In Channel Islands National Park, due to the persecution by humans and the effects of organochlorine chemicals such as DDT, breeding bald eagles were eliminated by the mid-1950's. In an innovative reintroduction program conducted 2002 and 2006, sixty-one young bald eagles were released on the northern Channel Islands.<br /> <br />  </p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The scientific name means \"a white-headed sea eagle\" and comes from the Greek words <em>halos</em>, meaning sea; <em>aetos</em> meaning an eagle; <em>leukos</em> meaning white; and <em>kephalus</em> referring to the head. Bald is from the Middle English word <em>balled</em>, meaning shining white.</li> <li>Rather than do their own fishing, bald eagles often go after other creatures' catches. A bald eagle will harass a hunting osprey until the smaller raptor drops its prey in midair, where the eagle swoops it up.</li> <li>Had Benjamin Franklin prevailed, America's emblem might have been the wild turkey not the bald eagle.</li> <li>The largest bald eagle nest on record, in St. Petersburg, Florida, was 10 feet in diameter and 20 feet tall. Another famous nest—in Vermilion,Ohio—was shaped like a wine glass and weighed over 2 tons. It was used for 34 years until the tree blew down.</li> <li>Immature bald eagles spend the first four years of their lives in nomadic exploration of vast territories and can fly hundreds of miles per day. Some young birds from California have reached Alaska.</li> <li>Bald eagles can live a long time, with a longevity record of 28 years in the wild and 36 years in captivity.</li> <li>Bald eagles occasionally hunt cooperatively, with one individual flushing prey towards another.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The plumage of an adult bald eagle is evenly brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but reversed sexual dimorphism, which occurs in many raptors, is evident in the species in that females are 25 percent larger than males. The beak, feet, and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of Canada, all of the continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. It presently occupies historical habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England. Northern eagles are migratory,while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year.</p> <p>Historical records indicate that in the early 20th century bald eagles bred on all islands within the park, with at least two dozen nesting pairs over the 8 Channel Islands. Breeding bald eagles provided important ecosystem functions in the northern Channel Islands. For example, bald eagles were once the top marine aerial predator and probably fed upon a variety of seabirds and fish. Bald eagles are generally highly territorial, and in the past this behavior may have prevented golden eagles from colonizing the islands. Due to the persecution by humans and the effects of organochlorine chemicals such as DDT, breeding bald eagles were eliminated by the mid-1950's. In an innovative reintroduction program conducted 2002 and 2006, sixty-one young bald eagles were released on the northern Channel Islands. Bald eagles have also been reintroduced on Santa Catalina Island</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The bald eagle explores sea coasts and other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish as well as rivers,large lakes, and mountainous open country. The bald eagle prefers old-growth and mature stands of coniferous or hardwood trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Selected trees must have good visibility, an open structure, and proximity to prey, but the height or species of tree is not as being in close proximity to water. The bald eagle is extremely sensitive to human activity, and is found most commonly in areas free of human disturbance.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The bald eagle's diet is opportunistic and varied, but most feed mainly on fish. When fish sources are unavailable, eagles may rely largely on carrion, especially in winter, and they will scavenge carcasses up to the size of whales, though it seems that carcasses of hoofed animals and large fish are preferred. They also may sometimes feed on subsistence scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps. Mammalian prey includes rabbits, hares, raccoons, muskrats, beavers, and deer fawns. Preferred avian prey includes grebes, alcids, ducks, gulls, coots, egrets, and geese. Most live prey are quite a bit smaller than the eagle, but predatory attacks on large birds such as the great blue heron and even swans have been recorded. Reptiles, amphibians and crustaceans (especially crabs) are preyed on when available.</p> <p>Fishing is a learned behavior for the bald eagle, and so juvenile eagles spend their first year eating carrion (carcasses) until they become proficient at fishing (Dooley et al. 2005). Prey remains from bald eagle nests on Santa Catalina Island contained almost 90% fish (Newsome etal. 2010), but an historic bald eagle nest on San Miguel contained more bird remains than fish (Collins et al. 2005). The abundance of seabirds and pinnipeds on the northern Channel Islands means eagles likely take advantage of those resources more than in other areas. This could pose a problem for recovery of bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands (see below), because pinnipeds and seabirds contain more DDE than do marine fish, due to bioaccumulation at higher trophic levels.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Bald eagles nest in trees except in regions where only cliff face sor ground sites are available. They tend to use tall, sturdy conifers that protrude above the forest canopy, providing easy flight access and good visibility. In southern parts of their range, bald eagles may nest in deciduous trees, mangroves, and cactus. It's unknown whether the male or the female takes the lead in selecting a nest site. Nests are typically built near the trunk, high up in the tree but below the crown.</p> <p>On the Channel Islands, where large trees are scarce, bald eagles have built nests on cliff faces, rock shelves and shallow cliffs, as well as in island pines and Torrey pines. One pair even attempted nesting in a grassland on Santa Cruz Island.</p> <p>Bald eagles build some of the largest of all bird nests—typically5 to 6 feet in diameter and 2 to 4 feet tall and ranging in shape from cylindrical to conical to flat, depending on the supporting tree. Both sexes bring materials to the nest, but the female does most of the placement. They weave together sticks and fill in the cracks with softer material such as grass, moss, or cornstalks. The inside of the nest is lined first with lichen or other fine woody material, then with downy feathers and sometimes sprigs of greenery. Ground nests are built of whatever's available, such as kelp and driftwood near coastal shorelines. Nests can take up to three months to build, and may be reused (and added to) year after year. The female lays one to three eggs with a usual clutch size of two eggs. The eggs are incubated for approximately 35 days, and the young eagles fledge 10 - 12 weeks after hatching. Bald eagles become sexually mature at five to six years with maturity usually corresponding to when their head and tail feathers become white.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The bald eagle's recovery is a spectacular conservation success story. Once abundant in North America, the species became rare in the mid-to-late 1900s—the victim of trapping, shooting, and poisoning as well as pesticide-caused reproductive failures. In 1978 the bird was listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act. Since 1980, gentler treatment by humans along with the banning of DDT (the bird's main pesticide threat) has led to a dramatic resurgence. By the late 1990s, breeding populations of bald eagles could be found throughout most of North America.</p> <p>In 2002, with funding from the <a href=\"http://www.darrp.noaa.gov/southwest/montrose/index.html\">Montrose Trustees Restoration Program</a>, the park (in conjunction with partner, <a href=\"http://www.iws.org/\">Institute for Wildlife Studies</a>) began to introduce juvenile bald eagles to the northern Channel Islands. This was done using a technique called \"hacking\". Birds of approximately 8 weeks of age were kept in one of two hack towers on Santa Cruz Island until they were ready to fly (at approximately 3 months of age). Sixty-one young bald eagles were introduced to the northern Channel Island between 2002 and 2006.</p> <p>Today, bald eagles are again an important part of the island ecosystem. 2006 marked the first successful bald eagle nest on the Channel Islands in over 50 years, and since that time, the recovering bald eagle population on the islands has grown. As of 2013 there were five breeding pairs on Santa Cruz Island, two on Santa Rosa, and one on Anacapa, and a total of over 40 bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands.</p> <p>Recovery of bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands was seen as critical to recovery of the endangered island fox, since nesting bald eagles might dissuade dispersing golden eagles (<em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>) from establishing breeding territories on the islands (Coonan et al. 2010). Golden eagle predation was responsible for the massive decline of island foxes on the northern Channel Islands in the 1990s.</p> <p>In June 2007, the bird's recovery prompted its removal from the Endangered Species list. Continuing threats to bald eagle populations include lead poisoning from ammunition in hunter-shot prey, collisions with motor vehicles and stationary structures, and development-related destruction of shoreline nesting, perching, roosting and foraging habitats.</p> <p>Based upon information of population trends, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species has listed the bald eagle a species of Least Concern and current data demonstrates that the population is presently increasing.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://birds.audubon.org/species/baleag\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">BirdLife International</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Bald_Eagle/lifehistory\">All About Birds</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/106005688/0\">The ICUN Red List of Threatened Species</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.peregrinefund.org/subsites/explore-raptors-2001/eagles/baldeagl.html\">The Peregrine Fund</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.J., C.A.

This seabird was classified as federally endangered in 1970 and as endangered by the state of California in 1971, but was delisted as a federally listed species in 2009. The only breeding colonies of California brown pelicans in the western United States are within Channel Islands National Park on West Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands. The preservation of this essential habitat along with the monitoring of this species is critical for the continued health of the California brown pelican population.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Breeding range is from the Channel Islands south to central Mexico.</li> <li>The only breeding colonies of California brown pelicans in the western United States are on West Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands.</li> <li>The non-breeding range extends north to Vancouver, Canada.</li> <li>Brown pelicans build large nest structures on the ground, in trees, or on vegetation.</li> <li>The nesting season can extend from January through October.</li> <li>Brown pelicans normally lay three eggs and the adults share incubation duties.</li> <li>Brown pelicans can dive from 60 feet in the air.</li> <li>Brown pelicans can live up to 40 years old.</li> <li>A pelican's throat pouch can hold over 2 gallons of water.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Brown pelicans weigh about 8 pounds and measure a little over 4 feet in length, with a wingspan of over 6.5 feet. The 6 subspecies of brown pelican are similar in appearance with slight differences particularly in breeding plumage. Sexes look similar, though males are slightly larger. Brown pelicans have short, dark legs, long, broad wings, a large, heavy all-brown body, and a huge bill. Webbing between all four toes makes the brown pelican an awkward walker, but a strong swimmer. In basic plumage, adults have a white neck and belly, pale yellow head with occipital crest, a brown body, brown eyes, a throat pouch that is reddish orange, and a billface that is paler at the base and tipped with yellow. As the breeding season approaches, the distal end of the bill turns reddish, the proximal end of the throat pouch brightens to a poppy-red, the iris turns a yellowish white to light blue, and a white stripe runs down the pouch side of neck, while the rest of the neck stays dark brown. Colors start to fade during the onset of incubation, and the yellow feathers on the head are replaced with white feathers.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The California brown pelican is a permanent resident of the coastal marine environment on the Pacific Coast and the range extends from British Columbia, Canada, south to Nayarit, Mexico. The bulk of the California brown pelican population (estimated to be about 90%) nests in Mexico. The only long-term breeding colonies of California brown pelicans in the United States are on Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands. The Channel Islands also provide roosting habitat for the birds, with major roosting areas occurring on offshore rocks of Santa Cruz Island and near the lighthouse on East Anacapa Island.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> California brown pelicans are aquatic birds and are typically found on rocky, sandy or vegetated offshore islands, beaches, open sea (for feeding),harbors, marinas, estuaries, and breakwaters. Nesting colonies are established on islands without mammalian predators and permanent human habitation. In the Southern California Bight, they typically build a nest on the ground or on native shrubs, but also occasionally in trees. On Anacapa and Santa Barbara Island, brown pelicans generally nest on inaccessible slopes, canyons, and high bluff tops and edges.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The brown pelican is the only pelican that is a plunge diver. The brown pelican is a unique feeder that makes impressive dives from ten to thirty above the surface. They are, however, able to dive from as high as one hundred feet. The deeper the meal the higher the dive. When it sees a potential meal it begins to tip downwards, the wings shape into a V, and dives. When the bill touches the surface of the water the pelican will push its legs and wings back creating a bit more force, under the water the bill opens and the pouch stretches out wide allowing the pelican to scoop up fish. The pelicans hit the water with such force that even fish six feet below the surface are stunned. Air sacs throughout the bird's body help to cushion the shock from the dive. Their pouch, attached to the lower mandible, when full can hold up to three gallons of water and fish, it is the largest pouch of any bird in the world. The pelican pops up to the surface, tips their head and bill forward letting the water drain out yet keeping the fish. Then they toss their head back to position the fish head first and swallow. It is said that brown pelicans can eat as much as four pounds of fish in one day.</p> <p>The California brown pelican stays close to shore and hunts for its food usually within five miles of land. Occasionally, one may travel as far as thirty to forty miles when necessary . Another way they feed is by sitting on the surface of the water and scavenging for food. It scans the ocean for the reflections off of the silvery scales of schooling fish rely solely on the ocean as their food source for they are carnivores and love to eat anchovies (Engraulis mordax). In fact, it is estimated that annually, California brown pelicans off the southern California coast eat about one percent of the total anchovy biomass. During their breeding season 90%of the California brown pelican's diet consists of the northern anchovy. Generally, they feed on this northern anchovy, the Pacific sardine and the Pacific mackerel.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Pelicans breed in nesting colonies on islands without mammalian predators and permanent human habitation. In the Southern California Bight, they typically build a nest on the ground or on native shrubs, but also occasionally in trees. On Anacapa and Santa Barbara Island, brown pelicans generally nest on inaccessible slopes, canyons, and high bluff tops and edges.</p> <p>Brown pelican are asynchronous nesters.The nesting season historically began in March and extended through late summer or early fall, but in recent years has often surpassed 11 months. Normal clutch size is three eggs. The peak of egg laying is usually March or April; however, eggs are often laid through June. Incubation commences after the first egg is laid, and males and females share incubation duties.</p> <p>Pelican breeding success is largely determined by the availability of their primary prey items, northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) and Pacific sardines (Sagax sarinops), which during the breeding season comprise nearly their whole diet. Brown pelicans can be seen performing a surface plunge from as high as 20 meters to catch their prey. Abandonment of nests can occur in years of rapid reduction in food availability.</p> <p>Brown pelican chicks are naked and helpless and are completely dependent on parental care and protection for the first three to four weeks after hatching. Both parents feed the young until they fledge. In California populations, chicks typically fledge about 13 weeks of age. A high percentage of post-fledging mortality is accounted for by the unsuccessful attempts of the young pelicans to feed themselves.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Brown pelicans are residents in much of their breeding range. After breeding, flocks move north along both coasts. In the Pacific, they migrate up to British Columbia. In early winter they return south to warmer waters on both coasts. Small numbers of immature birds wander inland in summer, especially in the southwest.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> In the 1960s and 1970s the park's colonies of California brown pelicans faced extinction. In 1970 on West Anacapa Island, only 552 nesting attempts were made and only chick survived. Scientists pinpointed the pesticide DDT flowing from mainland sewers into the sea as the cause. When the pelicans ate contaminated fish, DDT disrupted their reproductive systems. DDT altered the birds' calcium metabolism, resulting in egg-shell thinning. The egg shells were so thin that they broke under the parent's weight resulting in reproductive failure.</p> <p>The federal government listed the brown pelican as an endangered species in 1970, the state of California listed it as endangered in 1971, and DDT was eventually banned in 1972. The fight to save these birds led to a remarkable recovery. The park's breeding populations have steadily increased since 1980 and this subpopulation is now believed to be fairly stable. On Anacapa Island from 1969-1984, average colony size was 900 nest attempts per year.Strong increases in both productivity and nest attempts were observed in the mid 1980s, and the Anacapa colony has produced a mean of 4,600 nests per year during 1985-2006.</p> <p>Pelicans did not nest on Santa Barbara Island in recent times until 1980; the first significant nesting occurred in 1985. From 1985 to 2001, the colony produced a mean of about 770 nests per year. Starting in 2000, the pelicans started moving their nesting area around on the island.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"pelican-chart\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/nature/images/pelican-chart.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>California brown pelican colony size (nest attempts) on Anacapa Island, 1969-2006.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Today, the pelican population on West Anacapa Island averages about 4,600 nesting pairs annually and on Santa Barbara Island the average is about 1,500 nesting pairs.</p> <p>Nesting and roosting birds are very sensi¬tive to human disturbance. Pelicans are affected by ancillary fishing activities, including the presence of vessels, noise, and lights, near roosting and breeding areas. Increased light levels are known to alter the behavior of pelicans, leading to nest abandonment and increased egg and chick mortality. In 1999 large increases in nighttime squid fishing activity on park waters probably affected nesting pelicans - higher than average rates of nest abandonment and chick mortality were recorded and could not be explained by other environmental factors.<br /> <br /> There is no visitor access to West Anacapa Island. A no-entry closure from January 1 through October 31 also keeps boats well offshore to protect fledglings in the vicinity of the nesting colony and provides a buffer zone to nesting pelicans. On Santa Barbara Island, the pelican nesting area is closed to visitors and trails are closed when birds are nesting.</p> <p>In 2009, the brown pelican was removed from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife due to recovery. This action was based on a review of the best available scientific and commercial data, which indicated that the species is no longer in danger of extinction, or likely to become so within the foreseeable future. The brown pelican remains protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong><br /> <a href=\"http://birds.audubon.org/species/bropel\">National Audubon Society</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></p> <p> </p>",

This secretive creature is found under rocks and logs (mainly near streams) and also in the soil litter, or duff, during the winter and spring rainy season.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The Channel Islands slender salamander is a member of family Plethodontidae, the lungless salamanders.</li> <li>Lungless salamanders breathe through their skin, requiring them to live in damp environments on land, not in water, and to move about on the ground only during times of high humidity.</li> <li>Typical of most slender salamanders, when disturbed, this salamander may coil up and remain still, relying on cryptic coloring to avoid detection.</li> <li>It might also uncoil quickly and spring away, repeatedly bouncing over the ground, or drop its tail to distract a predator.</li> <li>The tail is easily broken off, but it can be regenerated.</li> <li>The cool marine climate of the Channel Islands, including summer fog, provides enough moisture for this species to be active all year.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Channel Islands slender salamander is a small slim salamander with 18-20 costal grooves, which denote its rib connections. It has short limbs, a narrow head, long slender body, very long tail, and with its conspicuous costal and end of torso grooves, this species has the worm-like appearance typical of most slender salamanders. There are four toes on the front and hind feet, which is also typical of slender salamanders. Fairly robust for a slender salamander, with relatively long legs. Its coloration is brown to pinkish above with a wide dorsal stripe with indefinite borders, and may be made up of many light speckles. The throat and underside of the tail are pale and the abdomen area is whitish or slate, with light and dark speckling.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Channel Islands slender salamander is an endemic species found only on the Channel Islands, although not on Santa Barbara Island. Interestingly, Channel Islands slender salamanders share their habitat on Santa Cruz Island with another similar species, the black-bellied slender salamanders without interbreeding. In one February survey, researchers recorded 155 Channel Islands slender salamanders and 152 black-bellied slender salamanders in similar habitat. However, only Channel Islands slender salamanders were found under driftwood on a sandy substrate near the ocean. In general, when only one species is found at a more open site, it is usually Channel Islands slender salamanders.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Channel Islands slender salamanders occur in grassland, coastal sage scrub, chaparral, riparian, oak woodlands, and pine forest communities. They have been found under rocks and logs, especially near streams. Dense populations have been found in open areas near the ocean; in February at the west end of Santa Cruz Island, salamanders were abundant under driftwood on sand within 200 feet of the ocean. Periods of surface activity correspond generally to the rainy season, especially in drier inland valleys (e.g., Santa Cruz Island). However, the moderating influence of cool, marine air, combined with daily fog, extends activity throughout the summer.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Feeding probably occurs both above and below ground. Studies describe that a similar species, the California slender salamander (B. attenuatus) capture prey using a projectile tongue and feed on small invertebrates, which consist of on earthworms, small slugs, a variety of terrestrial arthropods including sowbugs and millipedes, and insects including collembolans, aphids, caterpillars, small beetles, beetle larvae, and ants. The Channel Islands slender salamander probably eats a similar array of prey items.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The Channel Islands slender salamander do not have the ability to dig their own burrows, but use excavations of other animals and cracks in the soil, in addition to man made tunnels and crevices. Because of this they must descend from the surface to moist areas underground before the late spring. Eggs are laid while the female is below ground during late fall and winter. Egg sets have been found from December 8 to January 18. The number of eggs per set ranged from 13 to 20. Hatchlings emerge during winter and early spring. It is not known if adults tend their young, and the adults and the young animals migrate to the surface during the early rains in the fall and winter. The timing of this cycle is highly dependent on weather, and varies greatly between wet and dry years.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The most recent edition of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species listed the Channel Islands slender salamander as of Least Concern since, although its Extent of Occurrence is much less than 5,000 per square kilometer, it is common and occurs in an area of extensive, suitable habitat which appears not to be under threat, it has a presumed large population, and it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li>Natural History of The Islands of California, Schoenherr, Feldmeth & Emerson</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/index.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/index.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.amphibiaweb.org/\">http://www.amphibiaweb.org</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/59131/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/59131/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/311573/details\">http://eol.org/pages/311573/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17626\">http://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=17626</a></li> </ul>",

Each island population is recognized as a separate endemic or unique subspecies.<br /> <br /> The island fox, a descendant of the mainland gray fox, is the largest of the Channel Islands' native mammals, but one of the smallest canid species in the world.<br /> <br /> Although foxes have always existed at low population sizes, four island fox subspecies underwent catastrophic declines in the 1990s. On San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands at Channel Islands National Park, the decline was attributed to predation by golden eagles. The presence of non-native ungulates as a food source in addition to the DDT-caused decline of bald eagles, a natural competitor, facilitated the establishment of golden eagles as resident breeders on the islands. By 2000, predation on island foxes resulted in population declines to 15 individuals on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands, and less than 80 on Santa Cruz Island. In 2004, each of the park's island fox subspecies were federally listed as endangered.<br /> <br /> In 1999, Channel Islands National Park began an island fox recovery program that included captive breeding and reintroduction of foxes, removal of resident golden eagles, re-establishment of bald eagles, and removal of non-native ungulates. This coordinated, organized and highly focused strategy was able to reverse the certain extinction of an endangered population. Today, the population has recovered within the park. Population trend and annual survival are currently monitored to ensure that recovery continues and future threats to the park's island fox subspecies are identified.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>It is the only carnivore unique to California.</li> <li>Although the island fox is one of the smallest canids in the world, it is the largest native terrestrial mammal on the Channel Islands.</li> <li>The island fox is one-third smaller than its mainland ancestor, the gray fox. At 12 to 13 inches in height and 4 to 5 pounds, the island fox is about the size of a housecat.</li> <li>Some individuals have been known to live up to 15 years.</li> <li>Unlike nocturnal gray foxes, which hunt exclusively at night to avoid predators, island foxes have no natural predators, allowing them to be active duringdaylight hours with peaks in activity occurring at dusk and dawn.</li> <li>Visually, island foxes show signs of dominance or submission through facial expressions and body posture.</li> <li>They communicate by barking and sometimes growling.</li> <li>Their keen sense of smell plays an important role in the marking of territories. Island foxes are known to scent-mark their territories with a few drops of urine and tend to concentrate scats in particular areas, often conspicuously positioned on well-traveled paths.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong></p> <p>The island fox is one third smaller than its mainland ancestor the gray fox. Environmental and ecological factors such as overcrowding, reduction in predators, food limitations, and genetic variations could have contributed to the natural selection for a smaller size.</p> <p>The island fox has similar markings to the gray fox. They have gray coloring on the back, rust coloring on the sides,and white underneath. The face has a distinctive black, white, and rufous-colored patterns.</p> <p>On each of the six islands, a different subspecies occurs, distinguished by both genetic and physical differences. For example, San Miguel Island foxes have shorter tails, due to one less tail vertebra, and longer noses than the other island foxes.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong></p> <p>The island fox is found on six of the islands in the Southern California bight, including the three largest islands in the Channel Islands National Park (Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel islands). The other three islands which island foxes inhabit San Nicolas and San Clemente, owned by the US Navy, and popular Santa Catalina Island, which in large part is managed by the Catalina Island Conservancy.</p> <p>Older research on the island fox dated them back on the northern Channel Islands to 10,400 to 16,000 years ago. Yet, geologists believe the northern Channel Islands were never connected to the mainland. The most plausible and accepted theory for foxes crossing the water barrier of the Santa Barbara Channel is one of \"rafting.\" During the last ice age, 10-20,000 years ago, ocean levels were up to 400 feet lower than today's. The channel between the islands and mainland narrowed, perhaps to just four to five miles across. The northern islands became one large island we call Santarosae. The gray fox could have rafted on debris propelled by storms and/or currents. As the climate warmed and the ocean levels began to rise, Santarosae became the islands of Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel. Due to the lack of a fresh water source, the foxes did not persist on Anacapa, but the other three islands had suitable habitat for foxes.</p> <p>Recent archeological work, however, only dates the oldest island fox fossil at about 6,000 years before present, which is several thousand years after native people populated the island. This raises the possibility that gray foxes were brought to the islands by humans, and rapidly evolved into a smaller, separate species after that.</p> <p>Island foxes brought to the southern Channel Islands of Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, and San Clemente by the Chumash native people who traded with the Gabrielino people of the southern islands. The Chumash considered the fox to be a sacred animal--a pet of the sun, and possibly a dream helper. The island Chumash performed a fox dance and probably used the pelts of foxes to make articles like arrow quivers, capes, and headdresses.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong></p> <p>The climate of the California Channel Islands is semi-arid, and though rainfall amounts differ among islands the average rainfall across all islands is less than six inches per year. The native island vegetation is mostly coastal scrub, but these habitats have been heavily modified by the effects of introduced grazing animals and other human impacts. The northern islands (San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz) have significant areas dominated by non-native plant species, such as annual grasses and iceplant, whereas the southern islands (Santa Catalina, San Clemente and San Nicolas) have greater development impacts such as the naval bases and the town of Avalon. The larger islands (Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, and San Clemente) also have perennial streams that support riparian vegetation and tree species. Foxes are found in most of these habitats on these islands, but they prefer shrubby or wooded areas such as chaparral, coastal scrub and oak woodlands.</p> <p>Island foxes give birth to their young in simple dens, which are usually not excavated by the foxes themselves. By two months of age, young spend most of the day outside the den and will remain with their parents throughout the summer. Some pups disperse away from their natal territories by winter, although others may stay on their natal territories into their second year.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong></p> <p>Island fox diets vary based upon food item diversity of the individual islands. On San Rosa Island, where food item diversity is high, deer mice, Jerusalem crickets, beetles, and earwigs are the preferred food. On other Channel Islands, diets include plant items such as fruits from cactus, manzanita, saltbushes and seafigs, as well as insects and deer mice when they are present. Occasionally, foxes forage along the shoreline for crabs and other marine invertebrates.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong></p> <p>Island foxes are generally monogamous (mate for life), and breed only once a year. Pairs are seen together frequently beginning in January, and mating takes place in late February to early March. The gestation period is thought to be similar to the gray fox, which is around 52 days, and pups are born from late April through early May. Litter size ranges from one to as many as five pups, but two or three is considered average. Born in the protection of a den, pups are blind and helpless with short dark brown hair at birth. They emerge from the den at about one month of age, much furrier but still considerably darker than adults. They begin to resemble their parents by late summer.</p> <p>It is believed that island fox pups undergo a period of extended parental care. In a recent study of island foxes, scientists found adults and pups in the same trap on 22 occasions. In 24 traps containing only pups, they found killed mice and other prey items outside the traps, apparently left by the parents for their young. As with most wild canids, males play an important role in the rearing of young.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong></p> <p>The island fox, which only a short time ago was on the brink of extinction, provides an instructive example of how a coordinated, organized and highly focused strategy was able to reverse the certain extinction of an endangered population. Additional information about the strategies developed and implemented to reverse this situation may be found at <a href=\"http://www1.islandfox.org/p/about-island-fox.html\">Island Fox Conservation</a>.</p> <p>Due to these successful efforts, the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species now lists the island fox as near threatened.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/\">http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://islandfox.org/pdfs/foxfactsheet2.pdf\">http://islandfox.org/pdfs/foxfactsheet2.pdf</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/\">http://www.arkive.org/island-fox/urocyon-littoralis/</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.islandfox.org/\">http://www.islandfox.org</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/goeachannel.htm\">http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/goeachannel.htm</a></li> </ul>",

Therefore, they have very small, overlapping home ranges.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The island night lizard is a medium-sized lizard, with adults ranging from 2 ¾ to 4 inches in body length. It is endemic to the Channel Islands off the coast of southern California where it occurs on Santa Barbara, San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands. Both the color and pattern of the back of adult island night lizards are highly variable. Though these patterns grade into one another, there are serveral distinct types of which the mottled pattern is the most common (44% of the lizards). Less frequent patterns include plain, blotched, striped, broken stripes, ocellated, and finely mottled. Lichen-covered rocks and ground which make up their habitat and appear to provide good camouflage. Such cryptic coloration is oftern associated with the sort of sedentary lifestyle that the lizards have. However, the variety of colors and patterns present among the lizards is unusual. Few other terrestrial vertebrates show the marked color and pattern differences seen in island night lizards. In those that do, it is generally seen as geographic variation over a comparatively large range.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Island night lizards are an endemic Channel Islands reptile, known only to occur on Santa Barbara Island in the park and on San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands. They are the most morphologically distinct of the endemic vertebrates on the Channel Islands, indicating they have been isolated from the mainland for a long time.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The island night lizard is veru very secretive, preferring habitats with dense vegetation cover, such as boxthorn and prickly pear cactus, as well as cracks and crevices in and around rock outcrops and surface boulders. These areas provide protection from predators. They are also often found under rocks, driftwood, and fallen branches. Suitable habitat on Santa Barbara is in all of the canyons and on some of the sea cliffs, especially on the south side of Signal Peak. Island night lizards are very sedentary and have very small home ranges, averaging about 183 square feet.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Island night lizards feed on a wide variety of terrestrial spiders and insects, but they also eat an unusually large amount of plant material for a small lizard. Common animal food items include ground-dwelling spiders, pillbugs, a ground beetle (Amara sp.), moth larvae, and ants. Common plant food items include fruits of Australian saltbush, flowers, fruits and leaves of boxthorn, fruits of iceplant, and composite (Asteraceae) flower parts.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Night lizards have a low reproductive rate compared with other lizards, likely because they are so long-lived. Only about half of the adult females bear young in a given year and a female may not have her first brood until she is nearly five years old. Seasonal activity peaks in the spring when mating takes place, then continues at a lower level through the summer and fall. Island night lizards breed in April, and 2 - 9 young are born fully developed in September. Giving birth to live young (as opposed to laying eggs) is not common among reptiles. Young of the year are active throughout the year, while adults are active primarily during the spring and summer.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The island night lizard is listed as Threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, due to habitat alteration and predation resulting from introduction of alien species (e.g., feral cats, goats, pigs, and rabbits). However, according to the Channel Islands Species Recovery Plan of 1984, habitat on the islands \"probably has not been altered to the detriment of the [island night] lizards by grazing mammals\". Goats and pigs have recently been removed from San Clemente Island. Today, the island night lizard is not thought to be in imminent danger of extinction, and could be a candidate for delisting. Santa Barbara Island is part of the Channel Islands National Park. The entire island of San Clemente, used for military training, has been designated as Critical Habitat.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.werc.usgs.gov/Project.aspx?ProjectID=148\">USGS WERC Projects - Island Night Lizard Population Ecology on the Channel Islands</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/23095/0%20-%202007\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/23095/0%20%20-%202007</a></li> </ul>",

This makes it the only island endemic bird species in North America. Compared to its mainland cousin,the California scrub-jay, the island scrub-jay is larger, darker blue in color, and has a distinctive call, making it the most differentiated of all the island endemic birds. This species is the only scrub-jay on the Channel Islands and occupies more habitats than do scrub-jays on the mainland.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The island scrub-jay lives only on Santa Cruz Island, which means it has the smallest range of any North American bird species.</li> <li>The island scrub-jay belongs to the family Corvidae, which includes crows and ravens, are remarkable for their intelligence, memory and curiosity.</li> <li>A genetic analysis indicates that this species diverged from its closest relative, the wide spread California scrub-jay about 150,000 years ago.</li> <li>Island scrub-jays are monogamous and may stay with a mate for their entire lives.</li> <li>The island scrub-jay can live as long as twenty years.</li> <li>The island scrub-jay is noticeably larger than its mainland related species of scrub jays.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Measuring 13 inches, the island scrub-jay is distinguished from other scrub-jays by its larger size—almost 1/3 larger than its mainland counterpart. This species is also brighter and more vibrant blue than other scrub-jays. It has a broad head with ultramarine-blue nape, crown, upper wing and tail, a white upper breast, chin, and throat, and a large gray-brown patch on the upper part of its back. Other characteristics include a distinct blue collar below the throat which is nearly complete, and a disproportionate large black bill, and a long tail typical of most other jays. Juveniles are grayish-white overall, but have blue wings and tail. Island scrub-jays have a raspy \"shreep\" call and a undulating flight pattern.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The island scrub-jay is restricted to Santa Cruz Island, the largest and most topographically diverse of the Channel Islands. Santa Cruz Island is 18 miles off the coast of California and directly south of Santa Barbara. The Channel Islands are uniquely important for the preservation of this endemic bird and others. There are no recent records of scrub-jays occurring on other islands, but a fossil jay bone has been found on nearby Santa Rosas Island, and an ornithologist from the Smithsonian Institution who visited Santa Rosa Island in 1892 noted that the rancher there reported jays on the island. It is unclear at what point jays went extinct on Santa Rosa Island (Collins 2009).</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> This species breeds in coast live oak woodland or chaparral dominated by scrub oak. On the park property of Santa Cruz Island island scrub-jays are commonly seen in in upper Scorpion Canyon and at Prisoners Harbor. Most foraging and other maintenance activities occur inside territory boundaries, with territory boundaries being stable from year to year. Agonistic behaviors for defending territories include mostly vocalizations and chasing, although dominant jays have been observed pecking subordinate individuals.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The large bill of the island scrub-jay is related to its diet, of thick-shelled acorns which they bury, or cache, in the fall and eat months later. They also eat insects, spiders, snakes, lizards, mice, and other birds' eggs and nestlings.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> These birds are monogamous, often having the same mates all their lives. They are also territorial. Breeding habitat appears to be saturated on the island, causing young individuals to delay breeding for up to several years. Until breeding space becomes available, unmated individuals use marginal habitats not suitable for breeding. Non-breeders do not defend territories, but rather forage and roost in loose groupings or on their own.</p> <p>Nesting peaks during the last two weeks in March when the chaparral plants are flowering and growing new leaves. This period also coincides with an increase in arthropod abundance, indicating that this may be a strong influence on the timing of nesting in island scrub jays. Nests are located in dense bushes and trees and are often well-concealed. Nests are constructed of coarse sticks, lined with finer twigs and rootlets, and can be placed anywhere from ground level to 40 feet off the ground.</p> <p>Females lay two to five eggs in a nest that they incubate for about twenty days. While the female sits on the eggs, the males spends time hunting and defending the nest from predation by gopher snakes, island spotted skunks, island foxes, common ravens, and other island scrub jays. In fact, nest predation is the biggest limit onisland scrub-jay reproductive success, and the extent to which a nest isconcealed affects the likelihood of predation (Caldwell et al. 2013). Vegetation recovery on Santa Cruz Island may eventually reduce the impact of predation. Once the chicks fledge, average life expectancy is 4.8 years and can be as long as twenty years.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Since the island scrub-jay occurs only on one island that makes it susceptible to any major disaster, a disease outbreak, or widespread land-use changes, any of which could potentially extirpate the species or cause a severe population decline. The island scrub-jay is classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.</p> <p>The uniqueness of this jay is the focus of an ongoing research and monitoring effort by personnel from the Smithsonian Institution, Colorado State University, the UC Davis WildlifeHealth Center, and The Nature Conservancy. The most insidious threat to island scrub-jays is the possible introduction of West Nile Virus to Santa Cruz Island. The island scrub-jay's mainland cousin,the western scrub-jay, is extremely susceptible to West Nile Virus, which is carried by certain species of mosquitoes. Ambient temperatures on Santa Cruz Island are currently to low to support those mosquito species, but would be high enough to support those species when global warming occurs. The threat of this has prompted some conservation biologists to propose establishing a second, redundant population of island scrub-jays on Santa Rosa Island (Morrison et al. 2011). Another possible mitigation for West Nile Virus is annual vaccination of a core group of island scrub-jays against the disease, though the expense and availability of an appropriate vaccine and the difficulty of recapturing jays for booster shots make this less attractive as a treatment (Boyce et al. 2011, Wheeler et al.2011).</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"tp://birds.audubon.org/species/islscr\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">BirdLife International</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/106005688/0\">The ICUN Red List of Threatened Species</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/migratorybirds/featured_birds/default.cfm?id=302\">The Smithsonian National Zoological Park</a></li> <li>Boyce, W.M., W.

Unlike the island fox and the island deer mouse, the island spotted skunk shows little differentiation between the two islands as well as the mainland subspecies, suggesting recent colonization of the species. In recent times, the species was limited in numbers. However, island spotted skunk populations on both islands began increasing in the late 1990s, coincident with the decline in island foxes caused by golden eagle predation. As the only two terrestrial carnivores on the islands, skunks and foxes are natural competitors.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Island spotted skunks on the two islands differ only slightly, with those on Santa Rosa spotted skunk being slightly longer than those on Santa Cruz.</li> <li>Island spotted skunks are only about a third as large as their competitor, the island fox.</li> <li>They are more carnivorous than foxes, and more nocturnal. However, their diet became a little more omnivorous in the absence of the fox, during the late 1990s.</li> <li>Skunks may live only one to two years in the wild.</li> <li>Historically, skunks have been classified as a subfamily in the weasel family, the Mustelidae. Recent genetic data has resulted in skunks being reclassified into its own family, <em>Spilogale</em>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The island spotted skunk can be identified by its complex pattern of white markings on a blackbackground consisting of four to six broken white stripes, a triangular white forehead patch, a series of shorter white stripes resembling spots, and white on part of the abdominal surface and tip of the tail.</p> <p>It is distinguished from spotted skunk subspecies on the mainland by its shorter tail and less white abdominal coloration, slightly larger size, broader skull, and proportionately less white and blacker in the fur. Like the mainland subspecies, the island spotted skunks exhibit sexual size differences, with males averaging 28% larger than females. This skunk is considerably smaller than striped skunks on the mainland and has softer, glossier fur.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Channel Islands spotted skunks currently occur only on Santa Cruz and Santa RosaIslands where they are widely distributed. Spotted skunks occurred on San Miguel Island, probably until the late nineteenth century. Fossil material has been collected on San Miguel Island and a spotted skunk was reportedly collected from San Miguel Island sometime during the 1870s. However, there have been no records of skunks on San Miguel since then.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Spotted skunks on the Channel Islands show habitat preferences similar to those reportedfor the mainland subspecies. Based on radio telemetry studies, spotted skunks on Santa Cruz Island showed a preference for chaparral-grassland, open grassland, fennel-grassland, and ravines. On Santa Rosa Island, spotted skunks were found to be associated with rocky canyon slopes, cactus patches, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, open woodland, other scrub-grassland communities, and riparian habitat along streams. On both islands, the species has also been recorded in or under human dwellings and ranch outbuildings. The elevational range of the Channel Islands spotted skunk extends from sea level to approximately 2000 feet.</p> <p>Channel Islands spotted skunks are nocturnal. Activity begins at dusk, peaks during the early evening, and continues intermittently until dawn. On Santa Cruz Island, spotted skunks nest in cavities, burrows, and other natural crevices, as they do on the mainland. Dens are constructed in roots and earth under shrubs, cavities in rocks, open grassy areas, road cuts, human-made structures, and trunks and roots of oaks. Individuals use several dens distributed throughout their home range; some dens are used by two or more individuals either sequentially, or for females, simultaneously.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Spotted skunks on the Channel Islands have similar diets as those reported on the mainland. Studies on Santa Cruz Island showed skunks to be carnivorous, consuming primarily island deer mice and insects along with occasional lizards. Jerusalem crickets were the most frequent prey, but other prey included grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, caterpillars, earwigs, and ants. Seasonally available fruits and berries were collected on Santa Cruz Island consisting of grapes, summer holly stems and berries.</p> <p>In recent years skunks have begun preying on seabirds nesting in sea caves on Santa Cruz Island. Expansion of skunk foraging to sea caves is likely a result of their substantial population increase following decline of foxes.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The breeding season for spotted skunks on the islands is probably similar to spotted skunks on the mainland. Western spotted skunks mate in September and October, and following delayed implantation and a 210-310 day gestation, give birth in April and May to 2-6. Counts of three and five uterine scars were recorded from two skunks collected at Santa Cruz Island in September.</p> <p>On Santa Cruz Island, California, in a 1994 study of 47 dens used by island spotted skunks, 29.8% were under shrubs, 21.3% in open grassland, 21.3% in cavities in rocks, 10.6% in road cuts, 10.6% under human structures, and 6.4% in cavities in roots and trunks of trees.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the IUCN Red List (2008), the Western Spotted Skunk is listed as Least Concern as they are widely distributed in a variety of habitats including human altered habitats. The species may be declining in parts of the United States but not at a rate fast enough to be threatened. In contrast, prior to the recent upswing in skunk numbers on the islands, the island spotted skunk was thought to be rare, and was listed as a Species of Special Concern by the state of California. when the Island Spotted Skunk had a small population and was not well-studied, the skunk that time was designated as a species of concern. However, recent surveys now show a remarkable recovery in the species. On Santa Rosa Island, skunks are marked and counted during annual population monitoring for island foxes, and as of 2011 there were approximately 3,000 skunks on Santa Rosa Island.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/sudden-increase-rare-endemic-carnivore-ecology-island-spotted-skunk/\">Ecology of the Island Spotted Skunk</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.dfg.ca.gov/wildlife/nongame/ssc/docs/mammal/species/46.pdf\">Channel Islands Spotted Skunk</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_skunk\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_skunk</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/136797/0\">ICUN Red List</a></li> <li>Coonan, T.

The American subspecies, , <em>F. p. anatum</em>, inhabits western north America, from Mexico to Canada and Alaska. This falcon species was a resident on the Channel Islands in years past, but largely disappeared due to harassment, shooting, egg stealing, and reproductive failure caused by organochlorine pesticides, such as DDT. However, this species has made a comeback due to reintroduction efforts. Peregrines were reintroduced on the islands in the 1980s and as of 2013, there are 45 active peregrine falcons on the eight Channel Islands.</p> <strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong> <ul> <li>The peregrine falcon is one of the most widespread birds in the world. It is found on all continents except Antarctica and on many oceanic islands.</li> <li>The name \"peregrine\" means wanderer, and the peregrine falcon has one of the longest migrations of any North American bird.</li> <li>People have trained falcons for hunting for over a thousand years, and the peregrine falcon was always one of the most prized birds.</li> <li>Formerly called the \"duck hawk\", peregrines are formidable hunters that prey on other birds (and bats) in mid-flight.</li> <li>Peregrines hunt from above and, after sighting their prey, drop into a steep, swift dive, or stooop, that can top 200 miles an hour.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> This raptor is identified by its long, pointed wings and a long tail. Its shape as well as its size makes it stand out—the long primary feathers give the peregrine a long-winged shape. As with most raptors, males are smaller than females, so peregrines can overlap with large female merlins or small male gyrfalcons. Adults are blue-gray above with barred underparts and a dark head with thick sideburns. Juveniles are heavily marked, with vertical streaks instead of horizontal bars on the breast. Despite considerable age-related and geographic variation, an overall steely, barred look remains.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The peregrine is found on all continents except Antarctica and on many oceanic islands. Within Channel Islands National Park, a 2011 survey revealed that peregrine falcons are found on all five islands in the park. Although the numbers are not large, historic evidence shows that the peregrine was sparsely distributed on the islands. Owing to factors relating to the imperative of protecting nesting sites, peregrines tend remain in the Channel Islands for life.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Habitat for the peregrine is closely associated with the nest territory and their foraging areas. On the Channel Islands this generally would generally include coastal strands, bodies of water, and shorelines.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Foraging areas are associated with the nest territory. This generally includes coastal strands, bodies of water, shorelines, open grasslands, marshes and wooded areas. Peregrines hunt in the air, and the usual method of hunting prey is by attacking flying birds from above or chasing them from behind (Recovery Plan, 1982). Prey consumed by California peregrines is highly varied, nevertheless, they feed primarily on other birds, such as songbirds, shorebirds, ducks, and, in urban areas, starlings and pigeons. Flying high above their intended prey, peregrines will \"stoop\" or dive and strike in mid-air, killing the prey with a sharp blow. At no nest sites do peregrines concentrate on a single prey or few species. Peregrines are generalists which hunt the large variety of prey that occur in their home range (Walton, 1997).</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Generally speaking, peregrines are monogamous, mate for life, and breed in the same territory their entire life. On the Channel Islands, pairs remain in the area around the nest cliff enough from July to January (i.e. the non-breeding season) to maintain possession of the nest site and drive out competitors (Walton, 1997).</p> <p>Peregrines do not make stick nests; although they may use old common raven (<em>Corvus corax</em>) or great horned owl (<em>Bubo virginianus</em>) stick nests. The cliff usually has a small cave or overhung ledge large enough to contain three or four full-grown nestlings. Several holes or ledges that can be used in alternate years are apparently not an absolute requirement but probably increase the suitability of the cliff (Recovery Plan, 1982).</p> <p>Peregrine falcons generally reach breeding maturity at 2 years of age. Usually, the male arrives at a nesting site and begins a series of aerial acrobatic displays to attract a mate. An average clutch of four eggs is laid in the spring, hatching about a month later. Peregrines vigorously defend their nests, although they may abandon them if severely or continuously harassed.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The use of DDT as a pesticide during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s resulted in a precipitous decline of peregrine falcons in North America. During this period of DDT use, eggshell thinning and nesting failures were widespread in peregrine falcons, and in some areas, successful reproduction virtually ceased.</p> <p>As a result, there was a slow but drastic decline in the number of peregrine falcons in most areas of its range in North America. By the time peregrine falcons were listed as endangered in 1970, the eastern population of the American peregrine falcon was gone and the populations in the west had declined by as much as 90 percent below historical levels. By 1975, there were only 324 known nesting pairs of American peregrine falcons.</p> <p>An aggressive recovery program began in 1974 and resulted in over 6,000 falcons being reintroduced to the wild. Now there are about 3,000 breeding pairs of American peregrine falcons in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Territory occupancy, nest success, and productivity are all at levels considered normal for healthy peregrine falcon populations.</p> <p>In August 1999, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the American peregrine falcon from the list of endangered and threatened species, marking one of the most dramatic successes of the Endangered Species Act. Post-delisting monitoring will continue until 2015.</p> <p>Surveys in 2013 recorded a total of 45 peregrine falcon territories on the eight Channel Islands, and 27 of those territories had eggs or chicks by the end of April 2013. In 2013 there were 5 territories on Anacapa, 16 on Santa Cruz, 13 on Santa Rosa, 9 on San Miguuel, and 3 on Santa Barbara (Sharpe 2013).</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/Peregrinefactsheet.pdf\">Peregrine Falcon Fact Sheet, US Fish and Wildlife</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Peregrine_Falcon/lifehistory\">All About Birds</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=19000\">Comrack, Lyann A. and Randi J.

From the creators of the earliest known cave painting and carvings to 20th century practitioners of modern art and even to today's tourists, humans have tried to grasp the essence of this magnificent creature – its enormous size, strength and beauty and its coexistence with and importance to humans. In 1994, paleontologists made the remarkable discovery of a pygmy mammoth on Santa Rosa Island, the most complete collection of its kind in the world.</p> <p>Found only on the California Channel Islands and nowhere else in the world, the pygmy mammoth was probably a small form of the Columbian mammoth found on the mainland. Pygmy mammoths varied from 4.5 to 7 feet high at the shoulders and may have weighed only about 2,000 pounds, compared to the 14-foot tall, 20,000 pound Columbian mammoth. In other respects, they were probably similar, with short fur, a typical mammoth body form, and a relatively large head.</p> <p>The first remains of \"elephants\" on Santa Rosa Island were reported in 1873. Additional excavations over the years have given a basic understanding of a population of mammoths on the islands which became smaller in body size through time and which perished as the Pleistocene ended. Paleontological excavations on Santa Rosa Island in 1927 and 1928 resulted in the retrieval of a significant collection of a new species described as <em>Mammuthus exilis</em>. Philip Orr of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History recovered additional materials during archeological and geological work on Santa Rosa Island during the 1940s and 1950s.</p> <p>Remains of mammoths are most common on Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands, with smaller numbers recovered from Santa Cruz Island and from San Nicolas Island, outside the park. The recovered specimens range in size from 4 to 8 feet at the shoulder, compared to the 12 to 14 foot height of mainland mammoths.</p> <p><strong>The Journey to the Islands</strong><br /> Approximately 40,000 to 20,000 years ago, a small group of 14-foot tall, 20,000-pound Columbian mammoths embarked on a journey that would eventually end in the development of a new species—the Channel Islands pygmy mammoth. Leaving the heavily grazed mainland behind, these Columbian mammoths swam towards the scents of abundant vegetation from the huge, mountainous island of Santarosae.</p> <p>Approximately 20,000 years ago when sea level was about 300 feet lower than it is today, the four northern islands joined together to form an Ice Age “superisland” known as Santarosae. This island was only 6 miles from the mainland at its closest distance. As the ice sheets and glaciers melted and the sea level rose, only the highest parts of Santarosae remained as modern islands.</p> <p>But how did they reach the island? With their snorkel-like trunk and buoyant mass, elephants, living relatives of mammoths, are considered excellent distance swimmers, among the best of all land mammals, and skilled at crossing watergaps. Documented accounts demonstrate that Asian elephant swim to islands they cannot even see – some up to 23 miles away—guided by the odor of ripening fruit and vegetation. There is no reason that Pleistocene mammoths were not just as seaworthy, and just as good at swimming.<span style=\"color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>Evolving into a New Species</strong><br /> Once on the island, the population of mammoths increased and, eventually, the food supply became scarce as the island decreased in size due to climatic changes – glaciers and ice sheets melting, and sea levels rising. Those mammoths that were smaller and could survive with less food and water were at an advantage, especially in times of seasonal shortages. Over time, smaller animals that required fewer resources became the norm. In addition, the absence of predators on the islands also may have contributed to this downsizing: large size was no longer needed for predator avoidance and defense.</p> <p>Within less than 20,000 years, natural selection favored smaller-sized mammoths that stood less than 6.5 feet tall at the shoulder, less than half the height of their mainland ancestor. Thus, the small mammoths became a new species, the Channel Islands pygmy mammoth.</p> <p>The pygmy mammoth is an extinct member of an ancient and unique group of mammals collectively known as probiscideans. This name comes from the Greek word probiscis and refers to the large or extended noses. While the fossil history of this group spans over 55 million years and more than 160 different species, today’s elephants are the last survivors of this widespread group of animals.</p> <p><strong>Extinction</strong><br /> After 200,000 years as one of Earth's most dominant species, mammoths, which once thrived across Europe, Asia and North American, became extinct nearly 10,000 years ago. The extinction of the mammoths was also part of the much wider phenomenon of disappearance of the world's larger mammals, which started about 40,000 years ago and reached its peak between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. Just what caused the demise of this Pleistocene megafauna is still unknown: nearly 30 years of research and testing has not yet provided an answer that is universally convincing.</p> <p><strong>Special Islands</strong><br /> Mammoth finds are by no means rare. Complete skeletons to cave paintings have been discovered on four continents in a wide variety of locations: an engraving of a mammoth on mammoth ivory found in a rock shelter southwestern France; a preserved frozen carcass of a baby male mammoth in the permafrost of Siberia; a sinkhole with more than 100 mammoth remains in Hot Springs, South Dakota; and, of course, our own mammoth find right here in our backyard, within Channel Islands National Park – the discovery of the world's first virtually complete pygmy mammoth skeleton in 1994.</p> <p>Studying the pygmy mammoth reveals how important the Channel Islands are in illuminating the mysteries of evolution. The isolation of the islands have made them natural laboratories of evolutionary extravagance, as seen not only in the pygmy mammoth, but also in the extinct giant mouse, the diminutive island fox, the munchkin dudleya, and the giant, bright blue Island Jay. Isolated from their mainland relations and exposed to unique environmental conditions, the ancestors of these plants and animals, along with over 70 others, responded by becoming new species unique to the island – found nowhere else on earth.</p>",

Contrary to earlier reports of only existing on that island, it is also found on Santa Rosa Island. The species is related to king snakes and rat snake, and is harmless to humans. Its somewhat threatening behavior, mimicking the rattlesnake, will sometimes get individuals of the species killed unnecessarily.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is one of many endemic species in the national park.<br />  </li> <li>When threatened, the species will elevate and inflate its body, flatten its head into a triangular shape, hiss loudly, and quickly shake its tail back and forth to make a buzzing sound which may be a mimic of a rattlesnake rattle.<br />  </li> <li>A powerful constrictor; the gopher snake kills prey by suffocating them in body coils or by pressing the animal against the walls of their underground burrows.<br />  </li> <li>Due to the more limited fauna of the islands, Santa Cruz Island gopher snake has a less varied diet than other subspecies of gopher snakes.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake, <em>Pituophis catenifer pumilus</em> (<em>pumilio</em> is Latin for \"dwarf\"), is just as its Latin translation indicates, a dwarf race rarely exceeding 3 feet in length. By contrast, the Pacific gopher snake, its mainland cousin, can reach 7 feet in length. The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is the only dwarf form of the species, even though three other subspecies also occur on islands (<em>P. c. fulginatus, insulanus</em>, and <em>coronalis</em>).</p> <p>The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake has a rather narrow head that is only slightly wider than the neck and when compared to other races, has a short and flattened snout and a rounded rostral. The adult coloration is typically a light greenish or grayish-white background with a profuse pattern of gloss-black blotches, becoming \"muddied\" or less contrasting with age. Males tend to pull up some bright yellow on their anterior ventral surfaces as they grow. Hatchlings are highly contrasted, being a very light grayish-white with black patterning and range in length from 6.5 to 9 inches.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is found on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands. On the mainland, gopher snakes are found widely throughout western North America.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake, like its mainland congeners, is a habitat generalist. It can be found in all vegetation associations on the two islands, but it is most common in open areas such as grasslands, dry streambeds, and oak and chaparral woodlands.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Due to the more limited fauna of the islands, Santa Cruz Island gopher snakes have a less varied diet than other subspecies of gophersnakes. Their diet probably includes mice, lizards, birds' eggs, and nestlings. Juveniles probably take small lizards, mice, and possibly insects.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> In spring, juveniles and adults emerge from rodent burrows or rock fissures, where they hibernate during the colder months of fall and winter. Adults probably reproduce in May with females depositing clutches (generally, four to six eggs) from late June through July and hatchlings emerging in September and October.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The California Department for Fish and Game lists the Santa Cruz Island gopher snake as a California Species of Special Concern. The recent removal of feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island was beneficial for Santa Cruz Island gopher snakes. Feral pigs destroyed habitat for snakes and preyed on them as well.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/p.c.pumilis.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/p.c.pumilis.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/p_c_pumilis.html\">http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/p_c_pumilis.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.channelislandsrestoration.com/sci/gophersnakeinfo.htm\">http://www.channelislandsrestoration.com/sci/gophersnakeinfo.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://slitherbriggs.webs.com/pcpumilis.htm\">http://slitherbriggs.webs.com/pcpumilis.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/311573/details\">http://eol.org/pages/311573/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/species.html\">http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/species.html</a></li> </ul>",

Contrary to earlier reports of only existing on that island, it is also found on Santa Rosa Island. The species is related to king snakes and rat snake, and is harmless to humans. Its somewhat threatening behavior, mimicking the rattlesnake, will sometimes get individuals of the species killed unnecessarily.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is one of many endemic species in the national park.<br />  </li> <li>When threatened, the species will elevate and inflate its body, flatten its head into a triangular shape, hiss loudly, and quickly shake its tail back and forth to make a buzzing sound which may be a mimic of a rattlesnake rattle.<br />  </li> <li>A powerful constrictor; the gopher snake kills prey by suffocating them in body coils or by pressing the animal against the walls of their underground burrows.<br />  </li> <li>Due to the more limited fauna of the islands, Santa Cruz Island gopher snake has a less varied diet than other subspecies of gopher snakes.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake, <em>Pituophis catenifer pumilus</em> (<em>pumilio</em> is Latin for \"dwarf\"), is just as its Latin translation indicates, a dwarf race rarely exceeding 3 feet in length. By contrast, the Pacific gopher snake, its mainland cousin, can reach 7 feet in length. The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is the only dwarf form of the species, even though three other subspecies also occur on islands (<em>P. c. fulginatus, insulanus</em>, and <em>coronalis</em>).</p> <p>The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake has a rather narrow head that is only slightly wider than the neck and when compared to other races, has a short and flattened snout and a rounded rostral. The adult coloration is typically a light greenish or grayish-white background with a profuse pattern of gloss-black blotches, becoming \"muddied\" or less contrasting with age. Males tend to pull up some bright yellow on their anterior ventral surfaces as they grow. Hatchlings are highly contrasted, being a very light grayish-white with black patterning and range in length from 6.5 to 9 inches.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake is found on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands. On the mainland, gopher snakes are found widely throughout western North America.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> The Santa Cruz Island gopher snake, like its mainland congeners, is a habitat generalist. It can be found in all vegetation associations on the two islands, but it is most common in open areas such as grasslands, dry streambeds, and oak and chaparral woodlands.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Due to the more limited fauna of the islands, Santa Cruz Island gopher snakes have a less varied diet than other subspecies of gophersnakes. Their diet probably includes mice, lizards, birds' eggs, and nestlings. Juveniles probably take small lizards, mice, and possibly insects.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> In spring, juveniles and adults emerge from rodent burrows or rock fissures, where they hibernate during the colder months of fall and winter. Adults probably reproduce in May with females depositing clutches (generally, four to six eggs) from late June through July and hatchlings emerging in September and October.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The California Department for Fish and Game lists the Santa Cruz Island gopher snake as a California Species of Special Concern. The recent removal of feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island was beneficial for Santa Cruz Island gopher snakes. Feral pigs destroyed habitat for snakes and preyed on them as well.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/p.c.pumilis.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/p.c.pumilis.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/p_c_pumilis.html\">http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/p_c_pumilis.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.channelislandsrestoration.com/sci/gophersnakeinfo.htm\">http://www.channelislandsrestoration.com/sci/gophersnakeinfo.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://slitherbriggs.webs.com/pcpumilis.htm\">http://slitherbriggs.webs.com/pcpumilis.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/311573/details\">http://eol.org/pages/311573/details</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/species.html\">http://www.kingsnake.com/pituophis/species.html</a></li> </ul>",

During the breeding season, March through September, plovers can be seen nesting along the shores, peninsulas, offshore islands, bays, estuaries, and rivers of the United States' Pacific Coast.In Channel Islands National Park, it is a permanent resident on Santa Rosa Island and is a summer resident on Santa Cruz Island.

Encountering a mass of the flies on the beach, a plover runs through the cloud of insects with its mouth open, snapping at them to catch them in mid-air.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Plovers are small birds with long, dark or grayish feet and legs, a short dark bill, large eyes, a rounded head, and long, narrow wings that end in a sharp point. These birds have cryptic coloration. The color of their dorsal areas matches and blends with their surroundings, making them well camouflaged and difficult to see against the sand. They turn away from predators, sometimes crouching to hide their darker head and breast markings. When the birds stop running they seem to disappear, blending into the surroundings.These little birds are sand-colored above and white below, with a narrow dark stripe on the forehead and a dark stripe behind the eyes. They have two, small, dark, partial breast bands and dark ear patches. In breeding season the distinctive markings are darker in males than in females. In winter the difference in sexes is less apparent.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Most western snowy plovers that breed in California's Central Valley and the Great Salt Lake migrate to California and Mexican coasts for the winter. During the winter months they rest and eat to build up their fat reserves for the migration to their summer breeding habitats. The California Pacific coast resident population usually congregates on sand spits and dune-backed beaches. In more urban areas they can be found on bluff-backed beaches.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> In Channel Islands National Park, it is a permanent resident on Santa Rosa Island and is a summer resident on Santa Cruz Island. On the Channel Islands they forage in the wet sand and amidst surf-cast kelp in the intertidal zone and in dry, sandy areas above the high tide. In winter, snowy plovers are found on many of the beaches used for nesting as well as on beaches where they do not nest, and on estuarine sand and mud flats.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Snowy plovers are primarily visual foragers, using the run-stop-peck method of feeding. They forage on invertebrates in the wet sand and amongst surf-cast kelp within the inter-tidal zone, in dry, sandy areas above the high tide, on salt pans, on spoil sites, and along the edges of salt marshes, salt ponds, and lagoons. They sometimes probe for prey in the sand and pick insects from low-growing plants. Western snowy plovers have a unique way to catch a meal of kelp or wrack flies. Encountering a mass of the flies on the beach, a plover runs through the cloud of insects with its mouth open, snapping at them to catch them in mid-air. Adults forage on invertebrates primarily along the water's edge.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The nesting season extends from early March through September, with peak nesting occurring from mid-April through mid-August. Their nests typically are shallow scrapes or depressions on the ground on flat, open areas with sandy or saline substrates, where vegetation and driftwood is sparse or absent. Plover nests are camouflaged and are barely visible to even the well-trained eye. 7 Typically, the plover lays three highly camouflaged eggs in the incubating process;this takes about 28 days, with the females sit on the eggs during the day, the males at night. To distract a potential predator away from the nest, the snowy plover performs broken-wing displays. By acting injured the bird appears to be easy prey and the predator's attention is drawn to the bird. The snowy plover frequently raises two broods a year, and sometimes three in places where the breeding season is long.The female deserts her mate and brood about the time the chicks hatch and initiates a new breeding attempt with a different male.</p> <p>Snowy plover chicks are about the size of a person's thumb when they hatch. They leave their nest within three hours of hatching. They flatten themselves on the ground when a parent signals the approach of people or potential predators. They walk, run, and swim well and forage unassisted by parents, but require periodic brooding for many days after hatching. Chicks reach fledging age about one month after hatching.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Pacific coast population of the western snowy plover was listed as threatened by the Fish and Wildlife Service on March 5, 1993. The population has declined due to many factors. Recreational and other human disturbance, loss of habitat to urban development, introduction of beachgrass and other nonnative species, and expanding predator populations have all contributed to a decline in active nesting areas and in the size of the breeding and wintering populations. It is estimated that about 2,000 snowy plovers may breed along the U.S. Pacific Coast and that there are 157 current or historical snowy plover breeding or wintering locations along the U.S. Pacific Coast (USFWS 2001).</p> <p>Channel Islands National Park is one of the few locations in southern California that still supports breeding and wintering populations of western snowy plovers. In the 1990s Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands had both breeding and wintering populations, but numbers have declined precipitously. A few birds also lived on The Nature Conservancy portion of Santa Cruz Island. On Santa Rosa Island the birds inhabited about 16 miles of coastline, while on San Miguel Island they were present on about 10 miles of shoreline (USFWS 2001). The Skunk Point area on Santa Rosa Island is an important nesting area and foraging area for juvenile and migrating plovers. Forty to fifty percent of the nests in this area have been found on rocky outcrops in the back dunes, about 490 to 980 feet (150 to 300 meters) from the shoreline (USFWS 1995).</p> <p>Much of the work done in the recovery and restoration of the western snowy plover on the west coast was based on a plan developed by the Pacific Coast Western Snowy Plover Recovery Team.This plan was acknowledged and utilized in 2007 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in their effort as the spearhead in the recovery effort. Much of the plan was implemented by the California Department of Parks and Recreation.</p> <p>A survey was taken in May 2012 that found the overall numbers of western snowy plovers on the west coast to be 1855, which was an increase from the initial recovery program survey in 2005. It is also a significant improvement over the population number of 1537, the number of plovers found in 2007 when the restoration program began. However, the species showed disappointing decline from a count of 1917 plovers in 2011.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Snowy_Plover/lifehistory\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Snowy_Plover/lifehistory</a></li> <li><em><a href=\"http://sfbaywatertrail.org/discover-the-bay/about-bay-species/western-snowy-plover/\">http://sfbaywatertrail.org/discover-the-bay/about-bay-species/western-snowy-plover/</a></em></li> <li><em><a href=\"http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/AnimalDetails.aspx\">http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/AnimalDetails.aspx</a>?</em></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/western_snowy_plover\">http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/western_snowy_plover</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/plover_natural_history.pdf\">http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/plover_natural_history.pdf</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/arcata/es/birds/WSP/plover.html\">http://www.fws.gov/arcata/es/birds/WSP/plover.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/about_plovers.html\">http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/about_plovers.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/state_parks_sharing_beach_brochure.pdf\">http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/state_parks_sharing_beach_brochure.pdf</a></li> <li>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2007.

The maternity roosts are established in areas with ideal temperature and humidity, and are easily disturbed; this has made the species somewhat rare. At the park, the species occurs only on Santa Cruz Island, where it forms an annual maternity roost in a historic building in the Scorpion Ranch area. The Santa Cruz big-eared bat colony is one of only a handful known in the state of California.</p> <p>Quick and Cool Facts</p> <ul> <li>A Townsend's big-eared bat's average lifespan is 16 years; bats may live up to 30 years.</li> <li>Highly maneuverable flyer; capable of flying at slow hovering speeds.</li> <li>Large ears funnel sound into ear canal, and may also provide lift during flight and assist with temperature regulation.</li> <li>Townsend's big-eared bats are very sedentary, with movement by females during the nursing season rarely exceeding 15 km., and movement at other times usually being less than 50 km.</li> <li>When it's roosting or hibernating, Townsend's big-eared bat curls up its long ears so they look like ram's horns.</li> <li>When flying they can rapidly extend or contract their ears. When flying with their ears extended the ears point forward and are nearly parallel to their body.</li> <li>They do not tuck themselves into cracks and crevices like many bat species do, but prefer open roosting areas in large rooms with their fur erect to provide maximum insulation and with their ears coiled back.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Townsend's big-eared bats, previously called lump-nosed bats, are a medium-sized bat with very long ears. Their fur is pale gray or brown above and buff colored on the underside. This bat's ears are enormous, reaching a length of 38 mm. When the ears are laid back they extend to the middle of its body. The face is marked by two large glandular lumps on either side of its nose.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Townsend's big-eared bat occurs throughout the west and is distributed from the southern portion of British Columbia south along the Pacific coast to central Mexico and east into the Great Plains, with isolated populations occurring in the central and eastern United States.</p> <p>On the Channel Islands, big-eared bats are found only on Santa Cruz Island. The species was first observed in 1939 on Santa Cruz Island in a historic 2-story ranch house at Prisoner's Harbor, which hosted a large maternity colony of over 300 individuals. Subsequent studies showed that the population resided in the same area until 1974, when the structure was removed. From 1974 to 1988, no other Townsend's Big-eared Bats were seen on Santa Cruz Island, before Dr. Pat Brown of UCLA, in 1991, was made aware of a colony of Townsend's roosting in the bakery room of the Scorpion adobe building. Presently, a large maternity colony continues to use the building and, occasionally, the rock caves in the Scorpion area. According to the 1994 Department of Fish and Game report, the Scorpion roost is one of only two or three coastal maternity colonies known to exist south of Pt. Conception.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Big-eared bats have been reported in a wide variety of habitat types ranging from sea level to 3,300 meters. Habitat associations include: coniferous forests, mixed meso-phytic forests, deserts, native prairies, riparian communities, active agricultural areas, and coastal habitat types. Distribution is strongly correlated with the availability of caves and cave-like roosting habitat, with population centers occurring in areas dominated by exposed, cavity forming rock and/or historic mining districts. They prefer open roosting areas in large rooms and do not tuck themselves into cracks and crevices like many bat species do.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Radio-tracking has shown that the Scorpion bats forage up to 5 kilometers away to feed on moths and other insects among the native oak and ironwood forest on the north-facing slopes of Scorpion Canyon, returning to the roost each morning. In contrast to other southwest bats, due to its relatively poor urine concentrating ability, it drinks water.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Winter hibernation colonies are comprised of males and females and range in size from a few individuals to several hundred bats. If undisturbed, colonies will occupy the same site indefinitely.</p> <p>In the summer, the females form a nesting roost. Males are solitary during the maternity periods. The maternity colonies consist of one or more small clusters, which rarely exceed 100 bats. Females are alert and active in the maternity roosts and prefer dark places for their roosts. These colonies form between March and June (depending on climate), with pups born between May and July. Maternity colonies choose sites that have warm, stable temperatures for pup rearing. Female bats usually only have one young a year. The newborns range in weight from 2.1-2.7 grams. There is a strong maternal bond and the young bats squawk when the mother is away. The young bats, however, grow quickly, being able to fly within three weeks. After two months, many of the young bats have left the nursery roosts, with male bats leaving before female. In their first year, male bats are almost certainly incapable of breeding while female bats are able to reproduce at the age of four months.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Historically, this species has declined due to direct killing by people and because of destruction or disturbance of roost sites. These animals are sensitive to light and movement so if they are disturbed during the day, they awake and their ears begin to move as they try to identify the intruder. If the disturbance occurs for more than a few seconds, the entire group takes flight and the roost may be abandoned.</p> <p>A study sponsored by the California Department of Fish and Game in the late 1980's documented a population decline of 40-60% in the past 30 years. Only about half of the maternity colonies known to exist in California prior to 1980 were active by 1991, resulting in an estimated 54% decline of adult females. Only three maternity colonies increased in size during the period, and all three are located in National Park areas (Point Reyes National Park, Lava Beds National Monument, and Pinnacles National Monument). Of the 23 roosts that are no longer available to bats, 9 (mostly buildings) have been demolished, 4 (all buildings) have burned, 4 (all buildings) have been renovated in such a way that bats were excluded, and 6 (including buildings, caves, mines, and a water diversion tunnel) have had the entrance closed.</p> <p>Consequently, for this species to exist, it is essential that human disturbance is minimized and the habitat preserved.</p> <p>Human intervention may have helped conserved the population on the west coast of North America, because man-made structures provide a shelter for big-eared bats.1 Channel Islands National Park staff continues with a program of monitoring and surveying this species to ensure its well-being.</p> <p>In 2008, the ICUN listed this species as Least Concern because of its wide distribution, presumed large population, the occurrence in a number of protected areas and because it wasis unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category. However, today the Townsend's Big-eared Bat, is state-listed as an Endangered species in Washington, a Sensitive species in Oregon, and as a Species of Special Concern in Texas, Montana and California, and they are on the Blue List in British Columbia.</p> <p>Additional Information</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/okanagan/esd/atlas/species/townsends.html\">www.env.gov.bc.ca/okanagan/esd/atlas/species/townsends.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.desertmuseum.org/kids/bats/townsends.php\">www.desertmuseum.org/kids/bats/townsends.php</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://sibr.com/mammals/M037.html\">http://sibr.com/mammals/M037.html</a></li> <li>California Wildlife Habitat Relationship System, California Department of Fish & Game, California Interagency Wildlife Task Group, M037, Updated by CWHR Program Staff, May 2000</li> <li><a href=\"http://relicensing.pcwa.net/documents/Library/PCWA-L%20549.pdfpg.2\">http://relicensing.pcwa.net/documents/Library/PCWA-L%20549.pdfpg.2</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li>British Colombia, Ministry of Environment, Land and Parks. 1998. <em>Wildlife at Risk: Townsend's Big-eared Ba</em>t.

The western gull, a big bulky bird, is a bold, skillful hunter and scavenger. For the most part, western gulls are coastal dwellers that concentrate mainly in the Southern California area. Due to their opportunistic nature and adaptability, they can also thrive in an urban environment. Unfortunately, because of close proximity to human environs, they are also subject to abnormal environmental pressures.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Found along the along Pacific Coast of North America with breeding sites from central Baja California north to Washington.</li> <li>Relatively limited in distribution compared to most North American gulls.</li> <li>Large colonies are found on Santa Barbara and Anacapa Islands.</li> <li>Western Gulls nest on offshore islands, rocks along the coast, and on islands inside estuaries.</li> <li>They nest on the ground and fill the nest with vegetation, feathers, rope, plastic, or other items they find.</li> <li>In colonies with many more females than males present, two females may establish a pair bond. Each lays eggs, and then takes care of the double-sized brood.</li> <li>The female-biased sex ratio of some western gull colonies may have been the result of pollution by pesticides that acted like estrogen and made some male embryos develop as females.</li> <li>It takes four years for a western gull to achieve its gray and white appearance.</li> <li>They can live up to 25 years old.</li> <li>Western gulls feed only on the ocean's surface and do not dive like many other seabird species.</li> <li>Like most gulls, the western gull is an opportunistic feeder, capturing its own live prey, scavenging refuse, or stealing food from seals and other gulls.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The adult western gull has a deep gray back and wings, with black wing-tips that blend into the rest of the wing, unlike many species where the black is clearly defined. The underwing is white with a narrow band of gray. The head is mostly white, with a limited amount of brown streaking, especially in non-breeding plumage. The large bill is yellow with a red spot, and the eye is dark yellow. The western gull is a four-4 year gull, meaning that it takes four years to achieve adult plumage. Juveniles are mottled brown, with a dark bill and dark eyes, and pinkish-gray legs. This plumage varies and takes on more of the adult plumage characteristics in each successive year.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The western gull is confined to the immediate Pacific coast and its adjacent waters. The islets of Anacapa, which is part of the Channel Islands National Park, hosts the largest protected breeding colony of western gulls in the world with over 10,000 gulls gathering during nesting season from May through July. There is also a sizeable colony of western gulls (approximately 7,000 pairs) on Santa Barbara Island.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Western gulls spend their life along the ocean and its adjacent waters. They usually breed on near-shore islands and human-made structures, but search for food at sea, along estuaries, and on the shoreline. Wintering gulls may move farther out to sea, but also forage and rest on buildings, parking lots, seaside parks, landfills, and jetties.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Western gulls feed over the open ocean or along rocky shores. When the western gull spots its prey, it captures it by pecking, grabbing, and shallow diving. The bird's omnivorous diet includes squid, clams, mussels, sea urchins, eggs, chicks, adult birds, zooplankton, and small fish like anchovy, whiting, eel, and rockfish. Other oceanic species use the western gull to find prey. In turn, this gull may follow seals to locate food. This resourceful bird scavenges the carcasses of large mammals and when their normal sources of food are diminished, gulls are quick to take advantage of an easy food source such as trash and leftover scraps. By exploiting unnatural food resources their population may be growing larger than it would naturally thus upsetting the ecosystem balance.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Western gulls choose a nest site out of the wind, and out of sight from other gulls. In colonies with many more females than males present, two females may establish a pair bond. Each lays eggs, and then takes care of the double-sized brood. In late April or May, the female lays two to three light olive to green eggs with dark markings. Both parents incubate; after 4 -5 weeks the gray, downy chicks with black spots hatch. Within a day, the chicks can walk and soon leave the nest. They freely scramble after regurgitated food. If the third chick is not fed enough, it may leave the territory. Neighboring gulls sometimes kill wayward chicks, but adoption is frequent. Chicks play by chasing or tugging on objects. Juveniles fledge in about seven weeks and are usually fed for three months, but sometimes follow adults and beg for up to six months.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Many western gulls do not migrate; the rest cover very short distances to remain on the Pacific coast of North America. Some move south of the breeding range into Baja California. Fall movements peak in October and most adult birds return to their breeding grounds in March.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Populations of western gulls have restricted range and therefore, are vulnerable to oil pollution, ocean acidification, and climate change. In addition, they have also suffered from human disturbances and in the past, introduced black rats on Anacapa Island. Visit Seabirds for more information about restoration activities on Anacapa to remove black rats.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></li> </ul>",

As its name implies, California sea lions can be seen along the rocky shoreline.<br /> <br /> <b>Stop 7: Signal Peak Tour-An Ocean Park and Sanctuary</b><br /> <br /> From this vantage point, one has the opportunity to gaze upon another part of the park: the marine environment. One nautical mile of water around each island is part of Channel Islands National Park, and the six nautical miles around each island form Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm, one often sees or hears California sea lions, northern elephant seals, or harbor seals. The island's isolated shoreline offers these pinnipeds an ideal combination of safety from predators and freedom from human disturbance, making the island an ideal place to rest, breed, and pup.<br /> <br /> But even Santa Barbara Island's isolation could not always protect these and other sea mammals from human predation. As early as the late 1700's, fur hunters were exploiting sea otters, fur seals, elephant seals, and sea lions for their fur, hides and oil. Sea mammal hunting ended in the early 1900's and laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act now protect these species. Today, elephant seals, sea lions, and harbor seals regularly breed along the island's shoreline. In this isolated environment, their protected populations are recovering from centuries of slaughter. Unfortunately, the sea otter has not yet returned.<br /> <br /> These pinnipeds, along with over 800 other marine species, also depend on the extensive kelp forests found in these waters for food, shelter, and protection- from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales feasting on plankton. Kelp is a type of algae that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing organisms on Earth-it can grow two feet per day.<br /> <br /> While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California coastal mainland, the isolated islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp forests don't just benefit marine species-they benefit us as well. Not only do we eat some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but everyday products like ice cream, salad dressing, and even toothpaste also use a little bit of seaweed as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredient called algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine plants and algae such as kelp provide Earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, human activities have placed the kelp forest and its inhabitants in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have altered the kelp forest ecosystem, and kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the 20th century.<br /> <br /> However, with the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls, fishing regulations, and increased research and public education, some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary, this network of MPAs provides a refuge for sea life, as well as opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 marine reserves (including one on Santa Barbara Island's southeastern side), recreational fishing and commercial harvesting are prohibited; limited fishing and harvesting are allowed in two marine conservation areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and an important part of a larger, worldwide effort to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.<br /> <br /> <b>Park Protection</b><br /> In 1938, Santa Barbara Island was proclaimed a national monument to protect, preserve, and teach us about the island's fragile resources and unique past. This distinction was reaffirmed and strengthened in 1980, when the island was included in the newly established Channel Islands National Park. By understanding these resources and the role isolation plays on these islands, the National Park Service can preserve them for future generations to study and enjoy.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service needs your help as well. We encourage you to explore and learn more about Santa Barbara Island and the rest of the Channel Islands-but don't stop there. In recognizing the importance of these islands, take your awareness to the action level. Make every effort to preserve the plants, animals, and artifacts found not only within this park, but throughout the world as well.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Enhydra lutris nereis</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Today in California, the sea otter is a beloved and almost an iconic marine mammal that plays an important role in influencing and bringing about public policy for the protection of all marine mammals. An occasional visitor to the Channel Islands National Park, it is well-represented in coastal areas from Santa Barbara to just south of San Francisco.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Sea otters are members of the weasel or mustelid family. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>Sea otters have the thickest fur of any mammal, at 850,000 to one million hairs per square inch. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>Adult sea otters can eat 25%-30% of their body weight in one day. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>Sea otters are one of the few animals to use tools. They eat animals with shells, like clams and abalone, and use a stone to break open the shells. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>Sea otters are the smallest marine mammal. <sup>1</sup></li> <li>The maximum estimated lifespan of sea otters is 23 years in the wild. <sup>4</sup></li> <li>Great white sharks are one of the primary predators of sea otters. <sup>4</sup></li> </ul> <strong>Appearance</strong><br /> As described by the FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World, “The sea otter is the most changed of its weasel family origins. The muzzle has a set of thick vibrissae (whiskers). The large head has a blunt snout, and is connected to the body by a short, stocky neck. The forelimbs are short and similar to those of other otters, with a loose flap of skin under each that is used to store food. The hind limbs are large and flattened like flippers; they are oriented backwards. Although the short tail is not noticeably tapered, it is flattened top to bottom into a paddle-like structure.<br /> <br /> The pelage (fur) of sea otters is the densest of any mammal (850,000 to one million hairs per square inch). A layer of sparse guard hairs overlays the dense underfur. Sea otters are completely covered with fur, except for the nose pad, inside of the ear flaps, and the pads on the bottom of the feet. The color of the fur is dark brown to reddish brown. Older individuals become grizzled, with the fur around the head, neck, and shoulders becoming almost white.<br /> <br /> Male sea otters reach lengths of nearly 5 feet and weigh up to 100 pounds. Females can be up to 4 and ½ feet and weigh up to 70 pounds. Newborn sea otter pups weight ranges from about 2 to 4 and ½ pounds.” <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Historically, the California sea otter’s ranged from Punta Abreojos, Baja California, Mexico to northern California and the offshore islands that are now Channel Islands National Park. Due to a period of extensive hunting for sea otter pelts, known as \"the Great Hunt\" between 1741 and 1911, the world population plummeted to as little as 1000 individuals. In 1938, the population in California was only about 50 animals. Presently, through restoration efforts, the sea otter has been increasing in the nearshore area waters along the mainland coastline of California from San Mateo County to Santa Barbara County. <sup>2</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Sea otters inhabit temperate coastal waters with rocky or soft sediment ocean bottom. They live in offshore forests of giant kelp and spend most of their active time foraging below the canopy. They eat, rest, and groom themselves at the water surface. While sea otters are capable of diving to depths of at least 45 meters, they prefer coastal waters up to 30 meters deep. The shallower the water, the less time is spent diving to reach food.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> An According to information provided by the Animal Diversity Web, through the University of Michigan Zoology Department, “the sea otters are carnivorous. They will eat nearly any fish or marine invertebrate they can find in their kelp forest foraging grounds. Their diet consists of marine invertebrate herbivores and filter feeders such as sea urchins, sea stars, limpets, coast mussels, chitons, and purple-hinged rock scallops. Otters also eat crabs, octopus, squid, and fish. Individuals tend to be specialized in their choice of prey; one otter may consume only urchins and crabs while another may eat mostly fish, depending on the abilities of the individual and local food availability. Otters consume 20 to 25% of their body weight each day. They obtain most of their water from prey but also drink seawater to satisfy thirst<br /> <br /> Sea otters commonly feed in small groups. Hunting occurs on the sea floor. They use their sensitive whiskers to locate small creatures in the dense kelp beds and crevices. They use their small, agile forepaws to capture prey and to rub, roll, twist, and pull apart prey. Sea otters collect invertebrates in loose folds of skin under their armpits and eat at the surface. The feeding process, including foraging, eating, and cleaning their fur after a meal, lasts 2 to 3 hours. Sea otters usually eat 3 to 4 times a day.<br /> <br /> Sea otters break open prey items with hard shells or exoskeletons with a rock. Some otters hold the rock on their chest and drive the prey into the rocks. Others leave the prey on their chests and hit the prey with the rocks. The same rock is kept for many dives. Otters often wash their prey by holding it against their body and turning in the water. Males steal from females if they get a chance. For this reason, females tend to forage in separate areas.” <sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Sea otters can reproduce year round. The peaks of birth in California are from January to March. Sea otters are one of several species of mammals that undergo delayed implantation in which the embryo does not implant during the immediate period following fertilization, but remains in a state of suspended growth allowing for birth to occur under favorable conditions. Females usually give birth about once a year, though many females experience longer breeding intervals, giving birth every 2 years. A single pup is born weighing from 3 to 5 pounds. Twins occur in 2% of births, but only one pup can be raised successfully.<br /> <br /> Male sea otters do not provide any care to their offspring. Pups are weaned at around 6 months of age but start to eat solid foods shortly after birth. Females carry their pups on their bellies while they nurse. Their milk is 20 to 25% fat. While a mother is foraging, she wraps her pup in kelp at the water surface to keep it from drifting away. At any sign of a predator, the female clamps onto her pup’s neck with her mouth and dives. Females groom their pups extensively for 3 months as their coat develops. A pup’s coat traps air, which keeps the animal afloat. Pups start diving at 2 months of age. The pup remains dependent on the mother for about 6 to 8 months. <sup>4</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The southern sea otter is designated a fully protected mammal under California state law (California Fish and Game Code §4700) and was listed as a threatened species in 1977 (42 FR2965) pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). As a consequence of its threatened status, the southern sea otter is considered by default to be a “strategic stock” and “depleted” under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.). <sup>2</sup><br /> <br /> Based upon a 2010 assessment, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, (IUCN) list of threatened species considers the sea otter to be endangered due its vulnerability to large-scale population declines. The species is believed to have undergone a decline exceeding 50% over the past 30 years (approximately three generations). Recent studies have found infectious disease to be an important mortality factor in California Sea Otter populations. Around 280 Sea Otters found dead have been linked “to a pair of protozoan parasites, Toxoplasma gondii and Sacrocystis neurona.</p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/\">Marine Mammal Center</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/\">Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office</a></li> <li>FAO Species Identification Guide: Marine Mammals of the World</li> <li><a href=\"https://lsa.umich.edu/ummz/\">Animal Diversity Web</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/\">The IUCN List of Threatened Species</a></li> </ol>",

It is a silence that is accented by an occasional call of a foghorn, a cry from a gull flying overhead, or the bellow of a protective male sea lion below. It is a reminder that Anacapa is an island, a world apart, isolated from the mainland by eleven miles of ocean.<br /> <br /> Isolation is an important facet of life on all the Channel Islands. It has fostered the evolution of plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. Plants and animals that are unique to a certain location are called endemic species. Isolation, essential for a species to become endemic, allows these creatures to become well adapted to their unique environment.<br /> <br /> Isolation has also played a major role in shaping human activities on Anacapa. The island's separation from the mainland, as well as its steep cliffs, have limited and directed human use and occupation of Anacapa for thousands of years.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Lighthouse Complex</strong></p> <p>At 11:00 pm on December 2, 1853, a frightening jolt woke the passengers aboard the side-wheel steamer Winfield Scott. Rushing on deck, they discovered that the ship had run aground in dense fog. Water poured into the ship's hold through two gaping holes in its wooden hull. Boarding the lifeboats, the passengers rowed to safety on Middle Anacapa Island, but the Winfield Scott was lost. Its remains lie submerged off the island's north shore.<br /> <br /> Despite the wrecking of the Winfield Scott and other ships off Anacapa's coast, a light was not placed on the island until 1912. Because of Anacapa's isolation, and the difficulties of building and supplying such a remote station, the first light was an unmanned, acetylene beacon placed atop a fifty-foot-tall metal tower.<br /> <br /> Responding to requests for better navigation aids along the Santa Barbara Channel, the Bureau of Lighthouses replaced the beacon with a lighthouse containing a 3rd-order Fresnel lens in 1932. The lens is now on display in the Anacapa Island Visitor Center.<br /> <br /> Buildings to support the lighthouse were constructed in the Spanish Revival style, characterized by tile roofs, stucco walls, and arched openings. The light station resembled a small town, with four residences flanking a main street that led to the powerhouse, oil house, general services building, fog signal building, lighthouse, water tank building, and other support structures. A series of ninety steps with two landings and a crane were built to transport people and gear from the landing cove to the top of the steep cliff.<br /> <br /> Anacapa's isolation has always presented special challenges to island residents. Food, water, and other supplies must be shipped from the mainland and hoisted up the steep slopes at the Landing Cove. Power is supplied by solar energy supplemented by generators; communications are by radio and cell phone.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Lighthouse Complex Timeline</strong></p> <p>- On December 2, 1853, the side-wheel steamer <em>Winfield Scott</em> collided with Middle Anacapa Island. The wreck's notoriety led President Franklin Pierce to sign an executive order the following year, reserving Anacapa for lighthouse purposes.<br /> <br /> - The island's rugged terrain made the cost too high for immediate construction. Charles Hillinger, in the The California Islands, wrote that when members of the U. S. Coast Survey team visited Anacapa in 1854 they reported that it was an ideal but impossible site for a light station. Quoting a report, Hillinger wrote, \"It is inconceivable for a lighthouse to be constructed on this mass of volcanic rock-perpendicular on every face, with an ascent inaccessible by any natural means . . . .\"<br /> <br /> - In 1874, Congress funded a less expensive mainland station at Port Hueneme.<br /> <br /> - At the turn of the century, increased shipping traffic heightens the need for an Anacapa light. In 1911, Congress funded an automatic acetylene beacon mounted on a 50 foot metal tower at the eastern edge of Anacapa. In clear weather, the light could be seen from 20 miles in the distance. A whistling buoy was also anchored 5/8 of a mile offshore.<br /> <br /> - An estimated nine-tenths of all vessels trading up and down the Pacific Coast passed through the Santa Barbara Channel by 1920. Members of the American Association of Masters, Mates and Pilots demanded a fog signal as well as a light. A permanent lighthouse, however, required authorization by Congress. When the tank steamer <em>Liebre</em> grounded on the east end of Anacapa Island on February 28, 1921, directly under the light tower, local inspectors blamed the inadequate station and the capsized whistling buoy.<br /> <br /> - In 1928, the Bureau of Lighthouses allocated funds for an Anacapa lighthouse, the last major light station on the west coast. The Bureau of Lighthouses Annual Report for 1929 gave an estimated total for the entire project of $186,000.00. It included station residences, service buildings, hoisting derricks, a fog signal, radiobeacon, and miscellaneous improvements for the water supply, sanitation, and grounds improvement.<br /> <br /> - Construction was carried out in two phases--landing facilities and roads, followed by the tower and support buildings. The engineering fete was completed in 1933 at a cost of $110,490. The new station provided beacon and foghorn service plus weather and radio monitoring.<br /> <br /> - The new lighthouse's keeper, Frederick Cobb, lit the first light on March 25, 1932. Located on the highest point of East Anacapa Island, the Anacapa Island Lighthouse became an indispensable resource to shipping and passenger boats. At the top of the 39-foot concrete cylindrical tower flashed a third-order Fresnel lens, one of the most advanced lighthouse beacons in the world.<br /> <br /> - From 1931 through the 1960s, the light station housed a crew of between 15 and 25 people who maintained the lens, fog signal and tower, hourly weather and radar monitoring and reports, and a radio tower.<br /> <br /> - In 1938, Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands were established as Channel Islands National Monument.<br /> <br /> - In 1939, the U.S.Coast Guard replaced the Lighthouse Service.<br /> <br /> - The Anacapa light is blacked out during World War II, when the facilities were used as a coastal lookout station by the U.S. Navy.<br /> <br /> - In 1961 the U.S. Coast Guard modernized the light station by replacing the fog signal system and installing electrical appliances. The following year, however, a new plan was outlined to automate the Anacapa Island Light Station and to establish a rescue facility at Point Hueneme Light Station.<br /> <br /> - U.S. Coast Guard tender crews were phased out in the early 1960's. By 1967, Anacapa's light is fully automated and was able to be operated from the mainland.<br /> <br /> - In 1966, orders were approved to demolish three of the dwellings, the engine equipment building, shops, water tank house in one phase. Phase two removal included: the hoist house on the lower landing, the lower derrick and hoist equipment, burning the general services building, converting the power building to emergency quarters for servicing personnel, and burning the remaining quarters building. In May 1967, three of the houses were demolished.<br /> <br /> - In 1970, the U.S. Coast Guard and National Park Service signed a cooperative agreement. The lighthouse and fog horn continued under U.S. Coast Guard jurisdiction. The other facilities were to be maintained by the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> - With the addition of Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands, Channel Islands National Park was established in 1980.<br /> <br /> - The light and fog horn were converted to solar power in 1989. An acrylic lens (airport beacon) replaced the original Fresnel lens, which was carefully relocated to the Anacapa Visitor Center. These modern lenses are small versions of Augustin Fresnel's invention, using the same technology employed by the nineteenth-century physicist.<br /> <br /> - The Anacapa Island Light Station was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Twelve buildings and structures listed as contributing resources in the nomination form were: lighthouse tower; fog signal building; assistant keeper's residence; general services building; tank house; derrick building; oil house; power house; lower landing; upper derrick landing; landing stairway; and concrete watershed (rainshed).<br /> <br /> - In 1993, a conservation project restored the Fresnel lens to its original lustre. Guided by the NPS Archaeological Preservation Office, the lens was disassembled, polished to remove corrosion, lacquered, waxed and reassembled by park personnel.<br /> <br /> - In 1995, the lighthouse was restored by the U.S. Coast Guard.<br /> <br /> - Today, while the park manages the island, the U.S. Coast Guard continues to operate the lighthouse and fog signal building as an active aid to. For safety reasons, visitors to Anacapa Island are not permitted to tour the lighthouse.<br />  </p> <p><strong>More Information: <em>Winfield Scott</em></strong></p> <p>Anacapa Island, while surrounded by relatively calm waters when compared to those west of it, experiences dangerous fogs and Santa Ana winds. A number of vessels wrecked on or near the island although only one seemed to have been related to pilot error. The wreck of the <em>Winfield Scott</em> in 1853 was the most important of the Channel Islands shipwrecks.<br /> <br /> Westervelt and MacKay of New York built the <em>Winfield Scott</em> in 1850 for a route between New York and New Orleans. Named for the commanding general of the U. S. Army, Mexican War hero and presidential nominee, the 225-foot steam paddlewheeler began travel between the east and west coasts when she joined the New York and San Francisco Steamship Line in 1852. She set a record for that route (via Cape Horn) of less than 49 days. She then took passengers between Panama and San Francisco, usually in overcrowded conditions. In July of 1853 the Winfield Scott was sold to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.<br /> <br /> Loaded with over 300 passengers and crew and a reported $1 million in gold bullion (some accounts but the figure at $2 million), the <em>Winfield Scott</em> departed San Francisco on December 1, 1853. The next evening Captain Simon F. Blunt chose to pass through the Santa Barbara Channel to save time, but in a dense fog crashed into Middle Anacapa at full speed at 11:00 in the evening. Apparently Blunt had turned southeast thinking he had cleared Santa Cruz or Anacapa Islands. Purser Watkins gave this account, which was published by the Alta California:<br /> <br /> \"The ship's bow struck first, staving two holes in the bow; then, in backing off, her stern struck and knocked away her rudder. Most of the passengers had gone to bed but they came on deck in alarm. They could only look out into a thick fog and see nothing of the land. After losing the rudder, the ship drifted off the island a few hundred yards and then was swept back to strike the shore again with her bow. She had already taken on much water and now sank up to her guards.<br /> <br /> The Captain immediately sent out a boat to see where he could land the passengers. The purser reported that a little island separate from the main one was nearest and that the passengers could be placed on it for the night. The next morning the passengers, some mail, and the treasure were taken onto the main island. Captain Blunt stayed cool, provided bedding and provisions for the passengers, and moved among them unceasingly in his efforts to make them comfortable.\"<br /> <br /> After being brought from the small pinnacle some 200 yards offshore to the island in the ship's boats, the large group camped on the island for up to a week. The California saw smoke from the passengers' fires and rescued the women. It returned on December 9 and, in heavy swells, removed the rest of the passengers, leaving the ship's company on the island who attempted to save mail, baggage, furniture and some machinery from the wreck. Other boats appeared for salvage opportunities, including that of Captain Horatio Gates Trussell, who used wood and two brass thresholds from the wreck in the construction of his Santa Barbara home.<br /> <br /> On the 10th the steamer Southerner hove into sight and landed provisions for the officers and crew. Up to that time, the Winfield Scott had not been broken up by the action of the waves. When the Republic arrived the next day, however, the midship was sunk and Captain Blunt gave up all hope of saving her or getting her off the ledge. The crew went out to the ship and saved what they could before boarding the Republic for San Francisco. Some time later, the side-wheeler toppled off the ledge and sank. The valuable cargo was apparently saved although the lure of gold still attracts divers, who are prohibited by federal law from disturbing the wreck site.<br /> <br /> In 1894 and during World War II major salvage took place on the Winfield Scott. One firm blasted the wreck in order to remove hundreds of large copper bolts and much of the iron machinery. The wreck became popular to sport divers who are now prohibited by antiquity laws from removing any artifacts. The wreck of the Winfield Scott is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /> <br /> The wreck scatter is surveyed each year by the National Park Service. The scatter is considered to be small for such a large vessel, with the bow and stern missing. The most prominent piece of wreckage is purported to be the port paddle wheel, which stands above the bottom.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "In addition to the tour in this application, there is also a self-guided trail booklet entitled \"East Anacapa Island Map and Guide\" that repeats the same information. This Map and Guide refers to a single booklet that can be picked up from a brochure holder adjacent to the introductory panel that is located both near the landing dock and at the Visitor Center.The booklet is illustrated with black and white line art and maps. Inside the booklet, the bottom of each page shows one of two images of East Anacapa Island: either the famous arched rock or the lighthouse, surrounded by steep cliffs that drop down to the ocean below.For each Trail Stop, this program will first describe the view, then the illustrations and words shown in the written guide. All views are described from left to right, assuming you are standing on the trail facing the numbered post at 12 o'clock.CoverThe cover shows two pelicans standing on rocks facing each other, with water in the distance. They are dark and have long white necks with a black strip on top, ending with a tuft of feathers at the crown of their white heads. Their long beaks are tucked downward, snug against their necks, like a bobby pin. MapGeneral Description: The map of East Anacapa Island is drawn across two pages, with north at the top of the pages. The scale shows that each page is about one mile wide, so the island is roughly one and a half miles wide. The map shows the trails and numbered stops that correspond with this guide. Squares indicate man-made structures. The island is shaped a bit like a long fish, with its head pointing to the East, or right. The lighthouse is like an eye, near the tip of the right side. The main trails on the island are shaped like a figure eight, turned sideways to run the length of the island, with a loop at the east and west ends, and a single trail connecting them in the middle, where the campground is located. The figure eight shaped trail is about one mile from end to end, but the winding loops make the full hike about three miles in total length. Detailed Description: The detailed description that follows assumes that you will follow the trail in a clockwise direction but you may go counter clockwise as well. Your GPS will automatically trigger the information for each spot, no matter which route you take. Starting from the landing point where the boat docked at the northeastern corner of the island, a trail heads southward. The first branch on the right side leads to the northern side of the eastern loop trail. If you continue straight instead, you will reach the Visitor Center, Ranger Station, Picnic Tables, and Restrooms. Here there is a left hand branch that leads about one quarter-mile to the lighthouse on the eastern end of the island. There is also a right hand branch that takes you back to the north side of the eastern loop. This branch is #1 of the guide.If you continue south along the main trail, it takes you to the southern edge of the eastern loop, and #2, near a building. Further along is #3, near Pinniped Point. At the end of the eastern loop, you pass a campground and restrooms on your left. The loop closes and a single trail continues to the west. In about 500 feet is #4. In another 500 feet is #5, at the beginning of the western loop, with a branch to the right that leads to the northern side of the western loop. If you continue straight along the southern edge of the loop, after about 600 feet you will reach #6. Another 700 feet later, you will reach the edge of the island and #7. This is called Inspiration Point. If you continue northward, the loop continues, returning the middle of the island. When you reach the eastern loop, the northern side takes you past Cathedral Cove, which has another #3 stop with views similar to those seen earlier, except that now you will be on the southern side of the loop. In another 600 feet or so, you will reach another #2 stop, again with views similar those seen on the southern side.The guide for the map reads, \"How to use this trail guide. There are two routes indicated on the map above. Both routes begin at the visitor center. You may take the lower trail located in front of the buildings, which leads to Cathedral Cove. Or you may take the upper trail located behind the buildings, which leads to Pinniped Point. Both routes cover the same information. For variety, we recommend you take the opposite route back.Before beginning your exploration of Anacapa please note a few rules that will ensure your safety and protect the plants and animals on the island. Stay a safe distance back from cliff edges. The soil on the cliffs is unstable, and many of the overlooks are undercut. Do not risk your safety for a \"better\" view. Stay on the marked trails. Many of the plants on Anacapa are fragile, the soil is easily eroded, and off-trail travel disrupts roosting and nesting seabirds. No collecting. The park's natural and cultural resources are protected by federal law. Please, leave Anac",

You may notice the broad, elevated coastal plain stretching in front of you, one of six on the island. These plains are remnants of what geologists call \"marine terraces\"-ancient shorelines carved flat by wave action and exposed through changes in sea level and tectonic uplift of the land. A future marine terrace (called a wave-cut platform) is being created today by wave erosion at the base of the sea cliffs.<br /> <br /> The Channel Islands' first shoreline was created around five million years ago, when compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in the folding and faulting of marine sediments and volcanic rocks (deposited between 15-30 million years ago) and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today-Santa Barbara Island, as well as the other Channel Islands, continues to be uplifted.<br /> <br /> Ever since these compressional forces caused the islands to emerge from the sea, the Channel Islands have been separated from the mainland. And unlike the four northern islands, which were once joined as a single, \"super island\" known as Santarosae, Santa Barbara Island has never been connected to another neighboring island.<br /> <br /> For decades, however, scientists assumed that the northern islands (Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands) were connected to the mainland by a land bridge, but as bathymetric information (or topography) of the sea floor improved, it revealed that even during periods of lowest sea levels (about 17,000 years ago), the islands still remained isolated by at least four miles of ocean. It is this continuous geographical isolation that has shaped island life.<br /> <br /> <strong>Santarosae</strong><br /> Although never connected to the mainland by a land bridge, the four northern islands were once part of the Pleistocene 'superisland' known as Santarosae, nearly four times as large as the combined areas of the modern Channel Islands. The dark shaded area on the map depicts ancient coast of Santarosae and California around 20,000 years ago when sea level was 100 meters (approximately 350 feet) lower than it is today. As the ice sheets and glaciers melted and the sea level rose, only the highest parts of Santarosae remained as modern islands.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing near a steep coastal cliff, with an ocean cove below. If you are facing the cove, you are facing west. In the distance, a flat, grassy plateau slopes down into two points that stretch out into the sea, creating another distant cove, but its shoreline is obscured by the closer landform. To the right, or north, and just off shore, is Shag Rock-a large sea rock with a steep shoreline.<br />A wooden bench, with two \"legs\" and a wooden plank seat, is near the edge of the cliff providing a splendid view of the right side of the cove. Be careful if you decide to sit on it, as it is covered with white bird droppings. In front of the bench, low wooden railroad tie planks lie on the ground, marking the edge of the cliff<br />At your feet, the gritty soil has tiny fragments of broken shells and white rocks. Much of the ground is covered with this bare earth, but there are patches of coastal sagebrush, ice plant, and Greene's dudleya, a pale grey-green succulent with thick, fleshy leaves clustered in a rosette shape.<br /><br />To the east and west are stands of coreopsis, on thick stalks with feathery green leaves and mounds of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers in the spring, and brown, shaggy clumps or dried leaves and blooms in late summer and fall. <br />",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Shearing was Scorpion's Biggest Operation </b><br /> <strong><em>Every year, thousands of sheep were sheared in the shed that once stood right here.</em> </strong><br /> <br /> Shearing season was the liveliest time of year for the ranch. In the early years of ranching, more than 60 temporary workers arrived for the six-week spring (and sometimes fall) shearing season. Humming with life, you'd hear the snip snip of shears, sheep bleating in the pens, and snatches of song but little talking as the shearers tackled the job of flipping sheep on their backs, shaving them, and stuffing sacks with wool.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>Packing Scaffold </strong> </b><br /> All that remains today is the packing scaffold to the right of the kayak concession buildings. After a shearer clipped a sheep, a ranch hand tied the fleece into a bundle and threw it up to a sacker. The sacker threw it into a long burlap sack hanging from a scaffold. He then stepped down into the sack, hanging onto a rope for support, and stomped the fleeces down. When a sack was full, the end was tied with curved needle and heavy thread. Full sacks weighed 300-400 pounds.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>Shearers</strong> </b><br /> Workers days were filled with backbreaking, physical work, but shearers were paid for every sheep they sheared. The faster they worked, the higher the wage. A good shearer could clip 100 or more fleeces a day.<br /> <br /> Some years were better than others. The number of sheep sheared depended on how many could be rounded up. Sometimes drought reduced the size of the flock too. Usually, the shearers at Scorpion clipped between 3,500 and 5,000 sheep annually. Island-wide, the most sheep sheared in a year was over 50,000 in 1890 - enough to make 88,000 sweaters.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>It was a Long, Rough Route to Market</strong> </b><br /> The work didn't end once shearing was finished. Getting livestock and wool to markets on the mainland was difficult, but essential for a successful business. Sea transport was unreliable - unpredictable weather made transport dangerous and difficult to schedule. The risks were great and the costs high - livestock, cargo and human lives were lost to the sea.<br /> <br /> Even loading goods was a challenge. Before the pier was built, all goods, including skittish livestock, were wrestled from the rocky beach onto shaky skiffs or rafts. These small craft transported the goods to larger ships anchored in the harbor. Building the pier helped, but it didn't solve all the loading problems - in 1959, the wooden pier collapsed from the weight of heavy wool bales.<br /> <br /> <strong><b>Out on the Range </b> </strong><br /> <strong><em>Rounding up the island's wild sheep was tough, exciting, and crucial to the ranch's success.</em> </strong><br /> <br /> The Santa Cruz Island Company treated its sheep differently than most mainland ranches. Instead of being herded, the sheep roamed freely in vast pastures. They ventured into steep canyons and up inaccessible mountainsides. The sheep were not used to being herded. These conditions forced traditions from early California to continue on Santa Cruz Island - tough cowboys (vaqueros) combed the rough terrain on horseback to round up the lively sheep.<br /> <br /> When the Gherinis took over the east end in 1926, they built an elaborate fencing system to enclose the range. This improved the quality of pastureland and made it easier to control the sheep. Some sheep still ran wild in the hills, however. The vaqueros never caught them all; many of the island sheep escaped being sheared their whole lives.<br /> <br /> <em>For three generations vaqueros have been riding on the island. Every spring they come for the yearly round of sheep, called from earlier times corrida. Most of them are barbarenos, born in or near Santa Barbara... the vaquero's get-up consists of a blue shirt and jeans, a knife stuck in his belt in a leather sheath, a worn old hat,not a fancy sombrero. He knots a red or blue cotton bandana around his neck. The vaquero's tools are a good horse and a reata, a rawhide lariat coiled and tied near the saddle horn</em>.<strong> </strong> -Helen Caire<br /> <br />  </p>",

Corrals are located behind the buildings. To the left is a wooden framed structure that once held sacks of wool.",

San Miguel Island is the farthest west of the Channel Islands and experiences the harshest seas, wind and fog. The island and Point Conception provided landmarks to mariners traveling south marking the entrance to the Santa Barbara Channel. George Davidson wrote that San Miguel \"receives the full force of the northwest winds and swell, and in summer, fogs envelop it more than half the time.\" He wrote, \"There are more dangers around San Miguel than around any of the islands of the Santa Barbara group,\" because of its numerous offshore rocks and shoals. For instance, Don Morris and James Lima wrote of Simonton Cove as \"a gigantic catcher's mitt for those who misnavigate\" as they attempt to use it as a lee shore. Other hazards include Westcott Shoal, Castle Rock, Wilson Rock and the ever-changing shoal and sand spit at Cardwell Point at the eastern end of the island. Only Cuyler Harbor has provided a suitable anchorage although even it has hidden dangers in the form of submerged rocks.<br /> <br /> Morris and Lima detailed the following shipwrecks around San Miguel Island in their report Submerged Cultural Resources Assessment: Channel Islands National Park and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary :<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Manila Galleon</strong></em> (rumored, no date). Tales of the remains of a Manila galleon off San Miguel Island spurred a failed attempt by a salvage company to investigate and recover any artifacts in 1974. Reportedly located in approximately 50 feet of water off the northwest side of San Miguel Island, no physical or documentary evidence has been uncovered to substantiate the rumors.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Leader</strong></em> (1876). The Leader was a small (36 feet) sealing schooner which, when at anchor on the northwest side of the island on June 17, 1876, was pushed ashore by a heavy swell. The crew, under Captain Charles Lutgens, recovered about half of the empty casks and continued their sealing operations for about a month until rowing for help at Santa Rosa Island. Wreckage has not been found and is probably scattered over a wide portion of the coast.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>G W Prescott</strong></em> (1879). The five-year-old coastal lumber schooner, loaded with railroad ties evidently destined for the Southern Pacific Railroad at Los Angeles, stranded at an unknown location at the west end of San Miguel Island on August 15, 1879. Little else is known of the incident. Island residents apparently made use of any salvaged lumber, as accounts note the use of railroad ties in island construction projects following that date.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Surprise</strong></em> (1881). The small sealing schooner, owned by the Rogers Brothers of Santa Barbara, wrecked on March 13, 1881, when winds parted the anchor cables. Captain Charles Brown, crew John Haskell and Ramon Mesa, and a Mr. Muller who had chartered the vessel, were unhurt. She was reported to be high and dry and possibly a total loss, but in May the schooner Conway towed her to Santa Barbara for repairs that would \"place the Surprise in as fine trim as ever.\"<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Isabella</strong></em> (1885). This 35.4-foot sealing and fishing sloop lost anchor in a storm and wrecked at Cuyler Harbor in December of 1885. Her remains have not been located.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Liberty</strong> </em>(1895). The Liberty supplied William Waters' sheep operation on San Miguel Island and transported sheep and wool to Santa Barbara. Built in 1876, she was a small (34.6 feet) sloop of less than 14 tons burden. On March 28 or 29, 1895 the Liberty sank in Cuyler Harbor, at the time reported to be the result of a wave generated by a massive landslide which pulled the sloop from its anchor. The crew, under Captain Dally, located the wreck some three-quarters of a mile from its anchorage. The Los Angeles Times reported that \"A careful inspection revealed the curious fact that her bow had been stove in as if the boat had received a sharp blow from beneath the water and her mainmast lay amidships among her deck pointing sternwards. The anchor chains were wound around her keel as if the sloop had been rolled over and over and the anchors were but fifteen feet away, half buried in sand.\"<br /> <br /> Morris and Lima speculated that the landslide story \"may have been concocted to cover a bad job of anchoring\" and they appear to be correct: while a massive landslide was documented in the harbor that year, it occurred almost three weeks previous to the wreck, and Waters himself had written that the Liberty had been elsewhere during the event.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>N B</strong></em> (1897). This small schooner, built in 1853 in San Francisco, had been a Rogers Brothers vessel engaged in sealing, otter hunting and fishing. She had recently been sold to Ledbetter and Jackman when a storm forced her ashore, possibly on the northeast side of the island and likely at Cuyler Harbor. Little else is known and wreckage has not been located.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Santa Rosa</strong></em> (1899). The 61-foot schooner Santa Rosa belonged to the owners of Santa Rosa Island, being their island transport for the sheep operation there. The boat may have been in Cuyler Harbor to load sheep or bring supplies as the San Miguel boat had wrecked four years before. The Santa Rosa stranded in Cuyler Harbor after encountering high seas, despite the crew's efforts to lay anchor.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Kate and Anna</strong></em> (1902). Another small sealing schooner met its doom while at anchor in Cuyler Harbor as a northwester parted the anchor chain and drove her ashore. All was lost but the crew of six escaped through the breakers. Captain Charles Lutgens may have been the same as the captain of the Leader, which wrecked on the island in 1876.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>J M Colman</strong></em> (1905). This 105-foot coastal lumber schooner was en route to San Pedro from Washington State with up to 800,000 board feet of lumber when, after 36 hours of dead reckoning in a dense fog, she went ashore on the northwest part of Point Bennett on September 4, 1905. The Captain and half the crew waited on the island as Mate Patterson and four sailors rowed for help. The men in the rowboat had a hard struggle until they reached a point about 16 miles off the coast where they were picked up by the Mandalay. The schooner Chehalis hurried to the rescue bringing officers of the J. A. Hooper Company, owners of the J M Colman, to the scene. On September 10, the fog was still so thick that other vessels were also endangered. The Comet narrowly missed drifting up onto the rocks next to the J M Colman as she was already inside Richardson Reef. The large square-rigged vessel, loaded with lumber herself, was saved when a timely breeze cleared the fog. On the 14th, the J M Colman's hull was wedged between the two rocks with the prow to the sea. The bottom was gone; other vessels could not come near to help save the rigging or transfer the lumber. Finally, on September 26, crews transferred 60,000 feet of lumber. Seamen remained with the wreck for three weeks longer hoping to tow her out, but she lay deep in the ocean filled with water.<br /> <br /> The ship was a total loss and salvagers worked for over a year removing the load of lumber in the hold. Some of this lumber reportedly provided William Waters and John Russell with the materials to build their large ranch house on the island. National Park Service and other archeologists have surveyed wreck scatter, presumed to be that of the J M Colman.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Anubis</strong></em> (1908). The German steel-hulled cargo steamer stranded at a kelp-laced location between Castle Rock and the island on July 20, 1908, reportedly due to a defective compass. The 382-foot Anubis carried a cargo of lumber, tallow, and wheat as well as 67 passengers and crew. After it struck, Anubis settled on the rocks when in-rushing water extinguished the fires under the boilers and caused the vessel to list. The crew set to work heaving part of the deck load overboard. Captain Von Salzen sent his First and Third Mates and seven seamen in a lifeboat to Point Conception where the lighthouse keeper telegraphed for aid.<br /> <br /> The vessel had gone through a half mile of densely woven kelp before she struck, so she lay surrounded by kelp and deep water. On the 23rd, nine persons went to the mainland in a lifeboat. Meanwhile all abandoned ship for Flea Island except for the captain and crew. Captain Frank Nidever and a group of seal hunters arrived at the wreck on the power schooner Ynez. They had been camped on San Miguel Island when the Anubis struck the ledge, but the fog was so heavy that, even though they sailed out within 200 yards of the ship, they missed her. When the fog cleared, they saw her and Nidever took his schooner out to be of aid. Rescuers jettisoned more of the cargo in an attempt to refloat the ship. The Santa Barbara Morning Press headline on July 23 read: \"Swelling Grain May Burst Ship Asunder.\" Wide cracks had appeared in the decks, and the ship was considered lost. The ship laid easily, crew on board, since rocks protected it from the heavy seas. On the 27th, divers went down and reported a number of small holes and a good many sheared rivets in the bottom, but prospects were good for floating the ship and replacing the broken steel plates. The steamer Fulton took 450 tons of cargo and the steamer Dee Westport also took cargo to San Francisco. Part of the cargo, sacks of flour, was salvaged by those on the island and others, including Ira Eaton who reportedly removed 1,800 tons of cargo over a period of three weeks. On July 30, the crew pumped out the forward and after holds, lifted out the freight, and hauled her off the sunken ledge with anchor cables attached to the tug Goliath. The ship still had ten watertight compartments fore and aft, the water being mostly amidships. In Cuyler Harbor, she was patched up and then towed to San Francisco. The Anubis was the first ship to have been pulled off the islands and also the largest to be wrecked there.<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Comet</em> </strong> (1911). A wood-hulled coastal lumber schooner of 429 tons burden, the Comet was built in 1886 by the Hall Brothers of Washington, builders of the J M Colman. The ship was carrying 500,000 feet of lumber from Aberdeen, Washington to San Pedro when, on the foggy evening of August 30, 1911, she struck Wilson Rock and then stranded at Simonton Cove. Later inquiry blamed a faulty chronometer. While the captain, his wife and crew boarded a lifeboat for Santa Rosa Island (where they were transported to Santa Barbara to report the wreck), one man was left behind and drowned as he tried to swim to the wreck. Severe conditions hindered salvage and the schooner broke up on the beach. The owners of Santa Rosa Island contracted for the salvage, but were succeeded by San Miguel Island resident William Waters who paid $1,000 for the rights. Various parts of the ship are exposed when the beach sand has been depleted by storms, for instance in 1977, 1984 and 1999, when archeologists made a concerted effort to document parts of the schooner.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Pectan</strong></em> (1914). A 471-foot Union Oil Company oil tanker heading north under in ballast to Port San Luis, Pectan ran ashore on the sandy beach at Adams Cove near Point Bennett on the evening of January 21, 1914. With no apparent damage to her hull, she rested on the beach with her crew of 49 aboard, while several vessels attempted to pull her off; a tug brought fresh food and water for the crew. The captain decided to wait for a high tide on February 10, and on that date the ship could be freed without assistance.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Watson A West</strong></em> (1923). This sleek, four-masted coastal lumber schooner was built in 1901 and delivered lumber to California and ports around the world. Laden with 800,000 board feet of lumber she wrecked on February 24, 1923 near Point Bennett and immediately broke apart: \"She struck so hard the men in their berths were thrown out and instantly she broke and began to fill with water,\" reported a Santa Barbara newspaper. The crew rowed to Santa Barbara, a journey of 18 hours, without food or water. They arrived at the foot of State Street in Santa Barbara exhausted, hungry and half-clad. Captain Sorenson had been with the ship since its launching 22 years before. The owners failed to salvage the lumber aboard, and at least some of it contributed to the fencing and outbuildings of the ranch on San Miguel Island. Remains of the Watson A West have not been located.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Cuba</strong> </em>(1923). This 307-foot cargo-passenger liner, built by Blohm and Voss in Germany in 1897, was seized by the United States during World War I. The Pacific Mail Steamship Company purchased the steel-hulled ship from the government in 1920 and christened her the Cuba. Equipped with the latest electrical and radio equipment, the Cuba steamed between South America and San Francisco with ports in between. On her ill-fated last voyage she carried about 40 passengers, a cargo of coffee and a valuable load of silver bullion. Practically lost in the fog for three days and with an inoperative radio, the Cuba struck rocks near Point Bennett in the early hours of September 8, 1923. The Second Officer had failed to follow orders of Captain J. C. Holland, who had requested that he be awakened at 3:00 a.m. or earlier if visibility decreased. Finally awoken in distress at 4:00 a.m., the Captain was too late to avoid the disaster. Lifeboats removed all passengers, most to the beach at Point Bennett, except for one which voyaged along the south shore and eventually encountered a ship, and two others which mistakenly headed west only to sight a Navy destroyer in the thick fog. The destroyer rescued the passengers from the beach; it has been alleged that the busy wireless traffic surrounding the Cuba wreck may have contributed to the disastrous wreck of a flotilla of Navy destroyers at Point Arguello shortly after the Cuba went aground.<br /> <br /> The Captain and six crewmembers stayed with the ship for about a week, camping in a fisherman's hut at Point Bennett. Two guards were posted after the officers left, but their effectiveness was questionable. Numerous parties, including Ira Eaton of Santa Cruz Island, plundered the ship. At one point an armed showdown occurred between two rival salvage bands. One group, probably Eaton's, removed a reported $400,000 worth of items from the ship, including furniture, a piano, nautical instruments, radio equipment, fine doors and wood panels, glassware, linen and cargo. The ranch house at San Miguel Island received at least a number of corner sinks and the safe from the ship.<br /> <br /> The Cuba's wreckage has been considered the most compact and organized of all the major wrecks in the park. Park marine archeologists surveyed her in October of 1989 and found the wreckage to be somewhat vandalized by brass salvagers but intact. As Morris and Lima wrote, \"Its historical and archeological potential is far greater than the brass artifacts that have lured vandals here in the past.\"<br /> <br /> <em><strong>W. T. Co. No. 3</strong></em> (1935). A movie company hired a barge to assist in filming parts of Mutiny on the Bounty off Point Bennett. After finishing work for the day, the barge was being towed to its anchorage at Adams Cove with about 75 people aboard when a \"blast of wind\" caused the barge to founder. All aboard were swept into the seas and one man, assistant cameraman Glenn Strong, drowned while attempting to rescue a camera.<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Ruth K</em> </strong> (1960), Josie Lena (1962), Warrior and Legend (1967), Frederick Q (1974). The small fishing boat Ruth K parted anchor and stranded in Cuyler Harbor on the night of December 13, 1960. Almost two years later, on August 5, 1962, the 47-foot fishing boat Josie Lena met the same fate in the same location. Two boats wrecked in 1967. The Warrior struck a reef at an unidentified location off the island and sank on October 13, and the TransPac-winning racing yacht Legend stranded on the island after several days lost in the fog. The 46-foot fishing vessel Frederick Q from San Francisco foundered at an unidentified location off the island on November 29, 1974.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Uta Stansburinia</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The interesting and unique side-blotched lizard is found on both Anacapa and Santa Cruz islands in the national park, as well on the southern Channel Islands of Catalina and San Clemente. It is a smallish lizard with novel mating behaviors that have been documented in recent studies. Although it is a common and widespread species on the mainland, it nevertheless has an important niche in the park's ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The specific epithet, stansburiana, is in honor of Captain Howard Stansbury of the United States Corps of Topographical Engineers, who collected the first specimens while leading the 1849-1851 expedition to explore and survey the Great Salt Lake of Utah. <em>Uta</em> is a reference to the state of Utah.</li> <li>Different color morphs, or types, occur in males of this species. Males can have yellow, orange or blue throats, each color indicative of a respective, unique mating strategy.</li> <li>Recent research on the different-colored males has revealed evidence of cooperative mating behavior in this species.</li> <li>Males use a push-up display to defend their territory.</li> <li>This lizard is short-lived, living only about one year.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The side-blotched lizard is a small brownish gray lizard ranges from 1.5 - 2.5 inches long from snout to vent. It has small smooth granular scales on the back, larger scales on the head and limbs, a gular fold, a long thin tail and a dark blue-black mark on the sides of the chest behind the front limbs, which gives this lizard its name. This mark is sometimes faint or absent. The lizards overall color is brown, gray, yellowish, or black, with dark blotches, spots, and sometimes stripes. Often there is a double row of dark spots or wedges on the back, edged with white on the rear. The underside is whitish to gray and mostly unmarked. The throat is mottled with dark and light. Males are more colorful than females, having blue speckles on the upper surfaces, which are most visible during the light phase. Males also have a swollen tail base and enlarged postanals, but no distinct blue coloring on the belly (which can be found on male lizards of many other species.) The throat is marked with blue, orange, or yellow. Males often have many blue speckles on the tail and the posterior of the body.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The side-blotched lizard is found throughout most of western North America. It is common to abundant throughoutarid and semi-arid regions of the state, excluding most of northern California, the Sacramento Valley, the Sierra-Cascade ranges, and several of the Channel Islands. Its elevation range extends from below sea level to over 8000 ft. Prefers open habitats including desert, coastal scrub, chaparral, grass, juniper, pine-juniper, Joshua tree and valley-foothill.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Side-blotched lizards are found in habitats comprising a wide variety of arid and semi-arid situations with scattered bushes and/or scrubby trees; soil may be sandy, gravelly, or rocky. The species is often found in sandy washes with scattered rocks and bushes. As a diurnal reptile, it is usually the first lizard species out in the morning due to its small size which allows it to warm up quickly. It is active mostly on the ground, but it is also a good climber. The side-blotched lizard is often seen basking on rocks, hopping from boulder to boulder, or running quickly along the ground.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Side-blotched lizards eat a wide variety of insects and other arthropods. Little time is spent foraging. Lizards feed opportunistically on any moving insect of suitable size that passes nearby as they bask or move about their home range. Food also includes scorpions, spiders, mites, ticks and sow bugs. Some vegetable material is eaten either accidentally or possibly for water.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Biologist Barry Sinervo from the University of California, Santa Cruz has discovered a rock-paper-scissors strategy in the mating behaviour of the side-blotched lizard species <em>Uta stansburiana</em>. Males have either orange, blue, or yellow throats and each type follows a fixed, heritable mating strategy. Orange-throated males are strongest and do not form strong pair bonds; instead, they fight blue-throated males for their females. Yellow-throated males, however, manage to snatch females away from them for mating. The large size and aggression is caused by high testosterone production. Blue-throated males are middle-sized and form strong pair bonds. While they are outcompeted by orange-throated males, they can defend against yellow-throated ones. Because blue-throated males produce less testosterone they are not as large as the orange-throated males, but it gives them the advantage of being less aggressive and able to form strong pair bonds. Yellow-throated males are smallest, and their coloration mimics females. This lets them approach females near orange-throated males and mate when the males are distracted. This is less likely to work with a female that has bonded with a blue-throated male.This can be summarized as \"orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange\", which is similar to the rules of rock-paper-scissors.</p> <p>The breeding season lasts from March to August. Mating occurs from April to May; egg deposition occurs from late April to August. Females store sperm for delayed fertilization. Side-blotched lizards are monogamous. Clutch size is positively related to size of female, winter rainfall and spring annual production, and inversely related to season and density. Clutch size varies from 1 to 8 eggs (average = 4). Hatchlings appear from June to late September. Development time also decreases with season and is 61 to 77 days. Males and females reproduce the first spring following hatching at approximately (1.72 in) snout-vent length.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the species <em>Uta Stansburinia</em> is of Least Concern owing to this lizards very large number of occurrences or subpopulations. The total adult population size is unknown but surely exceeds 1,000,000. The extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, number of subpopulations, and population size are large and relatively stable.

Derived from the Cruzeño word pipiw, 'white.'   <br /> <br /> <b>Ethnographic Island Place Names</b><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside sits beside the corral, just beyond the pier and picnic area. A timeline demonstrates how Prisoners Harbor has welcomed a diversity of visitors to its calm and protected shores. Six images cross the middle of the panel to illustrate different periods of occupation here at Prisoners Harbor from 5,000 years of Chumash occupation to present day. The images overlay an aerial photograph of Prisoners beach to include the pier, picnic area and landscape in our immediate vicinity. Lines are drawn from the smaller timeline images to points in the landscape to mark the approximate location of each element. <br />Text reads:<br />- A Busy Port of Call<br />Prisoners Harbor has bustled with activity for thousands of years<br />Chumash swiftly plying the waters in tomols; curious European explorers setting foot on the island for the first time; abandoned Mexican prisoners searching for a way to escape; bleating sheep and rolling wine barrels racing down the pier; Navy landing crafts unloading cargo on the beach; and hopeful birders seeking a glimpse of the island scrub-jay near the largest coastal wetland on the islands. For thousands of years Prisoners Harbor has welcomed a diversity of visitors to its calm and protected shores. <br />The first image in the timeline series is an illustration of three Chumash paddling along the shores of Santa Cruz in a type of canoe called a tomol. <br />Caption reads: <br />In 1542 at least 1,200 Chumash lived in 10 villages along Santa Cruz Island's coast. Xaxas, one of the largest villages, was located here for over 5,000 years and served as a major port of trade and a departure point for cross channel travel.<br />The next image in the timeline marks the location of the pier. This black and white photograph taken from high on a ridge looks down at the ranch house complex, pier and shoreline. <br />Caption reads: <br />Recognized as the island's best harbor, ranchers began developing this area they called \"La Playa\" in the 1860s by constructing the first large wharf in Santa Barbara County. Although repaired, modified, and rebuilt many times, the pier has always been the island's main artery.<br />The third image in the timeline marks our current location at the corral. This black and white photograph illustrates the use of fencing to corral livestock. A few men on horseback are in and around a corral built near the pier. <br />Caption reads:<br />The area before you was the location of the harbor's earliest corrals. As the ranch transitioned from sheep to cattle in the 1940s, new corrals were built across the road on the filled-in wetland. When the wetland was restored in 2011, the corrals were returned to their original location. <br />The fourth image in the timeline series marks the location of the warehouse building just beyond the corral. This black and white photograph shows eight men in cowboy type hats, jeans and work shirts. Some wear vests. They all are standing in a row in front of the double doors of the brick warehouse building. In front of them are stacks of railroad ties.<br />Caption Reads:<br />In 1887 the double warehouse was constructed using stone and bricks quarried and manufactured on the island. A narrow-gauge rail system transported wool, wine, and other supplies from the warehouse to the end of the pier for shipment to the mainland.<br />The fifth image in the timeline marks the location of the former ranch house complex just up the dirt road from the warehouse. This black and white photograph shows the creek in the foreground and the two-story adobe ranch house and outbuildings set against the steep hills of the CaÃ±ada del Puerto.<br />Caption Reads:<br />An adobe ranch house was first constructed here in the mid-1800s and was later enlarged into an elegant, ten-room residence. Although it was torn down in 1968 after extensive flood damage, historic plantings such as agave and ornamental flowers still mark its former location.<br />The final image in the timeline series represents present day. The color photograph shows the steep ridges and shoreline of Prisoners Harbor and the pier stretched out into the blue green waters. A large white ship that transports visitors is docked at the pier. <br />Caption Reads: <br />Today, Prisoners Harbor continues to serve as the gateway to the island. To preserve the harbor's resources, the National Park Service has restored the coastal wetland, rebuilt the pier, repaired historic ranch structures, and protected archeological resources.<br />",

    "audioDescription": "A close-up of a large prehistoric looking bird, a great blue heron, wading with long legs in the shallow water of a wetland spans the panel. This crane like bird has a blue gray body, long snaky neck and a black and white striped crown on its head. It’s long, dagger like, yellow bill gulps a fish. A quote by Henry David Thoreau highlights the panel title A Wild Wetland: “the wildest and richest gardens that we have...” Text Reads: A Wild Wetland This wetland supports a diverse and abundant array of native flora and fauna. In 2011, the National Park Service and The Nature Conservancy began restoring the Prisoners Harbor wetland, the largest coastal wetland on the Channel Islands. Reduced by more than 50 percent in the late 1800s and early 1900s, this wetland once again provides a variety of habitats (open water, marsh, riparian, and woodland) for a large diversity of native plants and wildlife. Five smaller photographs with captions of plants, animals and the former ranch complex are stacked along the right side of the panel. First an image of brant. This small goose with white underbelly and a black head, chest and back rests on the surface of the water. Caption reads: Situated on one of the great migratory corridors of the continent (the Pacific Flyway), coastal wetlands provide waterfowl and shorebirds habitat to rest, feed, and overwinter. Next a photograph of the island scrub jay. This large crow sized bright blue bird has a long tail, broad head and thick black bill. Its white underbelly is in sharp contrast to the brilliant blue sheen of its back. A distinctive rusty-gray patch marks the upper part of the wings. Caption Reads: Landbirds, such as the endemic island scrub-jay, use wetland habitats for breeding and foraging. Then a photograph of the small cat-sized reddish brown island fox The diverse habitats of the wetland are frequented by bald eagles, island spotted skunks, Santa Cruz Island deer mice, Santa Cruz Island harvest mice, and Santa Cruz Island foxes. A close up photograph of the Santa Cruz Island bush mallow flower. Fuchsia pink in color, this delicate paper like flower has five simple petals around a white center. The wetland and stream channel provide habitat for a variety of native plants, including the endemic and endangered Santa Cruz Island silver lotus and Santa Cruz Island bush mallow. The last photograph in black and white taken in 1903, illustrates the Prisoners Harbor ranch house called La Playa. Tucked into the rugged landscape sits this elegant two story white adobe home with island made wrought iron railings along a second story balcony. An ornamental wrought iron rail fence surrounds a lush front yard garden. A smaller kitchen building is separated from the house. Near the kitchen building is a tall windmill that stands on top of a stone well. The stone well is all that remains today. Caption Reads: What’s a Well Doing in a Wetland?

    "bodyText": "<p><em><strong>Explore the native plant garden to learn about island plant species, communities, adaptations, and Island Chumash use of native plants.</strong></em><br /> <br /> Channel Islands National Park's mild climate, with short wet winters, long dry summers, and extensive coastal fog, is one of the best examples of the highly endangered Mediterranean ecosystem. A fascinating variety of over 700 native plants persist within the park, some of which are represented in the island native plant garden.<br /> <br /> This diversity is due to the many plant habitats existing on the islands that are rarely intact on the mainland. The islands also bridge two biogeographic provinces that support some plants usually found on the mainland only to the north, as well as some typically found to the south.<br /> <br /> Over 60 of these island species, like the munchkin dudleya, are found nowhere else on Earth-they are endemic or unique to the Channel Islands as a result of continuous isolation from the mainland. Most of these endemic species are considered rare, and 14 are federally listed as threatened or endangered due to human actions, livestock grazing, and the spread of nonnative plants.<br /> <br /> To protect these rare species, the National Park Service has made efforts to restore the islands' native vegetation through the removal of non-native plants and animals. You can help with this recovery by cleaning your boots and other possessions before you visit the islands to make sure you don't accidentally introduce nonnative species. Together we can ensure the protection of this wild remnant of coastal southern California.</p> <h3>Ways to Enjoy the Garden</h3> <p>- Follow the pathway and read the signs to learn about plant communities and identify plant species.<br /> <br /> - Use the trail guides or our mobile app to learn about island plant adaptations and Island Chumash use of native plants.<br /> <br /> - Not just for kids! Use the Junior Ranger booklet (available in the visitor center) or the bingo cards in the adjacent box to play garden bingo.<br /> <br /> - Visit the garden throughout the year to see the seasonal changes.<br /> <br /> - As in all national parks, everything is protected. It is illegal to feed, collect, disturb, or harm park plant life, wildlife, or other features.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "AUDIO DESCRIPTION INTRODUCTIONYou are standing outside of the Channel Islands National Park Visitor Center at the entrance to the Native Plant Garden. You are facing north. The Visitor Center is to your right, and the garden is straight ahead, from 12 o'clock to 8 o'clock. A dirt path stretches ahead of you, entering the garden.As you step onto the dirt, an introduction panel is immediately on your right. INTRODUCTION PANELTitled, \"An Island Garden,\" this panel shows a map of the garden, a yellow dudleya flower, a pine tree, and a flowery meadow with a seagull and lighthouse, in the distance.Dudleya flower image detail:A hikers boot-clad feet are a few inches from a flowering dudleya plant. The leaves of this succulent stick out from a central point, almost like a single rose flower with thick, fleshy, grey-green petals. Each plant is only one or two inches high. Red stems rise up from each plant, topped by actual flowers that are yellow and about four inches tall. The plant is growing in white gravel, surrounded by a scattering of smaller, dormant or off-season flowers with dead-looking foliage and dried brown blooms.Pine Image detail:From under the branches of a Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine, we look down over a large bay, with Santa Cruz Island continuing into the distance and the Pacific Ocean beyond. A few more trees are seen nearby. Flowery meadow image detail:A sea gull is standing in a field of yellow flowers of coreopsis with a lighthouse in the distance, and the Santa Monica Mountains at the far horizon. The gull is white with grey wings and a yellow beak. The field around the bird is dotted white with other gulls, standing in the field. They are evenly spaced, about 20 feet apart. Garden MapGeneral Description:The map is oriented with north up. It shows a garden about a half acre in size, or about Â½ the size of a football field. It is about 100 feet wide and 200 feet from north to south. The map shows the nine plant communities in the garden, and the trails leading through them. The central trails are in the shape of three connected loops, stacked in a \"snow man\" shape, with four dead end branch trails sticking out where the arms and legs might be. A red \"You Are Here\" box shows where you are standing, in the southeast corner of the garden, at the southeastern \"foot\" of the \"snow man\" trail. Detailed Map Description:The plant community right in front of you is island woodland. The other \"leg\" of the snowman-shaped trail is west of you at 8 o'clock. It is surrounded by coastal bluff scrub, and is bordered by beach and dune plant communities beyond. The three, stacked looping trails are ahead of you at 10 and 11 o'clock. The low, southern loop trail surrounds a coastal sage scrub plant community in the foreground and maritime cactus scrub on the far side of the loop. Beyond that, the middle loop trail cuts through a riparian woodland plant community on the east side and valley and foothill grasslands on the west side. Farther away, the northern loop trail surrounds an island chaparral plant community. At the very end of the garden is an island pine forest, cradled between the two trail \"arms\" that stretch up to the north. The Spinnaker Drive road you arrived on is shown in the southwest corner. West and north of the garden is a service road. Administrative offices and the Visitor Center are to the east, and another garden, labeled \"demonstration garden,\" lies across the sidewalk to the south.Volunteer Gardeners:A small photo by the map shows four men and women gardening in the natural landscaped area along the entrance sidewalk to your left. Yellow coreopsis flowers line the edge of the native plant garden. On a low concrete wall, words read, \"Channel Islands National Park, National Park Service.\" The National Park Service arrowhead symbol is also on the wall. Detailed National Park Service Logo Description:The National Park Service symbol, also shown in the upper right corner of the Panel, shows a tan-colored, flat arrowhead, pointing down. On the top are the words, \"National Park Service\" and a black and white sketch of a large green pine tree with shrubs nearby, with a snow-capped mountain in the distance. Near the tip on the bottom are the words, \"Department of the Interior\" and a sketch of a tan-colored buffalo with a large, shaggy head. The buffalo's body has large front legs and tall, rounded shoulders. It slopes downward in the back, to hindquarters about two-thirds the height of its shoulders. On your right, a couple of feet ahead, you will find a large metal box with a hinged top. Inside will be three slots with pamphlets. From left to right you will find Island Chumash Indian Plant Usage, Island Plant Adaptations, and Island Native Plant Garden Bingo. A smaller box, further ahead on the right, explains that Plant Guides cost $1.00, and asks that you either purchase them or return them, when you are done. A slot in the box at the 2 Â½-foot height is where you can insert payment for the",

    "bodyText": "<p>Welcome to Anacapa Island, one of five islands in Channel Islands National Park. The park was established to protect,preserve, and enhance our understanding of the islands' unique past and remarkable resources.</p> <h3>Get Acquainted</h3> <p>Twelve miles from the mainland, Anacapa Island emerges from the ocean as a five-mile-long volcanic rock divided into three islets-East, Middle, and West. Waves have eroded the island, creating towering sea cliffs, sea caves, and natural bridges, such as 40-foot-high Arch Rock-a symbol of Anacapa Island and Channel Islands National Park. The island provides critically important habitat for endemic plants and animals, pinnipeds, and seabirds, including the largest California brown pelican rookery in the United States.</p> <h3>\"Mirage\"</h3> <p>For thousands of years, the Chumash visited Anacapa Island, which was known to them as \"Anyapakh,\" meaning \"mirage.\" The first European settlers, fishermen, and sheep ranchers arrived in the 1800s. The Coast Guard built the last permanent light station on the west coast in 1932. Protection for the island began in 1938 when Anacapa Island (along with Santa Barbara Island) became a national monument. In 1980 it was designated as part of Channel Islands National Park. The island waters are protected by the National Park Service, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, and the State of California.</p> <h3>You Have a Role to Play</h3> <p>Everyone who visits this national park plays an important role in safeguarding the island plants, animals, cultural sites, and artifacts. Help protect your park by taking a moment to read the information provided here and follow up with actions that preserve the islands' fragile resources.<br /> <br /> For additional information on park regulations, safety, and things to do please refer to the park newspaper, brochure, and bulletins available near the visitor center and picnic area or visit www.nps.gov/chis.</p> <h3>Protect Yourself and Your Park: Rules and Regulations</h3> <p>Everything is protected.<br /> As in all national parks, it is illegal to feed, collect, disturb, or harm park wildlife, plant life, or other natural, historical, and archeological features.<br /> <br /> Hike only on designated trails.<br /> Visitors are required to use the designated island trail system. No off-trail hiking is permitted. Visitors should stay back from cliffs and should not rock climb as the cliffs and rock faces are very unstable. For more information on island hiking please refer to the park newspaper and the trail guide available near the visitor center and picnic area<br /> <br /> Remove your garbage.<br /> Visitors are required to pack out what they pack in, including garbage, and to secure their food and trash from birds and animals at all times.<br /> <br /> No pets.<br /> Domestic house pets can carry diseases that could harm the rare island fox or other animals that are unique to the island.

The kelp forests are an underwater gathering ground, attracting a crowd of creatures normally scattered throughout the surrounding waters.<br /> <br /> From its surface fronds, the giant seaweed extends below, attached to rocks of the nearshore reef. This vertical ecosystem becomes a passageway between air, sea and island worlds. Human divers can join pinnipeds, algae, fishes and marine invertebrates in the green shadowed thickets.<br /> <br /> <b>More Information on Kelp Forests and the Marine Environment</b><br /> The Channel Islands lie within a large embayment known as the Southern California Bight-an area just below Point Conception where the California coastline turns sharply to the east. Within this area, the sea floor is comprised of canyons, banks, escarpments, sea mounts, and deep basins (the Santa Cruz Basin off the island's south coast is deeper than the Grand Canyon). Nutrient-rich waters upwelling from these depths mix and mingle with cool waters from the north (California Current) and warm southern waters (California Countercurrent), creating the Santa Barbara Gyre-a swirling eddy that circulates nutrients and supports a wealth of marine plants and animals, from giant kelp forests and blue whales to tiny crabs and plankton. Here, northern and southern species overlap, creating a transition zone between the Oregonian and Californian marine biogeographic provinces. The western islands harbor numerous northern species, while southern species are more common on the eastern islands.<br /> <br /> One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park (six nautical miles around each island is part of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary).<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm below one may be able to see or hear California sea lions. These playful animals are often spotted around Anacapa's coast, hauled-out on the rocks. Sea lions, along with a variety of other marine species, depend upon the extensive kelp forests that can be found around Anacapa Island and the other Channel Islands. While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California mainland coast, the islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of algae that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing plants on earth-it can grow two feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales seeking a plankton snack.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use tooth-paste are also using a little bit of kelp as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredient called algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine plants such as kelp provide the earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have completely altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the century.<br /> <br /> However, with the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls, and fishing regulations, transplantation of kelp, public education, and various research programs some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provide a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 Marine Reserves (including the Anacapa Island Marine Reserve in the waters below you and stretching from Arch Point to Frenchys Cove), recreational fishing and commercial harvest are prohibited; limited fishing and harvest are allowed in the Anacapa Island Marine Conservation Area around the north side of West Anacapa. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.</p>",

Title reads: Kelp Forest: kelp forests support nearly a thousand species of animals, from tiny snails to muscular sea lions.<br /><br />16 animal species are labeled within the illustration; lush green macrosystis kelp reach like underwater trees to the water's surface. The bumpy, orange ocher star, bat star, warty sea cucumber, acorn barnacles, spiny purple urchin, pink abalone sea snail, California mussel and solitary green anemone all adhere themselves along portions of the ocean floor and underwater cliffs of the island. A California sea lion glides through the water while a scuba diver watches kelp bass, sheephead, opaleye and bright orange garibaldi fish swim in the water column. A solitary horn shark waits at the bottom, camouflaged with small dark spots on brownish skin while the spiny lobster peeks out from a crevice in the rock.<br /><br />Yellow green mats of kelp float at the water's surface.

A Network of 13 Marine Protected Areas covering 318 square (240 square nautical miles) have been established by the state of California and the federal government to provide refuge for sea life. <br />A map of the three islets of Anacapa Island and a color key of their Marine Protected Area designation is displayed on the panel. From left to right; West Anacapa, Middle Anacapa and then our location; East Anacapa. The waters surrounding West Anacapa are shaded purple and designated a Marine Conservation Area that Prohibits taking of all living, geological, or cultural resources, except for commercial and recreational fishing for lobster and recreational fishing for pelagic finfish. The waters along the eastern half of West Anacapa are considered Special Closure with prohibited access out to 120 foot depths from January 1 to October 31. The waters of Middle and East Anacapa are shaded orange on the map and designated Marine Reserve which prohibits taking of all living, geologic or cultural resources.<br /><br />Marine Protected Area Regulations are listed: diving, surfing, swimming and boating are allowed within Marine Protected Areas (or MPA's) but fishing is restricted. Anchoring and transit through MPAs with catch onboard is allowed, so long as fishing gear is stowed and not in use. <br /><br />Below the map of Anacapa Island, four photographs line the bottom of the panel. Each illustrates the richness of species and diverse habitats here. <br /><br />From left to right; sunlight illuminates the water as a scuba diver watches a bright orange garibaldi fish. Next, a person in a red kayak and blue life vest paddles under the curve of the 40-foot-high Arch rock, next a leopard shark with large, oblong brown spots on tan skin swims by. Last, an image of a rose colored California sheephead fish swims among the green kelp and bright pink corals. <br /><br />Text Reads: Marine Protected Areas enhance opportunities for recreation, education and science.

Images include a close up of the island fox, a cluster of creamy yellow Santa Rosa Island paintbrush flowers and a sweeping view of an island landscape with its curved bays, rugged hills and rare Torrey pine trees. <br /><br />Text reads:<br />Protect your park from invasive, non-native species by cleaning your boots, clothing, and gear. <br /><br />Use the nearby brushes to remove soil, seeds and other materials from your boots. Clean your clothing and gear before boarding to prevent the introduction of invasive, nonnative species and protect island species.<br /><br />Nonnative species are plants and animals that originate elsewhere and are brought to a new area where they can harm native plants and animals, damage food crops and spread disease at an estimated cost of $138 billion in economic damage each year in the United States. <br /><br />Nearly half of the endangered plants and animals in the United States have been impacted by nonnative species. Plants and animals living on islands are especially vulnerable to extinction due to their small populations, limited range, and lack of genetic variability. Unique island species like the island fox and Santa Rosa Island paintbrush have been pushed to the brink of extinction by nonnative species. <br /><br />Everyone who visits this national park plays an important role in preventing the introduction and spread of nonnative species. Each year botanists find new weeds on the islands that have been accidentally introduced. By brushing your boots and cleaning your clothing and gear, you can become part of the solution. Please help protect your park.",

The lighthouse is a cylindrical white building about four or five stories tall. It is slightly narrower at the top than the bottom. At the bottom is one window. The top has several windows facing in every direction. Above those windows is a smaller cylinder made of diamond-shaped glass panes, with a cone-shaped roof. Centered within the upper cylinder is a large lens, which magnifies the \"light\" of the lighthouse. A low railing surrounds around the upper glass cylinder.<br />On the bottom of the panel are two more plant photos: Island morning glory, with heart-shaped green leaves and white flowers with pink-tinted edges and yellow centers; and Greene's dudleya, a plant shaped like a single flower with thick, fleshy, grey-green petals. Each plant is only one or two inches high. <br />",

From its surface fronds, the giant seaweed extends below, attached to rocks of the nearshore reef. This vertical ecosystem becomes a passageway between air, sea and island worlds. Human divers can join pinnipeds, algae, fishes and marine invertebrates in the green shadowed thickets.<br /> <br /> <b>More Information on Kelp Forests and the Marine Environment</b><br /> The Channel Islands lie within a large embayment known as the Southern California Bight-an area just below Point Conception where the California coastline turns sharply to the east. Within this area, the sea floor is comprised of canyons, banks, escarpments, sea mounts, and deep basins (the Santa Cruz Basin off the island's south coast is deeper than the Grand Canyon). Nutrient-rich waters upwelling from these depths mix and mingle with cool waters from the north (California Current) and warm southern waters (California Countercurrent), creating the Santa Barbara Gyre-a swirling eddy that circulates nutrients and supports a wealth of marine plants and animals, from giant kelp forests and blue whales to tiny crabs and plankton. Here, northern and southern species overlap, creating a transition zone between the Oregonian and Californian marine biogeographic provinces. Santa Cruz Island lies in the middle of this transition zone. The western half of the island harbors numerous northern species, while southern species are more common on this eastern end of the island.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island also serves as the meeting ground for seabirds and shore birds that rarely occur together, such as black oystercatchers from the north and American oystercatchers from the south. Both species, as well as hybrids between the two, have nested at Fraser Point on the island's west end. Other northern birds, such as pelagic cormorants and<br /> pigeon guillemots, overlap with additional southern species, such as Scripps's murrelets and California brown pelicans.<br /> <br /> One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park (six nautical miles around each island is part of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary).<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm below one may be able to see or hear California sea lions. These playful animals are often spotted just to the west of Potato Harbor, hauled-out on the rocks. Sea lions, along with a variety of other marine species, depend upon the extensive kelp forests that can be found around Santa Cruz Island and the other Channel Islands. While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California mainland coast, the islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of algae that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing plants on earth-it can grow two feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales seeking a plankton snack.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use tooth-paste are also using a little bit of kelp as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredient called algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine plants such as kelp provide the earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have completely altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the century.<br /> <br /> However, with the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls, and fishing regulations, transplantation of kelp, public education, and various research programs some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provide a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 Marine Reserves (including the Scorpion Marine Reserve in the waters below you from Potato Harbor to Scorpion Rock), recreational fishing and commercial harvest are prohibited; limited fishing and harvest are allowed in two Marine Conservation Areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.</p>",

The diver wears a tight black wetsuit, a face mask, and long flippers. Below, a bouquet of spaghetti-shaped leaves are surrounded by coral and also anemones-some open; some closed. The anemones are shaped like flowers with thick succulent petals in various states of blooming. An orange garibaldi fish swims nearby.A photo shows a pink fish nestled in a crevice, surrounded by tan sand mixed with broken white shells. It has a large head and mouth. It has a curved feathery tail and a spikey fin, with a thin membrane, running along the top of its body.The text reads, Marine Protected Areas enhance opportunities for recreation, education, and science. Around Santa Barbara Island they protect critical and diverse habitats and species such as kelp forests, Xantus's Murrelet, and Cowcod.On the top left corner of the wayside exhibit, the text reads,Channel Islands National ParkOn the top right corner, the text reads,National Park ServiceU.

Thin, stiff wires stick up from the top edge of the panel. Please note: There are sometimes bird droppings on this panel.The View: Looking out over this wayside exhibit, is a steep rocky drop off. Below is a shoreline with blue green waters. Often, seals and sea lions are seen laying along the coast and a sea rock just off shore. They are furry, tan, and torpedo-shaped sea mammals, with flippers and dog-like heads. The males have a loud, bellowing bark, that sounds like \"Aarh!.\" The dock is seen at the base of the hillside below.The text on the panel reads,Sea lions lead a double life. Basking on the haul-out rocks, they appear lazy, immobile. But when they slip beneath the waves they become swift, proficient hunters.These nutrient-rich waters and nearby kelp forests attract great numbers of fish and squid, providing sea lions with an endless feast. Protected from human disturbance, thousands of seals and California sea lions use the islands' secluded coves as breeding grounds, nurseries, and resting areas. In many ways the Channel Islands are a paradise for pinnipeds (seals and sea lions).A photo shows of a group of sea lions lounging togethe",

A network of 13 Marine Protected Areas covering 318 square miles (240 square nautical miles) have been established by the State of California and the federal government to provide a refuge for sea life.<br /><br />A map of Santa Rosa Island, with key locations and marine reserves identified. <br /><br />Santa Rosa Island is shaped a bit like a fish, lying on its side, facing left, or west. From the left, the farthest, narrow point is Sandy Point, like a tiny, pointy head. Moving along to coast to the right, along the top, is Talcott Shoal, just offshore, and Brockway Point. At the top, northernmost fin of the \"fish\" is Carrington Point. A large square area of the ocean around this point is shaded in red, and titled, \"Carrington Point Marine Reserve\". Moving down and right, toward the southeast, is \"C\"-shaped Becher Bay and a \"You are Here\" mark. Farther to the right, or east, is Skunk Point, and, just below it, the easternmost point, appropriately named East Point. This side of the island would be the tail of the \"fish.\" The beaches, from around Skunk Point all the way down to East Point, are shaded orange. To the east of these beaches, a small, narrow, rectangular section of ocean is shaded red, and titled, \"Skunk Point Marine Reserve\". Moving to the left, or west, along the bottom of the \"fish\" is Ford Point and Johnsons Lee, just off shore. The lowest point is South Point. From here to a small, unnamed point to the west, a red shaded area extends from the coastline southward into the ocean, and is titled, \"South Point Marine Reserve\". Further up to the left, northwest of the reserve, is Cluster Point and Bee Rock, offshore. Inland, almost at the center of the island, is Soledad Peak at 1,574 feet or 480 meters. <br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Marine Protected Area Regulations<br /><br />Diving, surfing, swimming and boating are allowed within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) but fishing is restricted.

Skunk Point area beaches closed March 1 through September 15.<br /><br />A close-up photo shows a gopher rockfish, with brown and white and pale blue splotches swimming near the bottom of a reef that is covered in rose-colored anemones, which look like flowers with tentacles for petals. The fish has large black eyes and large, fan-like side fins.<br /><br />An underwater photograph shows eelgrass, which looks like tall grass with thin stalks and long narrow leaves. Above this sea grass swims a yellow torpedo-shaped fish with a black tipped tail.<br /><br />A close-up photo shows a red abalone, with a dark pink shell, with orange and white blotches suctioned to a deep red rock-like surface. Tiny black needles stick out of holes on the top of the shell and its sides, creating a dark fringe. Below the fringe are ruffled flaps around the shell. Nearby is a pinkish-colored barnacle; a tall, cone or volcano-shaped animal sticking up from the same red surface.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Marine Protected Areas enhance opportunities for recreation, education, and science. Around Santa Rosa Island they protect critical and diverse habitats and species such as eelgrass, rocky reefs, red abalone, and gopher rockfish.<br /><br />In the lower right corner of the panel, a blue photo shows two sharks swimming through water toward us, grinning with wide jaws. From each of their backs, a single tall fin rises upward.<br /><br />On the top left corner of the wayside exhibit, the text reads,<br /><br />Channel Islands National Park<br /><br />On the top right corner, the text reads,<br /><br />National Park Service<br />U.

    "bodyText": "<p>This sign, located at the campground restroom, provides information about San Miguel Island, campground regulations, watersports, hiking, and a map. It also contains safety information.<br /> <br /> San Miguel Island Campground<br /> Camping is available on all five islands in Channel Islands National Park. Here on San Miguel Island, camping is allowed only in this designated campground.<br /> <br /> Welcome to San Miguel Island, one of five islands in the Channel Islands National Park. As a visitor, you can help preserve and protect San Miguel Island by taking a moment to read this bulletin board and taking action to care for the island during your visit.<br /> <br /> Located twenty-five nautical miles off the coast of California, San Miguel Island is not only the farthest west of the Channel Islands, but also the most primitive and wild. Nowhere do you get a truer island experience than here. San Miguel is one of the greatest refuges on the coast with over 80,000 seals and sea lions and 13 different seabird species gathering to rest and breed.<br /> <br /> The island also hosts pristine tidepools, rare plants, and the strange caliche forest.<br /> <br /> For 12,000 years San Miguel was home to the seagoing Chumash people and their ancestors. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo set foot here as the first European to explore the California coast. For 100 years the island was a sheep ranch and in the 70 years it has been used by the military. Although San Miguel Island is still owned by the Navy, it was designated part of the Channel Islands National Park in 1980.<br /> <br /> Of all the campgrounds in the National Parks, this one on San Miguel is unique. You are among a very small group of people that have experienced this place. Only 100 to 200 people camp here each year. The effort it took to get here and the harsh weather you must sometimes endure are rewarded by a solitude and wildness seldom experienced anymore.<br /> <br /> Balancing the needs of visitors and wildlife is the highest mission of your National Park Service. Whether walking the trails, or paddling the shoreline, stay safe and join us in preserving a little piece of wild California.<br /> <br /> Campground Regulations <br /> <br /> Everything is protected.<br /> As in all national parks it is illegal to feed, collect, disturb, or harm park wildlife, plant life, or other natural, historical, and archeological features.<br /> <br /> Proper food storage is required.<br /> Store all food, trash, and scented items in a secure, animal-proof container at all times. Do not store in tents. Failure to store these items properly may result in a fine. Protect island wildlife, especially the island fox, by keeping your camp clean.<br /> <br /> Remove your garbage.<br /> Visitors are required to pack out what they pack in, including garbage.<br /> No campfires or charcoal fires.<br /> Due to extreme fire danger, no campfires or charcoal fires are permitted on the island. Use only enclosed gas campstoves for cooking.<br /> <br /> Smoking allowed only on beaches.<br /> Please take cigarette butts off the islands with your other trash.<br /> <br /> Avoid contact with deer mice.<br /> Hantavirus has been found in island deer mice. Contact your physician if you experience flu-like symptoms after contact with deer mice or infected materials. This is a life-threatening illness.<br /> <br /> Observe quiet time in the campground after 10:00 pm.<br /> To ensure a pleasurable camping experience for all, please respect your fellow campers and observe quiet time after 10:00 pm.<br /> <br /> Be aware of boat departure times.<br /> When departing the island, visitors are responsible for meeting the boat on time. Ask the ranger or concessioner for departure times.<br /> <br /> Emergency Procedures<br /> In an emergency, contact a ranger or concession employee. If a phone is available, contact the National Park Dispatch Center at 559-565-4221. This dispatch center handles all emergencies, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for Channel Islands National Park. On the water, use a marine radio to contact the US Coast Guard on VHF Channel 16.<br /> <br /> Watersports<br /> <br /> All watersports including, kayaking, swimming, snorkeling, and SCUBA, are at your own risk. There are no lifeguards on duty.<br /> <br /> Be alert to wind, waves, and currents at all times – strong winds and rough seas are not uncommon and conditions change rapidly.<br /> <br /> Water temperatures generally range from 50 to 60 degrees, and wetsuits should be worn if planning to stay in the water for any length of time.<br /> <br /> For your own safety, use a buddy system for all watersports and wear a helmet when kayaking near rocky outcroppings, overheads environments and caves.<br /> <br /> The entire shoreline of San Miguel is closed to landing except at Cuyler Harbor beach.<br /> <br /> Do not land on offshore rocks; these are protected places for seabirds, seals, and sea lions. Remain 100 yards from marine mammals that are hauled out on the rocks and beaches.<br /> <br /> Kayak equipment checklist – experienced sea kayakers recommend the following items: personal flotation device (PFD), helmet, broad-brimmed hat, sunscreen, adequate spray skirt, dry storage bags, food and fresh water with extra provisions, first aid, repair kit, and heavy diameter haul lines with carabiners.<br /> <br /> No fishing within marine reserves. There are three marine protected areas in the waters surrounding San Miguel Island, including the immediate area outside of Cuyler Harbor. Within these areas, the take of living, geological, or cultural resources is prohibited. All intertidal plants and most intertidal animals around the entire island are also protected. See Fish and Wildlife regulations for more information. Possession of a valid California state fishing license and an Ocean Enhancement stamp are required to fish outside the marine protected areas. Please see the island ranger for more details.<br />   <br /> Hiking<br /> <br /> Visitors must stay on trails at all times. No off-trail travel is allowed. This ensures the protection of wildlife, fragile plants, and geologic features. It also ensures your safety as the island was a former bombing range and there are possible unexploded ordnance.<br /> <br /> A map of San Miguel Island with key locations and marine reserves identified. Trails, ranger station, campground, and restrooms are also shown.<br /> <br /> The text reads,<br /> <br /> Visitors must be accompanied by a ranger beyond the ranger station. When not accompanied by a ranger, visitors may explore Cuyler Harbor beach, Nidever Canyon, the Cabrillo Monument, and the Lester Ranch Site (the trails marked in bold on the map)<br /> <br /> Depending on the length of your stay, up to three different ranger guided hikes can be offered:<br /> <br /> Point Bennett: An all day, 14 mile roundtrip hike to the pinniped rookery on the west end of the island. This trip includes a visit to the caliche forest which is about two miles from the campground.<br /> <br /> Cardwell Point: A six mile roundtrip hike to the pinniped rookery on the east end of the island.<br /> <br /> Lester Point: A scenic six mile roundtrip hike to the northern end of the island.<br /> <br /> For all hiking bring along: 1) a lunch and trail snacks; 2) at least 1 quart of water per person; 3) binoculars – viewing distance to the animals is dependent on weather and phase of pupping/breeding for the animals; and 4) hat, sunscreen, sturdy walking shoes, and at least a wind-proof layer.<br /> <br /> A photo shows a jumbled pile of varied pinnipeds, laying on top of one another. They include massive tan, brown, and gray elephant seals, shaped like enormous slugs, with heads like a dog’s except without visible ears. These elephant seals have stubby trunks or snouts. Mixed in among these huge seals are several, much smaller, sea lions. They are tan, with heads shaped like a dogs, but with tiny ears and long whiskers. <br /> <br /> A map shows San Miguel, an island with uneven shoreline and several tips or points. It is about 22 miles wide from west to east and 12 miles from north to south. At the northernmost point is a boot-shaped peninsula, ending in the tip of the boot—Harris Point. At about where the boots laces would be is Lester Point, which overlooks Simonton Cove and Otter Harbor to the west, and Castle Rock, offshore, further west. To the east of Harris Point, just past the “heel” of the boot, Cuyler Harbor cuts a c-shape out of the north shore of the island. Prince Island is just offshore. Features on the harbor shore, from west to east, include Palm trees, and offshore, Judge Rock and Gull Rock. Dotted lines represent a trail along the Cuyler Harbor beach. The trail branches inland near Gull Rock, heading south and then branching further to reach Cabrillo Monument, Lester Ranch site, a campground with restrooms, and a ranger station with restrooms. Farther along the northeast shore is Bay Point. At the eastern tip of the island is Cardwell Point. The ocean north of the coastline between Simonton Cove and Cardwell Point is colored red and titled Harris Point Marine Reserve, No Commercial or Recreational Fishing Allowed.<br /> <br /> At the southernmost side is Crook Point. On the southwest shore, a curve in the coastline marks Tyler Bight. The western tip of that curve ends at Judith Rock. Another curve to the west of Judith Rock is called Adams Cove. The ocean south of the coastline including Adams Cove and Judith Rock is also red and titled Judith Rock Marine Reserve, with the same rules.<br /> <br /> The western tip is called Point Bennett. Stretching out westward from the Point are several skinny islands, like sand spits. Amid these tiny islands is an icon of a half-sunken ship, titled “Cuba Wreck.”<br /> <br /> A black line wraps around the western tip of San Miguel, marking the coastline from near Castle Rock, all the way to Judith Rock. A note says, “Boating prohibited within 300 yards of shore from Castle Rock to Judith Rock from April 30th to October 1st, and from December 15th to March 15th. No boating within 100 yards of shore year-round.<br /> <br /> Off shore just northwest of San Miguel, is another red box over the ocean, titled Richardson Rock Marine Reserve.<br /> <br /> Inland, near the center of the island are Green Mountain, 817 feet tall, and slightly east of that, San Miguel Hill, 831 feet tall. Between them is the Caliche Forest.<br /> <br /> Notes on the map read: <br /> <br /> To avoid disturbing sensitive seals, sea lions, and seabirds, please stay away from the shoreline where you see them congregate. Refer to the National Marine Sanctuary’s “Protecting Your Channel Islands” brochure for more information on marine reserves.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This bulletin board, located at the campground restroom, provides information about San Miguel Island, campground regulations, watersports, hiking, and a map. It also contains safety information.The text reads,San Miguel Island CampgroundCamping is available on all five islands in Channel Islands National Park. Here on San Miguel Island, camping is allowed only in this designated campground.Welcome to San Miguel Island, one of five islands in the Channel Islands National Park. As a visitor, you can help preserve and protect San Miguel Island by taking a moment to read this bulletin board and taking action to care for the island during your visit.Located twenty-five nautical miles off the coast of California, San Miguel Island is not only the farthest west of the Channel Islands, but also the most primitive and wild. Nowhere do you get a truer island experience than here. San Miguel is one of the greatest refuges on the coast with over 80,000 seals and sea lions and 13 different seabird species gathering to rest and breed.The island also hosts pristine tidepools, rare plants, and the strange caliche forest.For 12,000 years San Miguel was home to the seagoing Chumash people and their ancestors. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo set foot here as the first European to explore the California coast. For 100 years the island was a sheep ranch and in the 70 years it has been used by the military. Although San Miguel Island is still owned by the Navy, it was designated part of the Channel Islands National Park in 1980.Of all the campgrounds in the National Parks, this one on San Miguel is unique. You are among a very small group of people that have experienced this place. Only 100 to 200 people camp here each year. The effort it took to get here and the harsh weather you must sometimes endure are rewarded by a solitude and wildness seldom experienced anymore.Balancing the needs of visitors and wildlife is the highest mission of your National Park Service. Whether walking the trails, or paddling the shoreline, stay safe and join us in preserving a little piece of wild California.Campground Regulations Everything is protected.As in all national parks it is illegal to feed, collect, disturb, or harm park wildlife, plant life, or other natural, historical, and archeological features.Proper food storage is required.Store all food, trash, and scented items in a secure, animal-proof container at all times. Do not store in tents. Failure to store these items properly may result in a fine. Protect island wildlife, especially the island fox, by keeping your camp clean.Remove your garbage.Visitors are required to pack out what they pack in, including garbage.No campfires or charcoal fires.Due to extreme fire danger, no campfires or charcoal fires are permitted on the island. Use only enclosed gas campstoves for cooking.Smoking allowed only on beaches.Please take cigarette butts off the islands with your other trash.Avoid contact with deer mice.Hantavirus has been found in island deer mice.

It is colored black on its back and head and white on its neck and chest, like a tuxedo. The text reads, Get Acquainted Thirty-eight miles from the mainland Santa Barbara Island is the smallest of the Channel Islands at just one-square mile in size. Waves have eroded the island, creating twin-peaked mesas, towering sea cliffs, sea caves, and natural bridges. The island provides critically important habitat for endemic plants and animals, pinnipeds, and seabirds, including one of the world’s largest colonies of Scripps’s murrelets. A photo from a hillside, looking out along the shoreline, and the ocean beyond. The foreground is covered with mounds of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that rise on tall green stalks. At the farthest point of land, an arch cuts through a tall rock outcrop, at the water line, creating a tunnel through the rock, and a peek at the water on the other side. The text reads, Island Crossroad For thousands of years, the Gabrieliño /Tongva and Chumash visited Santa Barbara Island. Explorers, seal and abalone hunters, ranchers, and the military would eventually follow. Protection for the island began in 1938 when Santa Barbara Island (along with Anacapa Island) was designated a national monument. In 1980 it was designated as part of the Channel Islands National Park. The island waters are protected by the National Park Service, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, and the State of California. A photo shows three people hiking through tall dry grass on a fairly flat field, near a cliff’s edge. Beyond and below them is a deep cove. Ocean waves crash up against rocks and dark cliffs near the shore, turning into white water. At the far side of the cove, an arch cuts through a rock shelf, at the water line, creating a tunnel through the rock, and a view of the water on the other side. In the distance, a tall point of land extends out into the ocean. The top is a flat plateau, with steep, almost vertical, cliffs dropping down to the water’s edge. A deep canyon cuts through a section of the plateau.

Several hundred yards off shore, a small island rises from the ocean. In the foreground, a thin peninsula of land extends out into the ocean. An arch cuts all the way through it at the water line, creating a tunnel through the rock, and a glimpse of the water on the other side. A metal box, with a hinged lid, is located below the sign.

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit is titled “Sea Bird Habitat.” The View: If you are facing the exhibit panel you are on a tall bluff overlooking the ocean. To your left is a hillside covered with dried grasses and depending on the season, coreopsis, with a thick, bare trunk, topped by a shaggy mop of yellow flowers and feathery green leaves, shaped like fluffy ostrich feathers. In late summer, fall or winter, the coreopsis will turn into waist-high brown stalks that look dead. Behind you is the patio of the Santa Barbara Island Visitor Center. The text reads, Sea Bird Habitat To cormorants, brown pelicans, and western gulls, this island offers ideal habitat. The basalt cliffs have ledges for nesting and roosting isolated from mainland predators and most human interference. There would be virtually no sea birds in Southern California if it were not for the islands. Sea birds often bathe in the cove to wash off parasites. In a constant shuttle between cliff and ocean, the birds carry anchovies and other fish back to nestlings. A photo shows six shiny black birds, perched on white rocks. Their necks are gracefully curved like a duck’s, but a bit longer. They have long pointed pale beaks, and black eyes. Their black tails are like a small feathered fan. This photo is provided by National Park Service The text reads, Cormorants are awkward flyers but prodigious divers, overtaking fish at depths of more than 100 feet. On land they hold their unoiled wings out to dry. Observe the birds closely to see their special adaptations to both land and sea. A photo shows a brown pelican sitting on a nest made of interwoven dried grasses. Its long white beak, with a pink tip, is tucked downward, snug against its long neck. Its wings are light brown, with a black stripe along the back of the neck and tuft of spikey feathers behind a tan and white head. The caption reads, California brown pelicans nest on the ground on Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands. They often fly single file, riding the updrafts along the cliffs. A photo shows a seagull, with a gray back and a white chest and head with a curved orange beak, nesting on sticks of dried grass in the dirt. The text reads, Western gulls’ nests are visible on the cliff ledges. But gulls also nest on the flat terraces above. Look for the different nesting patterns as you hike around the island.

    "bodyText": "<p>Signal Peak is the highest point on the island at 634 feet. The climb is well worth it as there are sweeping views of the island's western coast, including Sutil Island, a 13-acre rocky islet.<br /> <br /> <b>Stop 6: Signal Peak Tour-An Ideal Isolated Home</b><br /> <br /> The ever-present western gulls and graceful pelicans can often be sighted soaring throughout the island, especially along the steep, rugged volcanic cliffs. These cliffs, their numerous caves, and the rest of Santa Barbara Island's coastline and neighboring islets are home to 13 different species of nesting seabirds and shorebirds. Ashy storm-petrels, Brandt's cormorants, Cassin's auklets, pigeon guillemots, black oystercatchers, and one of the world's largest colonies of Scripps's murrelets all make their home here.<br /> <br /> Santa Barbara Island, the other Channel Islands, and all of their associated islets and offshore rocks comprise one of the largest breeding centers on the west coast for seabirds and shorebirds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, as well as the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters surrounding them, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> However, the island's isolation was not able to protect some species of seabirds from human impacts. The destruction of native vegetation, importing of non-native species, gathering of eggs, disturbance of rookeries, and the spread of pesticides in the marine environment have all been detrimental.<br /> <br /> During the 1960s, the pesticide DDT nearly caused the extinction of the California brown pelican as a breeding species on the west coast of the United States. In 1970, only 552 nesting attempts were made on Anacapa Island (the largest colony on the West coast of the United States) and just one chick survived. On October 13, 1970, the brown pelican was listed as an endangered species.<br /> <br /> Cassin's auklets were once so abundant on Santa Barbara Island that in 1863 it was recorded that \"they had undermined almost every part of the soft, earthy surface with their burrows.\" Between 1897 and 1908, cats were introduced to the island, and by 1911, it was reported that the breeding colony had been entirely abandoned. To make matters even worse, the cats devastated the island's large Scripps's murrelet colony as well-biologists found only one egg.<br /> <br /> Today, these species are gradually recovering now that their isolated island home is protected within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of the island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of southern California's seabird populations.<br /> <br /> On Santa Barbara Island, these efforts have focused on restoring seabird nesting habitat, removing feral cats and non-native vegetation, revegetating with native plants, installing nest boxes, and closing areas to protect nesting seabirds.<br /> <br /> The most notable results of these efforts have been the successful recovery of the California brown pelican and its removal from the endangered species list in 2009, and Santa Barbara Island once more supporting the largest number of breeding seabirds on any of the Channel Islands.</p>",

From this location, visitors can head down towards Webster Point or climb up to 634-foot Signal Peak, the highest point on the island.<br /> <br /> <b>Stop 4: Signal Peak Tour-Return of the Natives</b><br /> <br /> As you walk the island, you may notice the fields of grains and grasses that dominate the landscape. This was not always the case. What was once an island covered with coastal sage and bluff scrub, maritime cactus scrub, and native grasslands, has given way to nonnative, European grazing grasses and an assortment of weeds, including iceplants, oats, bromes, foxtails, thistles, and mustard. Today, about a third of the plant species found on Santa Barbara Island are nonnative.<br /> <br /> During the early 1900s, native vegetation was cut, burned, and plowed for farming. In addition, sheep, goats, and rabbits severely overgrazed the island, eliminating most of the native vegetation and creating open, disturbed, and eroded soils that allowed nonnative plants to flourish. Once established, these hardier nonnatives outcompeted the natives for limited soil and moisture, due to their longer germination and growth cycles and ability to withstand grazing and browsing by livestock.<br /> <br /> The NPS is working to restore the island's native vegetation, and special focus is being placed on the 14 plants endemic to the islands-those found nowhere else in the world. Four of these occur only on Santa Barbara Island: the Santa Barbara Island live-forever, buckwheat, cream cups, and island chicory. To ensure the survival of these unique species and encourage the recovery of the island's native vegetation, all non-native animals have been removed and the effort to plant native species and control nonnative weeds is underway.<br /> <br /> The recovery of native plants has so far been remarkable. Many are now spreading beyond the buried seed banks and steep canyon walls and cliffs, where they remained protected from grazing, and are reestablishing themselves slowly throughout the island.<br /> <br /> This reestablishment of native plants has also aided in the recovery of endemic deer mice, night lizards, and nesting land birds by providing important habitat. Today, there are 14 land birds that nest annually on the island. Three of these-the horned lark, orange-crowned warbler, and house finch-are endemic subspecies found only on Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the island's recovery did not come soon enough for the endemic Santa Barbara Island song sparrow, one of the smallest forms of song sparrow and differentiated from its mainland relative by its very gray back. The destruction of this sparrow's sagebrush and coreopsis nesting habitat and the presence of feral cats led to the extinction of this species in the 1960s. It is now lost forever.<br /> <br /> However, ecological restoration has helped populations of the endemic island night lizard recover to the point that it was removed from the Federal List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife in 2014. This species only occurs on Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, and San Clemente Islands.<br /> <br /> You can help with this recovery of island natives by cleaning your boots and other possessions, such as backpacks, before you visit. This ensures that you don't accidentally introduce nonnative species to the island. Together we can guarantee the return of native plants and animals throughout Santa Barbara Island.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a gently sloping ridge, in a saddle, or low point, between two rounded hills-North Peak, and, to the south, a slightly higher hill, Signal Peak. In clear weather, there are views of the ocean to the east and west. There is an 8-foot long wooden bench, on two posts, oriented to face the ocean views. Be careful if you decide to sit, as it is covered with white bird droppings. <br />Adjacent to the bench, on the ground are three railroad ties-thick wooden beams about 8 inches by 10 inches by 6 feet in length. At your feet, the gritty soil has tiny fragments of broken shells and white rocks. Along this ridge are low grasses, salt bush, and crystalline iceplant. In spring, the iceplant has red leaves and buds, that open into white feathery starburst blooms in spring. The terraces below the ridge have the same plants, plus occasional patches of coastal sagebrush and coreopsis. The sagebrush is a grey-green plant with a thin stalk with feathery leaves, like dill, and a tall spike at the tip, covered with tiny flowers, in season. Coreopsis has thick branches topped with tufts of green leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers in springtime, and a shaggy brittle, brown mop of dead leaves and blooms in late summer and early fall. <br />From here, you can take loop trails in four directions. The loop trail to the west circles north towards Webster Point. The trails to the north and northeast are part of the same loop trail-Arch Point Loop. It just happens to make a very sharp turn here. Heading north on this loop trail is, appropriately, the quickest way to get to North Peak. Heading northeast is the quickest way to Arch Point, with a branch trail, at about the halfway point, that leads to the Visitor Center and the Landing Cove. The loop trail to the south heads to Signal Peak, before looping around the southern end of the island, and merging back into the Arch Point Trail a little northeast of here. <br />",

    "audioDescription": "The Visitor Center is divided into two small rooms. First, the main room with a cement floor, 11 feet wide by 20 feet deep, displays a passport station and exhibit panels that describe the natural and cultural history of the island. The adjacent lighthouse lens room to the left of the entrance is 11 feet wide by 11 feet deep. The original Fresnel lens on display fills most of the space. MAIN EXHIBIT ROOM As you enter, moving counterclockwise around the room, wall panel exhibits with text, images and illustrate island natural and human history, including the following panels: introduction, things to do, geology, island chumash, recent history, natural history, and island conservation. THE LIGHTHOUSE LENS ROOM The lens room entryway is to the left of the main entrance. This small cement-floored room is 11 feet wide by 11 feet deep. The original Fresnel lens on display fills most of the space. Behind the lens to the right is a window on the open wall lets in natural light. In front of the lens to the left is another window on the open wall that lets in natural light. The four foot eight-inch-tall third order Fresnel lens sits on top of the original steel generator box in the corner of the room and is surrounded by a curved thirty-one-inch-high wooden railing. The lens resembles a giant four-sided beehive. With a diameter of forty inches, each side is a complex system of glass prisms held together by brass strips. On each side, at the center of the lens face is a bullseye design of glass and brass. The brass strips are like contour lines or concentric rings that form a large bullseye to divide and hold together each segment of glass. As you enter, moving counterclockwise around the room, wall panel exhibits with text, images and illustrate island lighthouse history.  ",

    "audioDescription": "The Blacksmith shed contains artifacts and exhibits. It is a short walk down the road from the pier. Restrooms and the Orientation exhibit area are nearby. The one room shed measures 10 feet by fifteen feet. A 6-foot extension wall to the left of the building creates an open-air porch with a steeply pitched shake roof. Two door openings provide access. The walls are of two different styles, flat horizontal boards and board and batten. The interior floor is dirt. The open doorway, one small square window, and cracks between the wall boards let sunlight into the space. The interior and porch area exhibits are described in the next section starting with the interior exhibit panels and artifacts. As you enter the shop, a large piece of free standing equipment is in the left corner of the room, a vise with drill press. The metal column comes up from a base at the floor and holds the circular drill table at waist height. The column continues up to the chuck and spindle where a capstan wheel adjusts the height of the drill. A plaque on the base of the vice reads: Press and Vise The blacksmith shop was a machine shop as well as a forge. This press which dates back to the Caire era (1880-1932) was used for drilling and threading pipes. An exhibit panel on the back wall behind the vice displays a black and white photograph of the exterior of the blacksmith shop. Text reads: The Blacksmith Shop The blacksmith shop was a hot, noisy, sweaty place, but it played a key role at Scorpion Ranch. An isolated ranch needed to be self-sufficient – a blacksmith shop made this possible. The blacksmith was kept busy making or repairing Scorpion’s tools and gear. Everything with metal parts passed through the smithy – on a given day the blacksmith might shoe horses, repair wagon wheels, sharpen plows and make oar locks. Continuing around the room to the right, hanging from the walls and on display are a variety of implements, chains, farm tools, building supplies, horseshoes, an anvil and another drill press in the forge area behind a waist high exhibit shelf that runs the length of the room and divides the forge area from the entryway. The shelf sits on top of a wall of ornamental ironwork crafted out of blacksmith tools welded together in an artful style. The exhibit area from left to right has a series of six tools mounted to a panel and labeled by letter. They are meant to be touched. a. Shovel b. Poker c. Tongs d. Pritchel e. Forepunch f. Iron Bar Text reads: A Day at the Forge Basic blacksmithing didn’t require much – only a hot fire, simple tools and brute strength. “Forging” is changing the shape of a piece of metal by heating and hammering it. It’s a very physical process. Although the Scorpion blacksmith shop was probably operated by one person, an assistant “striker” may have added his blows when vigorous hammering was needed. Leg vises anchored to the floor gave the blacksmith extra support when hammering. Three line drawings illustrate a portable forge, an anvil and a grindstone Text reads: portable forge- Not all blacksmithing at Scorpion took place in the shop. This portable hand forge and leg vise were taken out into the field, probably for shoeing horses. anvil An anvil is the iron block on which the blacksmith works metal. To keep it steady, this anvil was mounted on a sturdy log embedded in the dirt floor grindstone The blacksmith held a tool against the stone to sharpen it. Foot pedals made it easier to keep the stone turning. The next exhibit along the shelf describes how to make a horseshoe in 12 steps. 1. Build a fire in the forge. Use blacksmithing coal, (a soft coal, free from impurities). When packed down around the fi re, it changes to coke, a lightweight material that burns with a clean, intense flame. 2. Use the shovel and poker to adjust the fire. 3. Use your left hand to work the bellows or crank the blower to add oxygen to the fire so it burns hotter. 4. Stick the iron bar into the forge to heat. 5. Heat the section you’ll be working onto a bright-red heat, almost but not quite white hot. 6. Using the tongs, draw the iron bar out of the fire and turn to the anvil. 7. Pick up a small hammer. 8. Using the round face of the hammer, bend the iron bars over the anvil. 9. Once the horseshoe is the right shape, start the nailholes using a forepunch. The shape of the punch should exactly match the head of the nail. 10. Hammer a stamp into the hole to make a space for the shank of the nail. 11. Sharpen the pritchel on the grindstone. To complete the hole, hammer a pritchel into the hole. A little piece will drop out. 12. Lay the shoe flat on the anvil and hammer all around to level. Text continues: The island needed a gang of blacksmiths The Scorpion smith was in good company – there were once six blacksmith shops on the island. Blacksmiths at the satellite ranches, or outranches, dealt with day to day objects, while hinges, ornamental ironwork and railings were made at the main ranch bla",

    "audioDescription": "Five tactile models of the Channel Islands stretch straight ahead, curving slightly left at the far side of the room. Please use caution, as several wooden display boards hang over each island model, and are likely to knock into one’s head when touching the models. If it is windy, they tend to swing unpredictably as well! Near the center of this table display, a 2 1/4” wide by 1/8” high tactile bar indicates a ½ mile distance: about a 10-minute walk for an adult without physical disabilities. This is the scale for all of the island models in the breezeway. Each island sits on a table with curved edges, depicting the ocean. On the island’s surface, rough textures indicate areas of taller vegetation—brush and trees—often concentrated in valleys and canyons, and on the north shorelines. Let’s now explore this first island. Moving left along the table, about 4 feet from the tactile scale bar, at 10 o’clock, is the first and smallest of the Channel Islands in the National Park: Santa Barbara Island.",

    "audioDescription": "INTROWelcomeWelcome to the Channel Islands Visitor Center! Thank you for visiting. Please keep in mind that there is always a staff member within earshot. Please feel free to ask if you would like any assistance. Each audio section or subsection will generally provide three things: a general description of any graphics, videos, and displays, a reading of any text associated with that display, and directions to the next exhibit area.And so - let's continue this introduction with an overview of the exhibit space layout. General Space and Layout:This is the upper level of the 1,000 square foot visitor center. Turning with our backs to the counter provides a view of this open space, with tall windows providing views of a native plant garden. Bright graphics on the windows show the scenery and life of the Channel Islands. Most of the Visitor Center is about 2 feet below us, and is accessible by two ramps. The closest one is straight ahead, about 6 feet away. It leads to a gift shop at 1 o'clock. Continuing counterclockwise, at the lower level, are:a tidepool aquarium at 11 o'clock, complete with audio of the ocean, and a graphic mural of waves and birds along the shoreline.the main exhibits, from 11 to 9 o'clock, including the model of an enormous, bellowing bull elephant seal, native American Chumash songs and stories, and a life-sized model of an archaeological dig site. Another ramp back up to this level is at 9 o'clock.If you turn to face the counter, now, we can continue our counterclockwise review of the layout. A changing exhibit area is to the right, at 2 o'clock, about 20 feet away.A tactile display of specimens from the Channel Islands is at the end of this counter, at 2 o'clock.This Visitor Center Desk stretches from 2 o'clock to 9 o'clock.The Breezeway, our next exhibit area, is through doors to the left at 8 o'clock, about 12 feet away. Before heading to the Breezeway, though, it might be helpful to explore a tactile globe and map first, to understand the scale of the Channel Islands in context. Please ask the staff to provide these, if they are available.Globe: The globe of our planet Earth is 12\" in diameter, and 1\" represents roughly 700 miles, or about a 30 days walk for a fit adult without physical disabilities?. has two large land masses, or continents, that end in a point near the bottom of the globe. The one with the skinniest point is South America. Above this, connected by a thin strip of land, is another continent, North America. On the left side of it, there is a thin peninsula that runs parallel to the coastline. It is Baja California, part of Mexico. The United States begins slightly above the point where the peninsula connects to the mainland. About 1/2 inch above that connecting point you will feel a ridge, running parallel to, and about 1/4\" inland, from to the coast of North America. This is the Sierra Mountain range. Although they are too small to feel on this globe, the Channel Islands, are located off the coast, about Â¼\" left of the bottom of this ridge. Nation: This map of the United States is scaled so that 1\" = 100 miles, or about a 5 days walk for a fit adult without physical disabilities The left , or West, side of the map is bumpier than the right , or East side. On the far left, about a Â½ inch in from the edge of the continent, is a long vertical groove , about the length and width of an adult index finger. This is California's Central Valley, with the Sierra Mountains on the right side and lower coastal mountains on the left. With your fingertip at the very bottom of this valley, the Channel Islands can be found about an inch away, below and slightly to the leftÂ¬-4 tiny bumps in the flat expanse of the Pacific Ocean. California State: The map's scale is 1\" = 30 miles, about a 10-hour walk for a fit adult without physical disabilities. On the bottom, or Southern edge, at the coastline, you will feel a bumpy mountain range that heads upward and then (about 6 inches from the bottom) makes a right turn left, or due West, ending in a large bump near the coast in Santa Barbara County. (Keep this bump in mind!. An inch or two below this big bump, you can feel a row of 4 small bumps - the largest Channel Islands. From left to right (West to East), these are San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa. An inch and a Â½ below Anacapa is the fifth Channel Island in the National Park - Santa Barbara, about the size of a grain of salt. By feeling the rest of the State map, you will get a sense of the powerful tectonic forces that created these islands. Several mountain ranges converge near this point, created by the uplifting pressure of tectonic plates colliding beneath them. Now, for larger models - more than 100 times this size-let's head out to the Breezeway. Pressing together create those bulges. Directions to Tidepool: Following the counter to the left about 11 feet takes us to a 6 foot-long ramp down into the main exhibit area. Continuing straight ahead from the bottom",

    "audioDescription": "ORIENTATIONBecause this exhibit shows so many fish and marine mammals, we start with a general description of four tactile items: models of a generic fish, a bottle-nosed dolphin, a grey whale; and a specimen of whale baleen. Please ask the visitor center staff to place these on the counter in front of you, going from your left to your right. We will start by describing the fish on your far left.Generic Tactile Fish Model Description:Although there are approximately 22,000 species of fish in a variety of shapes and sizes, most fish have a shape similar to this generic fish model-shaped like a deflated football or flattened torpedo, balanced on its long, thin edge, with an opening for the mouth in the front, a tall fin on top, a wide flat tail fin in the back, and more thin fins along the sides and bottom. (Please note that there is a two-inch circle indent on one side of this fish model that was caused by the manufacturing process. It is not normally on a fish. The colors are also artificial, so this model is for tactile purposes only.) A more detailed description of the fish model follows.Detail about the Tactile Fish Model:Fish are animals that are cold-blooded, with fins and a backbone. They generally have very small, fine scales that are bony in structure and overlap each other to protect the soft body of the fish. On a live fish, the scales are covered by a slimy mucus layer that helps to prevent infection. The opening you feel on the front end of the fish is its mouth. If you hold the fish horizontally, so the biggest ridge is on top, it will be upright. Above the mouth, on either side of its head, are the fish's eyes. On a real fish, the eyes would not stick out quite so much. Above the eyes, on the top of head are two side-by-side small indents that are called nares. Nares are the nostrils of the fish and detect odors in water. Behind the corners of the mouth is a curved ridge covering the gills. Gills allow the fish to pull oxygen from the water and release carbon dioxide. In a live fish, these gills would open and close about a Â¼ inch every few seconds. Behind the gills are the first of several thin ridges or flaps you will be feeling on this fish, all representing fins. In a live fish under water, these fins would all be sticking away from the body. Fish move all of these fins in order to swim and turn though the water. These first fins, behind the gills, shaped like a flattened tooth, are side or pectoral fins. There is another pectoral fin about four inches behind the first pectoral fin on both sides. On top of the fish is a triangle shaped dorsal fin that sticks up from the body and just behind it is a smaller rounded adipose fin. The fin that sticks out on the bottom of the fish is called the anal fin. At the back of the fish is an upright tail, called a caudal fin, with a slight curve at the end, like a mustache that sticks out further on the top and bottom. This fin generates most of the forward momentum when a fish swims. Behind the front pectoral fins and running along the sides of the fish is a lateral line. The lateral line senses water currents and pressure, and movement in the water. On the bottom of the fish in front of the anal fin is the external opening called the vent. The vent is used for waste elimination and is also where eggs or sperm are released. Remember that the thousands of different species of fish come in a variety in the sizes and shapes. However, they will all have these basic parts, and most are have a shape roughly similar to this model. To the right of the fish is a model of a bottle nosed dolphin.Bottlenose Dolphin Model General DescriptionThe dolphin is upright if you hold it flat, so the middle of the dolphin has a point on the top called a fin. The head is on the pointy end. The head has a short, thick snout, shaped like the top of a long-necked bottle with eyes on either side. Near the head, two flat side blades called flippers stick out and downward on each side. The dolphin is a marine mammal, which means that it is warm blooded and breathes air. It breathes through a small blowhole, an indentation on the top of the head. The body is firm and its tail has a flat v-shape.Their color ranges from light gray to black with lighter coloration on their bellies.The actual adult dolphin is about 25 times bigger than this model. It can grow as big as 12 feet and 1400 lbs. (Please note that there are ridges on the bottom of the model in between the flippers. These were caused by the manufacturing process and are not on a real dolphin). A more detailed description of the model follows.Detail about the Tactile Bottlenose Dolphin Model:Below the dolphin's snout, the mouth is closed. If you were to open the mouth of a real dolphin you would see 18-26 pairs of sharp, conical teeth in each jaw. A dolphin does not chew its food. The teeth are used to grab the often-slippery prey. The corners of the mouth curve upward, giving the dolphin a permanent \"smile\". Above the snout",

    "audioDescription": "Santa Barbara Island: Island Power PanelAn exhibit panel, titled \"Island Power,\" is mounted on the exterior wall, adjacent to the door of the Visitor Center building.The text reads,Island PowerThe National Park Service built this ranger residence in 1991 to make it as energy efficient as possible. Solar panels provide all the electricity. Passive heat collection through floor tile and us of energy-efficient appliances all result in a residence that uses less energy per day than your household refrigerator.A photo shows three dark-grey rectangular solar panels, side by side, tilting backward. Each panel has eight horizontal sections with a grid of thin white lines. The Santa Barbara Visitor Center has a 3 foot by 4 foot entrance foyer. Across from the entrance door is a wall mounted wooden rack, with four shelves that hold guides and pamphlets. Above this rack is a square credit plaque, with a National Park Service logo. The text reads,This exhibit has been made possible byDenton O.\" Buster\" HyderSanta Cruz Island FoundationChannel Islands National ParkSanta Barbara FoundationSanta Barbara Museum of National HistorySanta Barbara Botanical Gardens.The entrance area opens into an exhibit area is about 10 feet by 12 feet in size. The exhibits focus on the natural and cultural history of Santa Barbara Island. The room is white with a red Salteeyo tile floor, lit by the natural light of tall windows with views of the ocean. The main exhibit area is generally laid out along the walls with a tactile exhibit in the center. Starting from the entrance, and moving from the left to the right around the room, you will first find a wall-mounted fire extinguisher at waist height, followed by a wall mounted exhibit panel about the seasons, and a wooden side table. On the table sits a National Park Service passport cancellation station and a sign-in book. Beyond this is an exhibit panel about geology.As you continue around to the side of the room facing the ocean, there are exhibit panels about marine life, and the island's history, and preservation. Along the next wall are a map of underwater topography and an inset case with natural specimens and tactile objects. In the next corner is a large shoreline diorama, and another exhibit panel. Along the back wall is a painted wall mural of an underwater scene. In the center of the room is an exhibit with a bronze tactile model of the island. Santa Barbara Island: Exhibit: â€˜Tis the Season...SummerThis exhibit panel has text with three photos with captions. At the top of the panel is the title, \"Tis the Season.\" Summer. For nesting birds & pinnipeds.A photo shows a broad cactus with pancake-shaped leaves, covered with thorny spines. On the ground just below the plant, and difficult to see at first glance, is a fluffy bird.Its large round eyes are yellow, with what look like dark feathered \"eyelashes\". It has a short, curved, yellow beak. Its face and upper wings are a light gray with white spots. At its neck and breast, small feathers puff out like layers of ruffles. The caption reads,A burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) well hidden (and well protected) in its thorny habitat. This photo is provided bySteve JunakThe text reads, As the foliage of the giant coreopsis dries and the thick stems are exposed, the stands begin to resemble diminutive forests surrounded by a desert landscape. While walking on the trails on Santa Barbara Island, you may be treated to the sights and sounds of nesting land birds. The most common of these are the western meadowlarks which serenade you with their melodious song, horned larks, orange-crowned warblers, and American kestrels. Also look for the diminutive rock wren in rocky areas.California sea lions pup on the rocky beaches in early summer. These curious marine mammals can be heard barking throughout the day and night as they rest on the rocks and swim in the offshore kelp forests. You may even encounter them with you in the water if you snorkel or SCUBA dive.A year on Santa Barbara Island is marked by cycles of birth, growth, and death of the island's plants and animals against the backdrop of the seasonal climate changes.A photo shows a rocky shoreline, covered with a dozen furry, tan and gray sea lions. The seals are shaped like fat slugs, with heads like a puppy's but with tiny ears. Shallow pools of water are seen between the rocks. The caption reads,California sea lions (Zalophus californianui) are the best known of all seals since they are the ones most commonly seen in the zoos and circuses. Adult males can be up to nine feet long and weigh over 700 pounds. This photo is provided byWilliam. B. DeweyA photo shows a mother pelican with her chick. The mother bird is light gray, with a black neck, and black tuft of spikey feathers behind her white head. Her long beak is open, pointing downward, with her chick's head wedged up inside of it. The chick's long neck and body are a fluffy white. This photo is provided byFranklin Gress The text at t",

Each has a single arm rest that extends and curves out to become a wide flat panel, parallel to the floor. The two chairs have this arm rest panel on the right \"arm,\" and the other two have it on the left \"arm.\"An information panel, titled \"Santa Rosa Island Interpretive Guide,\" is posted on the wall inside the School House.The panel background is a black and white photo showing twelve people on horseback, in front of a wooden fence. Behind it is a thick section of trees. In the distance, to the left, is a large hill.The text reads,Learn more about ranch history, including a complete map and guide to the ranch area, in the Santa Rosa Island Interpretive Guide.The guide also provides detailed information on island Chumash history, military history, and natural history. In addition, it serves as a trail guide for the 1.75 mile hike from the pier to Water Canyon Beach via Cherry Canyon.Borrow the guide and return it or take it home and donate at ciparkfoundation.org/join-support/.Below and to the left of this panel is a small metal box with a locked panel in front, and a slanted top with a slit in the center, about three inches wide. To the right of this box is a wall mounted plastic holder that contains the guides. This exhibit panel, titled \"Channel Island Ranchos,\" provides cultural history about Santa Cruz Island and Santa Rosa Island.The panel background is a faded sepia photo, in shades of brown. It shows a steep, rocky shoreline, with a wooden staircase rising from the beach to the rocky plateau above. On the plateau are a large, long building, two smaller buildings, and canvas tents. The text reads:Santa Cruz Island covers almost 61,000 acres, its fertile central valley girded by rugged mountains, reaching 2,434 feet.Santa Rosa Island encompasses over 54,000 acres, of strikingly different topography - rolling grassy hills, mesas with deep-cut arroyos, and dunes that shift in the almost continuous winds.The Early Years.Humans inhabited the Channel Islands as early as 12,000 years ago. In 1542, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo found populous Chumash villages on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel islands. The waters of the Santa Barbara Channel teemed with marine life, and the Channel Islands were regular ports of call for fur traders, hunters, and fishermen in the late eighteenth century, although most trade was illegal under both Spanish (1769 to 1821) and Mexican (1821 to 1848) rule. The sea otter population experienced a serious decline by 1820 and the seals by 1830. By 1810 the islanders, victimized by European disease and their economy disrupted, began to migrate to the mainland at the urging of Franciscan padres.Deve",

    "audioDescription": "On the valley floor, within the protection of a wide canyon is the Scorpion Ranch housing complex that consists of a two-story ranch house with a kitchen, bakery with a built-in masonry oven, dining area and two rooms upstairs for housing ranch staff. A bunkhouse and a storage shed, about the size of a garage, are also within the 5-foot-high wooden split rail fence that surrounds the compound. Gardens, shrubs and fig trees edge the buildings.The two-story, adobe Scorpion Ranch house, now the visitor center with exhibits, is tucked in close to the canyon walls and faces the open valley to the south. The ranch house was built in 1886 of rubble-wall masonry and rests on a stone and mortar foundation. The building has a rectangular plan that measures 51 feet by 18 feet. It has a shed roof and walls that are 20 inches thick and composed of local stone, adobe bricks, mortar covered with white stucco, and limestone. Windows across the face of the building provide natural light. The first floor has two main rooms, both are open to the public with exhibits and audio visual components that describe the natural and cultural history of the area. The bakery is at the west end of the building and also contains exhibits. The bunkhouse is located immediately south of the adobe ranch house. Built in 1914, this one-and-a-half story wood frame structure has a simple, gable-roof and white board-and-batten siding. A panel at the entrance to the complex reads:Welcome to the Visitor CenterWe invite you to explore this historic ranch building and find out what makes SantaCruz Island like nowhere else on Earth.Investigate the dining room exhibits: discover how isolation from the mainland hasfostered Santa Cruz Island's unique plants, animals and ways of life and learn whatthe National Park Service is doing to protect and restore the island.Wander through the kitchen: listen to stories of living and working at ScorpionRanch.Peek into the bakery: See where bread was baked for the island workers - youmay also hear roosting bats.Take a guided walk or use the interpretive guide: Learn more about the island'shistory and ecology.Interior ExhibitsThe visitor center is on the first level of the ranch house. The two exhibit rooms are full of natural light with white walls and large square terra cotta tile flooring. On the floor, laid out in a figure eight pattern that weaves between both rooms are 19 specially printed floor tiles that tell the history of Santa Cruz Island in timeline format from 8,000 years ago, to 2007. Timeline tiles read:1. Saxipak'a Once upon a time.2. 8,000 years ago Earliest evidence of human life on Santa Cruz Island.3. 2000 years ago Chumash have highly developed technology and systems of transportation and trade.4. 1542 First European explorer, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, visits the island. At least 1200 Chumash are living on Santa Cruz Island.5. 1769 Santa Cruz Island receives its current name: La Isla de la Santa Cruz.6. 1822 Last of the island Chumash population were relocated to the mainland.7. 1839 The Mexican government grants Santa Cruz Island to Andres Castillero.8. 1857-1869 Santa Cruz Island is owned by William Barron and operated as a sheep ranch.

Please remain on the wet sand (below mean high tide) or the road throughout this area during this time.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Mixing of Waters and the Diversity of Marine Life</strong></p> <p>The Channel Islands lie within a large embayment known as the Southern California Bight-an area just below Point Conception where the California coastline turns sharply to the east. Within this area, the seafloor is composed of canyons, banks, escarpments, sea mounts, and deep basins (the Santa Cruz Basin is deeper than the Grand Canyon). Nutrient-rich waters upwelling from these depths mix and mingle with cool waters from the north (California Current) and warm southern waters (California Countercurrent), creating the Santa Barbara Gyre-a swirling eddy that circulates nutrients and supports a wealth of marine plants and animals, from giant kelp forests and blue whales to tiny crabs and plankton. Here, northern and southern species overlap, creating a transition zone between the Oregonian and Californian marine biogeographic provinces.<br /> <br /> The Channel Islands also serve as the meeting ground for seabirds and shorebirds that rarely occur together, such as black oystercatchers from the north and American oystercatchers from the south. Both species, as well as hybrids between the two, nest on the islands. Other northern birds, such as pelagic cormorants and pigeon guillemots, overlap with additional southern species, such as Scripps's murrelets and California brown pelicans.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Western Snowy Plover</strong></p> <p>Skunk Point is one of the few locations in southern California that still supports breeding and wintering populations of western snowy plovers, a federally threatened shorebird species. Its extensive back dune area and sandy shoreline provide important nesting and foraging areas. Other locations on Santa Rosa, San Miguel, and Santa Cruz Islands also support smaller populations.<br /> <br /> The Pacific coast population of western snowy plovers has declined due to many factors. Recreational and other human disturbance, loss of habitat to urban development, introduction of beachgrass and other nonnative species, and expanding predator populations have all contributed to a decline in active nesting areas and in the size of the breeding and wintering populations.<br /> <br /> Within the park the population numbers have declined as well. On Santa Rosa Island it is estimated that less than 30 breeding pairs were on the island in 2002, down from 60 pairs in 1993. However, an estimated 200 birds still wintered on the island's beaches that same year. A recovery plan has also been implemented within its entire range that has helped the population increase by nearly 25 percent.<br /> <br /> To avoid disturbance and help the western snowy plovers recover, several of the islands' back beaches and sand dunes are closed to recreational use from March 15th to September 15th, including Skunk Point. Please remain on the wet sand (below mean high tide) or the road throughout this area during this time.</p> <p><strong>Tidepools</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Visit the \"Animals\" section for descriptions and photographs of common tidepool animals.</em> </strong><br /> <br /> Due to their relative isolation and protection, the tidepools in Channel Islands National Park are some of the best within southern California. Anemones, sea stars, urchins, limpets, periwinkles, chitons, barnacles, mussels, and many other beautiful species can be seen at numerous pristine tidepool sites. The most accessible sites on Santa Rosa Island include the rocky outcropping just before Skunk Point as well as near the pier in Bechers Bay and at East Point.<br /> <br /> Intertidal life has adapted to the sea and the land. When looking at a tidepool area, notice how plants and animals may be found in certain areas and not in others. Those living in the upper splash zone are tolerant to sunlight, heat, and water loss and have either a means to \"shelter\" themselves or the ability to move into an area of greater moisture. An animal with a tightly closed shell or a shell firmly attached to rock will hold water within so that it does not require water surrounding it at all times. Animals found in rock crevices and submerged pools usually require more moisture to prevent them from drying out.<br /> <br /> Because space is a limiting factor, there is competition between organisms. Many animals and plants are found in a small area. Some may live on each other or use an old shell as a surface on which to live. This is one important reason why collecting is not permitted-you may be taking away a home.<br /> <br /> Although hardy against the forces of nature, the plants and animals of the intertidal zone cannot entirely endure the impact of humans. Since individuals interact with one another, minute changes in the area could disrupt the entire community. While exploring, please keep in mind these tidepool tips:<br /> <br /> - Watch your step! The rocks can be very slippery and there may be small animals on them.<br /> <br /> - Keep an eye on the waves. The surge can sneak up on you.<br /> <br /> - Take your time and look carefully. Tidepool organisms are often very small and camouflaged.<br /> <br /> - Do not collect anything! Not only is it unlawful, but if animals and shells are taken, there may be nothing left for others to enjoy.<br /> <br /> - If you pick up an animal to observe, please place it back where it was found. That particular spot is its home territory.<br /> <br /> - Although you may not know the animals by name, through simple observation a great deal of information can be learned. Consider, for example, what keeps it from drying out? Why doesn't it get swept out to sea? Does it search for food or wait for food to come to it?<br /> <br /> Take time to look carefully in the tidepools and you should see some of the following species.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing at Skunk Point, flat sandstone slab that stretches far out into the ocean, covered, inland, by an enormous white sand beach. The rock is a light, pinkish tan in color. Closer to the water, thin grooves or channels appear in the rock, running in the direction of the water. Near the mid-tide mark, the rock slab begins to break into smaller chunks and the surface is covered with bright green algae.<br /><br />Here at the point, various currents and ocean swells often collide, creating turbulent waters. Waves seem to break in various directions, creating crisscrossing lines of foamy white water. The water close to shore is a pale turquoise in color, changing to a darker blue farther from shore. <br /><br />Visible from the most commonly visited parts of the island, the triangular-shaped beach behind Skunk Point seems far larger in reality than it appears from a distance. Although its size varies with the seasons, the beach can be almost four miles long and almost a mile deep. <br /><br />The Skunk Point Marine Reserve begins to the east of Skunk Point and continues down to the southern tip of the beach. To the northwest is Bechers Bay, followed by Carrington Point in the distance. To the southeast is East Point. In good weather, Santa Cruz Island can be seen in the distance, to the east.<br /><br />There is an extensive back sand dune area along the beach which is off limits in spring and summer, in order to protect the nesting and foraging areas for the endangered western snowy plover. <br /><br />You are standing on a rocky shoreline. The stone is a conglomeration of sand and thousands of rocks, ranging from the size of a small nut to a small watermelon, that poke up from a smooth surface, creating a trip hazard, so please watch your step. As you move closer to the ocean, deep pools are nestled in gaps of the shoreline. One pool is the size of a small swimming pool.<br /><br />Near the mid-tide mark, the rock surface is carpeted with slippery, bright green algae. Seaweed with rubbery branching leaves, grips the rocks along the edges of the pools. <br /><br />The sea floor in the pools is mixed of sand, sandstone, and cobblestones, covered with a wide variety of animals. Among these may be ochre stars, which are orange, five-armed sea stars with white dots. Bat stars, orangish-red sea stars with five wide arms. Sea urchins, red, purple and black creatures with spiky needles radiating outward, like a spiky ball. Anemones, circular greenish animals surrounded by a ring of pale, pointy tentacles, that curl up into a tight ball if touched. California sea cucumbers, tan and bumpy cucumber-shaped creatures. Mossy chiton, a well camouflaged animal, with a hard brown oval shell, and thick, brown mossy fringe around its outer edge.<br /><br />The deepest of the pools is connected to the ocean by a channel through the rocks. Ocean waves create surges of water that rush through the channel. In the waters off shore and in the deeper pools, are tangled strands of brown kelp. The kelp's ropelike stalks reach from the ocean floor up to the water's surface, with short, rubbery, lasagna-like blades sticking off of it. <br /><br />Western snowy plovers are endangered small birds, with bodies about the size of a lime. They have light brown backs and wings, white breasts, narrow wings that end in a sharp point, and feather-less leathery brown legs and feet. Their rounded heads have a short black beak, and their feathers have a narrow black stripe across the forehead, a black horizontal stripe behind large black eyes, and a thin white ring around their necks. Below this ring are small dark rectangular patches; on one either side of their necks.<br /><br />The plovers scrape out shallow depressions in the sand where they lay their eggs. These are well camouflaged, and hard to see in the sand. Young snowy plovers are about the size of a person's thumb when they hatch. They leave their nests within three hours of hatching, and begin to forage on their own. Plover parents work hard to keep their young safe. If a predator approaches their nest, they will pretend to be injured to lure the predator away. If their chicks are wandering when a predator appears, they will signal the chicks, which then flatten themselves against the sand to be less visible. <br /><br />If conditions are right, the Western snowy plovers may raise two or even three broods each year, in these vulnerable, sandy nests. These plovers were listed as threatened by the Fish and Wildlife Service on March 5, 1993. To help restore their population, the National Park Service closes several beaches on Santa Rosa and other Channel Islands during the breeding season. <br /><br />",

    "audioDescription": "You are standing at Skunk Point, flat sandstone slab that stretches far out into the ocean, covered, inland, by an enormous white sand beach. The rock is a light, pinkish tan in color. Closer to the water, thin grooves or channels appear in the rock, running in the direction of the water. Near the mid-tide mark, the rock slab begins to break into smaller chunks and the surface is covered with bright green algae. Here at the point, various currents and ocean swells often collide, creating turbulent waters. Waves seem to break in various directions, creating crisscrossing lines of foamy white water. The water close to shore is a pale turquoise in color, changing to a darker blue farther from shore. Visible from the most commonly visited parts of the island, the triangular-shaped beach behind Skunk Point seems far larger in reality than it appears from a distance. Although its size varies with the seasons, the beach can be almost four miles long and almost a mile deep. The Skunk Point Marine Reserve begins to the east of Skunk Point and continues down to the southern tip of the beach. To the northwest is Bechers Bay, followed by Carrington Point in the distance. To the southeast is East Point. In good weather, Santa Cruz Island can be seen in the distance, to the east. There is an extensive back sand dune area along the beach which is off limits in spring and summer, in order to protect the nesting and foraging areas for the endangered western snowy plover. You are standing on a rocky shoreline. The stone is a conglomeration of sand and thousands of rocks, ranging from the size of a small nut to a small watermelon, that poke up from a smooth surface, creating a trip hazard, so please watch your step. As you move closer to the ocean, deep pools are nestled in gaps of the shoreline. One pool is the size of a small swimming pool. Near the mid-tide mark, the rock surface is carpeted with slippery, bright green algae. Seaweed with rubbery branching leaves, grips the rocks along the edges of the pools. The sea floor in the pools is mixed of sand, sandstone, and cobblestones, covered with a wide variety of animals. Among these may be ochre stars, which are orange, five-armed sea stars with white dots. Bat stars, orangish-red sea stars with five wide arms. Sea urchins, red, purple and black creatures with spiky needles radiating outward, like a spiky ball. Anemones, circular greenish animals surrounded by a ring of pale, pointy tentacles, that curl up into a tight ball if touched. California sea cucumbers, tan and bumpy cucumber-shaped creatures. Mossy chiton, a well camouflaged animal, with a hard brown oval shell, and thick, brown mossy fringe around its outer edge. The deepest of the pools is connected to the ocean by a channel through the rocks. Ocean waves create surges of water that rush through the channel. In the waters off shore and in the deeper pools, are tangled strands of brown kelp. The kelp’s ropelike stalks reach from the ocean floor up to the water’s surface, with short, rubbery, lasagna-like blades sticking off of it. Western snowy plovers are endangered small birds, with bodies about the size of a lime. They have light brown backs and wings, white breasts, narrow wings that end in a sharp point, and feather-less leathery brown legs and feet. Their rounded heads have a short black beak, and their feathers have a narrow black stripe across the forehead, a black horizontal stripe behind large black eyes, and a thin white ring around their necks. Below this ring are small dark rectangular patches; on one either side of their necks. The plovers scrape out shallow depressions in the sand where they lay their eggs. These are well camouflaged, and hard to see in the sand. Young snowy plovers are about the size of a person’s thumb when they hatch. They leave their nests within three hours of hatching, and begin to forage on their own. Plover parents work hard to keep their young safe. If a predator approaches their nest, they will pretend to be injured to lure the predator away. If their chicks are wandering when a predator appears, they will signal the chicks, which then flatten themselves against the sand to be less visible. If conditions are right, the Western snowy plovers may raise two or even three broods each year, in these vulnerable, sandy nests. These plovers were listed as threatened by the Fish and Wildlife Service on March 5, 1993. To help restore their population, the National Park Service closes several beaches on Santa Rosa and other Channel Islands during the breeding season.",

During the winter, the cove is open and unprotected from southeast storms. Watersports and landing from a boat can be very challenging here due to shorebreak and currents. Proceed with caution. No lifeguard on duty. <br /> <br /> <strong>Place Name</strong><br /> Smugglers Cove received its name from the widespread smuggling around the back side of the island by sea otter traders and others, known as contrabandistas during both the Spanish and Mexican years (1769-1848).<br /> <br /> According to Pier Gherini [1966]: “Smugglers’ Cove referred to an era in early California history when custom duties were evaded, and apparently Smugglers’ Cove was used as an interim stopping place prior to the entry at mainland ports.”<br /> <br /> Helen Caire [1993] further describes this era: “Monterey became the capital of Alta California, and its port alone was open to foreign ships. The only source of revenue for California, the tax on imports, was of great importance. Many foreign vessels tried to dodge it, often successfully, reducing Spanish revenue while enriching themselves. Smuggling flourished, especially since the contrabandistas brought goods, which the californios wanted, and indeed, many of which they really needed. Soon the chief aim and heaviest traffic of the traders was the beautiful fur of the sea otter. It is certain that the islands were used as bases of operations on the southern coast, as Smugglers’ Cove on Santa Cruz Island and a bight of the same name on San Clemente [Island] testify. By 1834 the deserted islands were not visited except by smugglers and sea otter hunters.”</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>While Scorpion Ranch was the headquarters for the east end island operations, Smugglers Ranch served as an outpost for laborers who worked in the olive orchard and the vineyards located in Smugglers Valley. Although early maps show a residence at Smuggler's as early as 1885, the building bears the date \"1889.\" Like the two-story ranch house at Scorpion, the Smuggler's ranch house often is referred to as an \"adobe,\" despite its construction of both rock masonry and adobe. The quarry for the limestone used in the construction of the ranch house and other structures can be seen off the west corner of the house. According to Gherini, early maps show that the ranch facility consisted of \"...a residence, a separate one-room building for the foreman, a cookery, a bake oven, a tool shed, a supply shed, a stable, a well, a hog corral, and water closets.\"<br /> <br /> <b>More Ranching History</b><br /> While the isolated island offered ranchers several advantages over the mainland, including no predators and the world's best fence (the ocean), it created special challenges as well. Supplying such a remote outpost was probably the biggest challenge. The transportation of supplies and stock onto and off the island was always an adventure-the distance to the mainland, rough seas, and expense made it very difficult. However, as former ranch superintendent Clifford McElrath wrote in his memoir On Santa Cruz Island, ranchers would adapt to the difficulties of isolated island life through self-reliance and by \"learning to make do with what [they] had.\" Pier Gherini, former owner of the eastern portion of the island, wrote a humorous story in \"Island Rancho\" about the self-reliance of Joe Griggs:<br /> <br /> \"Joe could do most anything, except write. An expert rider, huntsman, and general ranch worker, Joe also was a mechanical whiz. He once took a 1915 Waterloo Boy tractor that had been \"mothballed\" because the early workmen wouldn't touch it, and used the parts to make a sawmill. The fact that we didn't need a mill in no way detracted from the ingenuity and skill that went into its making. All of these people had one common characteristic. They knew and loved the Island. Each in his own way was rugged and self-reliant. They took its beauties and hardships in stride.\"<br /> <br /> Although livestock ranching on Santa Cruz Island began in the 1850s, it was under the direction of Justinian Caire beginning around 1880 that a variety of agricultural and ranching endeavors were developed in an effort to create a self-sufficient operation on the island.<br /> <br /> In California's Channel Islands, Marla Daily writes that, \"Buildings including several ranch houses, bunkhouses, barns, wineries, a chapel, mess hall, blacksmith shop, and saddle shop were constructed. Wherever possible, native island materials were used. Kilns were built for the manufacture of bricks and limestone mortar. Stones were quarried and cut to shape on the island. A resident blacksmith forged wrought-iron fittings, railings, and hinges used on many of the buildings. Employees included masons, carpenters, dairymen, team drivers, vintners, a wagon maker, cobbler, butcher, seasonal grape pickers and sheep shearers, a sea captain and sailors to run the company's 60-foot schooner. Hay, vegetables, and over a dozen varieties of grapes were grown, in addition to almond, walnut and other fruit and ornamental trees. Sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs were raised.\"<br /> <br /> Since the island was too large to manage from the one main ranch in the Central Valley, other facilities, or out-ranches like the one at Scorpion, were developed. Completed in 1887, the two-story Scorpion ranch house, and later, the wooden bunkhouse (ca 1914), were home to ranch hands who tended the flocks of sheep and cattle and the crop fields on the broad plateaus and rich black soils on this eastern end of the island. Known as the \"granary of the island,\" the Scorpion and Smugglers ranches were the bases that supplied much of the food and hay for the island operation.<br /> <br /> Sheep ranching for meat and wool by descendants of Justinian Caire, the Gherini family, continued on the eastern end of Santa Cruz Island between 1926 and 1984. The Gherini era ended in February 1997 when the National Park Service acquired the last interest from the family. Today, the National Park Service is preserving the historic area so visitors always will have the chance to remember and understand this unique part of the island's past.</p>",

Built of plastered stone and adobe on a brick and mortar foundation with a shingled hipped roof the exterior of the house is reminiscent of European architecture or the square saltbox houses of New England.

Parts of this road are still visible today. <br /> <br /> According to Gherini, “In early June 1892, laborers began work on the new Scorpion road located on the side of the Scorpion Valley hill near the beach. The hill had large outcroppings of volcanic rock. The foreman described the work as ‘lavora alla pietra’ (work at the rock). This work continued until the end of November 1892 and involved as many as thirteen workers a day.  Usually the daily work crew consisted of nine to ten workers….map 92, dated 1892, indicated for the first time that there was a road at this location leading out of the Scorpion Valley to Smugglers. The rock walls built to support the road were the largest  rock walls built on the island. When Margaret Eaton first observed the road-work in 1909 she quipped, ‘… Some stonemason who knew his business built that road.’”</p>",

With steep terrain and drop offs along the way, it's just wide enough for one vehicle in most places and provides a panoramic scene of the mainland, the other Channel Islands, and the rolling hills of Santa Cruz Island itself. The road is scattered with uneven rock and winds up out of the valley along a very steep road cut into the edge of the hillside.",

    "bodyText": "<p>In response to growing maritime traffic at Los Angeles, the U. S. Lighthouse Service built the only navigational aid on Santa Rosa Island at South Point in 1925. Using a small landing below and a trail, and with the help of Vail & Vickers horses and cowboys, the lighthouse crews from Yerba Buena Island in San Francisco Bay erected a \"beacon light,\" a typical pyramidal tower on a forty-foot square plot of land at an elevation of 430 feet. The pyramidal tower acted as a base for the electric-powered, unmanned light, which was maintained about twice a year or when needed. The government paid Vail & Vickers one dollar per year for the use of the plot of land, the landing below and the connecting trail.<br /> <br /> In 1937 the Lighthouse Service decided, after some study, to replace the pyramidal tower with a small house at a higher elevation. Vail & Vickers employees completed a new trail to this location, leveled the new site, and used pack horses to haul up to 4900 pounds consisting of approximately 35 boxes and crates of equipment, lumber, and water from the landing at Johnson's Lee.<br /> <br /> The new seven-by-seven foot house was constructed on the mainland, each piece marked, disassembled and rebuilt on site, now 530 feet above sea level. Shortly after, crews built a six-by-seven foot wood frame addition to the building. The resulting new light structure was rectangular with lapped siding painted white. Benches inside held the banks of batteries that powered the small 375-mm electric, 4,300 candlepower light located on the roof, the batteries being charged by a windmill generator. In operation, the light beamed white flashes of 1.2 seconds duration every 20 seconds and was visible 19 miles out to sea.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers assisted the Coast Guard on contract, supplying transportation, at first horses, and vehicles on occasion. Diego Cuevas recalled that the Coast Guard men walked the trail from the tender anchored at Johnson's Lee to maintain the light, and would contract with the Vails if any equipment needed hauling in or out. In many instances the staging area would be the pier at Becher's Bay. In later years, according to Cuevas, a Coast Guard helicopter made the trip. Originally the batteries were charged by a windmill generator, but more recently by solar power.<br /> <br /> The Coast Guard put the South Point Light Station out of operation prior to 1986 and left the house and light in place. The building sat unmaintained for many years until 2020 when the NPS restored it and listed it in the National Register of Historic Places. Following this restoration, the Coast Guard installed a modern light fixture atop the building and restored its function as a navigational aid following several decades out of operation.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the </strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> _</em></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Elgaria m.multicarinata</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The southern alligator lizard is found on San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz Islands in the national park as well as almost any natural habitat in California (except most of the deserts and very high elevations.) They can be fairly large in size. Active during daylight, they are frequently seen moving on the ground, and occasionally up in bushes. They are also often found underneath debris, beach driftwood, and near human settlements. Alligator lizards do not typically bask in the sun out in the open or on top of a rock like many other lizard species. They seem to prefer sunny spots with some cover nearby. This is a lizard that is often seen in yards and garages in Southern California.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Alligator lizards live up to 15 years.</li> <li>Just like snakes, alligator lizards shed their skin in a single intact piece by essentially turning it inside out as they crawl out of it.</li> <li>Observations suggest that they are able to eat animals close to or greater than their own body length.</li> <li>As with most lizards, they may detach their tail deliberately as a defensive tactic, however the tail will grow back, although generally not as perfectly as the original.</li> <li>Tail regeneration is energetically expensive. Reproductive fitness and survival have been shown to be decreased during the regeneration process.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Alligator lizards have slender gray-brown colored bodies, although juveniles are marked differently than adults with a broad stripe on the back of tan, reddish, yellow, gray, or beige and side bars may be less distinct. In size they range from 2 7/8 - 7 inches in snout to vent length and up to approximately 12 inches in total length. With their large heads and powerful jaws, alligator lizards are capable of inflicting a nasty and painful bite. Their limbs are short, but alligator lizards have long tails, sometimes as much as twice the body length.</p> <p><strong>Range Distribution</strong><br /> The species <em>Elgaria multicarinata</em> ranges from southern Washington mostly west of the Cascades and Sierras into northwestern Baja California, including some of the Channel Islands. In his 2003 field guide, Robert C. Stebbins, noted herpetologist, states that this species occurs from sea level to 5,000 feet, but has been observed by others at 6,200 ft. and there are unconfirmed reports of their occurrence as high as 8,000 ft.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Preferred habitat for alligator lizards includes grassland, open forest and chaparral, and they are also found in foothill oak woodlands. Inidividuals can be found under rocks, logs, boards, trash, and other surface cover.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The alligator lizard is carnivorous, feeding on various invertebrate species, and occasionally on w small, young mammals and birds. Of their invertebrate prey, insects and their larvae, especially ground beetles, grasshopper and crickets, are prominent in their diet. Aligagtor lizards eatoOther arthropods, such as spiders (including black widow spiders), centipedes, scorpions, sow bugs andsnails. Frog tadpoles, when they occur near alligator lizard habitat, are sometimes taken as well. Observations suggest that they eat animals close to or greater than their own body length. Some reports suggest bird eggs are eaten; other studies question this. Cannibalism for this species is not uncommon, as young adults are often preyed upon by mature adults. Other lizards, especially western skinks, are also a food source for the alligator lizard owing to the fact that they can be active when other kinds of lizards need to rest.</p> <p>It has been shown that movement of prey helps to stimulate feeding behavior by alligator lizards, but they can also consume non-moving food such as spider egg contents, dead lizards, baby mice, and insects. Edible objects are approached and visually inspected by moving the head up and down, side-to side, or in small circles to judge size and distance . Being satisfied, the lizard then inspects with the tongue if possible. When ready to strike, the lizard arches its back upward, straightens the front limbs, bends the head and neck downwards, and attacks with a swift downward stroke.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Alligator lizards will hibernate in underground dens during cold winter months, emerging in early spring. Mating is thought to generally occur between April and May. Unlike some lizard species that engage in elaborate mating displays, breeding behavior of alligator lizard males is more succinct. They simply pursue a female of interest, and mating ensues. In an unexpected behavior, observations show that females share egg-laying sites. Interestingly, significant differences exist for number of clutches between populations of <em>Elgaria</em> in different areas. Normally 5 to 20 eggs laid between May and June and July. Eggs are placed in rock crevices orburrows of rodents. The lizards hatch after 11 weeks and are about one and one-third inches in length,weighing about 2 ounces. The alligator lizard reaches its maturity in about 18 months and can live as long as 15 years.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The alligator lizard is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, tolerance of a broad range of habitats, presumed large population, and because it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/e.m.multicarinata.html\">http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/e.m.multicarinata.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheet.htm\">http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheet.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/63703/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/63703/0</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/794874/details\">http://eol.org/pages/794874/details</a></li> </ul>",

There are over 20 recognized subspecies, and the island birds belong to the subspecies <em>megalonyx</em>, which also occurs in coastal southern California. A separete subspeices (<em>P. m. clementae</em>) inhabits Sant aCatalina Island and formerly occured on San Clemente Island, but was extirpated there by the 1970s.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>While feeding on the ground spotted towhees often use a two-footed, backwards-scratching hopping technique.. This \"double-scratching\" is used by a number of towhee and sparrow species to uncover the seeds and small invertebrates they feed on.<br />  </li> <li>During conflicts between two towhees, one bird pick up a piece of twig, bark, or leaf and carry it around. This seems to be an indication of submission.<br />  </li> <li>Early in the breeding season, male spotted towhees spend their mornings singing their hearts out, trying to attract a mate. Male towhees have been recorded spending 70 percent to 90 percent of their mornings singing. Almost as soon as they attract a mate, their attention shifts to other things, and they spend only about 5 percent of their time singing.<br />  </li> <li>When disturbed, a nesting female spotted towhee may run away like a mouse rather than fly.<br />  </li> <li>They occasionally sun themselves, lying down on the grass with feathers spread.<br />  </li> <li>They often bathe in dew or fog drip on vegetation.<br />  </li> <li>A group of towhees are collectively known as a \"tangle\" and a \"teapot\" of towhees.<br />  </li> <li>Spotted towhees live in drier habitats than eastern towhees. Some scientists have suggested that the bold white spots on spotted towhees' backs help them blend in to the sun-dappled undergrowth.<br />  </li> <li>The oldest recorded spotted towhee was 10 years 8 months old.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The spotted towhee is a large sparrow with white-spotted black back and black rump. Its breast is black, the belly white, and sides are rufous. The species has a black head with eyes that are red. Distinctively, its wings are black with white spots. It has a tail that is long and black with white corners. The female spotted towhee is duller, with brown instead of black and fewer white spots. Differences between the subspecies, <em>P. m. clementae</em> and <em>P. m. megalonyx</em>, the most locally common of the subspecies, is that clementae is in size slightly greater than megalonyx;its bill and feet appreciably larger. As well<em>, clementae's</em> coloration is grayer than in <em>megalonyx</em> with its black areas in the male duller and less intense.The rump and lower back of <em>clementae</em> is more or less mixed with grayish.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Spotted towhees are widely distributed in western North America, occurring from the southern tip of Mexico to southern Canada. The spotted towhee is the most common bird on Santa Rosa Island, according to park landbird studies.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Spotted towhees are birds of dry thickets, brushy tangles, forest edges, old fields, shrubby backyards, chaparral, coulees, and canyon bottoms, places with dense shrub cover and plenty of leaf litter for the towhees to scratch around in. Data from the park's landbird monitoring program indicates that spotted towhees on Santa Rosa Island favor scrub, grassland and chaparral habitat types.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Spotted towhees rummage in the leaf litter or creep through thick shrubs. Towhees tend to hop wherever they go, moving deliberately and giving themselves plenty of time to spot food items. They scratch at leaves with a characteristic two-footed backward hop, and then pounce on anything they've uncovered.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> In the breeding season, spotted towhees eat mainly insects including ground beetles, weevils, ladybugs, darkling beetles, click beetles, wood-boring beetles, crickets, grasshoppers, caterpillars, moths, bees, and wasps. Other leaf-litter arthropods such as millipedes, sowbugs, and spiders are taken as well. They also eat acorns, berries, and seeds including buckwheat, thistle, raspberry, blackberry, poison oak, sumac, nightshade, chickweed, and crops such as oats, wheat, corn, and cherries. In fall and winter, these plant foods make up the majority of their diet.</p> <p>Spotted towhee nests are usually built in depressions on the ground, or occasionally in vegetation 1 ½to 5 feet off of the ground, which are typically overhung with bushes, vines, or clumps of grass that provide shelter and protective screening. The female lays two to six white or gray eggs flecked with purple and red brown that she incubates from 12 to 14 days. Pairs will raise two and occasionally three broods in a single season and will renest following nest failure.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The California Department of Fish and Game has listed the San Clemente spotted towhee, which occurs currently on Santa Catalina Island and formerly occurred on San Clemente Island, as a California Bird Species of Special Concern.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li>PDF of San Clemente Spotted Towhee account from:Shuford, W.

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Eumetopias jubatus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Steller sea lions are the largest members of the Otariid, or “eared seal,” family. Steller sea lions that are also known as northern sea lions are sometimes confused with California sea lions, but are much larger and lighter in color. At one time, this species were found here in abundance. Only an occasional male Steller sea lion has been seen since the 1980s.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Steller sea lions are the largest of the sea lions.</li> <li>They have thick, hairy necks that look like a lion's mane.</li> <li>They don't need to drink water - they get all the water they need from the food they eat.</li> <li>Male Steller sea lions don't eat during the breeding season. They care more about protecting their territory and making sure their females don't run off with another male!</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The Steller sea lion is called “seevitchie” by the Aleuts and “sivuch” by the Russians, each translating to “seawolf.” The name that the animal now bears comes from George Wilhelm Steller, a naturalist aboard the 1741 Vitus Bering expeditions. Steller thought the creature resembled a lion because the male’s large neck and shoulder region look similar to the mane of a lion.<br /> Steller sea lions, being otariids or eared seals, differ from the phocids, or “earless” seals, by having visible external ear flaps and long hind flippers that can be turned under, making travel on land easy. Steller sea lions are light tan to reddish brown in color. Males are visibly larger and appear lighter in color than females. Female sea lions average seven feet in length and about 600 pounds. Male sea lions, slightly longer at nine feet, weigh more than twice as much as females at an average of 1,500 pounds with “beach masters” reaching up to 2,400 pounds. Juveniles are chocolate brown in color and appear in early June. Pups stay dark for their first four to six months and then molt to a lighter color. Males are visibly larger and appear lighter in color than females. Juveniles are chocolate brown in color and appear in early June. Pups stay dark for their first four to six months and then molt to a lighter color.<sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Steller sea lions live in an arc around the north Pacific from central California to Japan. The animals seen in our area of Alaska are from the western stock. Steller sea lions do not migrate, but individuals disperse widely outside of breeding season. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> In early May, adult male sea lions haul out on established rookeries to claim their area. A returning bull will attempt to reclaim a spot he has held in past years. Eventually, he will be too old (between 13 to 15 years) to compete and will spend his retirement at a haul-out or possibly hold down some less desirable territory at the rookery edge. Haul-outs and rookeries are mostly located on remote and rocky coasts and islands with easy access to the open sea.<sup> 1</sup></p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Steller sea lions are opportunistic marine carnivores. Their most important prey species include: pollock, Atka mackerel, pacific herring, capelin, pacific sandlance, pacific cod, and salmon. Haul-outs and rookeries are mostly located on remote and rocky coasts and islands with easy access to the open sea. Steller sea lions often feed at night, but hunt schooling prey by day in large groups. It is believed that group feeding may help in controlling the movement of schooling fish and prey. <sup>1</sup><br /> <br /> In the years 1976 and 1977, there was a warming period in the Gulf of Alaska waters. This warming lessened the availability of some of the sea lion’s prey, specifically oily fish like sandlance, white capelin, and herring. Sea lions now rely on pollock as a main dietary source. This diet switch may be a contributing factor in the decline of the sea lion as pollock lacks the oil critical to the maintenance of sea lion blubber. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Female Steller sea lions are sexually mature at four to six years of age. Bulls become mature at three to eight years, but cannot defend territory until they are nine or 10 years old. The competition for territory consists of aggressive displays: roaring, hissing, and chest-to-chest confrontations with open mouths that sometimes end in severe injury. The victor stays out of the water as long as months before any females visit him. Male sea lions fast during this time. <sup>1</sup><br /> <br /> In late May or early June, female sea lions arrive at the rookery. Their main objective is to find a good beach on which to give birth. The male with the best birthing territory ends up with the most females. Just 10 to 14 days after giving birth, the female is ready to mate. After fertilization occurs, the embryo develops for a few weeks and then stops. After three to four months, in September or early October, the embryo implants in the uterine wall and resumes growing. This delayed implantation allows the pups to be born at an optimal time. Total gestation time is 11 and one half months. <sup>1</sup><br /> <br /> Pups, usually one per female and weighing 35 to 50 pounds, are born mid-May to mid-July. For five to 13 days the mother stays with the pup; she then leaves the pup alone while she goes out to forage. At 10 to 14 days the pups form groups of their own—sleeping and playing together while the mothers forage. Pups are able to crawl and swim soon after birth but do not enter the water for about four to six weeks. The mother and pup find each other through scent and vocalizations. Pups will sometimes approach other females, but females will not accept pups that are not their own. A pup will continue nursing from the mother even after it starts foraging on its own. Some pups nurse until the mother’s next birth and some until they are three years old. <sup>1</sup></p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> In the 1960s, there were between 250,000 and 300,000 Steller sea lions worldwide. The Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands historically contained the largest percentage of this population. In 1977, this area contained 74 percent of the global population, but by 1989 it dropped to 56 percent. In 1990, the Steller sea lion was listed as threatened throughout its range. Later studies of mitochondrial DNA from Steller sea lions suggest that there are at least two stocks, an eastern stock (California through Southeast Alaska) and a western stock (Prince William Sound and areas west). The decline was happening solely to the western stock and in 1997, the listing of the western stock was reclassified as endangered. <sup>2</sup><br /> <br /> The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (ICUN), Red List Category & Criteria states that based upon current trends this species is declared near threatened. This assessment was made in June of 2012. This is a dramatic change from the 20 year downward trend in species numbers beginning in the late 1970s.<br /> In explanation Steller sea lions experienced a dramatic and unexplained population decline of about 70% between the late 1970s and 1990 with the steepest decline occurring between 1985 and 1989 when the population was reduced by 15% per year. The population reached its low point in approximately 2000 and has shown an overall annual increase of 1.5–2% since that year. However, in the western Aleutian and Commander islands the trends have continued to show persistent declines. Overall, the Asian portion of the population declined through the 1990s and began to slowly increase in 2000 due to increases in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands. The decline of the 1980s and 1990s weights the trend such that the subspecies has experienced a population reduction of 57% during the last three generations (1981–2011), which qualified the species for Endangered. <sup>5</sup></p> <p><strong>References and Additional Information</strong></p> <ol> <li>Write up by Kenai Fjord NP - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kefj/naturescience/steller-sea-lion.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/kefj/naturescience/steller-sea-lion.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kefj/naturescience/steller-sea-lion-decline.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/kefj/naturescience/steller-sea-lion-decline.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/steller-sea-lion/?\">http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/education/marine-mammal-information/pinnipeds/steller-sea-lion/?</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steller_sea_lion\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steller_sea_lion</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/8239/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/8239/0</a></li> </ol>",

Although the work was probably carried out by both skilled stone masons and less skilled workers, as differences in quality can be detected in the various structures, the masonry involved has been examined by experts and has been judged as \"good quality work, built to high standards.\"<br /> <br /> \"To make better use of the land, workers cleared the fields of rocks; then piled the huge rocks into cairns which remain today as a monument to their labor,\" wrote Gherini about the large rock piles that can be seen as one hikes along the road to Smugglers Cove. The \"better use of the land\" Gherini writes about is the planting of a variety of crops such as wheat, corn, potatoes, beans, barley, onions, hay, and alfalfa in these cleared fields between Scorpion and Smugglers. These crops supplied many of the food products and hay for the island operation and led to the east end of the island being known as the \"granary.\"</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Dotting the open landscape along the road to Smugglers Cove, scattered and are over 100 large rounded piles of stacked stones, some twenty feet in diameter several feet high. The stones were stacked by workers who were clearing the fields for farming. The piles are scattered across hundreds of acres in the mesa lands between Scorpion and Smugglers Ranches. Many of the piles are in close proximity to one another, some fifty to 100 yards apart.",

    "audioDescription": "You have stepped off the boat, onto the lower landing platform of the dock at the east end of a very long pier, that runs east to west. You are standing on metal decking with sturdy railings. The decking runs along two sides of the larger platform above you. Supporting the entire structure are metal beams and thick round posts that look like telephone poles, which extend down into the ocean below. Around the waterline and below, barnacles and mussels cling, in dense clusters, to those posts. The ocean waters extend out in every direction.<br /><br />A tall metal staircase with twelve risers leads up to the platform above. The upper dock platform is about 100 feet by 70 feet. Five-foot high wooden railings run along the perimeter of the pier and dock platform and pier. Below the dock railing, at each corner, is a light beacon, under a clear bell-shaped cap. <br /><br />If you are standing at the top of the risers on the platform, to your left, attached to top of a post are two large outdoor lights. Just past the lights, mounted to the railing, is a heavy plastic yellow container that is rectangular with a rounded top. The lettering on it reads,<br /><br />Life Ring.<br /><br />Straight ahead, on the opposite side of the dock, is a park orientation panel, mounted to the railing. <br /><br />To the right of that panel, and running parallel to the railing, are two low wooden risers with yellow stripes painted on the sides. Matching yellow L-shapes are painted on the pier about 10 feet away from the risers' corners, seemingly outlining a rectangular area on the dock.<br /><br />The ocean end of the dock extends out farther on the left side, by about 20 feet. Near the middle of that side of the dock is a metal cabinet, covered with green canvas. Three shapes stick up on the top, also covered in canvas. Nearby is a large yellow plastic barrel with square shapes that curve out on the sides. <br /><br />In the far right corner of the ocean end of the dock is an upright metal cylinder, about five-feet wide by eight-feet tall. At the top of the cylinder is a giant metal hinge that supports a long steel \"arm,\" ending with two thick parallel metal plates, just a few inches apart, creating a slot, like that between prongs of tongs or a clamp. The plates hang down lower than the arm about one foot. On top of the arm are three thin metal bands, each curved into an upright loop that is connected to the sides of the arm. Lettering on the side of the steel \"arm\" reads,<br /><br />Hydro Pro.<br /><br />The wooden plank pier, that connects the dock to the island, is 650 feet long and 20 feet wide. At the land end of the pier, on either side, is a steep sandy-colored rocky ridge with eroded gullies and a sandy beach below. The cliff surface varies from top to bottom. Embedded in the top area are random clumps of cobble-sized stones. On the lower part of the cliff are layers of horizontal ridges, like the wavy edge of a stack of pancakes.<br /><br />On the south side, 18 wooden steps with railings lead downward. At the bottom step, there is a ladder, that you can climb down to reach the sandy beach. <br /><br />On the north side is an information panel. <br /><br />At the end of the pier, a dirt road continues upward, cutting through the cliff to the top of the plateau.<br />",

San Miguel Island is home to 20 of these species and some, like the San Miguel Island song sparrow, are found only on this island.<br /> <br /> Isolation has also played a major role in shaping human activities on the islands. While the southern California coastal mainland has seen extensive development, the Channel Islands remain undeveloped. The islands' separation from the mainland by up to 60 miles of an often turbulent ocean has limited and directed human use and occupation for thousands of years. And this limited use continues today, giving us a chance to see coastal southern California as it once was.<br /> <br /> So step back in time and experience San Miguel Island's isolation as you walk up Nidever Canyon to the ranger station. It's like nowhere else on Earth.<br /> <br /> <b>An Ocean Park and Sanctuary</b><br /> From this vantage point, one has the opportunity to gaze upon another part of the park: the marine environment. One nautical mile of water around each island is part of Channel Islands National Park, and the six nautical miles around each island form Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm, one often sees or hears California sea lions, northern elephant seals, or harbor seals. The island's isolated shoreline offers these pinnipeds an ideal combination of safety from predators and freedom from human disturbance, making the island an ideal place to rest, breed, and pup.<br /> <br /> But even San Miguel Island's isolation could not always protect these and other sea mammals from human predation. As early as the late 1700's, fur hunters were exploiting sea otters, fur seals, elephant seals, and sea lions for their fur, hides and oil. Sea mammal hunting ended in the early 1900's and laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act now protect these species.<br /> <br /> In this isolated environment, their protected populations have recovered from centuries of slaughter. Today, up to five different species (elephant seals, sea lions, Guadalupe fur seal, northern fur seals, and harbor seals) and over 100,000 individuals use the island's shoreline. On Point Bennett alone over 30,000 individuals can be found-making it one of the largest concentrations of wildlife in the world.<br /> <br /> These pinnipeds, along with over 800 other marine species, also depend on the extensive kelp forests found in these waters for food, shelter, and protection- from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales feasting on plankton. Kelp is a type of algae that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing organisms on Earth-it can grow two feet per day.<br /> <br /> While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California coastal mainland, the isolated islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp forests don't just benefit marine species-they benefit us as well. Not only do we eat some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but everyday products like ice cream, salad dressing, and even toothpaste also use a little bit of seaweed as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredient called algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine plants and algae such as kelp provide Earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, human activities have placed the kelp forest and its inhabitants in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have altered the kelp forest ecosystem, and kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the 20th century.<br /> <br /> However, with the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls, fishing regulations, and increased research and public education, some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary, this network of MPAs provides a refuge for sea life, as well as opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 marine reserves (including three around San Miguel Island), recreational fishing and commercial harvesting are prohibited; limited fishing and harvesting are allowed in two marine conservation areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and an important part of a larger, worldwide effort to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.<br /> <br /> <b>An Ideal Isolated Home</b><br /> San Miguel Island and its associated islets support regionally important and diverse seabird colonies, including one-third of the breeding seabirds in the Channel Islands. Prince Island, which lies at the entrance to Cuyler Harbor, hosts the most diverse seabird colony on the west coast with 13 different species. Ashy storm-petrels, Brandt's cormorants, Cassin's auklets, pigeon guillemots, California brown pelicans, and common murres all make their home here.<br /> <br /> San Miguel Island, the other Channel Islands, and all of their associated islets and offshore rocks comprise one of the largest breeding centers on the west coast for seabirds and shorebirds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, as well as the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters surrounding them, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> However, the island's isolation was not able to protect some species of seabirds from human impacts. The destruction of native vegetation, importing of non-native species, gathering of eggs, disturbance of rookeries, and the spread of pesticides in the marine environment have all been detrimental.<br /> <br /> During the 1960s, the pesticide DDT nearly caused the extinction of the California brown pelican as a breeding species on the west coast of the United States. In 1970, only 552 nesting attempts were made on Anacapa Island (the largest colony on the West coast of the United States) and just one chick survived. On October 13, 1970, the brown pelican was listed as an endangered species.<br /> <br /> Today, pelicans and other seabird species are gradually recovering now that their isolated island home is protected within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of the island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of southern California's seabird populations.<br /> <br /> On San Miguel Island, these efforts have focused on restoring seabird nesting habitat, removing black rates and nonnative vegetation, revegetating with native plants, installing nest boxes, and closing areas to protect nesting seabirds.<br /> The most notable results of these efforts have been the successful recovery of the California brown pelican and its removal from the endangered species list in 2009.</p>",

Supplying such a remote outpost was probably the biggest challenge. The transportation of supplies and stock onto and off the island was always an adventure-the distance to the mainland, rough seas, and expense made it very difficult. However, as former ranch superintendent Clifford McElrath wrote in his memoir On Santa Cruz Island, ranchers would adapt to the difficulties of isolated island life through self-reliance and by \"learning to make do with what [they] had.\" Pier Gherini, former owner of the eastern portion of the island, wrote a humorous story in \"Island Rancho\" about the self-reliance of Joe Griggs:<br /> <br /> \"Joe could do most anything, except write. An expert rider, huntsman, and general ranch worker, Joe also was a mechanical whiz. He once took a 1915 Waterloo Boy tractor that had been \"mothballed\" because the early workmen wouldn't touch it, and used the parts to make a sawmill. The fact that we didn't need a mill in no way detracted from the ingenuity and skill that went into its making. All of these people had one common characteristic. They knew and loved the Island. Each in his own way was rugged and self-reliant. They took its beauties and hardships in stride.\"<br /> <br /> Although livestock ranching on Santa Cruz Island began in the 1850s, it was under the direction of Justinian Caire beginning around 1880 that a variety of agricultural and ranching endeavors were developed in an effort to create a self-sufficient operation on the island.<br /> <br /> In <strong>California's Channel Islands</strong> , Marla Daily writes that, \"Buildings including several ranch houses, bunkhouses, barns, wineries, a chapel, mess hall, blacksmith shop, and saddle shop were constructed. Wherever possible, native island materials were used. Kilns were built for the manufacture of bricks and limestone mortar. Stones were quarried and cut to shape on the island. A resident blacksmith forged wrought-iron fittings, railings, and hinges used on many of the buildings. Employees included masons, carpenters, dairymen, team drivers, vintners, a wagon maker, cobbler, butcher, seasonal grape pickers and sheep shearers, a sea captain and sailors to run the company's 60-foot schooner. Hay, vegetables, and over a dozen varieties of grapes were grown, in addition to almond, walnut and other fruit and ornamental trees. Sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs were raised.\"<br /> <br /> Since the island was too large to manage from the one main ranch in the Central Valley, other facilities, or out-ranches like the one at Scorpion, were developed. Completed in 1887, the two-story Scorpion ranch house, and later, the wooden bunkhouse (ca 1914), were home to ranch hands who tended the flocks of sheep and cattle and the crop fields on the broad plateaus and rich black soils on this eastern end of the island. Known as the \"granary of the island,\" the Scorpion and Smugglers ranches were the bases that supplied much of the food and hay for the island operation.<br /> <br /> Sheep ranching for meat and wool by descendants of Justinian Caire, the Gherini family, continued on the eastern end of Santa Cruz Island between 1926 and 1984. The Gherini era ended in February 1997 when the National Park Service acquired the last interest from the family.<br /> <br /> Today, the National Park Service is preserving the historic area so visitors always will have the chance to remember and understand this unique part of the island's past.<br /> <br /> <strong>Visit the individual building sites for more information on ranch history.</strong></p>",

The two-room center holds exhibits, interactive displays, video and a passport station. <br /><br />The two-story ranch house is tucked in close to the canyon walls and faces the open valley to the south. The ranch house was built in 1886 of rubble-wall masonry and rests on a stone and mortar foundation. The building has a rectangular plan that measures 51 feet by 18 feet. It has a shed roof and walls that are 20 inches thick and composed of local stone, adobe bricks, mortar covered with white stucco, and limestone. Windows across the face of the building provide natural light. The first floor has two main rooms, both are open to the public with exhibits and audio visual components that describe the natural and cultural history of the area. The bakery is at the west end of the building and also contains exhibits. The bunkhouse is located immediately south of the adobe Ranch House.

Supplying such a remote outpost was probably the biggest challenge. The transportation of supplies and stock on and off the island was always an adventure-the distance to the mainland, rough seas, and expense made it very difficult. However, ranchers adapted to the challenges of island life through self-reliance and, as one ranch foreman wrote, \"learning to make do with what [they] had.\"<br /> <br /> No one was better at this than Diego Cuevas, a former ranch foreman, who stated in an oral history that he learned to \"fix things by improvising. You had to out there. We didn't have any stores.\" Margaret Vail Woolley, part of the Vail family that owned the island, concurred, \"He [Diego] could make anything out of anything. It was remarkable. He was perfect for the island.\"<br /> <br /> Some of Diego's inventions included shutting off the generator by creating a timer using ice, cables, and pulleys (which didn't work), or by using a rat trap, string, and an alarm clock (which did work). He also built a motorized cart to haul slop to the pigs and a diesel-hauling trailer with a tank. He installed a truck engine in a boat given to the ranch by the Air Force and devised a cooling system for it that worked with salt water and a kelp knife to protect the rudder and prop, but soon discovered that fishing still was better from the rocks on the island shore.<br /> <br /> To be as self-sufficient as possible, island ranchers grew and raised much of their own food, importing deer, elk, quail, pigs, and rabbits. They would make many of their own supplies such as ropes, saddles, candles, and soaps. They often salvaged what they could from shipwrecks and from abandoned military establishments from World War II and the Cold War. And they had specialized boats constructed to transport supplies, cattle, and staff to and from the island.<br /> <br /> Ranching began on Santa Rosa Island in 1844 shortly after the island was granted to the Carrillo family by the Mexican government. Then from 1858 to 1901 the More family ran one of the largest sheep ranches in the state, with up to 80,000 sheep.<br /> <br /> They centered their operations in Becher's Bay, where they constructed a pier and built the clapboard ranch house, horse barn, and blacksmith shop barn that are still found here today. These buildings, built in the 1860s and 1870s, are some of the oldest wood buildings in Santa Barbara County.<br /> <br /> For almost a century after the Mores, Vail & Vickers operated one of the largest and most productive beef cattle ranches in Santa Barbara County. Four generations of family members acted as stewards of the land managing the ranch in the traditional system of vaqueros (Spanish for \"cowboys\"), tending cattle on horseback, and preserving the last intact large Mexican land grant rancho in California as well as the last working island cattle ranch in the continental United States.<br /> <br /> Although the end of ranching in 1998 brought a close to a truly unique way of life, Vail & Vickers' commitment to ranching traditions preserved an undeveloped landscape that greatly contributed to the decision by Congress to include Santa Rosa Island in Channel Islands National Park in 1980.<br /> In 1986 the federal government purchased the island. Today, the NPS is preserving and interpreting the historic area so visitors will always have the chance to remember and understand this unique part of the islands' past.<br /> <br /> For more information on ranching history and the historic buildings, please see the other site pins on the map and visit the ranch exhibit in the restored schoolhouse.<br /> <br /> For more even more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\"><strong>Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </strong></a><strong> </strong></p>",

On the west side of the road is the Vail and Vickers Ranch House site, with a two story house and an outbuilding, both with white clapboard siding and dark green trim and roofs. The dirt road continues toward the north, with a long wooden rail fence running near the right or eastern side of the road, and a row of eucalyptus trees just beyond that fence. About a quarter of a mile down that road is the ranch complex, a cluster of ranch buildings and corrals. <br /><br />On a side road that loops to the right, near the eucalyptus trees, is small chain link fence enclosure with a low shed with a metal roof: the pig pen. Back on the main road, just past that side road turn, are two single story wooden sheds: the scale house and the branding shed. Further along the main road are two large red wooden barns, the blacksmith shop barn and the horse barn. After this, the road curves right toward the east, passing a single story grey wooden bunkhouse, a small single story white school house, several wooden rail corral enclosures, and a cattle dipping vat. As the road approaches the edge of the bluff, a hundred yards to your left, or the north, is the foreman's house-a white single story structure, with dark green trim and roof. On the other side of the road are a rope house, a cattle chute and a pile driver.<br /><br />To the east of the road where you are now standing, on the other side of the wooden rail fence, and running parallel to it, is a long row of eucalyptus trees.<br /><br />To the south of you, the road continues toward a cluster of national park service buildings-white with green trim and roofs. <br />",

Justinian Caire realized the importance of Prisoner's Harbor as the only good landing for goods, and set to work improving the small area known as La Playa (the beach) as the entrance gate to his island enterprises. Its facilities were of the utmost importance to the island's owners as the shipping facility, entry point for visitors, and warehouse location. Please see the Prisoners Harbor points of interest section (pages 52-57) for more information about the historical features in the area.<br /> <br /> Ranching by descendants of Justinian Caire, the Gherini family, continued on the eastern end of the island between 1926 and 1984. The Gherini era ended in February 1997 when the National Park Service acquired the last interest from the family. Ranching also continued on the rest of the island until 1987 when the Nature Conservancy acquired the property. In 2000, the Nature Conservancy donated 8,500 acres of its holdings, including the Prisoners Harbor area, to the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> Today, the National Park Service is preserving the historic area so visitors always will have the chance to remember and understand this unique part of the island's past.</p>",

It measures 54 feet on the front and rear, and 45 feet on the sides. Red brick-faced rubble walls with lime mortar, 20 inches thick, rise above a three-foot high stone foundation. A solid brick wall with an arched passageway separates the two storerooms. Two doorways with maroon hinged wood doors framed in white face the harbor, while two smaller doorways face the cliff at the rear of the building. Both sets of doorways feature arched openings filled with brick. The builders imbedded a carved plaque in the brick facade at the upper part of the west gable; it reads: 1887.

This incredible display of coastal sagebrush and coastal bluff scrub native vegetation is very similar to how the island would have looked to the first visitors.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the island's vegetation was not always this lush. In the 1870s, the island was described as a \"barren lump of sand.\" For over 100 years sheep (up to 6,000 at one point), cattle, horses, pigs, burros severely overgrazed the island, eliminating most of the native vegetation and creating open, disturbed, and eroded soils that allowed nonnative plants to flourish. Once established, these hardier nonnatives outcompeted the natives for limited soil and moisture, due to their longer germination and growth cycles and ability to withstand grazing and browsing by livestock.<br /> <br /> The park is working to restore the island's native vegetation, and special focus is being placed on the 10 plants endemic to the islands-those found nowhere else in the world. To ensure the survival of these unique species and encourage the recovery of the island's native vegetation, all non-native animals have been removed and the effort to plant native species and control nonnative weeds is underway.<br /> <br /> The recovery of native plants has so far been remarkable. Many have spread beyond the buried seed banks and steep canyon walls and cliffs, where they remained protected from grazing, and have reestablished themselves throughout the island.<br /> This reestablishment of native plants has also aided in the recovery of endemic deer mice, island foxes, and nesting land birds by providing important habitat. Today, there are 16 land birds that nest annually on the island. Six of these-the song sparrow, horned lark, orange-crowned warbler, loggerhead shrike, Allen's hummingbird, and house finch-are endemic to the Channel Islands.<br /> <br /> You can help with this recovery of island natives by cleaning your boots and other possessions, such as backpacks, before you visit. This ensures that you don't accidentally introduce nonnative species to the island. Together we can guarantee the return of native plants and animals throughout San Miguel Island.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "From the middle of the Nidever Canyon, if you are facing down toward the ocean, you will be facing north. A narrow one-mile trail is carved into the steep canyon wall, leading to Cuyler Harbor Beach below. Along some parts of the trail, wooden planks are laid into the dry ground, creating steps. At the base of the canyon are large sand dunes that give way to the beach below. Prince Island can be seen in the distance. It is tall and rocky, with a plateau on top. Behind you, the trail leads up to the Cabrillo Monument, the campground, and the ranger station. <br /><br />The hillsides along Nidever Canyon Trail are covered with a large variety of flowering plants. Dudleya, a succulent with thick grey-green leaves clustered in a rose shape, an inch or two high. Red stems rise up from these clusters, topped by yellow rounded flowers about four inches tall. <br /><br />Coreopsis, with a thick, bare trunk, is topped by a spray of yellow, daisy-like flowers, and feathery green leaves, shaped like fluffy ostrich feathers, in the spring. During drier seasons, the plant appears dead, as the top withers into a shaggy, brittle, brown mop of dried leaves. Island buckwheat, with soft grey-green rounded leaves and, in season, clusters of button-like yellow flowers. Non-native grasses also grow in the canyon. Water is almost always present in the bottom of the canyon. Depending on the time of your visit, there is also a seasonal waterfall. Landbirds are often seen here. <br />",

Fortunately, the spread of these nonnative trees can be controlled. Many other non-native plants that reached the islands during the ranching period, however, are not as benign.<br /> <br /> What was once an island covered with coastal sage-scrub, chaparral, oak scrub, oak woodland, and native grasslands (both annuals and perennial) has given way to nonnative, European grazing grasses and an assortment of weeds, including oats, bromes, fox-tails, thistles, mustard, and fennel. Today, nearly 25 percent of the plant species found on eastern Santa Cruz Island are introduced, providing approximately 75 percent of the ground cover.<br /> <br /> Native plants that developed in isolation often are vulnerable to competition from introduced or alien species. Many of these alien plants have evolved with grazing pressure, whereas the native island plants have not co-existed with grazers or browsers on the islands since the pygmy mammoths, nearly 12,000 years ago. With sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs grazing and browsing on the native vegetation and disturbing the soil, the alien plants spread rapidly, competing with the natives for limited soil and moisture. The nonnatives eventually overwhelm the natives, which often have longer germination and growth cycles.<br /> <br /> The restoration of the island's native vegetation is the goal of the National Park Service. Special focus is being placed on the plants that are endemic to the islands, those occurring only on the Channel Islands and nowhere else in the world. Eight of these occur only on Santa Cruz Island. Nine of these endemic plants are currently listed as endangered species. To ensure the survival of these unique species and encourage the recovery of the island's native vegetation, the National Park Service, along with The Nature Conservancy, is working towards the removal of nonnative species. Over 9,000 sheep were removed from the eastern 6,200 acres of Santa Cruz Island between 1997 and 1999 (Sheep were eliminated by The Nature Conservancy from the rest of the island by the late 1980s.) Pigs were removed from the island by 2007 and weed control is currently underway.<br /> <br /> One needs only to look at the recovery of vegetation, reduction of erosion, and the condition of archeological sites on San Miguel Island since the removal of sheep in the 1950s to envision what may eventually occur on Santa Cruz Island. Described as a \"barren lump of sand\" in the 1930s, San Miguel Island has undergone a remarkable recovery and now is densely vegetated with a diverse assemblage of native plants. In fifty years, we hope to write about the remarkable recovery and return of the native plants of Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> <b>Additional Island Restoration Information</b><br /> Close to the mainland yet worlds apart, Santa Cruz Island is home to plants and animals that are found nowhere else on Earth. Like the Galapagos Islands of South America, the Channel Islands exist in isolation, allowing evolution to proceed independently, fostering the development of 145 endemic, or unique, species. Santa Cruz Island is host to 60 of these endemic species. Some, like the island jay and the Santa Cruz Island silver lotus, are found only on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this isolation has also made these species vulnerable to extinction. The melodic song of the Santa Barbara Island song sparrow and the crimson flower of the Santa Cruz Island monkey flower are no longer heard or seen within the park. The destruction of these species' habitats by nonnative plants and animals has caused their extinction along with eight other rare and unique island species. Once found only on the Channel Islands, they have been lost forever.<br /> <br /> To save 10 other island species, including the island fox, from the brink of extinction as well as to protect more than 2,000 significant archeological sites, the National Park Service and The Nature Conservancy embarked upon a multi-year program to restore Santa Cruz Island. This restoration program is part of the National Park Service mission, as mandated by Congress, to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. As owner of over 70 percent of Santa Cruz Island, it is the mission of The Nature Conservancy to preserve the plants and animals that represent the diversity of life on Earth by protecting the land and waters they need to survive.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service, The Nature Conservancy, and natural and cultural resource experts identified nonnative feral pigs as the most significant disturbance to the island's sensitive resources. Pigs cause major direct impacts to native plant communities, rare plant species, and archeological sites.<br /> <br /> Pig rooting caused massive destruction of native species and resulted in bare ground that was easily eroded and colonized by invasive weeds, especially fennel. This activity was a factor in the decline of nine island plant species listed as threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<br /> <br /> Pig rooting also damaged a large number of archeological sites on the island that are associated with the Chumash native people who occupied the island from at least 9,000 years ago until the early 1800s. The feral pigs rooted three feet deep at a number of sites, disturbing these sacred sites and destroying their archeological value.<br /> <br /> Moreover, feral pigs played a pivotal role in the catastrophic decline of island foxes. Piglets provided a year-round food source for golden eagles, allowing these formerly rare or occasional visitors to expand their range and establish a resident population on the island that then preyed on island foxes. Golden eagle predation placed the fox on the brink of extinction on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands.<br /> <br /> The consensus among numerous experts was that the eradication of feral pigs was the most important action that could be taken to protect and restore Santa Cruz Island. The National Park Service had success restoring other islands in the park through the removal of nonnative animals. The eradication of European rabbits from Santa Barbara Island and sheep and burros from San Miguel Island resulted in tremendous natural recovery. Feral pigs were also eradicated from Santa Rosa Island in a similar program. Pig eradication began on Santa Cruz Island in 2005 and was completed in 2007.<br /> <br /> Other management actions to initiate recovery of the island ecosystem were implemented. Golden eagles were live captured and relocated to northeast California. A captive breeding program for island foxes was established to restore a wild island fox population. The last captive bred island fox was released in 2008. The island fox was delisted as an endangered species in 2016 and has been recognized as one of the quickest and most succesful recoveries of an endangered species. Monitoring of the island fox population continues.<br /> <br /> Also, native bald eagles were reestablished on the island. This predator disappeared in the 1950s due to DDT poisoning, hunting, collecting, and intentional poisoning. Bald eagles eat fish, seabirds, and animal carcasses, not live foxes and are very territorial.<br /> In 2006 this program paid off. For the first time in more than 50 years, two bald eagle chicks were hatched unaided from two separate nests on Santa Cruz Island. Today the island is home to over 30 resident bald eagles.<br /> <br /> This multi-year program to remove golden eagles, reestablish bald eagles, save island foxes, and eradicate pigs has helped restore the balance to the naturally functioning ecosystem on Santa Cruz Island. Once restored, the island will offer one of the last opportunities to experience the nationally significant natural and cultural heritage of coastal southern California.</p>",

Many other nonnative plants that reached the islands during the ranching period, however, are not as benign.<br /> <br /> What was once an island covered with coastal sage-scrub, chaparral, oak scrub, oak woodland, and native grasslands (both annuals and perennial) has given way to nonnative, European grazing grasses and an assortment of weeds, including oats, bromes, fox-tails, thistles, mustard, and fennel. Today, nearly 25 percent of the plant species found on eastern Santa Cruz Island are introduced, providing approximately 75 percent of the ground cover.<br /> <br /> Native plants that developed in isolation often are vulnerable to competition from introduced or alien species. Many of these alien plants have evolved with grazing pressure, whereas the native island plants have not co-existed with grazers or browsers on the islands since the pygmy mammoths, nearly 12,000 years ago. With sheep, cattle, horses, and pigs grazing and browsing on the native vegetation and disturbing the soil, the alien plants spread rapidly, competing with the natives for limited soil and moisture. The nonnatives eventually overwhelm the natives, which often have longer germination and growth cycles.<br /> <br /> The restoration of the island's native vegetation is the goal of the National Park Service. Special focus is being placed on the plants that are endemic to the islands, those occurring only on the Channel Islands and nowhere else in the world. Eight of these occur only on Santa Cruz Island. Nine of these endemic plants are listed as endangered species. To ensure the survival of these unique species and encourage the recovery of the island's native vegetation, the National Park Service, along with The Nature Conservancy, is working towards the removal of nonnative species. Over 9,000 sheep were removed from the eastern 6,200 acres of Santa Cruz Island between 1997 and 1999 (Sheep were eliminated by The Nature Conservancy from the rest of the island by the late 1980s.) Pigs were removed from the island by 2007 and weed control is currently underway.<br /> <br /> In 2011, work began here at Prisoner's Harbor to restore the largest coastal wetland on the Channel Islands. Island ranchers reduced this wetland habitat by more than 50 percent when they filled it with gravel, rerouted and channelized the creek, and planted eucalyptus and other nonnative trees and plants. Restoring the westland included excavating thousands of cubic yards of fill and reshaping the landscape to allow the wetland to flood naturally. In addition, nonnative trees and plants were removed and replaced with native vegetation. Learn more about this wetland restoration project on page 55 and by visiting the signs around the wetland area.<br /> <br /> One needs only to look at the recovery of vegetation, reduction of erosion, and the condition of archeological sites on San Miguel Island since the removal of sheep in the 1950s to envision what may eventually occur on all of Santa Cruz Island. Described as a \"barren lump of sand\" in the 1930s, San Miguel Island has undergone a remarkable recovery and now is densely vegetated with a diverse assemblage of native plants. In fifty years, we hope to write about the remarkable recovery and return of the native plants of Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> <b>Wetland Restoration</b><br /> Coastal wetlands in California are increasingly rare-over 90 percent have been eliminated. Prior to alterations in the late 1800s, the Prisoner's Harbor wetland was the largest wetland on the Channel Islands and provided a variety of habitats (open water, marsh, riparian, and woodland) for native plants and wildlife.<br /> <br /> Ranchers reduced this wetland habitat by more than 50 percent when they filled it with gravel, rerouted and channelized the creek, and planted eucalyptus and other nonnative trees and plants.<br /> The process of reviving the wetland's natural function and ecology on nearly 50 acres of land began in 2011. Thousands of cubic yards of fill were excavated and the landscape was reshaped to allow the wetland to flood naturally. In addition, nonnative trees and plants were removed and replaced with native vegetation.<br /> <br /> The return of the wetland not only increases the diversity and abundance of plants and animals, it also helps protect archeological resources and historic structures from erosion and flooding and provides visitors the opportunity to experience, enjoy, and learn about a natural wetland ecosystem.<br /> <br /> <b>More Restoration Information</b><br /> Close to the mainland yet worlds apart, Santa Cruz Island is home to plants and animals that are found nowhere else on Earth. Like the Galapagos Islands of South America, the Channel Islands exist in isolation, allowing evolution to proceed independently, fostering the development of 145 endemic, or unique, species. Santa Cruz Island is host to 60 of these endemic species. Some, like the island jay and the Santa Cruz Island silver lotus, are found only on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this isolation has also made these species vulnerable to extinction. The melodic song of the Santa Barbara Island song sparrow and the crimson flower of the Santa Cruz Island monkey flower are no longer heard or seen within the park. The destruction of these species' habitats by nonnative plants and animals has caused their extinction along with eight other rare and unique island species. Once found only on the Channel Islands, they have been lost forever.<br /> <br /> To save 10 other island species, including the island fox, from the brink of extinction as well as to protect more than 2,000 significant archeological sites, the National Park Service and The Nature Conservancy embarked upon a multi-year program to restore Santa Cruz Island. This restoration program is part of the National Park Service mission, as mandated by Congress, to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. As owner of over 70 percent of Santa Cruz Island, it is the mission of The Nature Conservancy to preserve the plants and animals that represent the diversity of life on Earth by protecting the land and waters they need to survive.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service, The Nature Conservancy, and natural and cultural resource experts identified nonnative feral pigs as the most significant disturbance to the island's sensitive resources. Pigs cause major direct impacts to native plant communities, rare plant species, and archeological sites.<br /> <br /> Pig rooting caused massive destruction of native species and resulted in bare ground that was easily eroded and colonized by invasive weeds, especially fennel. This activity was a factor in the decline of nine island plant species listed as threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<br /> <br /> Pig rooting also damaged a large number of archeological sites on the island that are associated with the Chumash native people who occupied the island from at least 9,000 years ago until the early 1800s. The feral pigs rooted three feet deep at a number of sites, disturbing these sacred sites and destroying their archeological value.<br /> <br /> Moreover, feral pigs played a pivotal role in the catastrophic decline of island foxes. Piglets provided a year-round food source for golden eagles, allowing these formerly rare or occasional visitors to expand their range and establish a resident population on the island that then preyed on island foxes. Golden eagle predation placed the fox on the brink of extinction on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands.<br /> <br /> The consensus among numerous experts was that the eradication of feral pigs was the most important action that could be taken to protect and restore Santa Cruz Island. The National Park Service had success restoring other islands in the park through the removal of nonnative animals. The eradication of European rabbits from Santa Barbara Island and sheep and burros from San Miguel Island resulted in tremendous natural recovery. Feral pigs were also eradicated from Santa Rosa Island in a similar program. Pig eradication began on Santa Cruz Island in 2005 and was completed in 2007.<br /> <br /> Other management actions to initiate recovery of the island ecosystem were implemented. Golden eagles were live captured and relocated to northeast California. A captive breeding program for island foxes was established to restore a wild island fox population. The last captive bred island fox was released in 2008. The island fox was delisted as an endangered species in 2016 and has been recognized as one of the quickest and most succesful recoveries of an endangered species. Monitoring of the island fox population continues.<br /> <br /> Also, native bald eagles were reestablished on the island. This predator disappeared in the 1950s due to DDT poisoning, hunting, collecting, and intentional poisoning. Bald eagles eat fish, seabirds, and animal carcasses, not live foxes and are very territorial.<br /> In 2006 this program paid off. For the first time in more than 50 years, two bald eagle chicks were hatched unaided from two separate nests on Santa Cruz Island. Today the island is home to over 30 resident bald eagles.<br /> <br /> This multi-year program to remove golden eagles, reestablish bald eagles, save island foxes, and eradicate pigs has helped restore the balance to the naturally functioning ecosystem on Santa Cruz Island. Once restored, the island will offer one of the last opportunities to experience the nationally significant natural and cultural heritage of coastal southern California.</p>",

This is plateau is a marine terrace-an ancient shoreline carved flat by wave action and exposed through changes in sea level and tectonic uplift of the land. Remnants of this and other marine terraces can be found around much of the island's coastline. A future marine terrace (called a wave-cut platform) is being created by wave erosion at the base of the sea cliffs below you.<br /> <br /> The islands' first shoreline was created around five million years ago, when compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in folding and faulting of marine sediments and volcanic rocks (deposited between 15-30 million years ago) and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today. Earthquakes are quite common and all the islands continue to be uplifted.<br /> <br /> Ever since these compressional forces caused the islands to emerge from the sea, they have been separated from the mainland. For decades, scientists assumed that the two were connected by a land bridge, but as bathymetric information (or topography) of the sea floor improved, it revealed that even during periods of lowest sea levels (about 17,000 years ago), the islands still remained isolated by at least four miles of ocean. It is this continuous geographical isolation that has shaped island life.<br /> <br /> <strong>Santarosae</strong><br /> Although never connected to the mainland by a land bridge, the four northern islands were once part of the Pleistocene 'superisland' known as Santarosae, nearly four times as large as the combined areas of the modern Channel Islands. The dark shaded area on the map depicts ancient coast of Santarosae and California around 20,000 years ago when sea level was 100 meters (approximately 350 feet) lower than it is today. As the ice sheets and glaciers melted and the sea level rose, only the highest parts of Santarosae remained as modern islands.<br /> <br /> <b>Caliche Forest</b><br /> The island's isolation has also helped to preserve one of the island's most interesting features-the caliche forest, calcified casts of ancient vegetation that have been exposed in several areas by the eroding sand. This ancient fossilized vegetation is comprised of roots and trunks of a variety of plants, including possibly pines and cypresses that once grew on the island during periods of colder and wetter climates. The most unusual casting that has been found is a huge caliche log that was 2½ feet in diameter and about 30 feet long. Learn more about the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/caliche-forest.htm\">Caliche Forest</a>.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Please note: To visit the caliche forest, you must go with a ranger.

It is derived from very small, single-cell sea plants called diatoms, which are made of silica (silicon dioxide). As these plants die, their silica skeletons settle into the various marine sediments at the bottom of the ocean, often enmasse. It is from this diatomaceous earth that the mineral chert is derived-some of the siliceous diatoms are dissolved by water and then later recrystallized as a dense hard form of rock. Chert fractures like glass and was used by the Chumash Indians for arrowheads, drill bits, and scraping and cutting tools. Chert on the islands has a light brown color owing to small amounts of iron impurities. Other impurities in chert give it a variety of colors that can be found throughout the world. The black variety is called flint and is colored by inclusions of organic matter. Jasper is the name given to the red-colored variety owing to inclusions of an iron oxide, hematite.<br /> <br /> Around five million years ago, compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in folding and faulting of these marine sediments and volcanic rocks (deposited between 15-30 million years ago) and the eventual uplift of the islands.

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Back from the Brink</b><br /> Perhaps by now you have been lucky enough to cross paths with an island fox. They are frequently seen in Cherry Canyon as well as around the campground area. The island fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis</em>) lives on six of the eight Channel Islands-San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, and San Clemente. Each island has its own subspecies, and it is found nowhere else in the world.<br /> <br /> The island fox is the largest native mammal on the Channel Islands, but one of the smallest foxes in the world. It is nearly 20 percent smaller than its closest relative, the mainland gray fox. It's about the size of a house cat, averaging from 12 to 13 inches in height, 23 to 27 inches in length (including tail), and three to six pounds in weight. Similar in appearance to the gray fox, the island fox has a gray back, rufous sides (reddish-brown), and white undersides. There are distinctive black, white, and rufous markings on the face.<br /> <br /> Unlike the nocturnal gray fox, which hunts at night to avoid predators, the island fox is active during daylight hours. As a \"generalist omnivore,\" it eats almost all available foods on the islands, including fruits, vegetation, insects, mice, and crabs.<br /> Mating takes place in February and March, with pupping usually in April or May. Average litter size is two. The adult males play an important role in the raising of young.<br /> <br /> The fossil record for the island fox dates back at least 6,400 years. Since the Channel Islands were never connected to the mainland, scientists currently have two theories on how the fox arrived on the islands. However, due to the scant fossil history, significant questions still remain on the exact mechanism of the initial arrival.<br /> <br /> One theory is that the island fox's ancestor, the gray fox, \"rafted\" to the islands on driftwood, propelled by a storm or currents. During the last ice age, 10-20,000 years ago, ocean levels were up to 400 feet lower than today, narrowing the channel between the islands and mainland to perhaps just four to five miles across and grouping the northern islands together into one large island we call Santarosae. The other theory is that gray foxes were transported to the northern Channel Islands, like they were to the San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands, by American Indians.<br /> <br /> The foxes adapted to their new island home, evolving into a dwarf, or smaller, form of the gray fox. Environmental and ecological factors such as overcrowding, reduction in predators, food limitations, and genetic variations could have contributed to the natural selection for a smaller size. As the climate warmed and ocean levels began to rise, Santarosae was divided into the islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa. Because of a lack of permanent freshwater, the island fox did not inhabit Anacapa Island.<br /> <br /> Between 1994 and 1999, island foxes almost disappeared on San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz Islands. Predation by nonnative golden eagles caused over a 90 percent decline in the population with just 15 foxes left on Santa Rosa, placing the island fox on the brink of extinction. By 2004, the island fox was listed as a federally endangered species.<br /> <br /> A successful recovery effort included captive breeding of island foxes, relocation of golden eagles, and the reestablishment of bald eagles (a natural competitor of the golden eagle). In all, on Santa Rosa Island nearly 100 foxes were released over a six-year period with the final fox set free in 2008. Today, with the population at close to pre-decline numbers, the recovery effort has been recognized as one of the quickest and most successful recoveries of an endangered species.</p>",

Near this location two different rock types converge-Monterey shale and Santa Cruz Island volcanics. To the east is Monterey shale- a white to beige, fine, silica-rich rock made up of sediment washed out to sea from the mainland, reworked volcanic deposits, and shells and skeletons of marine organisms. These particles were laid down in layers underwater 7-16 million years ago.<br /> <br /> To the west (the area you have been hiking on) lies the Santa Cruz Island volcanics, composed primarily of andesite, a dark-colored, fine-grained rock. These rocks reveal a fascinating story about the formation of the Channel Islands. Between 15-30 million years ago, lava flows and volcanoes covered much of the area that now comprises the northern Channel Islands and the western Santa Monica Mountains. In some places the lava accumulated to as much as 10,000 feet thick. A certain type of lava, pillow lava, found in some of these rocks is evidence that much of the volcanic action took place below the surface of the ocean. In other places, oyster shells and other marine fossils are found embedded in the lava. At times, the buildup of lava was great enough that volcanic islands formed. These islands probably were short lived and were eroded to below sea level after the volcanic action ceased.<br /> <br /> The reason for these volcanic eruptions can be found within the magnetic particles in the rocks. As the rocks were cooling, magnetic particles within the rocks would have been set in line with the magnetic poles of the earth. However, magnetic measurements now taken in these same rocks show that they do not line up. In fact, they are off by about 100 degrees, with the oldest rocks showing the largest discrepancy. Geologists believe that when these rocks were formed, the platform on which the islands rest lined up in a north-south direction along the southern coast of California, with San Miguel Island's position lying just offshore from San Diego.<br /> <br /> As the Pacific plate made contact with and began to slide past the North American plate, forming the San Andreas fault, this platform was rotated in a clockwise direction to its present east-west position. As it rotated, the crust of the ocean thinned and the resulting reduction of pressure allowed molten magma to form and ascend from the mantle, erupting under the sea as lava.<br /> <br /> Around 5 million years ago, compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in folding and faulting of these marine sediments and volcanic rocks and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today. Earthquakes are quite common. A major fault that runs through the center of the island has moved nearly 100 feet in the last 30,000 years, and all the islands continue to be uplifted.<br /> <br /> Ever since these compressional forces caused the islands to emerge from the sea, they have been separated from the mainland. For decades, scientists assumed that the two were connected by a landbridge, but as bathymetric information (or topography) of the sea floor improved, it revealed that even during periods of lowest sea levels (about 17,000 years ago), the islands still remained isolated by at least four miles of ocean. It is this continuous geographical isolation that has shaped island life.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>Santarosae</strong> </b><br /> Although never connected to the mainland by a land bridge, the four northern islands were once part of the Pleistocene â€˜superisland' known as Santarosae, nearly four times as large as the combined areas of the modern Channel Islands. The dark shaded area on the map depicts ancient coast of Santarosae and California around 20,000 years ago when sea level was 100 meters (approximately 350 feet) lower than it is today. As the ice sheets and glaciers melted and the sea level rose, only the highest parts of Santarosae remained as modern islands.</p>",

Today, however, research has revealed that Cabrillo was most likely Spanish and probably died on Santa Catalina Island and was most likely buried at sea.<br /> <br /> And although in 1542 Cabrillo was the first European explorer to reach the isolated, windswept shores of San Miguel Island, he was certainly not the first to \"discover\" it. When Cabrillo came ashore there were approximately 100 Chumash living in 2 villages along the island's coast, including a village at Cuyler Harbor. The Chumash and their ancestors had been living on San Miguel almost continuously for nearly 12,000 years.<br /> <br /> Today there are over 600 fragile, relatively undisturbed archeological sites. The oldest one dates back to 11,600 years before the present-some of the oldest evidence of human presence in North America.<br /> <br /> Most of these archeological sites are \"middens,\" a debris pile containing remnants of those societies who came before. These midden sites offer us a window into the Chumash world. By examining these sites, archeologists can piece together a picture of their ancient island life.<br /> <br /> The Island Chumash were skilled crafts people and seafarers with a vast knowledge of the world around them and how to use it for their survival. The predominance of shells and fish bones within the middens reveal that although the islanders exploited terrestrial plant resources, such as acorns and cherries, they subsisted primarily on fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms. They often plied the channel in search of this rich variety of marine food, traveling in tomols (canoes) made of redwood or pine planks caulked with tar from natural seeps.<br /> <br /> The middens also reveal that other items not available in this isolated island environment had to be obtained from villages on the mainland or other islands. One of the principal products manufactured and traded by the islanders were shell beads, which were the currency of trade in the Chumash area and throughout California.<br /> <br /> To produce these beads, chert microdrills were used to bore holes in pieces of olivella snail shells. Chert, a hard, durable silica rock, was found in considerable quantities on Santa Cruz Island. Because Eastern Santa Cruz Island had chert of the proper type and quality needed for tool construction, this location became the center for manufacturing chert microdrills. One particular site contains evidence of the highest density of microdrill production in North America. Other sites on San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz Islands have been labeled by archeologists as \"bead factories,\" with amazing amounts of discarded drills and bead debris.<br /> <br /> San Miguel Island and the other Channel Islands were not isolated enough to protect the Island Chumash from the diseases the Spanish explorers and missionaries brought with them as they began colonizing California in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, the Island Chumash had been devastated by measles and other introduced epidemics, as well as by drought and the disruption of their trade-based economy. The last of the islanders would leave their traditional San Miguel Island home by 1816.<br /> <br /> Although much of the islander's history and way of life has been lost, enough remains to remind us of this unique part of San Miguel Island's past. These midden sites, along with today's descendants of the Island Chumash, remind us how important and sacred these isolated islands are.<br /> <br /> Taking from or disturbing archeological sites or artifacts is a violation of state and federal law. The archeological sites around the Channel Islands are a testament to the importance of the Chumash and other American Indians. Archeological sites are sacred to Chumash peoples today, are protected by federal law, and are a vital nonrenewable scientific resource. Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.<br /> <br /> <b>Ancient Ocean Pathways Lead the Chumash Home</b><br /> In 1976, the Chumash Brotherhood of the Tomol built and paddled the tomol , Helek (Peregrine Falcon), from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island. This historic ocean voyage, the first since the mid-1800s, brought the Chumash back to their island home and sustained their traditional way life.<br /> <br /> Then in 1997, a group of Chumash built the traditional style tomol , 'Elye'wun (Swordfish), the first to be owned by the Chumash in 150 years, and paddled her from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island in 2001, completing the island circle begun by Helek .<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual tomol crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash on San Miguel Island</strong><br /> Historical records have proven that Chumash people made permanent settlements on San Miguel Island, although archeological remains of a village have not been found. One chronicler of the Cabrillo expedition wrote that local natives called the island Ciquimuymu , with two villages named Cico and Nimollollo . Accepted Chumash knowledge notes the island being called Tuqan , with the same name applied to its largest town that was probably located at Cuyler Harbor. A smaller settlement named Niwoyonmi has not been located. The occupants of this island would have experienced harsher climatic conditions than their neighbors on Santa Rosa or Santa Cruz islands; there were few locations that afforded good shelter, although water was available. Archeologists considered that the more intense conditions on the island likely spurred the San Miguel Chumash into extensive trade, especially with people on the mainland east of Goleta. San Miguel's occupants also had strong ties with those of Santa Rosa Island.<br /> <br /> Humans settled San Miguel Island at a very early date, as evidenced by evaluation of archeological materials found at Daisy Cave and other sites along the coastline. Preliminary results from excavations at Daisy Cave indicate a society reliant on the sea for sustenance, and one that had adapted through the development of technologies considered to be the earliest examples known in the New World, including the use of fishhooks and line. Fish bones from Daisy Cave have been dated as up to 11,500 years old, suggesting that the island was occupied as early as its neighbor, Santa Rosa Island; together (the four northern islands were one large island during this early period) these would represent perhaps the oldest known settlement in the region.<br /> <br /> As with the occupants of the other Channel Islands, the combination of pressures from the mainland missions, disruption of their trade and subsistence activities and invasions by European hunters eventually caused the Chumash to vacate the island, reportedly as early as 1816. However, the exact date when the last Chumash occupants of San Miguel Island were removed or left is not known. Fernando Librado, J. P. Harrington's Chumash informant, claimed that many people were killed in a fierce storm at the time of removal from the island, but the story has not been substantiated.<br /> <br /> The Chumash presence on San Miguel Island is today represented in the archeological record. Many important discoveries have been made indicating early habitation and technological innovation. Further investigations will lead to a better understanding of the social structure, subsistence and technology of the island residents and their relationships with mainlanders and other islanders.<br /> <br /> The earliest descriptions of the island Chumash culture and the first historical documentation of contact activities are found in the accounts of the various explorers who traveled in the region between 1542 and 1603. Cabrillo's chronicler Juan Paez de Castro wrote about San Miguel Island: \"Wednesday, the 25th October 1542], they left these islands, that is, the one farthest to windward, which has a very good port inside which no bad effects will be felt in any kind of sea weather. Paez mentioned the Chumash names for the island which they had apparently learned from the friendly occupants. Antonio de Herrera wrote in 1615, \"In the eight days they were at this port they were well treated by the Indians, who go naked and have their faces painted in a checkerboard fashion.\"<br /> <br /> Returning to San Miguel Island after exploring northward on the coast, Cabrillo's party hauled out their<em> frigata San Miguel</em> at Cuyler Harbor to recaulk and repair planking. Either here or on another island the fleet wintered; debate continues whether the long-accepted location of San Miguel Island is accurate. Nevertheless, the Chumash were not as welcoming this time. Francisco de Vargas recalled in 1560: \"With the natives of this island he had some great fights as they came out in a warlike manner. During all the time the fleet was at the Island Capitana the Indians never stopped fighting.\"<br /> <br /> Direct contacts with the island were few after Cabrillo's fateful voyage. VizcaÃ­no had contact with island Chumash in 1602, as his chronicler wrote: \"At dawn the captain's ship was near an island [San Miguel] in the shelter of which it was calm. A canoe came out with two Indians and a small boy, their eyes being painted with antimony. They asked us to go to their land; however, there was such a heavy sea and the island presented so many shoals that we did not dare to go to it, but veered out to sea . . . \"<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> Missionization<br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.sbnature.org/collections-research/anthropology/chumash-life/#:~:text=Chumash%20life%20was%20centered%20around%20their%20town%20and%20village.&text=Some%20villages%20were%20as%20large,near%20the%20Santa%20Barbara%20Channel.\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.santaynezchumash.org/chumash-history\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students </em>.

Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe?

They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop . Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named 'Elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, 'Elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, 'Elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil , now known as Scorpion Valley.

    "bodyText": "<p><b>A Window Into Their World</b><br /> <em>Taking from or disturbing archeological sites or artifacts is a violation of state and federal law. The archeological sites around the Channel Islands are a testament to the importance of the Chumash and other American Indians. Archeological sites are sacred to Chumash peoples today, are protected by federal law, and are a vital nonrenewable scientific resource. Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.</em><br /> <br /> As you reach the overlook you mayl see tiny fragments of broken shell glittering in the soil. How did these shells get up here? Must be the ocean at work—or is it?<br /> <br /> Archeologists identify this as a \"midden,\" a debris pile containing remnants of those societies who came before-the Chumash and their ancestors. This midden is just one of an estimated 3,000 prehistoric sites on Santa Cruz Island, ranging from small temporary camps to larger villages and dating back at least 7,500 years. At the time of European contact (Cabrillo's voyage in 1542), at least 1,200 Chumash lived in 10 villages distributed around the island's coast, including the largest historic island village, Swaxil, located near the Scorpion ranch.<br /> <br /> These midden sites offer us a window into the Chumash world. By examining these sites, archeologists can piece together a picture of their ancient island life.The Chumash were skilled crafts people and seafarers with a vast knowledge of the world around them and how to use it for their survival. The predominance of shells and fish bones within the midden reveal that although the islanders exploited terrestrial plant resources, such as acorns and cherries, they subsisted primarily on fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms. They often plied the channel in search of this rich variety of marine food, traveling in swift tomols (canoes) made of redwood or pine planks caulked with tar from natural seeps.<br /> <br /> The midden also reveals that other items not available in this isolated island environment had to be obtained from villages on the mainland or other islands. One of the principal products manufactured and traded by the islanders was shell beads, which were the currency of trade in the Chumash area and throughout California. Chert microdrills were used to bore holes in pieces of Olivella snail shells to produce these beads. Not only did the islands have an abundance of Olivella shells, but, even more importantly, eastern Santa Cruz Island also had considerable natural deposits of chert, a hard durable silica rock.<br /> <br /> Eastern Santa Cruz Island was the center for manufacturing chert microdrills, as this location had chert of the proper type and quality for such tools within coastal Chumash territory. One particular site contains evidence of the highest density of microdrill production in North America. Other sites on Santa Cruz Island have been labeled by archeologists as \"bead factories,\" with amazing amounts of discarded drills and bead debris.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island was not, unfortunately, isolated enough to protect the Chumash from the diseases the Spanish brought with them as they began colonizing California in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, the island Chumash population had been devastated by measles and other introduced epidemics. The last of the Chumash islanders would leave their traditional island home in 1822.<br /> <br /> Although much has been lost, enough remains to remind us of this unique part of the island's past. These midden sites, along with today's descendants of the island Chumash, give us a window into this ancient world and remind us on another level how important and sacred these isolated islands are.<br /> <br /> <b>Ancient Ocean Pathways Lead the Chumash Home</b><br /> In 1976, the Chumash Brotherhood of the Tomol built and paddled the tomol, Helek (Peregrine Falcon), from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island. This historic ocean voyage, the first since the mid-1800s, brought the Chumash back to their island home and sustained their traditional way life.<br /> <br /> Then in 1997, a group of Chumash built the traditional style tomol , 'Elye'wun (Swordfish), the first to be owned by the Chumash in 150 years, and paddled her from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island in 2001, completing the island circle begun by Helek .<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual tomol crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash on Santa Cruz Island</strong><br /> Archeological investigations indicate that Santa Cruz Island has been occupied for at least 9,000 years. The island was home to the largest population of island Chumash and developed a highly complex society dependent on marine harvest, craft specialization and trade with mainland groups. The Santa Cruz Island Chumash produced shell beads that they used for currency, which formed an important part of the overall Chumash economy. Those living on the east end of the island mined chert from the numerous island outcroppings to make tiny blades for drilling holes to make the shell disc beads. Native villagers had no known contact with outsiders until the 16th and early 17th centuries. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who is credited with the first European exploration of the California coast, observed at least six villages, though he and his crew never stopped at the island. The villages were called Niquipos, Mazul, Xuga, Nitel, Macamo, and Nimitapal . Cabrillo named the island San Lucas, although the Chumash called it Limuw .<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash, from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students</em>.

Remnants of this and older marine terraces can be found around much of the island's coastline. You're actually standing on an older marine terrace right now while a future marine terrace (called a wave-cut platform) is being created by wave erosion at the base of the sea cliffs below you.<br /> <br /> The islands' first shoreline was created around five million years ago, when compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in folding and faulting of marine sediments and volcanic rocks (deposited between 15-30 million years ago) and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today. Earthquakes are quite common. A major fault that runs east-west through the center of Santa Rosa Island has moved nearly 10 miles, and all the islands continue to be uplifted.<br /> <br /> Ever since these compressional forces caused the islands to emerge from the sea, they have been separated from the mainland. For decades, scientists assumed that the two were connected by a land bridge, but as bathymetric information (or topography) of the sea floor improved, it revealed that even during periods of lowest sea levels (about 17,000 years ago), the islands still remained isolated by at least four miles of ocean. It is this continuous geographical isolation that has shaped island life.<br /> <br /> <b>Santarosae</b><br /> Although never connected to the mainland by a land bridge, the four northern islands were once part of the Pleistocene \"super island\" known as Santarosae, nearly four times as large as the combined areas of the modern Channel Islands.

The archeological sites around the Channel Islands are a testament to the importance of the Chumash and other American Indians. Archeological sites are sacred to Chumash peoples today, are protected by federal law, and are a vital nonrenewable scientific resource. Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.</em><br /> <br /> As you reach the overlook, turn around and take in the view of Prisoners Harbor. The second largest historic Chumash village on Santa Cruz Island, Xaxas (hä´ häs), was located at Prisoners Harbor and was occupied for over 3,000 years. It was a major port of trade and a departure point for cross-channel travel. At the time of European contact ((Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo’s voyage in 1542) the village was home to approximately 95-160 Chumash, including many high-ranking families, a powerful chief, and tomo l (plank canoe) owners.<br /> <br /> Xaxas is just one of an estimated 3,000 archeological sites on Santa Cruz Island, ranging from small temporary camps to larger villages and dating back at least 7,500 years. At the time of European contact (Cabrillo's voyage in 1542), at least 1,200 Chumash lived in 10 villages distributed around the island's coast, including the largest historic island village, Swaxil, located near the Scorpion ranch.<br /> <br /> These archeological sites offer us a window into the Chumash world. By examining these sites, archeologists can piece together a picture of their ancient island life.The Chumash were skilled crafts people and seafarers with a vast knowledge of the world around them and how to use it for their survival. The predominance of shells and fish bones within the midden reveal that although the islanders exploited terrestrial plant resources, such as acorns and cherries, they subsisted primarily on fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms. They often plied the channel in search of this rich variety of marine food, traveling in swift tomols (canoes) made of redwood or pine planks caulked with tar from natural seeps.<br /> <br /> The midden also reveals that other items not available in this isolated island environment had to be obtained from villages on the mainland or other islands. One of the principal products manufactured and traded by the islanders was shell beads, which were the currency of trade in the Chumash area and throughout California. Chert microdrills were used to bore holes in pieces of Olivella snail shells to produce these beads. Not only did the islands have an abundance of Olivella shells, but, even more importantly, eastern Santa Cruz Island had considerable natural deposits of chert, a hard durable silica rock.<br /> <br /> Eastern Santa Cruz Island was the center for manufacturing chert microdrills, as this location had chert of the proper type and quality for such tools within coastal Chumash territory. One particular site contains evidence of the highest density of microdrill production in North America. Other sites on Santa Cruz have been labeled by archeologists as \"bead factories,\" with amazing amounts of discarded drills and bead debris.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island was not, unfortunately, isolated enough to protect the Chumash from the diseases the Spanish brought with them as they began colonizing California in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, the island Chumash population had been devastated by measles and other introduced epidemics. The last of the Chumash islanders would leave their traditional island home in 1822.<br /> <br /> Although much has been lost, enough remains to remind us of this unique part of the island's past. These midden sites, along with today's descendants of the island Chumash, give us a window into this ancient world and remind us on another level how important and sacred these isolated islands are.<br /> <br /> <b>Ancient Ocean Pathways Lead the Chumash Home</b><br /> In 1976, the Chumash Brotherhood of the Tomol built and paddled the tomol, Helek (Peregrine Falcon), from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island. This historic ocean voyage, the first since the mid-1800s, brought the Chumash back to their island home and sustained their traditional way life.<br /> <br /> Then in 1997, a group of Chumash built the traditional style tomol , 'Elye'wun (Swordfish), the first to be owned by the Chumash in 150 years, and paddled her from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island in 2001, completing the island circle begun by Helek .<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual tomol crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.<br /> <br /> <br /> <b>Protecting the Islands</b><br /> This is why Channel Islands National Park was established by Congress in 1980-to protect, preserve, and teach us about the islands' unique past and fragile resources, including: the island Chumash and the ranchers who came after them; the native plants that are struggling to recover; the complicated geologic story; and the wide variety of other natural and cultural resources not mentioned in this guide. By understanding these resources and the role isolation plays on these islands, we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and help preserve them for future generations to study and enjoy.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service needs your help as well. We encourage you to explore and learn more about Santa Cruz Island and the rest of the Channel Islands. But don't stop there. In recognizing the importance of these islands, take your awareness to the action level. Make every effort to safeguard-to preserve-the plants, animals, and artifacts found not only within this park, but throughout the world as well.</p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash on Santa Cruz Island</strong><br /> Archeological investigations indicate that Santa Cruz Island has been occupied for at least 9,000 years. The island was home to the largest population of island Chumash and developed a highly complex society dependent on marine harvest, craft specialization and trade with mainland groups. The Santa Cruz Island Chumash produced shell beads that they used for currency, which formed an important part of the overall Chumash economy. Those living on the east end of the island mined chert from the numerous island outcroppings to make tiny blades for drilling holes to make the shell disc beads. Native villagers had no known contact with outsiders until the 16th and early 17th centuries. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who is credited with the first European exploration of the California coast, observed at least six villages, though he and his crew never stopped at the island. The villages were called Niquipos, Mazul, Xuga, Nitel, Macamo, and Nimitapal . Cabrillo named the island San Lucas, although the Chumash called it Limuw.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students</em>. Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop . Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named 'Elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, 'Elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, 'Elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p>",

Supplying such a remote outpost was probably the most considerable of these. The transportation of supplies and stock on and off the island was always an adventure-the distance to the mainland, rough seas, and high expense made it very difficult.<br /> <br /> However, ranchers adapted to the challenges of island life through self-reliance and, as one ranch foreman wrote, \"learning to make do with what [they] had.\" In order to produce income and be as self-sufficient as possible, ranchers developed a diverse operation: they raised barley and potatoes, maintained a vegetable garden, and imported different animals, including sheep, cattle, horses, mules, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and ducks.<br /> <br /> Not all of these enterprises succeeded. Several attempts to grow crops were severely hampered by the island's unrelenting winds and blowing sand. And droughts caused ranchers to remove their livestock, impacting the raising of wool and meat for market.<br /> <br /> Nevertheless, ranching persisted for over 100 years on San Miguel Island and included such colorful characters as George Nidever, a prominent California pioneer, William G. Waters, an eccentric entrepreneur, and the well-publicized family of Herbert Lester.<br /> <br /> Nidever was the first to begin ranching in earnest on the island. In 1850 he brought 45 head of sheep, 17 head of cattle, two hogs, and seven horses and by 1862 the stock had increased to 6,000 sheep, 200 head of cattle, 100 hogs and 32 horses. During the drought in 1863 and 1864 Nidever lost most of his livestock and those that remained denuded much of the island, leaving just sand dunes and drifts.<br /> <br /> Nidever is most noted for finding the \"Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island.\" She was an American Indian woman lived isolated on the remote island for 18 years after her people went to the mainland in 1835. Eighteen years later, Nidever, while collecting seagull eggs on the island, found her and eventually brought her back to Santa Barbara where she delighted the town with her language, songs, and dance. Tragically, however, within a short period of time she became ill and died.<br /> <br /> In the 1880s William Waters acquired the ranching rights to the island and became the longest-lived resident of the island, spending almost thirty years there. He proclaimed himself the \"King of San Miguel,\" stating that the United States had no right to the island and that it was his for the taking. When the government tried to investigate, Waters threatened to shoot any invaders of his nation. According to Waters, only when Grover Cleveland sent a civil request as the head of one nation made to another would he allow government surveyors to access to the island. In reality, what probably convinced Waters to allow the survey party access was the visit to the island by a U.S. Marshal and a contingent of armed men. Waters was eventually denied his request to remain as the self-appointed king and remained a U.S. citizen until his death.<br /> <br /> Waters and his work staff constructed the island's first road from Cuyler Harbor beach to the top of the island via Nidever Canyon, blasting rocks and making a fine but narrow grade for hauling supplies up and products down. The road remains as a hiking trail today and some of the rockwork is still evident.<br /> <br /> Waters and his staff also constructed the island's largest ranch house-the ruins of which lie before you. After sand drifts had buried the old ranch house in upper Nidever Canyon, work began on this new house in 1906. It was constructed out of materials salvaged from shipwrecks around the island - most of it from the lumber schooner the J.M. Coleman which had gone aground inside Point Bennett in 1905. The house was 125 feet long and 16 feet wide with double-walls to withstand the strong winds. A blacksmith shop/harness room, tool shed, well, cistern, and root cellar were also constructed.<br /> <br /> Robert Brooks acquired the island lease from Waters in 1917 and hired his friend from the Army, Herbert Lester, to manage the ranch from 1929-1942. Herbert brought his new bride, Elizabeth, with him to the island, and eventually had two daughters out here, Betsy and Marianne. Herbert and his family enjoyed isolated island life and saw it as an escape \"from the shallowness of civilization and its incessant and inconsequential demands.\"<br /> <br /> San Miguel Island soon came to be known as Lester's Island, and following in Waters' footsteps, he too dubbed himself the \"King of San Miguel.\" He wore a makeshift insignia to designate his rank and their mailbag read \"Kingdom of San Miguel.\"<br /> <br /> Numerous stories are known from the Lester era, due to extensive coverage in the press. In 1940, Life magazine ran an article about the family entitled \"Swiss Family Lester,\" including a story about the kids being educated in the \"tiniest schoolhouse in the world.\"<br /> <br /> In 1937, The Santa Barbara News-Press carried an article headlined, \"Man's Life Saved by Island King.\" The story described how Robert Brooks was working on the reconstruction of the landing down in Cuyler Harbor when he lost his footing, fell and impaled his thigh on a rusted bolt. He was in danger of bleeding to death if he did not receive immediate attention. Lester, relying on his Army experience, quickly sterilized the wound with Lysol and stitched it closed with a curved burlap sack needle and some fishing line. The ranch had no radio at the time so the American flag was hoisted upside down in the hope of attracting a passing vessel. Two weeks later their regular supply ship arrived and transported Brooks to the hospital. The doctors were quite impressed with Lester's work and refused to take any pay as Lester had completed all the treatment necessary and had saved Brooks' life.<br /> <br /> In 1948 island ranching came to an end when the Navy revoked Brooks' lease so that the island could be used as bombing range to train and test for the nation's Cold War defense system.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the ranch house built by Waters and lived in by the Lesters burned down in 1967 when the Navy inadvertently started a fire during weapons testing. All that remains today is what you see before you (piles of rubble, hardware and metal pieces, and two cement-lined excavations considered to be a cistern and a root cellar) and, of course, the stories of survival on a weather-beaten and most isolated island.<br /> <br /> Even today, the isolation of this island still affects visitors and the National Park Service. Public boat trips for park visitors are limited to only a few days each month during the summer and visitors must bring (and carry up to the top of the island) all their own food and water. Park staff must import food and drinking water as well, and have established a solar power system for energy. Like so many who visited and resided here before, we must learn to make do with what we have.<br /> <br /> For more information on ranching history, visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/lester-ranch-site.htm\">Lester Ranch</a>.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Along the trail at the Lester Ranch Site is of rubble and a wooden sign with white lettering that reads,<br /><br />Old Ranch Site<br /><br />The trail divides in tree directions near the site. The trail to the north leads you to the Cabrillo Monument. The trail to the northeast heads to the campground. To the south is the trail to the airplane landing strip and the ranger station.<br /><br />Here, at the Lester Ranch Site, William Waters, who acquired ranching rights in the 1880s, constructed the island's largest ranch house. We are standing amongst its ruins. Work began in 1906. It was constructed out of materials salvaged from shipwrecks around the island. The house was 125 feet long and 16 feet wide with double-walls to withstand the strong winds. A blacksmith shop/harness room, tool shed, well, cistern, and root cellar were also constructed.<br /><br />The house was later lived in by the Lester Family from 1928 - 1942. It burned down in 1967 when the island was being used as a military testing range. <br /><br />All that remains of the house today is a stone and brick rubble, piled in messy mounds. The prominent pile of rubble is the living room chimney. Some of the brick mantelpiece is still visible. Rusty objects, pipes, a shovel, and a white ceramic corner sink lay half buried by the brush, rubble, and soil. <br /><br />Old concrete foundation walls, including those of the root cellar and the cistern, are intact, but cracked and crumbling. The ruins are covered with pale moss. Giant yellow Coreopsis, with thick branches topped with tufts of feathery green leaves and yellow, daisy-like flowers in springtime, and a shaggy, brittle, brown mop of dead leaves in the drier seasons, dried grasses, and low scrub brush grow amid and around the ruins. <br />",

The ever-present western gulls and graceful pelicans often can be sighted soaring along the steep, rugged volcanic cliffs. These cliffs, their numerous caves, and the rest of Santa Cruz Island's coastline and neighboring islets are home to twelve different species of nesting seabirds and shorebirds, including ashy storm-petrels, Brandt's cormorants, Cassin's auklets, pigeon guillemots, and black oystercatchers.<br /> <br /> Santa Cruz Island, the other Channel Islands, and all their associated islets and offshore rocks comprise one of the largest breeding centers on the west coast for sea birds and shore birds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, and the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> This isolation and abundance of food also make the islands an ideal home for seals and sea lions. Watch for California sea lions and harbor seals swimming in the waters around Cavern Point and Potato Harbor. These two species rest and breed throughout Santa Cruz Island's shoreline.<br /> <br /> But even the island's isolation could not protect these and other sea mammals from human predation. As early as the late 1700s fur hunters were exploiting sea otters, elephant seals, fur seals, and California sea lions for their fur, hides, and oil. This slaughter would continue until 1911, when the sea otter finally became the last sea mammal to receive legal protection.<br /> <br /> Isolation also was not able to protect some species of sea birds from human impacts. The gathering of eggs, disturbance of rookeries, and pesticides all have been detrimental. The endangered California brown pelican, for example, once nested on Scorpion Rock, but human disturbance caused the entire colony to be abandoned by the 1930s.<br /> <br /> In addition, during the 1960s, the pesticide DDT nearly caused the pelican to become extinct as a breeding species on the west coast of the United States. In 1970, on neighboring Anacapa Island, only 552 nesting attempts were made with just one chick surviving. On October 13, 1970, the brown pelican was listed as an endangered species.<br /> <br /> Today, the gradual recovery of these species continues as their isolated island home is ensured protection within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of the seabird populations in southern California.<br /> <br /> On Santa Cruz Island, these efforts have focused on closing off public access to certain habitat critical sea caves and restoring seabird habitat on Scorpion and Orizaba Rocks. These rocks are important nesting islets for burrow-nesting seabirds. To restore seabird habitat on these islets, restoration efforts have included removing nonnative vegetation, revegetation with native plants, installation of nest boxes, and closures to protect nesting seabirds.<br /> <br /> <b>Protecting the Islands</b><br /> This is why Channel Islands National Park was established by Congress in 1980-to protect, preserve, and teach us about the islands' unique past and fragile resources, including: the island Chumash and the ranchers who came after them; the native plants that are struggling to recover; the complicated geologic story; the pinnipeds, sea birds and shore birds that depend on these isolated islands for survival; and the wide variety of other natural and cultural resources not mentioned in this trail guide. By understanding these resources and the role isolation plays on these islands, we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and help preserve them for future generations to study and enjoy.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service needs your help as well. We encourage you to explore and learn more about Santa Cruz Island and the rest of the Channel Islands. But don't stop there. In recognizing the importance of these islands, take your awareness to the action level. Make every effort to safeguard-to preserve-the plants, animals, and artifacts found not only within this park, but throughout the world as well.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>More Seabird Information</strong></u></p> <p>The Channel Islands are vital habitat for seabirds and shorebirds, providing essential nesting and feeding grounds for 99% of seabirds in southern California and important wintering areas and stopover points for shorebirds. Thirty shorebird species have recorded, including snowy plovers, willets, wandering tattlers, whimbrels, black turnstones, and sanderlings. Twelve species of seabirds depend on the rich marine resources and the isolation of these offshore islands to provide food and undisturbed nesting grounds safe from predators. The islands host half of the world's population of ashy storm-petrels and western gulls and 80% of the U.S. breeding population of Scripps's murrelets. In addition, the islands are home to the only major breeding population of California brown pelicans in the western U.S.<br /> <br /> The Channel Islands are critically important to seabirds, supporting:<br /> <br /> - the largest breeding colonies of seabirds in southern California<br /> - the only breeding colonies of California brown pelicans in California<br /> - the only protected colonies of California brown pelicans and Scripps's murrelets on the West Coast of the U.S.<br /> - the largest colonies in southern California of Cassin's auklet, western gulls, Scripps's murrelets, rhinoceros auklets, tufted puf fins, ashy storm-petrels, double-crested cormorants, pigeon guillemots, and black storm-petrels<br /> - over 30 years of seabird research<br /> <br /> <strong>Impacts to Seabirds</strong><br /> Seabirds in the park and throughout southern California are impacted by many factors including contaminants, oil spills, invasive species, and changes in the ocean environment. For example, the introduction of DDT, a long-lived pesticide, into the marine environment has severely impacted seabird populations at the islands. Before DDT was banned in the 1970s, California's brown pelican population suffered nearly complete reproductive failure.<br /> <br /> On land, predation and habitat disturbance by invasive species have impacted seabirds. At Anacapa, introduced black rats preyed heavily on seabird eggs and chicks severely depleting populations of Scripps's murrelets. Black rats still prey on seabird populations on San Miguel. At Santa Barbara Island, seabirds were decimated by cats and habitat has been marginalized by years of over grazing by introduced livestock and rabbits. Seabird habitat has also been severely impacted by grazing of non-native animals on Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> <strong>Monitoring and Restoration</strong><br /> Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support seabird populations in southern California. Several of these projects have been funded by the Montrose Settlements Restoration Program (MSRP), a multi-agency government program dedicated to restoring natural resources harmed by DDTs and PCBs released into the environment.

It is genetically and physically different enough from the mainland trees that it is considered a separate subspecies and given its own common name-the Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine.<br /> <br /> As the climate has changed, the pines most likely survived here because of the cool, moist air from the persistent island fog and because of the limited competition from other plants-due to the island's isolation, a smaller number of plant species exist on the island as compared to the mainland.<br /> <br /> The Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine has a very limited range on the island, occurring only in two locations. Along with its limited individual genetic variability, this makes the Torrey pine very vulnerable to extinction.<br /> <br /> To ensure the survival of this unique pine, the park closely monitors its health. So far, all studies have indicated that the pines are doing very well. In 1888, when the Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine was first described, the grove was highly impacted by sheep grazing, and the population was estimated to be about 100 trees. Today that number has grown to over 4,000 trees along with many young trees. Some of the oldest trees are in the heart of the grove and have been dated to approximately 250 years old.<br /> <br /> Please refer to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/torrey-pines.htm\">Torrey Pines</a> for more information on the Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Back from the Brink</b><br /> Perhaps by now you have been lucky enough to cross paths with an island fox. They are frequently seen along the trail as well as around the campground area. The island fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis</em>) lives on six of the eight Channel Islands-San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, and San Clemente. Each island has its own subspecies, and it is found nowhere else in the world.<br /> <br /> The island fox is the largest native mammal on the Channel Islands, but one of the smallest foxes in the world. It is nearly 20 percent smaller than its closest relative, the mainland gray fox. It's about the size of a house cat, averaging from 12 to 13 inches in height, 23 to 27 inches in length (including tail), and three to six pounds in weight. Similar in appearance to the gray fox, the island fox has a gray back, rufous sides (reddish-brown), and white undersides. There are distinctive black, white, and rufous markings on the face.<br /> <br /> Unlike the nocturnal gray fox, which hunts at night to avoid predators, the island fox is active during daylight hours. As a \"generalist omnivore,\" it eats almost all available foods on the islands, including fruits, vegetation, insects, mice, and crabs.<br /> Mating takes place in February and March, with pupping usually in April or May. Average litter size is two. The adult males play an important role in the raising of young.<br /> <br /> The fossil record for the island fox dates back at least 6,400 years. Since the Channel Islands were never connected to the mainland, scientists currently have two theories on how the fox arrived on the islands. However, due to the scant fossil history, significant questions still remain on the exact mechanism of the initial arrival.<br /> <br /> One theory is that the island fox's ancestor, the gray fox, \"rafted\" to the islands on driftwood, propelled by a storm or currents. During the last ice age, 10-20,000 years ago, ocean levels were up to 400 feet lower than today, narrowing the channel between the islands and mainland to perhaps just four to five miles across and grouping the northern islands together into one large island we call Santarosae. The other theory is that gray foxes were transported to the northern Channel Islands, like they were to the San Nicolas and San Clemente Islands, by American Indians.<br /> <br /> The foxes adapted to their new island home, evolving into a dwarf, or smaller, form of the gray fox. Environmental and ecological factors such as overcrowding, reduction in predators, food limitations, and genetic variations could have contributed to the natural selection for a smaller size. As the climate warmed and ocean levels began to rise, Santarosae was divided into the islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa. Because of a lack of permanent freshwater, the island fox did not inhabit Anacapa Island.<br /> <br /> Between 1994 and 1999, island foxes almost disappeared on San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz Islands. Predation by nonnative golden eagles caused over a 90 percent decline in the population with just 15 foxes left on San Miguel Island, placing the island fox on the brink of extinction. By 2004, the island fox was listed as a federally endangered species.<br /> <br /> A successful recovery effort included captive breeding of island foxes, relocation of golden eagles, and the reestablishment of bald eagles (a natural competitor of the golden eagle). In all, on San Miguel Island 62 foxes were released over a six-year period with the final fox set free in 2007. Today, with the population at close to pre-decline numbers, the recovery effort has been recognized as one of the quickest and most successful recoveries of an endangered species.<br /> <br /> <b>Park Protection</b><br /> In 1980, San Miguel Island was designated part of Channel Islands National Park to protect, preserve, and teach us about the island's fragile resources and unique past. By understanding these resources and the role isolation plays on these islands, the National Park Service can preserve them for future generations to study and enjoy.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service needs your help as well. We encourage you to explore and learn more about San Miguel Island and the rest of the Channel Islands-but don't stop there. In recognizing the importance of these islands, take your awareness to the action level. Make every effort to preserve the plants, animals, and artifacts found not only within this park, but throughout the world as well.<br /> <br /> <b>Area Beyond Ranger Station is Closed to Unescorted Travel</b><br /> Due to unexploded ordnance, visitors must be accompanied by a ranger beyond this point. Entering this area without a ranger is a violation of federal law. When not accompanied by a ranger, visitors may only explore Cuyler Harbor beach, Nidever Canyon, the Cabrillo Monument, and the Lester Ranch site.<br /> <br /> To see other parts of the island, such as Point Bennett or the caliche forest, you must go with a ranger. If you are with Island Packers, Channel Islands Aviation, or Truth Aquatics a ranger or volunteer will be available for most of these trips to lead hikes. They will announce time and date during your arrival. If you are a private boater, the San Miguel ranger can be contacted on Marine Radio Channel 16. You can also arrange a hike with the ranger through park headquarters at (805) 658-5730.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "In an open field, next to the airplane landing strip, sits the ranger station. It is an L-shaped wooden building. The building has brown, planked wood siding. If facing the front of the building, four upper, clerestory windows are visible near the peak of the roof. A lower roof overhangs the front of the building, supported by beams and posts, creating a covered walkway. Along that walkway, at ground level, five windows alternate with five doors. Two wooden benches along the exterior wall provide seating. At the bend of the L-shape is a 10-foot by 10-foot structure that sticks up about 10 feet taller than the roof. Sticking up from it are several tall rods and a shallow, concave-shaped satellite dish. An outdoor lamp attached to the side. <br /><br />In front of the station is a picnic table and a flagpole, flying the United States flag. On the left side of the walkway is a low wire frame platform. Mounted on top of this is a large brush, made of stiff blue plastic spikes, used to clean off the bottoms of boots. Further to the left is a small, single-seater wood plank outhouse, with symbols on the door representing both a man and a woman. Several other small storage sheds are nearby.<br /><br />The ranger station information center is through the second door from the right. The room is a large and open space, with high ceilings. It has light wood paneling. Windows line the back wall behind a partially-partitioned area with desks and a table with two chairs. Colorful pictures on the walls display island views. On the left side of the room are two doors leading to equipment and supply closets. To the right is a television, set on the top of a corner cabinet, with a shelf of videos below it.<br />",

Archeological sites are sacred to Chumash peoples today, are protected by federal law, and are a vital nonrenewable scientific resource. Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.</em><br /> <br /> If you were to walk along the edge of the marine terrace below, you would discover tiny fragments of broken shells glittering in the soil and piles of shells falling out from the cliff edge. How did these shells get there? Must be the ocean at work-or is it?<br /> <br /> Archeologists identify this as a \"midden,\" a debris pile containing remnants of those societies who came before-the Chumash and their ancestors. This midden is just one of over 700 archeological sites on Santa Rosa Island that have been discovered, ranging from small temporary camps to larger villages. In fact, the oldest human remains yet discovered in North America came from Santa Rosa Island's remote northwest shoreline and date back over 13,000 years.<br /> <br /> Spanish mission records indicate that up to 1,200 Chumash lived in eight villages distributed around the island's coast, including a village here in Bechers Bay (near the ranch area). On the terrace above Southeast Anchorage there is a prehistoric village site dating back at least 7,500 years ago, where depressions in the ground mark individual thatched hut locations.<br /> <br /> These midden sites offer us a window into the Chumash world. By examining these sites, archeologists can piece together a picture of their ancient island life. The Island Chumash were skilled crafts people and seafarers with a vast knowledge of the world around them and how to use it for their survival. The predominance of shells and fish bones within the midden reveal that although the islanders exploited terrestrial plan resources, such as acorns and cherries, they subsisted primarily on fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms. They often plied the channel in search of this rich variety of marine food, traveling in tomols (canoes) made of redwood or pine planks caulked with tar from natural seeps.<br /> <br /> The midden also reveals that other items not available in this isolated island environment had to be obtained from villages on the mainland or other islands. One of the principal products manufactured and traded by the islanders were shell beads, which were the currency of trade in the Chumash area and throughout California. Chert microdrills were used to bore holes in pieces of olivella snail shells to produce these beads.<br /> <br /> Not only did the islands have an abundance of olivella shells, but also, even more importantly, Santa Cruz Island (which lies to the east) had considerable natural deposits of chert, a hard durable silica rock. Eastern Santa Cruz Island was the center for manufacturing chert microdrills, as this location had chert of the proper type and quality for such tools. One particular site contains evidence of the highest density of microdrill production in North America. Other sites on Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands have been labeled by archeologists as \"bead factories,\" with amazing amounts of discarded drills and bead debris.<br /> <br /> Santa Rosa Island was not isolated enough to protect the Chumash from the diseases the Spanish brought with them as they began colonizing California in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, the island Chumash had been devastated by measles, other introduced epidemics, drought, and the disruption of their trade-based economy. The last of the Chumash islanders would leave their traditional island home in 1822.<br /> <br /> Although much has been lost, enough remains to remind us of this unique part of the island's past. These midden sites, along with today's descendants of the Island Chumash, remind us on another level how important and sacred these isolated islands are.<br /> <br /> <b>Ancient Ocean Pathways Lead the Chumash Home</b><br /> In 1976, the Chumash Brotherhood of the Tomol built and paddled the tomol, Helek (Peregrine Falcon), from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island. This historic ocean voyage, the first since the mid-1800s, brought the Chumash back to their island home and sustained their traditional way life.<br /> <br /> Then in 1997, a group of Chumash built the traditional style tomol, 'Elye'wun (Swordfish), the first to be owned by the Chumash in 150 years, and paddled her from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island in 2001, completing the island circle begun by Helek .<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual tomol crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.<br />  </p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash on Santa Rosa Island</strong><br /> Archaeologist Phil Orr's discovery of human bones in 1959 at Arlington Springs provided evidence of the oldest known habitation of the island. Recently radio-carbon dated to 13,000 years before present, these are among the oldest securely-dated human remains in North America. The age of the Arlington remains and a host of archeological sites on the Channel Islands that date to the late Holocene (10,000-6,500 years before present) indicate an early migration route from the Old World into North America along the West Coast.<br /> <br /> Santa Rosa Island and the other Channel Islands provided rich resources for seafaring peoples to thrive by hunting seabirds, sea mammals, fish and shellfish. With extensive trade networks on the mainland, the island Chumash were able to trade marine resources with mainland peoples for goods they could not harvest or produce on the island. With plentiful food and fresh water, the island supported several villages at the time of European contact.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo sailed up the coast of California in 1542, the first European to visit the Channel Islands, and documented three villages on Santa Rosa Island. A half-century later, Sebastian Rodriguez CermeÃ±o wrote about his interaction with the Chumash on the south side of the island on December 13, 1595, as he sailed southward along the coast: \"...and there came alongside a small boat like a canoe, with two Indians in it rowing. And having arrived at the launch, they brought some eighteen fish and a seal and gave them to us, for which we gave them some pieces of taffeta and cotton cloth in order that they should bring more. They went on shore and returned in the same boat with three Indians and brought nothing, At this island we went fishing with lines and caught some thirty fishlike cabrillas sea bass], which we soon ate on account of our great hunger....On both [Santa Rosa Island and Santa Cruz Island] the land is bare and sterile, although inhabited by Indians, there are no ports or coves in them in which to take shelter.\"<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash, from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students</em>. Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop. Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol. The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek, which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named 'Elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, 'Elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, 'Elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a hillside above the ocean, with a sweeping view of Bechers Bay, a wide curve in the coastline, far below. The hillside is covered with tall grass and scrubby shrubs. At the bottom of the hill is grassy, fairly level plateau that runs parallel to the shore, about one fourth to one half of a mile deep, ending in a steep cliff at the shoreline. Near the shoreline edge of the plateau, hundreds of yards apart, are deep crevices or gullies that run perpendicular to the shoreline, and deepen and widen at the shore. Darker tall bushes or small trees grow in these gullies. At the back of the plateau, where it meets bottom of the inland hills, is a long dirt road. It extends north toward the pier and the ranch complex with some tall trees. In the other direction, it runs southeast toward a hillside covered with a dark green stand of Torrey pines, and, beyond that, Skunk Point, a sandy spit of beach in the far distance. Just below us, on the plateau beyond the dirt road, is a long dirt airplane landing strip. A wire fence with wooden posts, separates this airstrip from the main road. A second dirt road follows the fence line, on the airstrip side. <br /><br />The ocean water near the shore is light turquois blue in color, growing darker blue further from the shore. In the medium turquoise area are patches of brown, underwater kelp forests.",

One nautical mile of water around each island in the park is part of Channel Islands National Park, and six nautical miles around each island form Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.<br /> <br /> Within this ocean realm one often sees harbor seals or other pinnipeds (seals and sea lions). The island's expansive and isolated beaches offer sea lions, harbor seals, and elephant seals an ideal combination of safety from predators and freedom from human disturbance, making the beaches an ideal place to rest, breed, and pup.<br /> <br /> These pinnipeds, along with a variety of other marine species, also depend on the extensive kelp forests found in these cold waters. While urban and industrial development has altered much of the southern California coastal mainland, the isolated islands contain the most undisturbed stretches of coastline in this region, providing some of the best conditions for kelp forests and their inhabitants.<br /> <br /> Kelp is a type of alga that, under ideal conditions (cold, nutrient-rich water), is one of the fastest growing organisms on Earth-it can grow two feet per day. This foliage provides food, shelter, and protection for over 800 different species-from foraging nudibranchs, to grazing snails, to fish seeking refuge, to whales feasting on plankton.<br /> <br /> But we must not forget about ourselves. Not only do we feed upon some of the animals that depend upon the kelp forest, but also those of us who eat ice cream, salad dressing, and even use toothpaste are all using a little bit of seaweed as well. Kelp is harvested for a natural ingredient called algin, which is used as a suspending, stabilizing, emulsifying, gel-producing, and film-forming additive in more than 70 commercial products. In addition, marine algae and plants such as kelp provide Earth with 80 percent of its oxygen.<br /> <br /> Despite these benefits, the kelp forest and its inhabitants are in jeopardy. Pollution and over-harvesting of marine species have altered the kelp forest ecosystem. Kelp forests in southern California today cover less than half the area they covered at the turn of the 20th century.<br /> <br /> However, with the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), improved pollution controls, fishing regulations, research, and public education, some of these problems have been corrected.<br /> <br /> Within the park and sanctuary a network of MPAs provides a refuge for sea life and opportunities for recreation, education, and science. In 11 marine reserves (including two on Santa Rosa Island-around Carrington and Skunk Points), recreational fishing and commercial harvesting are prohibited; limited fishing and harvesting are allowed in two marine conservation areas. The MPAs total 318 square miles, the largest such network off the continental United States and part of a larger effort throughout the world to conserve natural, historic, and cultural marine resources.<br /> <br /> <b>Protecting the Islands</b><br /> In 1980 Congress established Channel Islands National Park to protect, preserve, and teach us about the islands' fragile resources and unique past, including the Island Chumash and those who came after them, the island fox that recovered from the brink of extinction, the restoration of the islands' native plants, the complicated geologic story, the Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine that occurs nowhere else on Earth, the kelp forest and its inhabitants that depend on these isolated islands for survival, and the wide variety of other natural and cultural resources not mentioned in this trail guide. By understanding these resources and the role isolation plays on these islands, we can help preserve them for future generations to study and enjoy.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service needs your help as well. We encourage you to explore and learn more about Santa Rosa Island and the rest of the Channel Islands. But don't stop there. In recognizing the importance of these islands, take your awareness to the action level. Make every effort to safeguard-to preserve-the plants, animals, and artifacts found not only within this park,</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a long curve of sandy beach, at the bottom of Water Canyon, near the middle of Bechers Bay. At your feet, scattered across the sand are tiny broken shells, driftwood, a few small rounded rocks, and broken pieces of kelp stalks and leaves.<br /><br />The ocean water near the shore is light turquois blue in color, growing darker blue further from the shore. <br /><br />On the inland side, the beach rises up into shallow, sandy dunes, mounds covered with small green plants. These curve up to meet the base of rock cliffs that tower almost 50 feet above the beach. Tall grass grows at the top of those cliffs.<br /><br />The cliffs follow the curve of Bechers Bay. If you are facing the ocean, to the left, or north, in the distance, is the wooden pier. It is a long narrow platform, supported of tall upright poles, extending a couple of hundred yards out into the ocean. <br /><br />To the right, or southeast, just past the top of the cliff, is a hillside covered with a dark green stand of Torrey pines. Beyond that is Skunk Point, a sandy spit of beach in the far distance. <br />",

J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

It is located .4 miles off the island's southwest coast.<br /> <br /> It is named by the Geographic Board for the ship, <em>Sutil</em>, of the Dionisio AlcalÃ¡ Galiano (1760-1805) Spanish expedition of 1792. Galiano was sent by the viceroy of New Spain, Juan Vicente de Güemes, Count of Revillagigedo to explore and claim the Pacific coast of North America north of California. He sailed in the schooners <em>Sutil</em> and <em>Mexican</em> a from San Blas, Mexico. This expedition went as far as the Strait of Georgia between Victoria and the British Columbia mainland, looking for the Northwest Passage. Afterwards Alcalá Galiano wrote an account in which he claimed no such passage existed. It is located 0.4 miles southwest of Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> The island is an important wildlife habitat, particularly for seabirds. On August 24, 2019, seabird biologists with Channel Islands National Park and the California Institute for Environmental Studies confirmed the first record of a brown booby chick from an active nest on Sutil Rock off Santa Barbara Island.<br /> <br /> This successful nest signifies a northward expansion of their known breeding range in the Gulf of California and along the Pacific coast of Mexico. The closest current breeding colony is located on the Coronado Islands off Northern Baja California, Mexico.<br /> <br /> Brown boobies, once considered a rare visitor to the Channel Islands, were observed only 16 times in the 30 years between 1984 and 2014. They were first seen roosting in small numbers on Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands in 2013. There was a dramatic rise in their numbers in 2015 with over 170 individuals observed at Santa Barbara Island. Since that time, they have been seen consistently on both islands with fewer sightings occurring on Anacapa Island.<br /> <br /> \"Seabirds rely upon the rich marine resources and the isolation of these offshore islands to provide food and undisturbed nesting grounds safe from predators,\" said Channel Islands National Park Superintendent Ethan McKinley. \"With this successful brown booby nest, there are now 14 breeding seabirds that rely upon this vital habitat.\"<br /> <br /> Brown boobies, generally considered a tropical or subtropical bird, appear to have been extending their range northward since the 1990s when they first migrated to the Coronado Islands of Baja California from the Gulf of California and Pacific coast of Mexico. This expansion of their range coincides with shifts in oceanic conditions with warmer waters and changes in prey availability.<br /> <br /> An impressive seabird species, brown boobies are known for making spectacular plunge dives from heights of up to 50 feet to feed on surface fish. They nest on islands, lay their eggs on the bare ground, and make nests with sticks, rocks, bones, and vegetation to protect them. They winter far out to sea.<br /> <br /> Worldwide, brown booby populations have declined due to habitat degradation on islands where introduced predators have reduced their nesting success.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Due to their relative isolation and protection, the tidepools in Channel Islands National Park are some of the best within southern California. Anemones, sea stars, urchins, limpets, periwinkles, chitons, barnacles, mussels, and many other beautiful species can be seen at numerous pristine tidepool sites. The most accessible sites include: Frenchy's Cove on Anacapa Island; Smuggler's Cove on Santa Cruz Island; Becher's Bay at the pier, Southeast Anchorage, East Point on Santa Rosa Island; eastern end of Cuyler Harbor on San Miguel Island. Check with the park's boat and plane concessionaires for trips to these tidepooling areas.</p> <p>The area between the land and the sea is not distinct, but is a zone of transition. This area may be covered with water during high tide or exposed to sunlight during low tide. Life in this intertidal region must be the hardiest within the marine environment-able to withstand hours of exposure and the incessant pounding of the energy-filled surf.</p> <p>Intertidal life has adapted to the sea and the land. When looking at a tidepool area, notice how plants and animals may be found in certain areas and not in others. Those living in the upper splash zone are tolerant to sunlight, heat, and water loss and have either a means to \"shelter\" themselves or the ability to move into an area of greater moisture. An animal with a tightly closed shell or a shell firmly attached to rock will hold water within, so that it does not require water surrounding it at all times. Animals found in rock crevices and submerged pools usually require more moisture to prevent them from drying out.</p> <p>How an animal feeds often depends on its ability to move. An animal that moves about is able to search for its food. Some graze the rocks for algae, while others feed on settled debris. An animal that remains stationary feeds on food particles suspended within water.</p> <p>Because space is a limiting factor, there is competition between organisms. Many animals and plants are found in a small area, some may live on each other, or use an old shell as a surface on which to live. This is one important reason why collecting is not permitted-you may be taking away a home.</p> <p>Although hardy against the forces of nature, the plants and animals of the intertidal zone cannot entirely endure the impact of humans. Since individuals interact with one another, minute changes in the area could disrupt the entire community. While exploring, please keep in mind these tidepool tips:</p> <ul> <li>Watch your step! The rocks can be very slippery and there may be small animals on the rocks.</li> <li>Keep an eye on the waves. The surge can sneak up on you.</li> <li>Take your time and look carefully. Tidepool organisms are often very small and camouflaged.</li> <li>Do not collect anything! Not only is it unlawful, but if animals and shells are taken, there may be nothing left for others to enjoy.</li> <li>If you pick up an animal to observe, please place it back where it was found. That particular spot is its home territory.</li> <li>Although you may not know the animals by name, through simple observation a great deal of information can be learned. Consider, for example, what keeps it from drying out? Why doesn't it get swept out to sea? Does it search for food or wait for food to come to it?</li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Torrey pine is the rarest native pine in the United States and, possibly, the rarest pine in the world. It only grows naturally in two places. One is here on Santa Rosa Island and the other is near San Diego. Scientists think that it never was a very abundant pine, probably always needing to be near the coast, but they do believe that in the past it occurred in more places along the coast. Unfortunately, specific places cannot be identified because of lack of fossil records. Furthermore, at the moment, it is not known which Torrey pine forest (Santa Rosa Island or San Diego) is the oldest.<br /> <br /> There is much debate on how and when the Torrey pine arrived on Santa Rosa Island. To date, researchers have yet to agree on an arrival date. Some have suggested several million years ago while others have suggested between 5,000 and 43,000 years ago. The seeds were most likely transported from the mainland by birds, possibly jays that are known to transport seeds a long distance, or possibly by cones floating across the ocean. The other possible explanation is that the Chumash or their ancestors brought them over. The Chumash were excellent seamen and traders and they did use Torrey pines. If that is true, the trees couldn't be much more than 13,000 years old (since this is the oldest human date from the islands). However, until it can be established by either fossil evidence or genetic variation that the trees were here before the Chumash, this possibility cannot be discounted.<br /> <br /> Thousands of years of isolation on Santa Rosa made this island version of the Torrey pine distinct. It is genetically different enough from the mainland trees that it is considered a separate subspecies and given its own common name-the Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine (subspecies differ from each other in various ways but if crossed will produce fertile offspring). This island tree grows shorter, broader, and bushier than the mainland one. Also, its bark is thicker and scalier and its cones are rounder. They both have needles in clusters of five, but the pines on the island have blue-gray needles while those on the mainland are gray.<br /> <br /> Most scientists agree that the climate changed to a hotter and drier environment between 3,000 and 8,000 years ago, which may have caused a decrease in the number of Torrey pine forests, particularly on the mainland. The pines most likely survived here because of the cool, moist air from the persistent island fog and because of the limited competition from other plants-due to the island's isolation, a smaller number of plant species exist on the island as compared to the mainland.<br /> <br /> The Santa Rosa Island Torrey pine has a very limited range on the island. It only occurs on two sandstone bluffs in the northeast corner of the island. One is on the ridge overlooking Bechers Bay and the other is Box Canyon, one canyon over to the south. This limited range along with its limited individual genetic variability-all these trees are basically identical to each other-makes the Torrey pine very vulnerable to extinction. Species with little or no genetic variability cannot respond as satisfactorily to environmental changes-drought, a new disease, or insect pests-as can species with a more diverse gene pool.<br /> <br /> This is why the park closely monitors the health of the Torrey pines. And so far all studies have indicated that the pines are doing very well. In 1888, when the island Torrey pine was first described, the population of the grove was heavily impacted by sheep and was estimated to be about 100 mature, reproductive trees. With the removal of the sheep by 1910, the grove expanded to 1,500 trees by the mid-1990s and by 2015, the population increased to 3,500 trees and over 8,500 seedlings. Some of the oldest trees are in the heart of the grove and have been dated to over 250 years old.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing high on a rocky hillside, overlooking a wide ocean bay, surrounded by tall Torrey pine trees. In the distance, the coastline curves out to Carrington Point. In the middle of that curve are a cluster of buildings at the ranch complex, and a wooden pier that stretches far out into the ocean. <br /><br />The Torrey pines have tall thin dark brown trunks have bark with a cracked surface, like a cracked pie crust or alligator skin. Overhead, the tips of branches end in clusters of long spikey dark-green needles-up to about 10 inches long. Growing on the branches are brown oval -shaped pine cones, made of dozens of splayed open seed scales with gaps in between them.<br /><br />The rocky, bumpy ground surface below the pines is blanketed with brown pine needles; a few twisted, dead pine branches; and fallen pine cones. Some pine cones have rolled downhill, and collected at the bottom of gullies. <br /><br />Below the trees are a few smaller plants: island manzanita bushes, with red branches and green oval leaves with bunches of berries that are green, yellow, or red, depending on the season. Scrub oaks, with small bush-like trees with grey bark, small olive green, oval shaped leaves, and, in season, acorns shaped like a smooth cone, with a knit beanie hat on top. Monkey flower, with green oval leaves and small red flowers. <br /><br />Underfoot, the rocky ground surface is covered with lichen, a pale green crust-like growth, that looks like blotches of spray paint. <br /><br />Above the trees, you can often hear the screech of red tail hawks. One may also find Allen's hummingbirds-tiny, 3 inch long birds with fast fluttering wings, green backs, and purple throats. Sometimes you also find the colorful San Clemente spotted towhee, a large sparrow with a white-spotted black back and a black rump. Its breast is black, its belly white, and its sides are reddish brown. It has a black head with red eyes. Its wings are black with white spots and its long tail is black with white corners.<br /><br />As one heads south from the Torrey pine forest, a grassy hillside drops down toward low rolling hills, with sandy Skunk Point, in the distance.<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>View one of the rarest pines in the world, the Torrey pine. Torrey pines occur naturally in only two locations in the world—on the cool, fog drenched northeastern slopes of Becher’s Bay and just north of San Diego. The easier, moderate route allows visitors to view the pines along the flat Coastal Road. The strenuous route follows the loop trail to the top of the grove, providing spectacular views. For the best route take the loop trail up the western edge of the grove, along the top, and down the steep, eastern side of the grove. For an easier, more gradual descent, follow the road down to Southeast Anchorage.<br /> <br /> <strong>Distance:</strong> 5 miles to base of pines; 7.5 miles via the loop trail (both are round trip from pier)<br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate to strenuous</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing high on a rocky hillside, overlooking a wide ocean bay, surrounded by tall Torrey pine trees. In the distance, the coastline curves out to Carrington Point. In the middle of that curve are a cluster of buildings at the ranch complex, and a wooden pier that stretches far out into the ocean. The Torrey pines have tall thin dark brown trunks have bark with a cracked surface, like a cracked pie crust or alligator skin. Overhead, the tips of branches end in clusters of long spikey dark-green needles—up to about 10 inches long. Growing on the branches are brown oval -shaped pine cones, made of dozens of splayed open seed scales with gaps in between them. The rocky, bumpy ground surface below the pines is blanketed with brown pine needles; a few twisted, dead pine branches; and fallen pine cones. Some pine cones have rolled downhill, and collected at the bottom of gullies. Below the trees are a few smaller plants: island manzanita bushes, with red branches and green oval leaves with bunches of berries that are green, yellow, or red, depending on the season. Scrub oaks, with small bush-like trees with grey bark, small olive green, oval shaped leaves, and, in season, acorns shaped like a smooth cone, with a knit beanie hat on top. Monkey flower, with green oval leaves and small red flowers. Underfoot, the rocky ground surface is covered with lichen, a pale green crust-like growth, that looks like blotches of spray paint. Above the trees, you can often hear the screech of red tail hawks. One may also find Allen’s hummingbirds—tiny, 3 inch long birds with fast fluttering wings, green backs, and purple throats. Sometimes you also find the colorful San Clemente spotted towhee, a large sparrow with a white-spotted black back and a black rump. Its breast is black, its belly white, and its sides are reddish brown. It has a black head with red eyes. Its wings are black with white spots and its long tail is black with white corners. As one heads south from the Torrey pine forest, a grassy hillside drops down toward low rolling hills, with sandy Skunk Point, in the distance.",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Corynorhinus townsendii</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The Townsend's big-eared bat is known for the unique habit of forming maternity roosts during breeding season. The maternity roosts are established in areas with ideal temperature and humidity, and are easily disturbed; this has made the species somewhat rare. At the park, the species occurs only on Santa Cruz Island, where it forms an annual maternity roost in a historic building in the Scorpion Ranch area. The Santa Cruz big-eared bat colony is one of only a handful known in the state of California.</p> <p>Quick and Cool Facts</p> <ul> <li>A Townsend's big-eared bat's average lifespan is 16 years; bats may live up to 30 years.</li> <li>Highly maneuverable flyer; capable of flying at slow hovering speeds.</li> <li>Large ears funnel sound into ear canal, and may also provide lift during flight and assist with temperature regulation.</li> <li>Townsend's big-eared bats are very sedentary, with movement by females during the nursing season rarely exceeding 15 km., and movement at other times usually being less than 50 km.</li> <li>When it's roosting or hibernating, Townsend's big-eared bat curls up its long ears so they look like ram's horns.</li> <li>When flying they can rapidly extend or contract their ears. When flying with their ears extended the ears point forward and are nearly parallel to their body.</li> <li>They do not tuck themselves into cracks and crevices like many bat species do, but prefer open roosting areas in large rooms with their fur erect to provide maximum insulation and with their ears coiled back.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Townsend's big-eared bats, previously called lump-nosed bats, are a medium-sized bat with very long ears. Their fur is pale gray or brown above and buff colored on the underside. This bat's ears are enormous, reaching a length of 38 mm. When the ears are laid back they extend to the middle of its body. The face is marked by two large glandular lumps on either side of its nose.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The Townsend's big-eared bat occurs throughout the west and is distributed from the southern portion of British Columbia south along the Pacific coast to central Mexico and east into the Great Plains, with isolated populations occurring in the central and eastern United States.</p> <p>On the Channel Islands, big-eared bats are found only on Santa Cruz Island. The species was first observed in 1939 on Santa Cruz Island in a historic 2-story ranch house at Prisoner's Harbor, which hosted a large maternity colony of over 300 individuals. Subsequent studies showed that the population resided in the same area until 1974, when the structure was removed. From 1974 to 1988, no other Townsend's Big-eared Bats were seen on Santa Cruz Island, before Dr. Pat Brown of UCLA, in 1991, was made aware of a colony of Townsend's roosting in the bakery room of the Scorpion adobe building. Presently, a large maternity colony continues to use the building and, occasionally, the rock caves in the Scorpion area. According to the 1994 Department of Fish and Game report, the Scorpion roost is one of only two or three coastal maternity colonies known to exist south of Pt. Conception.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Big-eared bats have been reported in a wide variety of habitat types ranging from sea level to 3,300 meters. Habitat associations include: coniferous forests, mixed meso-phytic forests, deserts, native prairies, riparian communities, active agricultural areas, and coastal habitat types. Distribution is strongly correlated with the availability of caves and cave-like roosting habitat, with population centers occurring in areas dominated by exposed, cavity forming rock and/or historic mining districts. They prefer open roosting areas in large rooms and do not tuck themselves into cracks and crevices like many bat species do.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Radio-tracking has shown that the Scorpion bats forage up to 5 kilometers away to feed on moths and other insects among the native oak and ironwood forest on the north-facing slopes of Scorpion Canyon, returning to the roost each morning. In contrast to other southwest bats, due to its relatively poor urine concentrating ability, it drinks water.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Winter hibernation colonies are comprised of males and females and range in size from a few individuals to several hundred bats. If undisturbed, colonies will occupy the same site indefinitely.</p> <p>In the summer, the females form a nesting roost. Males are solitary during the maternity periods. The maternity colonies consist of one or more small clusters, which rarely exceed 100 bats. Females are alert and active in the maternity roosts and prefer dark places for their roosts. These colonies form between March and June (depending on climate), with pups born between May and July. Maternity colonies choose sites that have warm, stable temperatures for pup rearing. Female bats usually only have one young a year. The newborns range in weight from 2.1-2.7 grams. There is a strong maternal bond and the young bats squawk when the mother is away. The young bats, however, grow quickly, being able to fly within three weeks. After two months, many of the young bats have left the nursery roosts, with male bats leaving before female. In their first year, male bats are almost certainly incapable of breeding while female bats are able to reproduce at the age of four months.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Historically, this species has declined due to direct killing by people and because of destruction or disturbance of roost sites. These animals are sensitive to light and movement so if they are disturbed during the day, they awake and their ears begin to move as they try to identify the intruder. If the disturbance occurs for more than a few seconds, the entire group takes flight and the roost may be abandoned.</p> <p>A study sponsored by the California Department of Fish and Game in the late 1980's documented a population decline of 40-60% in the past 30 years. Only about half of the maternity colonies known to exist in California prior to 1980 were active by 1991, resulting in an estimated 54% decline of adult females. Only three maternity colonies increased in size during the period, and all three are located in National Park areas (Point Reyes National Park, Lava Beds National Monument, and Pinnacles National Monument). Of the 23 roosts that are no longer available to bats, 9 (mostly buildings) have been demolished, 4 (all buildings) have burned, 4 (all buildings) have been renovated in such a way that bats were excluded, and 6 (including buildings, caves, mines, and a water diversion tunnel) have had the entrance closed.</p> <p>Consequently, for this species to exist, it is essential that human disturbance is minimized and the habitat preserved.</p> <p>Human intervention may have helped conserved the population on the west coast of North America, because man-made structures provide a shelter for big-eared bats.1 Channel Islands National Park staff continues with a program of monitoring and surveying this species to ensure its well-being.</p> <p>In 2008, the ICUN listed this species as Least Concern because of its wide distribution, presumed large population, the occurrence in a number of protected areas and because it wasis unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category. However, today the Townsend's Big-eared Bat, is state-listed as an Endangered species in Washington, a Sensitive species in Oregon, and as a Species of Special Concern in Texas, Montana and California, and they are on the Blue List in British Columbia.</p> <p>Additional Information</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/okanagan/esd/atlas/species/townsends.html\">www.env.gov.bc.ca/okanagan/esd/atlas/species/townsends.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.desertmuseum.org/kids/bats/townsends.php\">www.desertmuseum.org/kids/bats/townsends.php</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://sibr.com/mammals/M037.html\">http://sibr.com/mammals/M037.html</a></li> <li>California Wildlife Habitat Relationship System, California Department of Fish & Game, California Interagency Wildlife Task Group, M037, Updated by CWHR Program Staff, May 2000</li> <li><a href=\"http://relicensing.pcwa.net/documents/Library/PCWA-L%20549.pdfpg.2\">http://relicensing.pcwa.net/documents/Library/PCWA-L%20549.pdfpg.2</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li>British Colombia, Ministry of Environment, Land and Parks. 1998. <em>Wildlife at Risk: Townsend's Big-eared Ba</em>t.

    "bodyText": "<p>Vail & Vickers, as well as their neighbors on the Channel Islands, operated unique livestock businesses wherein their location required a transportation system entirely relying on boats and, to a smaller extent, aircraft. From the time of Alpheus Thompson shipping cattle and sheep on a small schooner to the final shipment of cattle off Santa Rosa Island, boats have played a key role in ranch operations. Santa Rosa Island owners almost always had a boat specifically for transporting livestock, supplies, and personnel. Few other places in the Americas operated this way, and the Vail & Vickers ranch was among the last.<br /> <br /> <b><em>Mildred E</em>., 1901-1909</b><br /> The wooden, two-masted Mildred E. was built in 1884 in Meteghan, Nova Scotia, and was registered by Walter L. Vail and J. V. Vickers in December 10, 1901. Vail & Vickers used <em>Mildred E.</em> in island service for a short time. In 1903 the firm had the Santa Rosa Island constructed expressly for livestock transport, leaving Mildred E. to few duties. Proving unsatisfactory to the needs of the company, Vail & Vickers abandoned <em>Mildred E</em>. in 1909, claiming she was unfit for service.<br /> <br /> <b><em>Santa Rosa Island</em>, 1903-1915</b><br /> Some confusion has existed as to the <em>Santa Rosa</em> and the <em>Santa Rosa Island</em>. They were actually two different vessels. A. P. More's sailing schooner Santa Rosa wrecked in San Miguel Island's Cuyler Harbor in November 1899. Vail & Vickers contracted construction of the 87-foot, gasoline schooner <em>Santa Rosa Island</em> in Wilmington, California in 1903. Vail & Vickers put her to work hauling sheep off the island by July of 1903.<br /> <br /> After the ranch owners obtained the <em>Vaquero</em>, three of Walter Vail's sons-N. R., Ed and Banning-took the Santa Rosa Island on a four-month voyage to Mexico in 1915, leaving San Pedro for Cabo San Lucas, the Gulf of California, and Mazatlán. They and their friends, with a hired captain and cook, spent their time \"fishing, hunting, trading with the locals of coastal fishing villages, and socializing with Mazatlán's upper society of the day.\" Apparently the boat was sold shortly after the trip to Mexico and entered service in the South Pacific.<br /> <br /> <em><b>Onward</b></em><br /> Smaller boats served the island's smaller needs for transportation to and from Santa Barbara for supplies and provisions. Vail & Vickers' power boat <em>Tortuga</em> operated around Santa Rosa Island in the early 1910s, hauling supplies and mail for various camps on the island. Little else is known of it or of <em>Colleen</em>, another small vessel on the island. Vail & Vickers purchased the 64.5 feet long motor launch Onward for $7,737 in 1921 to perform errands around the island and channel in the 1920s and 30s. C.W. Smith, ranch foreman, used her for various tasks, including retrieving lumber from a wreck that came in handy for building corrals. Smith reportedly took <em>Onward</em> to Santa Barbara after the 1925 earthquake to check on damage there. The Vails kept her on a mooring at Bechers Bay. Vail & Vickers sold <em>Onward</em> in August 1942 to the DeLuxe Water Taxi Company, hoping to stave off the potential military seizure of the main island boat <em>Vaquero</em>, reasoning that the government would not take their only vessel; the attempt failed.<br /> <br /> <b><em>Vaquero</em>, 1913-1943</b><br /> To bring consistency and reliability to the island cattle transportation challenges, Vail & Vickers commissioned a new cattle boat in 1913 and christened her <em>Vaquero</em>. She was not the first <em>Vaquero</em> to operate in southern California waters. Harris Newmark recalled that a steamer <em>Vaquero</em> offered excursions from San Pedro to Santa Catalina in August of 1871. Vail & Vickers registered <em>Vaquero</em> in 1914.<br /> <br /> William Muller built <em>Vaquero</em> as a sturdy workhorse of a ship. She measured 121 feet and was \"beamy,\" or wide, in order to handle the cattle cargo and of a shallow draft to allow navigation close to shore.<br /> <br /> Rigged with two masts, she had six staterooms to sleep 18, a galley and dining room, and two toilets in the single deckhouse. Three generators supplied electricity for lights, an icebox, and a 25-watt radiophone. Two fuel tanks held 2,000 gallons each, and two water tanks stored a total of 1,800 gallons. She was originally powered by a gasoline engine, which was replaced in 1928 with a Western Enterprise six-cylinder diesel.<br /> <br /> The holds, divided into five cattle pens, had a capacity of about 10,000 cubic feet, or 200 head of cattle, which constituted seven carloads (rail cars) on the mainland. The deck, equipped with 3.5-foot gunnels topped with two-by-sixes to hold the cattle in, was divided into ten pens. A ramp would be deployed to load and unload the cattle to and from the deck and hold.<br /> <br /> The Vails docked <em>Vaquero</em> at San Pedro for many years, loading and unloading cattle at nearby Wilmington. The 115-mile trip to the island from Wilmington took at least twelve hours, and in the worst weather up to 23 hours, providing somewhat of an adventure when the Vail family came out to the island many times during the year. Margaret Vail Woolley recalled the family's first trip to the island on the Vaquero around 1928:<br /> <br /> \"My mother decided to trick us out in little yachtsman's uniforms. So she did-little white pants, little hats. We were so cute . . . and cold and filthy but over we went and slept. There were cabins on the Vaquero then . . . we could get our whole family in the rear cabin by doubling up considerably.\"<br /> <br /> On a typical weekend trip to Santa Rosa Island, the family would board Vaquero after school on Friday and sleep aboard in the staterooms during the overnight trip. A cook made hot meals in the cozy galley, a popular spot to stay warm during winter voyages. After spending Saturday and Sunday on the island, the family departed Sunday night, arriving in time for Monday morning school. During the 1930s, Russ Vail recalled, \"the vessel was used a little more easily in those days,\" with cheaper fuel and labor costs, so the Vail family traveled to and from the island on the boat regularly.<br /> <br /> V<em>aquero</em> not only shipped the supplies and cattle for Santa Rosa Island, but also contracted with the other islands' operators. In 1937 Vaquero transported much of Edwin Stanton's new sheep to Santa Cruz Island and regularly transported Robert Brooks' sheep to and from San Miguel Island and Ed Vail's sheep to and from San Nicolas Island. The Vails hired out <em>Vaquero</em> for other purposes in the off-season, including hauling supplies to southern California ports, as a fishing barge off Santa Monica, for wreck salvage, and, at one point in the 1930s, acting as a mother ship for a whaling operation. Vaquero captain Claude Morris recalled some of the memorable off-season voyages:<br /> <br /> \"The Hollywood studios used the boat for many movies. One early one was \"Laurel and Hardy Go to Sea.\" Other trips were hauling turtles from Turtle Bay in Mexico, tuna from San Diego, beans from Port Hueneme . . . . Catalina Island had an over population of rattlesnakes, so we hauled a group of young wild pigs to Catalina from Santa Rosa Island. Deer . . . were taken to Santa Rosa for sport hunting.\"<br /> <br /> At least once Vail & Vickers delivered cattle to San Francisco, according to Morris, and made a short run to Gaviota across the channel: \"There was no dock in Gaviota, so the cattle were just pushed overboard and herded ashore with skiffs, as the cattle would often swim out to sea.\"<br /> <br /> The United States' entry into World War II caused a chain of events that would alter the sea transport of Vail & Vickers cattle for many years to come. In December 1942 Vail received a letter from Commander G. W. D. Dashiell, the port director at San Pedro's Naval Transportation Service, informing him that the US Army would requisition <em>Vaquero</em> for wartime service. Vail had reportedly sold their smaller boat Onward in an attempt to circumvent taking of the Vaquero. The tactic didn't work, so Vail renewed the ships papers on January 1, 1943 and Vail delivered the boat to the Army at San Pedro on January 14th, ending thirty years' service by the sturdy and unique cattle boat of Santa Rosa Island.<br /> <br /> <em>Vaquero</em> then traveled across the Pacific Ocean under its own power. She was spotted off Biak Island in New Guinea, painted green, but its fate after 1944 is unknown. However, one researcher traced the boat up to 1954 when it was still in use by the Army.<br /> <br /> The Navy was aware of the need for beef in the war effort and, being sympathetic to the Vails' predicament, made available landing barges to ship Santa Rosa Island cattle. The Navy used the event as an exercise, using three LCTs (landing craft) and transporting 3,000 head of cattle to the beach at Ventura. Of the landing methods, Al Vail explained simply, \"Well, you drop the ramp and kick 'em off . . . most of 'em didn't even have to go through the water.\"<br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the Vails, by the fall of 1943 the landing craft were needed elsewhere. Ed Vail hired Edwin Stanton's island schooner Santa Cruz to restock the island that fall, but found that the Santa Cruz was \"totally inadequate for that size job.\" Vail & Vickers turned to the only answer they could at the time- hiring barges and tugs to make the cattle movements.<br /> <br /> For almost fifteen years following the war, the Vails used rented barges and tugs to move cattle to the mainland. At one point they bought and converted a landing craft for the job, but it sank off west Santa Cruz Island in rough weather. The barges were equipped with pens and loaded from the Bechers Bay pier using cattle chutes, as they had on the Vaquero. Occasionally, to unload calves that typically balked at entering the chute on the pier, the cowboys built a ramp of sand to the beached barge and drove the livestock ashore or drove them ashore simply by opening the pens and shooing the calves out into the shallow water.<br /> <br /> <b><em>Vaquero II</em>, 1959-1999</b><br /> After more than 15 years hauling island cattle by barge and tug, and no doubt tired of the inconvenient and costly method of transport, Vail & Vickers contracted with Lindwall Boat Works in Santa Barbara to construct a 64'6\" wooden cattle boat. Six open cattle pens constituted the bulk of the boat's square footage, with a capacity of about 100 head of adult cattle or 210 calves. The boat would be half the size of the original Vaquero and hold half the number of livestock as cargo, but would be faster and more efficient both in operation and crew requirements (it required only a skipper and a deckhand). In February 1959, the boat was delivered to Santa Barbara Harbor for launch and the Vails christened the boat Vaquero II.<br /> <br /> <em>Vaquero II </em>became a landmark at Santa Barbara Harbor. Operation between Port Hueneme and Santa Rosa Island for cattle shipments took about five hours. It made regular runs to the island (about every ten days) with food and supplies from its homeport at Santa Barbara Harbor, a trip of about three hours. Considered to be the last operating wooden cattle boat on the Pacific Coast, it handled the island cattle shipments with few breakdowns and enjoyed a reputation for seaworthiness.<br /> <br /> The Vails also used <em>Vaquero II</em> to haul Stanton Ranch cattle and sheep from Santa Cruz Island after their venerable schooner Santa Cruz wrecked off anchor in a storm in 1960. <em>Vaquero II</em> hauled Santa Cruz Island livestock for 26 years, including the final shipment of cattle after Carey Stanton's death in 1987. The Gherini family of east Santa Cruz Island also employed Vaquero II for their sheep shipments after their boat Hodge wrecked in 1976. <em>Vaquero II</em> held up to 600 sheep.<br /> <br /> Los Angeles Herald-Examiner columnist Cholly Angeleno wrote of the challenges an uninitiated passenger might have faced on what must have been <em>Vaquero II</em> in the early days:<br /> <br /> \"I remember when one of the Vails'] cattle ships stopped over at Catalina, with Ed Vail skippering the vessel. He promptly invited Hook Beardslee and me to take \"the cruise\" to Santa Rosa to pick up some cattle. But when we got aboard ship we promptly declined the offer. The farmyard aroma was stifling!\"<br /> <br /> With the end of ranching in 1998, Vail & Vickers donated Vaquero II in 1999 to a nonprofit organization and it was converted for other uses.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\"> <strong>Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </strong></a><strong> </strong></p>",
    "audioDescription": "You have stepped off the boat, onto the lower landing platform of the dock at the east end of a very long pier, that runs east to west. You are standing on metal decking with sturdy railings. The decking runs along two sides of the larger platform above you. Supporting the entire structure are metal beams and thick round posts that look like telephone poles, which extend down into the ocean below. Around the waterline and below, barnacles and mussels cling, in dense clusters, to those posts. The ocean waters extend out in every direction.<br /><br />A tall metal staircase with twelve risers leads up to the platform above. The upper dock platform is about 100 feet by 70 feet. Five-foot high wooden railings run along the perimeter of the pier and dock platform and pier. Below the dock railing, at each corner, is a light beacon, under a clear bell-shaped cap. <br /><br />If you are standing at the top of the risers on the platform, to your left, attached to top of a post are two large outdoor lights. Just past the lights, mounted to the railing, is a heavy plastic yellow container that is rectangular with a rounded top. The lettering on it reads,<br /><br />Life Ring.<br /><br />Straight ahead, on the opposite side of the dock, is a park orientation panel, mounted to the railing. <br /><br />To the right of that panel, and running parallel to the railing, are two low wooden risers with yellow stripes painted on the sides. Matching yellow L-shapes are painted on the pier about 10 feet away from the risers' corners, seemingly outlining a rectangular area on the dock.<br /><br />The ocean end of the dock extends out farther on the left side, by about 20 feet. Near the middle of that side of the dock is a metal cabinet, covered with green canvas. Three shapes stick up on the top, also covered in canvas. Nearby is a large yellow plastic barrel with square shapes that curve out on the sides. <br /><br />In the far right corner of the ocean end of the dock is an upright metal cylinder, about five-feet wide by eight-feet tall. At the top of the cylinder is a giant metal hinge that supports a long steel \"arm,\" ending with two thick parallel metal plates, just a few inches apart, creating a slot, like that between prongs of tongs or a clamp. The plates hang down lower than the arm about one foot. On top of the arm are three thin metal bands, each curved into an upright loop that is connected to the sides of the arm. Lettering on the side of the steel \"arm\" reads,<br /><br />Hydro Pro.<br /><br />The wooden plank pier, that connects the dock to the island, is 650 feet long and 20 feet wide. At the land end of the pier, on either side, is a steep sandy-colored rocky ridge with eroded gullies and a sandy beach below. The cliff surface varies from top to bottom. Embedded in the top area are random clumps of cobble-sized stones. On the lower part of the cliff are layers of horizontal ridges, like the wavy edge of a stack of pancakes.<br /><br />On the south side, 18 wooden steps with railings lead downward. At the bottom step, there is a ladder, that you can climb down to reach the sandy beach. <br /><br />On the north side is an information panel. <br /><br />At the end of the pier, a dirt road continues upward, cutting through the cliff to the top of the plateau.<br />",

Vail & Vickers managers chose to rid the island of sheep and slowly restock with cattle, giving time for the overgrazed vegetation to recover adequately in order to run a viable cattle operation. Vail & Vickers reached this goal by 1910.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers traditionally raised Hereford cattle, first bringing herds from their Empire Ranch in Arizona, later buying young cattle from the Santa Cruz Island Company and all over the west. During the last years of ranch operation, they changed to a crossbreed that provided lighter beef as called for by modern tastes.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers ran a stocker ranch, where calves were fattened on the ranch with island grasses and then sold directly to packing plants as \"finished\" cattle or, in later years as corn-fed beef became the standard, sold to feed lots for additional fattening. A stocker ranch differs from the common cow/calf operation in that cows were not bred to produce newborn calves to raise; they brought calves to the island for feeding, \"stocking\" the island with six-month-old calves.<br /> <br /> Weaned calves destined for Santa Rosa Island arrived at Wilmington (1902-1939) near Los Angeles or Port Hueneme (1939-1998) in train carloads or by truck and were deposited into corrals at the harbor (occasionally in the early days they were shipped from Santa Barbara). Often the stock would be \"stopped\" at a mainland ranch where they would receive some or all preparation-branding, dehorning, vaccinating, and feeding. Stopping cattle allowed ranch owners to wait for the best island grass conditions. This preparation was also occasionally done on the island.<br /> <br /> The cattle were marked with various brands. \"V/V\" didn't last long because it was graphically too complicated. After the war the managers used \"VR\" (Vail-Rogers), reflecting Ed Vail's partnership with Jimmy Rogers (son of the famous Will Rogers) on the Jalama Ranch near Lompoc. A heart-slash was the standard brand on the ranch for the last decade of the operation.<br /> <br /> From the harborside corrals, vaqueros loaded the calves through chutes and ramps onto a vessel, either a barge, Vaquero, or Vaquero II. The vessels had pens aboard to regulate the number and weight of animals. Loading typically occurred in the dark. After a voyage of about five hours the livestock were unloaded onto the pier at Bechers Bay. After about three days in pens at the ranch house, where they would be fed and observed, calves were distributed to one of the six pastures on the island.<br /> <br /> The total number of cattle depended on the weather, abundance of grass, and general range condition. During some dry years managers kept the ranch half stocked; the usual stocking level would reach about 6,000 to 7,000 head at the \"spring peak.\" The largest number of cattle on the island at one time, consisting largely of calves, was about 9,000.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers stocked the island using a double season strategy, where an overlap occurred between new calves and finished cattle that gave them two green seasons. From a new 300- to 450-pound calf arriving in the winter and early spring to a 750- to 1,000-pound feeder steer ready for shipping the following late spring and early summer, a steer spent roughly eighteen months on the island, gaining about 600 pounds.<br /> <br /> While the herds could wander freely throughout the large pastures on the island, they tended to stay in groups in particular areas. The cowboys kept an eye on them but didn't interfere unless necessary, to doctor them or improve pasture utilization. Even at roundup time, the cowboys avoided roping cattle; instead they kept the cattle gentle by not \"running â€˜em.\" No supplementary feed was necessary. If the range conditions became poor, cattle were shipped off the island rather than import feed, which was expensive and labor intensive.<br /> <br /> At roundup and shipping time the island came alive. The roundup followed a 100-year-old tradition of vaqueros tending cattle on horseback. The roundup, an icon of the romance of the West, is in reality a hard, dirty job that requires concentrated preparation, precise execution and judgment-and a good spell of rest when it is all over. The art of the roundup has been fully understood only by those who have participated in the activity. It requires a sure horseman or horsewoman on a good horse, possessing both agility and endurance; a knowledge of the land being worked, coupled with a good eye and a sense of how a steer thinks; and, perhaps most importantly, the ability to work as a team with little direct communication.<br /> <br /> The island cowboys and their families spent three months in the spring on roundups around the island. Before the 1960s, cowboys gathered cattle to roundup grounds across the island mostly without the benefit of corrals. The eventual use of corrals throughout the island made roundups easier and faster and cut the number of cowboys needed. After being rounded up, the cattle were moved to smaller pastures close to the ranch in Bechers Bay and then eventually to the pens at the ranch, where they were carefully weighed in the scale house and assigned pens for shipment on the boat or barge.<br /> <br /> During the Vail & Vickers years, a variety of vessels were used to ship the cattle to the mainland, including the Mildred E., Santa Rosa Island, Vaquero, Santa Cruz, barges and landing crafts, and, beginning in 1958, the Vaquero II. What follows is a ranger's account of the loading operation:<br /> <br /> \"The boat used for this unusual operation, the Vaquero II, is basically a shallow-drafted, floating cattle pen built especially for this purpose. The original Vaquero was pressed into service during World War II and never returned to Santa Rosa. The Vaquero II, a smaller boat, holds 100 head ... I watched the boat pull alongside the dock one morning. It was 4:00 am, dark and cold. An overhead light illuminated the end of the pier. Silhouettes of the cowboys could be seen against the morning sky. The voice of the foreman rose above the crashing of the waves on the beach.<br /> <br /> When all was ready the overhead light was switched off then on, a signal to the cowboys to start the first group of 15 down the pier. Three vaqueros on horseback galloped behind the stampede. When the cattle reached the first planks of the pier they tried to stop, but the vaqueros cracked their whips and yelled, as their horses reared in the air. The herd was pushed reluctantly down the pier into a chute, forcing them to go single file. They were encouraged to keep moving with electric cattle prods or hot shots. Finally, each steer scrambles down the rusty ramp to the boat, where they were packed in so tightly they could not move.<br /> <br /> As dawn broke, the Vaquero II, low in the water, began its journey, a journey it and the Vaquero before it had completed hundreds of times for more than 90 years. From Santa Rosa Island the Vaquero II lumbers the 55 miles to Port Hueneme where the cattle are sold at auction.\"<br /> <br /> The sale price of a steer or cow was based on weight on the island at the time of shipping. Cattle lost some weight on the boat trip to the mainland and even more during shipping to feed lots. Vail & Vickers shipped cattle by rail in the early years and later by truck, to feed lots all over the West, including the Rocky Mountain states and the Midwest. Vail & Vickers owned a feedlot at Walnut, California, until around 1984. After 120-150 days of feeding on grains and supplements, the cattle were slaughtered and sent to markets as choice beef.<br /> <br /> Cultural changes in the country after World War II helped raise public awareness of the importance and fragility of the resources on the Channel Islands. The booming post-war economy brought increased visitors and residents to California, especially to the scenic coastal areas, which saw greatly increased development. Events like the Santa Barbara oil spill and the discovery of the effects of DDT on seabird populations heightened environmental awareness and calls for protection of coastal resources.<br /> <br /> On March 5, 1980, President Jimmy Carter designated the Channel Islands National Monument islands of Anacapa and Santa Barbara as a national park and added Santa Cruz, San Miguel, and Santa Rosa Islands.<br /> <br /> In 1986 the National Park Service acquired Santa Rosa Island from Vail & Vickers for nearly $30 million. The ranching operation continued until 1998 when the final roundup brought a close to the last working island cattle ranch in the continental United States and an end to a truly unique way of life.<br /> <br /> For almost a century, Vail & Vickers operated one of the largest and most productive beef cattle ranches in California. Four generations of family members acted as stewards of the land managing the ranch in the traditional system of vaqueros (Spanish for \"cowboys\"), tending cattle on horseback, and preserving the last intact large Mexican land grant rancho in California. Their commitment to ranching traditions preserved an undeveloped, historic landscape that greatly contributed to Santa Rosa Island's inclusion in Channel Islands National Park.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Cowboy Life</strong></p> <p>The life of a cowboy, as personified in tales of the old west, had perhaps its ideal venue on Santa Rosa Island. Although without a saloon to saunter down to in the evening and lacking in shoot-outs, island cowboys were isolated from mainland progress and hence hung on to a passing way of life for a few extra decades. Once left at the Bechers Bay pier, the cowboy did almost nothing but be a cowboy, day and night. Life revolved around the bunkhouse, tack room, and range, as the men herded cattle, fixed fences and cared for their tack and horses.<br /> <br /> Al Vail, for 25 years a cowboy then 36 more as ranch manager, described the life of a Vail & Vickers employee: \"A cowboy does a little o' everything. You know, the reason for the island is to run cattle . . . in between when we're shipping cattle there's lots of other work, like fence building, breaking colts, do anything that comes along as far as maintaining a ranch.\"<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers needed six or seven men to handle the day-to-day ranch duties and, before building corrals around the island in the 1950s and 1960s, required even more for roundups. Most cowboys tended to be happy with the island life, and the managers were lucky to have steady crews, especially in the 1930s and 1940s. Vail spoke on the hiring practices at the ranch:<br /> \"Most of the personnel we have we get through word of mouth . . . We never had any luck going through an appointment agency . . . If the guy's a good cowpuncher and he says his friend is a good cowpuncher then you hire him.\"<br /> <br /> Many cowboys followed the Vail family from their ranch in Arizona to Santa Rosa Island in the years after the island was purchased. One of the most storied of the old Arizona cowboys was Juan Ayon, who spent over 50 years chasing cattle, building fences, cooking, and keeping gardens on the island. Ayon was born in 1887 in Mexico and worked at the Empire Ranch for many years, forming a bond with the Vail family that lasted three generations. He is thought to have arrived at Santa Rosa Island around 1911. It has been written that:<br /> <br /> \"Juan, who was heavy-set with a short, stocky build, had great physical strength, and possessed many talents. He was not only an experienced cowboy, but also a good ranch hand as well-he milked cows, built fences, broke horses, nurtured the island's garden, and occasionally worked as the island cook (he always gave that assignment a fight and often ended up cooking only for himself!). Apparently his reputation of having a curmudgeon-like personality combined with a slightly humorous nature was well-deserved.\"<br /> <br /> Many of the cowboys, like Jesus Bracamontes, came from Mexico. Jesus was born in January 1925 in Sonora, Mexico, and spent his whole life as a cowboy in Mexico and the United States; he worked for more than 35 years on Santa Rosa Island. During WWII the Vails enrolled in the Bracero Program, created by the Farm Security Administration and the Mexican government to help staff agricultural operations at a time when labor was short. The program granted temporary visas to 2.6 million Mexican citizens and helped find them work in the United States.<br /> <br /> Cowboys worked seven days a week, sunrise to sunset. They were allowed four days paid leave on the mainland every six to eight weeks, or every month if not working cattle (vaqueros were also given longer vacations to go home to Mexico). It was an isolated life, where you couldn't run to town when you wanted. Office manager Tom Thornton took care of supplies for the cowboys:<br /> <br /> \"They'd send us a shopping list or call over after the phone became a very common and very easy thing to use. A simple matter. They would hope that [the clothes] fit. They always buy their shoes large so they can get thick socks or thinner socks. Buy their leather to make their chaps and to make saddles and buy their rope for their lassoes etc. You are dealing with a real family over there. \"<br /> <br /> The risks of isolation, of getting injured or seriously ill out on the island, didn't seem to bother many of the cowboys. Bill Wallace, who was hired in 1948 and was ranch foreman from 1968 to 1999, probably put it best when he said, \"I've been out here just about fifty years. Well, once you get out here, it's damned hard to find a reason to ever go back. I only go into town when I absolutely have to. That's about once or twice a year. And that's too [expletive deleted] much.\"<br /> <br /> Tom Thornton speculated on why Vail & Vickers was so successful in getting and keeping good cowpunchers on the ranch:<br /> <br /> \"[T]he Vail & Vickers cowboys are probably the best fed cowboys in the world. They get what they want. Al has no restrictions on . . . reasonable foods. So they eat very well. Probably that's one reason they stay so long. They are probably the best paid cowboys in the country. There is nothing \"pickey-unish\" about Santa Rosa people.\"<br /> <br /> anta Rosa Island provided a unique backdrop for ranch life. While it was not the life for everyone, many of the cowboys and foremen stayed on for much of their working lives, dedicated to the island traditions and their employers. Those traditions contributed to the preservation of the \"old ways\" on Santa Rosa Island, a place almost untouched by the hurry of city life and pressures of development from nearby suburbs. The end of ranching in 1998 brought to a close a truly unique way of life in coastal California.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Horses</strong></p> <p>Santa Rosa Island's herds of horses served many purposes. Foremost, they worked at the most critical times of ranch operation: roundups and moving cattle. They also provided transportation, labor, and recreation for visitors and family.<br /> <br /> Ranch managers kept about forty head of riding horses as well as twelve to fifteen brood mares. Additional horses, including yearlings, resting, and retired horses, brought the number to well over a hundred. The horses, mainly quarter horses, were bred and raised for ranch use. Known around southern California as a fine herd of cattle horses, each was trained by the cowboys and foremen to perform the jobs unique to the island.<br /> <br /> Diego Cuevas spoke of the ranch philosophy on horses:<br /> <br /> \"Important part of the island was the horses, was number one . . . you gotta learn from the horses, teach â€˜em to lead, got to teach â€˜em so you can walk to and touch and play with their feet and make them gentle. That's one of the most important parts. So you have the job, the cowboy gotta do all those things like that. You know, train the horses from beginning from baby to three or four years old. So you can drive it and then you start teaching it how to respond to the reins. Once you do that you start teaching it how to work cows. And you try your best to make a good gentle horse at the same time. Working horse and gentle horse. Lot of the horses they see that they begin to get to be gentle and nice, you can play with them and they make good kid horses, because on the island you always have somebody that never ride a horse and then you can put him on the horse and you can trust him.\"<br /> <br /> A cowboy would be assigned five or six horses to ride and care for. Usually he would break his own horses, train them, and use them exclusively during roundups.<br /> <br /> Working island horses spent their time in the House Field, roughly 640 acres west of the ranch complex. Yearling and older horses were turned out onto the Soledad and Green Canyon Flats. Ranch workers sowed oat fields in the flat areas east and south of the ranch house to produce feed for the horses; ranch workers cut and baled oat hay in May, weather permitting.<br /> <br /> Earlier in the century, horses performed most of the transport labor, hauling wagons of materials to various parts of the island. The first ranch vehicle, a Fordson tractor, arrived in 1939, and island managers started to use trucks in the 1950s, but horses remained the favored mode of transportation. The Vail children and their friends looked forward to island visits, which afforded the freedom of riding horseback in the hills, searching out pigs, and having picnics in favorite spots.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Hunting Pigs, Deer, and Elk</strong></p> <p>Hunting had a long tradition on Santa Rosa Island, with the earliest reference dating back to 1853. Nonnative pigs, deer, and elk were all privately and commercially hunted on the island.<br /> <br /> <u>Pigs</u><br /> The origin of pigs on the island has not been determined, although it is known that sometime after 1844 Alpheus Thompson raised \"a lot of hogs.\" Since then, pigs had become a source of delight to the hunter and a bother to the rancher. Charles Holder wrote in 1910 that \"years ago wild pigs were placed on the island and are now â€˜wild hogs' . . . dangerous to approach or hunt on foot.\" Al Vail stated that hogs inhabited the island long before Vail & Vickers took possession of the island in late 1901. In the early 1930s, according to Vail, they traded hogs for Catalina Island quail, shipping them over on the Vaquero.<br /> <br /> Arthur Sanger, who hunted hogs on the island between 1910 and 1917, described \"wild hogs weighing as much as 150 and 200 lbs. with curved tusks six inches long. They have the appearance of large hyenas, high heavy shoulders and low rumps.\" He continued, \"Many times they charged us with their teeth snapping with a grinding noise as if they wanted us to know what to expect if they reached us, but they never did. At the time I will admit that I felt more like running than shooting. We had some exciting experiences and we learned that if you corner or wound a tusker, he will always charge you.\"<br /> <br /> Not only was pig hunting a popular sport on the island, it also became a necessary means to keep the population in check and slow the damage caused by their voracious rooting. Vail claimed that the hogs ate the cattle's molasses blocks and dug up valuable soil, which caused erosion, encouraged weeds, and reduced pasture productivity.<br /> <br /> The NPS decided to eliminate the feral pigs, citing soil disturbance and the nonnative status of the approximately 500 to 4,000 animals (the population varied wildly depending on island conditions). The 1984 supplement to the General Management Plan noted that feral pigs, not to mention livestock, elk, and deer, would be removed from Santa Rosa Island. A major eradication effort in 1991 and 1992 eliminated all pigs from the island.<br /> <br /> <u>Elk and Deer</u><br /> The elk and deer herds originated with the desire of the ranch owners to make the island \"a sportsman's paradise.\" Walter Vail's sons, N. R., Mahlon, and Ed were ranchers and businessmen and worked to import elk and deer as a source of income and for their pleasure and that of visitors.<br /> <br /> The first record of elk on the island came from a writer that visited the island in 1892 and reported on an ill-tempered pet female elk that \"weighed as much as an ordinary horse.\" N. R. Vail wrote that around 1905 they obtained three elk from Oregon and a few years later a bull. One story goes that around 1908 an old elk that had been the mascot for the Elks Club in Long Beach was retired and taken to the island. Other family members recalled that the elk were imported in the 1910s. In 1911 a local newspaper reported on a herd of nine elk on Santa Rosa Island, stating, \"it is an ideal range for them, and the day may come when the island may be well stocked with this species of game, now becoming extinct in other portions of the continent. Absolute protection is guaranteed them on the island.\" By 1994, the elk population had grown to approximately 900.<br /> <br /> Margaret Vail Woolley said that the elk \"were brought over with the idea that someday they'd be hunted, or at least they'd be meat producers and be profitable.\" Difficulty in getting fresh meat to shore, the depression, and refrigeration problems hindered those plans, and the elk were hunted only sporadically.<br /> <br /> Family members and friends of the Vails and the Vickers enjoyed elk hunting. In the 1950s, under Ed Vail, a number of prominent men came to the island to hunt not only elk but also deer and pigs, including Governor (and later Chief Justice of the Supreme Court) Earl Warren, Bing Crosby (who had a ranch in Nevada and sold cattle to the Vails), and newspaper publisher and More descendant Thomas Storke.<br /> <br /> Deer have been reported on Santa Rosa Island as early as 1880. The Vails brought deer over from Arizona's Kaibab National Forest in 1929-30. By 1994, the deer population had grown to approximately 1,000.<br /> <br /> The Vail family began hosting commercial hunts for elk, deer, and pigs as early as 1979. Multiple Use Managers Inc. was hired to help manage the herds and to operate the commercial hunts. This business relationship lasted for the entire 32 year run of the commercial hunting program on Santa Rosa Island.<br /> The federal government purchased the island in 1986 and Vail & Vickers retained a 25 year right to use and occupy most of the ranch complex at Bechers Bay. The NPS also permitted the hunting operation for that period. The deer and elk were eliminated in 2011.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a sandy dirt road, more than 300 feet long, running roughly east to west, from the ocean side near the landing dock road, toward the ranch barns. There are 6-foot high wooden fences on the north and south sides, creating a long, narrow corridor. To the east is a glimpse of the ocean. Toward the southeast, just beyond the fence, a long line of eucalyptus trees form a windbreak. The fences on the north side of this road, and some of the south side, are part of a series of ranch corrals. The corral fences are constructed of posts, with four wooden plank rails, each about one foot by twelve. <br />As you walk west along the road, toward the ranch buildings, on your left, you will see a long pen that parallels the eucalyptus windbreak. About half-way down the road, on the left is another pen with a large water trough. At the far end, straight ahead, is a large corral, adjacent to a blacksmith shop barn. A little to the right, farther away, is a larger horse barn with a large corral connected to it. Turning around to return east, back along the same road toward the ocean, this larger pen feeds into smaller pens, ending with a row of six small pens connected by a narrow fenced corridor",

The building is powered by solar energy and receives water from a modern well in Nidever Canyon. The airstrip's west end conveniently abuts the entrance to the ranger station.<br /> <br /> Although the Navy retains legal possession of the island and may in perpetuity, agreements were made in 1976 that allowed the National Park Service to manage the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>NPS and Navy Cooperation</strong><br /> The idea of including San Miguel Island in the Channel Islands National Monument had circulated for decades. Activities in this direction increased in the early 1960s as President Kennedy pressed for parklands and NPS historian Ross Holland produced a history of the island in 1961.<br /> <br /> The Navy, however, continued to deny transfer of San Miguel to the NPS. It needed the island to test guided weapons systems, for fleet squadron practice, and for on-land instrumentation. Creation of a park would have an adverse effect on the required readiness training of fleet aviation units. A park would attract the general public into the nearby hazard area, which had to be kept free to assure maximum range scheduling. In short, the position of the Commander, Pacific Missile Range was that there was no objection to the proposed park provided San Miguel Island was excluded until it was no longer desired for Navy purposes. The Navy also wanted unrestricted access to and use of existing improvements on privately owned Santa Rosa Island and Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> In 1948 biologist Lowell Sumner had made an air inspection of the northern Channel Islands after which he recommended nominal transfer of San Miguel Island from Navy to NPS. If that could not be done, he urged that the Navy should stop the destructive sheep grazing.<br /> <br /> In July of 1957 Sumner conferred with regional specialists on seashore survey at the subject island and then wrote the Regional Director that he was still of the same opinion he had in 1939: the scientific features of San Miguel Island were so outstanding that it warranted every effort of preservation. It was approximately 14 times as large as Santa Barbara Island and had a correspondingly greater wealth of unique biological features. He noted that the federal government had, through its continuance of sheep grazing, permitted destruction on San Miguel; thus it should be up to the government to restore the land.<br /> <br /> A few days later the Regional Director wrote to the Director of NPS in Washington asking that San Miguel Island be added to Channel Islands National Monument. He wrote that no NPS representative concerned with biological and other natural resources had been on the island since 1939. The only activity on the island or around it in 1957 was commercial and military.<br /> <br /> The Navy could not give up San Miguel, yet preservation experience lay with the National Park Service. During 1962 the Western Regional Office, NPS, and the Navy drew up a series of interim agreements and put forth plans for the future management of San Miguel Island. NPS pointed out that they had been criticized for the lack of protection they offered on the islands they already controlled, but that lack of funds, transport, and personnel was the reason.<br /> <br /> The Navy was concerned about a need for launching missiles and the need to close down the island temporarily to continue the launches. The Navy discussed using San Miguel and San Nicolas for a naval petroleum reserve, and this was fought by local conservation groups who urged national monument status for San Miguel instead. Letters went to President Kennedy urging his support for conservation.<br /> <br /> Recognizing that San Miguel and Prince Islands contained rich and unique natural and cultural resources, the Department of the Navy and Department of the Interior entered a Memorandum of Agreement on May 7, 1963 for \"protection of natural values and historic and scientific objects\" on the two islands. The agreement authorized the Department of the Interior to take action regarding resources inventory and protection. Interior agreed to evaluate natural and cultural resources, to promote recovery or reintroduction of rare and locally extinct plants and animals, and to cooperate with the Navy in its rules and management of the islands. It was understood that the Navy had paramount use of the islands as a missile test range and that in the future it could even be a Naval Petroleum Reserve. Both parties recognized the priority of military uses. As a result, both departments would share responsibility for preservation and management. San Miguel and Prince Islands would not be open for public recreational purposes, and the Navy owned the island. These facts made it unlawful for the NPS to spend its funds there.<br /> <br /> NPS personnel began to study the island after the agreement was signed. Historian Daniel Bienvenu of the National Park Service prepared a Historic Structures Report for the Lester ranch house in November of 1965. Bienvenu found the old house abandoned for almost 20 years and quite dilapidated. He noted that while many fixtures had been taken away, numerous artifacts had been left, such as a table, beds, and sinks and toilets. Bienvenu recommended that the house, \"a hand-made oddity, with no recognizable architecture,\" be retained on the site \"until destroyed by the elements.\" Two years later, the ranch house burned to the ground along with the outbuildings and shearing shed.<br /> <br /> In cooperation with the Navy, the National Park Service produced a management plan for the island in the late 1960s. The document's authors recommended a wide range of activities on the island, concluding, \"San Miguel and Prince Islands possess both unique and irreplaceable scientific and natural values.\" Included in the recommendations were exotic plant identification and removal, enhancement of native plants, removal of feral burros, and studies of fire ecology, marine mammals population and ecology, faunal species, seabird and landbird ecology, underwater features, and history, prehistory and archeology.<br /> <br /> Two major agreements were negotiated and signed in regard to San Miguel Island after Park Superintendent Bill Ehorn took office in 1974. The first, signed in 1976 was an amendment to the agreement between the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Navy that related to protection of natural values on San Miguel. The amendment further recognized that the National Park Service could expend appropriated funds on the island to enforce NPS regulations and to develop a tightly controlled visitor program. Public access was to be confined to daylight hours and importantly tied to spending of funds at the island.<br /> <br /> As a result of this, a tent was set up in Nidever Canyon adjacent to the old windmill to serve as temporary Park headquarters; beginning in 1978 visitors could contact the ranger as they walked up the canyon to the island. Ehorn assigned Mike Hill as ranger at the post. Hill accompanied all visitors to the island who wanted to take the trail that follows the road bulldozed during World War II.<br /> <br /> Ehorn convened an advisory group that included A. Starker Leopold, Carey Stanton, Ralph Philbrick and Bob DeLong. In 1977, a Statement for Management was drawn up for San Miguel and Prince Islands by the National Park Service as well as an agreement between the National Marine Fisheries Service and the National Park Service for management and protection of the pinnipeds on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> A decision by the United States Supreme Court gave the State of California control over tidal lands, not the National Park Service, although designation of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary in 1980 offered federal protection of those waters. On land, meanwhile, Monument staff in 1977 killed the last of the feral burros that had been roaming the island for decades, finally bringing to a close the era of domestic livestock grazing on San Miguel Island.<br /> <br /> After creation of Channel Islands National Park in 1980 the National Park Service took on additional management of San Miguel and Prince Islands, although the Navy retained ownership until a transfer would be authorized by the Navy. A General Management Plan (GMP) was quickly adopted that spelled out development and protection of the island. The GMP designated the entire island as a historic zone overlapping the natural zone, which extended into the waters surrounding the island.<br /> <br /> Of the natural zone, 2,800 acres would be a protected area in which development and visitor access would be restricted. Only one acre, in two half-acre parcels, would be used for developments: the NMFS research station at Point Bennett and a proposed visitor contact station at the Lester Ranch site. Camping would be prohibited and visitors were restricted to day use only and by permit.<br /> <br /> The NPS adopted amendments to the 1980 GMP in 1984, which included minor changes in plans for San Miguel Island. Noting the dearth of visitors due to extreme conditions, park-imposed restrictions and distances from the mainland, the GMP proposed one or two small primitive campgrounds, one at the Lester Ranch site and another at the dry lake bed (the latter location was dropped within a year). The plan also extended the range of ranger-led walks, although it still limited trail construction. In light of these potential developments, the development zone was increased to 1.5 acres.<br /> <br /> A small amount of development occurred in the 1980s. The tent in the canyon was replaced by a conex box. NPS crews eventually constructed a campground in a former sheep corral near the Lester ranch house ruins. Trail development remained low-key in the interest of habitat restoration, with visitors being restricted to ranger-led walks if venturing beyond the area of Nidever Canyon and the old ranch site. The trail to Point Bennett was used for such walks and by staff and volunteers of the field station. A trail to Lester and Harris points was developed but like the Point Bennett trail, was restricted to supervised hikes.<br /> <br /> Park resources staff focused on archeological and shipwreck survey work as well as island fox monitoring, pinniped research and habitat restoration. In 1997 the NPS constructed a modern building up on the mesa to replace the temporary ranger station in the canyon. Designed to echo the lines of the Lester ranch house, the one-story structure combined a ranger contact station, ranger residence and bunkhouse for visiting researchers. The building is powered by solar energy and receives water from a modern well in Nidever Canyon. The airstrip's west end conveniently abuts the entrance to the ranger station.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "In an open field, next to the airplane landing strip, sits the ranger station. It is an L-shaped wooden building. The building has brown, planked wood siding. If facing the front of the building, four upper, clerestory windows are visible near the peak of the roof. A lower roof overhangs the front of the building, supported by beams and posts, creating a covered walkway. Along that walkway, at ground level, five windows alternate with five doors. Two wooden benches along the exterior wall provide seating. At the bend of the L-shape is a 10-foot by 10-foot structure that sticks up about 10 feet taller than the roof. Sticking up from it are several tall rods and a shallow, concave-shaped satellite dish. An outdoor lamp attached to the side. <br /><br />In front of the station is a picnic table and a flagpole, flying the United States flag. On the left side of the walkway is a low wire frame platform. Mounted on top of this is a large brush, made of stiff blue plastic spikes, used to clean off the bottoms of boots. Further to the left is a small, single-seater wood plank outhouse, with symbols on the door representing both a man and a woman. Several other small storage sheds are nearby.<br /><br />The ranger station information center is through the second door from the right. The room is a large and open space, with high ceilings. It has light wood paneling. Windows line the back wall behind a partially-partitioned area with desks and a table with two chairs. Colorful pictures on the walls display island views. On the left side of the room are two doors leading to equipment and supply closets. To the right is a television, set on the top of a corner cabinet, with a shelf of videos below it.<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>With the islands having never been connected to the mainland, plants, seeds, and spores over millions of years were carried from the mainland by ocean currents, wind, and birds or in the fur of animals that reached the islands. Due to continuous isolation from the mainland, many plant communities on the islands are unique, including the absence of some common mainland species and the presence of many island endemics (species that grow naturally only on one or more of the Channel Islands).<br /> <br /> Since the Chumash did not practice agriculture, they used native plants as a primary source of food and medicine. Native plants also provided important construction materials for canoes, houses, bows, arrows, nets, baskets, beds, clothing, footwear, ornaments, and a variety of other items used in daily life.<br /> <br /> With nonnative browsing and grazing animals now removed, many native plants are spreading beyond the steep canyon walls and cliffs-where they remained protected from grazing for nearly 150 years-and reestablishing themselves throughout the island. Take time to look carefully in Water Canyon (or other island canyons such as Lobo and Cherry Canyons) and you should see some of the following species.</p> <h3>Toyon</h3> <p>Also known as Christmas berry or California holly, this plant is an evergreen chaparral and coastal sage scrub species that grows on all of the larger islands and on the mainland as well. Due to sheep grazing and reduced fire frequency, toyons on the island are more tree-like than most found on the mainland. During the summer and fall the small flowers decorating the tips of the branches give way to clusters of bright red berries. During the winter these berries provide an important food supply for birds.<br /> <br /> The Chumash ate toyon berries as well, roasting them or letting them wilt in the hot sun before eating. Toyon was also a valuable source of hardwood for manufacturing a variety of implements such as arrows, harpoons, fish spears, digging sticks, and gaming pieces. The Chumash often used heat or steam to shape and form objects made from toyon and other hardwoods.</p> <h3>Island Scrub Oak, Coast Live Oak, and Island Cherry</h3> <p>Island scrub oak is a thin-branched shrub with flat, smooth-edged leaves that are rich green on the upper surface and a dull gray underneath. Coast live oak is a much taller and stouter tree, with cupped, spiny-edged leaves and \"hairy armpits.\" Turn over one of the leaves and look for a small, fuzzy white patch where some of the side veins of the leaf join the central vein.<br /> <br /> The acorns from these oaks, along with those from six other species that grow on Santa Rosa Island, were an important food source for the Island Chumash and many other California Indian groups. Each fall acorns were gathered, hulled, dried, and stored in large granary baskets. When prepared, acorns were ground into meal, leached to remove the tannic acid and bitter flavor, and cooked into mush. Other seeds and herbs may have been added to enhance the (generally bland) flavor.<br /> <br /> Although the Island Chumash gathered acorns, oaks are less abundant on the islands than on the mainland. To increase their supply of acorns and other medicinal and food plants, the islanders engaged in trade or undertook gathering expeditions to the mainland. The island Chumash also compensated for the short supply of acorns by substituting other plant foods in their place. One important alternative was island cherry. Most often, island cherry grows as a large shrub. However, in deep, moist soils and sunshine it can grow to a forty-foot tree. This plant blooms from spring through early summer. When ripe, the fruit ranges in color from dark purple to black and is characterized by a large seed and pulpy flesh. In addition to eating the pulp, the pits were boiled in several changes of water to release the toxic chemicals. Then the pits were mashed to the consistency of refried beans and eaten.</p> <h3>Monkey Flower</h3> <p>Monkey flower is common in chaparral throughout California. Known as \"sticky\" monkey flower because the deep green leaves secrete a gluey substance, they bloom from January to May and were named for the monkey face that sometimes can be seen within the orange to pale yellow flowers. A mainland species, endemic island species, and a hybrid between the two occur here on Santa Rosa Island. The island endemic species differs from the mainland species in the lack of sticky leaves and its bright red flowers. The hybrid produces peach or bronze-colored flowers. These plants are commonly seen on rock walls where the nonnative animals could not reach.</p> <h3>Lemonade Berry</h3> <p>Lemonade berry is a shrub with thick, leathery leaves. The Chumash would steep the sticky, lemon-tasting berries in water to make juice, or they would suck on them like candy. One should be careful, however, since lemonade berry belongs to the same family as poison oak and can trigger a skin rash in those sensitive to it.</p> <h3>Santa Cruz Island Ironwood</h3> <p>Thousands of years ago the Channel Islands had a moister climate, as did much of southern California. Different plant communities and different animals, such as pygmy mammoths, existed on the islands. The Santa Cruz Island ironwood is a relic of this earlier environment. Fossil evidence indicates that ironwoods once grew on the mainland as far north as Washington and as far east as Nevada.<br /> <br /> Today the ironwood grows only on islands in locations where conditions approximate California's earlier, wetter climate. Small groves of these trees are often found on Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands, where they grow mostly in north-facing canyons cooled by fog. In fact, fog is an important element in the ironwood's successful adaptation and survival. Moisture from fog collects on the leaves and drips down to the soil surrounding the trunk, thereby increasing the amount of water available to the tree. This also helps to sustain the other larger tree species on Santa Rosa and the other islands.<br /> <br /> Ironwood has dark green, highly serrated, finger-like leaves and in summer produces many small white flowers.</p> <h3>Poison Oak</h3> <p>Poison oak grows on all of the Channel Islands except Santa Barbara Island and is readily identified in spring as a three-leafed shrub or vine with bronze-green foliage. During late summer and fall the leaves turn a red or rust color and white berries develop. Poison oak can cause allergic reactions and rashes if it comes in contact with the skin. Please do not touch. The Chumash used poison oak to treat warts, cankers, and skin cancer and to staunch blood flow.</p> <h3>Coastal Prickly Pear</h3> <p>The coastal prickly pear is a cactus that blooms in May and June, producing a shiny yellow flower with dense layers of petals. The plant's shallow root system spreads over a wide area to extract maximum moisture while its sharp spines reflect the sun and wind to help protect the plant from deyhydration.<br /> <br /> The spines also helped protect the plant from cattle, sheep, elk, deer, and pigs, allowing it to spread into the overgrazed sage scrub and grasslands. Forney's map of 1873 depicted numerous thickets of cactus across the island. Mrs. Woolley said, \"the thing I remember most vividly is that when I was young there was lots and lots of cactus. Fields of it, acres of it.\" Edwin Stanton on neighboring Santa Cruz Island, an avid student of agricultural science, used cochineal insects to rid his island of native prickly pear cactus. The cochineal insects appear as small, silvery white mounds on the cactus pads. These insects weaken and eventually kill the cactus by sucking sap from the plant. Both Mrs. Woolley and Al Vail speculated that Stanton's \"bugs\" migrated to Santa Rosa Island and eliminated most of the cacti. Mrs. Woolley noted that \"it just died by the acre.\"<br /> <br /> The Chumash harvested the sweet prickly pear fruit and used its beet-red juice as a paint and dye. The long, sharp cactus thorns were used for decorative ear piercing and tattooing. Vertical and transverse lines were commonly tattooed on the cheeks and chin, although tattoo designs were applied also to the forehead, arms, and other parts of the body. To create a dark blue tattoo, the skin was pricked with a cactus thorn and the punctures rubbed with charcoal. When the wounds healed the pigment was sealed under the skin.</p> <h3>Dudleya (Live-forever)</h3> <p>Perhaps no plant is more versatile in adapting to different habitats than dudleya. These low-growing, fleshy succulents with a waxy coating commonly grow on dry, rocky outcroppings like the walls of Water Canyon.<br /> <br /> However, they also can be found on stabilized sand dunes, grasslands, and scrub habitats in conditions varying from full sun to shade. This adaptability is reflected in the variety of dudleyas found on the Channel Islands, including four species on Santa Rosa Island.<br /> <br /> On these canyon walls one can find candleholder and Greene's dudleya. These Channel Island endemics also occur on San Miguel and Santa Cruz Islands. The other dudleya species, Santa Rosa Island live-forever and munchkin dudleya, occur just on<br /> Santa Rosa Island and they grow only on the island's eastern tip. See page 58 for more information about these unique dudleyas.</p> <h3>Wild Cucumber</h3> <p>Another plant that evolved to deal with the dry conditions of southern California (average rainfall on Santa Rosa is approximately 19 inches) is the vine-like wild cucumber that often can be seen along the hillsides in the oak understory. This plant has an immense, poisonous, fleshy root, or underground tuber, that stores water and nutrients.<br /> <br /> Wild cucumber is one of the very first flowers to bloom from January to June. The plant sprawls over trees, shrubs, and the ground, leaving a tangle of dried stems and leaves by midsummer. In spring however, the wild cucumber forms large, egg-shaped, bright green fruits covered with big soft green prickles that turn hard and spiny as the fruits dry.<br /> <br /> Inside are large seeds. The Chumash made necklaces of these seeds, polishing them along their oiled bodies. They were used also as marbles by Chumash children.</p> <h3>Other Native Plant Species</h3> <p>Other plants to look for include giant coreopsis, scouring rush, coastal goldenbush, indian pink, Santa Cruz Island buckwheat, island red buckwheat, and California poppy.</p>",

One is a solar hot water panel—a grey metal box, about one foot high, with two pipes attached, one with a spigot. The other is a photovoltaic panel, only about 2 inches high. The building has reddish brown, horizontal, wood plank siding. A shallow porch, with railings, wraps around two sides of the building, covered by a roof overhand, supported by posts and beams. You can access the porch two ways. On the building’s left side is a handicapped accessible ramp. The front side of the building has stairs with railings and five risers. On the ground next to the stairs is a metal box with two thick brushes that face inward. On the front side, the porch has a bulletin board on the wall, flanked by doors for two unisex restrooms. On the side of the porch is a large deep sink, with an adjacent wide wooden counter with a backboard, that overhangs and slants down toward the sink. From the restroom location, you can see fifteen shelters—three-sided wooden structures with grey shingled roofs. Each structure is shaped like a hexagon that has been cut in half, open on the side that faces the ocean. Each wall surface of the exterior of these shelters has a solid sheet of tan-colored siding. The interior walls are unfinished open frame construction. Mounted to one interior side wall is a metal box, about one foot high by two feet wide by one foot deep. Metal pegs and hooks on the walls are used to hang clothing and gear. A translucent fiberglass panel at the top of the back wall provides some natural light. Each shelter site has a picnic table located in or near the shelter. Tents are pitched in or near the shelters as well. The shelter sites are about 40 feet apart from each other. At the edge of the campground, on the downhill side, is a water station. This is a two and a half foot tall wooden post, with a pipe running up it to a faucet on top. Surrounding it on the ground is a wooden frame filled with rocks. The post has a water faucet, a small metal box screwed into its side. A wooden plaque with a sign that reads, Please help protect our wildlife. Please do not rinse dishes, brush teeth, or use soap at the water faucets. Please wash dishes at the large sink next to bathroom. Thank you.",

    "audioDescription": "You are standing on section of a dirt road, where it narrows down to a trail as it crosses the bottom of Water Canyon. The bottom of Water Canyon, as curves up from here, is filled with line of willow trees. A creek flows down from the canyon, ending in a long, narrow lagoon with olive green colored water, that stretches out toward the sandy shoreline. Lining the sides of the lagoon are tall cattails, with upright stalks and narrow green leaves, and, in season, brown cylindrical spikes, shaped like broom handles. On its approach down into the canyon and the lagoon, the road cuts though the surrounding hillsides, exposing alternating horizontal layers of rocks and sandy soils. Clinging to these rocky surfaces are dudleya, a low-growing, fleshy succulent with a waxy coating, and yellow flowers on a tall thin stalk, in season. The rest of the hillsides are covered in grasses and scrubby brush made up of a variety of plants: Sagebrush, with a thin stalk, with feathery leaves, like dill, and a tall spike at the tip, covered with tiny flowers in spring. Toyon, a small tree with dark green, oval leaves with tiny white flowers in summer and clusters of bright red berries in late fall and early winter. Island buckwheat, with soft rounded grey-green leaves and, in season, pink flowers at the end of slender stalks. Coastal prickly pear, a broad cactus with pancake-shaped leaves covered with thorny spines and, in season, broad yellow flowers.",

Unlike the other buildings nearby, it has horizontal board siding, but has a compatible red tile roof, installed around 1980, which was originally asbestos/concrete shingles. At an unknown date, the building was sandblasted, which damaged the wood siding and allows fungus and mildew to build up.

It has two-story-high arched windows on the front and sides, an arched door on the front, facing the ocean, and a round window above the door. In the distance is a view of the western end of Anacapa Island. From 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock, the hill slopes down toward the ocean, with California's mainland in the distance. The meadow is filled with restored plant species, including coreopsis, alkali heath, gum plant, yarrow, needlegrass, California barley, giant ryegrass, live-forever, buckwheat, and golden- bush. <br /><br />At the far edge of the meadow, rocky outcrops mark the top of the cliff at the edge of the island. Ventura County is seen on the mainland in the distance. At 2 o'clock is the Visitor Center building with nearby latrine bathrooms and a flat, black solar panel that generates electricity from sunlight. Two additional white buildings with clay roofs are nearby. At 3 o'clock the trail leads downhill toward these buildings. Further away is a grey storage building with a very large solar panel. Beyond that building is the white, cylindrical Anacapa lighthouse, about 6 stories tall.

You may notice the broad, elevated coastal plain stretching in front of you, one of six on the island. These plains are remnants of what geologists call \"marine terraces\"-ancient shorelines carved flat by wave action and exposed through changes in sea level and tectonic uplift of the land. A future marine terrace (called a wave-cut platform) is being created today by wave erosion at the base of the sea cliffs.<br /> <br /> The Channel Islands' first shoreline was created around five million years ago, when compressional forces, caused by the ramming of Baja California into southern California, resulted in the folding and faulting of marine sediments and volcanic rocks (deposited between 15-30 million years ago) and the eventual uplift of the islands. These compressional forces are still ongoing, making this area geologically active today-Santa Barbara Island, as well as the other Channel Islands, continues to be uplifted.<br /> <br /> Ever since these compressional forces caused the islands to emerge from the sea, the Channel Islands have been separated from the mainland. And unlike the four northern islands, which were once joined as a single, \"super island\" known as Santarosae, Santa Barbara Island has never been connected to another neighboring island.<br /> <br /> For decades, however, scientists assumed that the northern islands (Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands) were connected to the mainland by a land bridge, but as bathymetric information (or topography) of the sea floor improved, it revealed that even during periods of lowest sea levels (about 17,000 years ago), the islands still remained isolated by at least four miles of ocean. It is this continuous geographical isolation that has shaped island life.<br /> <br /> <b><strong>Santarosae</strong></b><br /> Although never connected to the mainland by a land bridge, the four northern islands were once part of the Pleistocene 'superisland' known as Santarosae, nearly four times as large as the combined areas of the modern Channel Islands. The dark shaded area on the map depicts ancient coast of Santarosae and California around 20,000 years ago when sea level was 100 meters (approximately 350 feet) lower than it is today. As the ice sheets and glaciers melted and the sea level rose, only the highest parts of Santarosae remained as modern islands.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a gently sloping ridge, about halfway up Signal Peak, a rounded hill. In clear weather, there are views of Webster Point down the slope to the northwest, and of the ocean on either side of that point. Webster Point is a rocky peninsula of land that sticks out into the ocean like a large paw with pointed claws. The claw closest to us curls toward us, creating a tiny, sheltered cove. Just inland from that cove, a deep canyon cuts into the plateau at the shoreline. As the shoreline curves south toward us, the rocky slopes rise up into tall, steep, rocky cliffs.<br /><br />Near us is an eight-foot wide wooden bench, on two posts, facing Webster Point. Be careful if you decide to sit on it as it is covered with white seagull droppings. On the ground, a few feet in front of it, is a railroad tie-a thick wooden beam about 8 inches by 10 inches by 6 feet in length.<br /><br />The land around you is mostly bare soil, with patches of grass, and an occasional clump of scrub brush, only a few inches high. The soil has tiny fragments of broken shells and white rocks. There is a darker blanket of vegetation downslope, closer to Webster Point.",

If it was a rain cloud, it meant rain.\" It’s possible that -tikay-, meaning 'to hide something,' is the root of this word, referring to the clouds which collect on the peak.<br /> <br /> Please see \"Ethnographic Island Place Names\" below for more information on island place names.</em><br /> <br /> <em><strong>Except for the beach at Frenchy's Cove, West Anacapa is designated as a Research Natural Area and is closed to the public in order to protect nesting California brown pelicans.</strong></em><br /> <br /> Anacapa Island, the other Channel Islands, and all their associated islets and offshore rocks comprise one of the largest breeding centers on the west coast for sea birds and shore birds. Their isolation and freedom from predators and human disturbance, and the abundance of food in the cold, nutrient-rich ocean waters, make them an ideal place for marine birds to breed and rear their young.<br /> <br /> On the north slopes of West Anacapa, California brown pelicans typically nest and raise their young from January through October. In fact, West Anacapa has the largest and most consistently used brown pelican nesting colony on the West Coast of the United States. Brown pelicans will abandon their nests if disturbed, leaving the eggs and chicks defenseless against predators such as gulls and ravens. A serious disturbance can cause an entire colony to be abandoned. For this reason Anacapa's isolation is a critical factor in the successful nesting of these seabirds.<br /> <br /> But even the island's isolation could not protect California brown pelicans from human impacts. The gathering of eggs, disturbance of rookeries, and pesticides have all been detrimental. The pesticide DDT nearly caused the pelican to become extinct as a breeding species on the west coast of the United States. In 1970, on neighboring Anacapa Island, only 552 nesting attempts were made with just one chick surviving. On October 13, 1970, the brown pelican was listed as an endangered species.<br /> <br /> Today, the recovery of the California brown pelican and other seabird species continues as their isolated island home is ensured protection within Channel Islands National Park. Through monitoring and restoration programs, the park and its partners are working to conserve critical nesting habitat and to protect the integrity of island and marine ecosystems that support 90 percent of the seabird populations in southern California.<br /> <br /> <b>Ethnographic Island Place Names</b><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Larus occidentalis</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> Western gulls are the most abundant breeding seabird in the Channel Islands National Park, with a population estimated at more than 15,000. The western gull, a big bulky bird, is a bold, skillful hunter and scavenger. For the most part, western gulls are coastal dwellers that concentrate mainly in the Southern California area. Due to their opportunistic nature and adaptability, they can also thrive in an urban environment. Unfortunately, because of close proximity to human environs, they are also subject to abnormal environmental pressures.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>Found along the along Pacific Coast of North America with breeding sites from central Baja California north to Washington.</li> <li>Relatively limited in distribution compared to most North American gulls.</li> <li>Large colonies are found on Santa Barbara and Anacapa Islands.</li> <li>Western Gulls nest on offshore islands, rocks along the coast, and on islands inside estuaries.</li> <li>They nest on the ground and fill the nest with vegetation, feathers, rope, plastic, or other items they find.</li> <li>In colonies with many more females than males present, two females may establish a pair bond. Each lays eggs, and then takes care of the double-sized brood.</li> <li>The female-biased sex ratio of some western gull colonies may have been the result of pollution by pesticides that acted like estrogen and made some male embryos develop as females.</li> <li>It takes four years for a western gull to achieve its gray and white appearance.</li> <li>They can live up to 25 years old.</li> <li>Western gulls feed only on the ocean's surface and do not dive like many other seabird species.</li> <li>Like most gulls, the western gull is an opportunistic feeder, capturing its own live prey, scavenging refuse, or stealing food from seals and other gulls.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The adult western gull has a deep gray back and wings, with black wing-tips that blend into the rest of the wing, unlike many species where the black is clearly defined. The underwing is white with a narrow band of gray. The head is mostly white, with a limited amount of brown streaking, especially in non-breeding plumage. The large bill is yellow with a red spot, and the eye is dark yellow. The western gull is a four-4 year gull, meaning that it takes four years to achieve adult plumage. Juveniles are mottled brown, with a dark bill and dark eyes, and pinkish-gray legs. This plumage varies and takes on more of the adult plumage characteristics in each successive year.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The western gull is confined to the immediate Pacific coast and its adjacent waters. The islets of Anacapa, which is part of the Channel Islands National Park, hosts the largest protected breeding colony of western gulls in the world with over 10,000 gulls gathering during nesting season from May through July. There is also a sizeable colony of western gulls (approximately 7,000 pairs) on Santa Barbara Island.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Western gulls spend their life along the ocean and its adjacent waters. They usually breed on near-shore islands and human-made structures, but search for food at sea, along estuaries, and on the shoreline. Wintering gulls may move farther out to sea, but also forage and rest on buildings, parking lots, seaside parks, landfills, and jetties.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Western gulls feed over the open ocean or along rocky shores. When the western gull spots its prey, it captures it by pecking, grabbing, and shallow diving. The bird's omnivorous diet includes squid, clams, mussels, sea urchins, eggs, chicks, adult birds, zooplankton, and small fish like anchovy, whiting, eel, and rockfish. Other oceanic species use the western gull to find prey. In turn, this gull may follow seals to locate food. This resourceful bird scavenges the carcasses of large mammals and when their normal sources of food are diminished, gulls are quick to take advantage of an easy food source such as trash and leftover scraps. By exploiting unnatural food resources their population may be growing larger than it would naturally thus upsetting the ecosystem balance.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> Western gulls choose a nest site out of the wind, and out of sight from other gulls. In colonies with many more females than males present, two females may establish a pair bond. Each lays eggs, and then takes care of the double-sized brood. In late April or May, the female lays two to three light olive to green eggs with dark markings. Both parents incubate; after 4 -5 weeks the gray, downy chicks with black spots hatch. Within a day, the chicks can walk and soon leave the nest. They freely scramble after regurgitated food. If the third chick is not fed enough, it may leave the territory. Neighboring gulls sometimes kill wayward chicks, but adoption is frequent. Chicks play by chasing or tugging on objects. Juveniles fledge in about seven weeks and are usually fed for three months, but sometimes follow adults and beg for up to six months.</p> <p><strong>Migration</strong><br /> Many western gulls do not migrate; the rest cover very short distances to remain on the Pacific coast of North America. Some move south of the breeding range into Baja California. Fall movements peak in October and most adult birds return to their breeding grounds in March.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> Populations of western gulls have restricted range and therefore, are vulnerable to oil pollution, ocean acidification, and climate change. In addition, they have also suffered from human disturbances and in the past, introduced black rats on Anacapa Island. Visit Seabirds for more information about restoration activities on Anacapa to remove black rats.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.audubon.org/\">National Audubon Society</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\">Bird Life International</a></li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Reithrodontomys megalotis</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The western harvest mouse is the smallest of the rodent species found in Channel Islands National Park. It occurs only on Santa Cruz Island within the park, but also on Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands. The species may have reached San Clemente Island via hay bales in the 1930s, whereas harvest mice may have been inadvertently introduced to Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina in native American canoes.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>In 1951, noted zoologist and professor at UC Berkeley, Dr. Oliver Pearson, named and described this species on the islands.</li> <li>The western harvest mouse has a broad range in western North America but is only found only on three of the eight Channel Islands-Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, and San Clemente Islands.</li> <li>Females can breed at 4 months of age, and in a year will have from two to three litters.</li> <li>The western harvest mouse appears to be strictly nocturnal.</li> <li>The initial census of this species on the islands thought the numbers to be very small, which subsequently proved inaccurate.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> The western harvest mouse is a slim, medium sized mouse with adult lengths ranging from 4 ½ to 6 ½ inches in length and weight from 3 to 8 ounces. It is distinguishable from the island deer mouse by its smaller head, body size and it's relatively much longer tail, including the grooves on the anterior face of the upper incisors. It has a brownish back, buff-colored sides, and a white underside. There is an indistinct dark broad stripe along its spine. The tail is from about 2 to 4 inches in length, sparsely haired, dorsally grey while white underneath. The ears are naked giving them a prominent, flesh-color or a buffy-cinnamon color. The western harvest mouse only has 4 digits on the forefeet. The hind feet are ½ inch to ¾ inch in length with 5 digits.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> The western harvest mouse, besides having a range through much of western North America, is distributed throughout California. It is common to abundant in shrub lands, grasslands, and in early several stages of most habitats statewide (except at some high elevations, although lower than 1600 feet).</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> Across its range the western harvest mouse inhabits sagebrush, steppe, and agricultural areas. The western harvest mouse dwells in areas below 1600 feet. It forages in grasslands bordering riparian areas such as irrigation right of ways, coastal marshes, streams, or lakes. The western harvest mouse is often considered an edge species. It is important for the western harvest mouse to have shrub or grass overstory with tall lush herbaceous cover to conceal its nests. They typically build above-ground nests in dense grass or herbaceous vegetation.</p> <p>On Santa Cruz Island, their distribution was previously thought to be limited to the marsh area at Prisoner's Harbor. Recent surveys found them to be much more widely distributed on the island, but at relatively low numbers (especially when compared to the numerous island deer mice), due to their need for dense grass or herbaceous cover (which is patchily distributed on Santa Cruz. The species is more numerous on Santa Catalina Island, which may be an indication of that island's recovery from non-native grazers.</p> <p><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> The western harvest mouse appears to be strictly nocturnal. It is most active before midnight, on moonless or overcast nights. Minimum activity occurs between 6:00 am and noon. This mouse is active year round utilizing trails built by other small mammals. Their food is mostly vegetable matter, chiefly seeds, leaves, and stems of grasses and forbs, although occasionally insects, such as grasshoppers, crickets, and beetles, may be eaten.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The western harvest mouse may have more than one nest within its home range to use as rest sites. The nests are about the size and shape of a baseball, consisting of grass lined with fine plant material. These nests are located on the ground in clumps of grass, shrubs, or logs, or hanging from vegetation. Each nest has a small entrance on its underside leading to a golf ball sized chamber lined with dandelion fluff or a similar material.</p> <p>The western harvest mouse has a high potential reproductive rate. Females can breed at 4 months of age. It births litters averaging 4 young, but ranging anywhere from 1-9 young. The female is able to become pregnant more than once a year, with a gestation period of 23 or 24 days. It breeds throughout the year with the exception of late winter in the southern part of its range. In northern parts of its range, this harvest mouse breeds only in late spring and summer (usually 2-3 litters).</p> <p>The young weigh ½ ounce or less at birth and are naked, pink, and blind. The mouse's eyes open 10-12 days after birth and they are weaned 19 days after birth. The western harvest mouse goes through 3 pelages: juvenile, sub-adult, and adult. The juvenile pelage is rather wooly and dull grey. The adult pelage is relatively brighter. Molting starts on the ventral surface and spreads over the flanks to meet on the back. A second point of origin is on the muzzle, the new coat spreads back forming a molt line behind the ears. This specie molts once annually during the summer.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> According to the IUCN, (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources), this species is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, tolerance of a broad range of habitats, occurrence in a number of protected areas, and because it does not appear to be under threat and is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category.</p> <p>In 1998 the California Department of Fish and Game considered the species to be one of special concern.</p> <p>The recent removal of feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island should improve habitat for harvest mice, which may become more widely and densely distributed on the island.</p> <p>Additional Information</p> <ul> <li>Jack C. von Bloeker, Jr. Land Mammals of the Southern California Islands</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.sibr.com/mammals/M113.html\">http://www.sibr.com/mammals/M113.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://iws.org/CISProceedings/7th_CIS_Proceedings/Drost_et_al.pdf\">http://iws.org/CISProceedings/7th_CIS_Proceedings/Drost_et_al.pdf</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://eol.org/pages/328436/overview\">http://eol.org/pages/328436/overview</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www4.uwsp.edu/biology/facilities/vertebrates/mammals%20of%20wisconsin/reithrodontomys%20megalotis/reithrodontomys%20megalotis%20page.htm\">http://www4.uwsp.edu/biology/facilities/vertebrates/mammals of wisconsin/reithrodontomys megalotis/reithrodontomys megalotis page.htm</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.dfg.ca.gov/\">http://www.dfg.ca.gov</a></li> <li>Terrestrial Mammal Species of Special Concern in California, Bolster, B.C., Ed., 1998</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/19410/0\">http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/19410/0</a></li> <li>Collins and George 1990: <a href=\"http://www.nhm.org/site/sites/default/files/pdf/contrib_science/CS420.pdf\">http://www.nhm.org/site/sites/default/files/pdf/contrib_science/CS420.pdf</a></li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Scientific Name</strong><br /> <em>Charadrius alexandrinus</em></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br /> The western snowy plover is a threatened small shorebird, approximately the size of a sparrow. During the breeding season, March through September, plovers can be seen nesting along the shores, peninsulas, offshore islands, bays, estuaries, and rivers of the United States' Pacific Coast.In Channel Islands National Park, it is a permanent resident on Santa Rosa Island and is a summer resident on Santa Cruz Island. Owing to the species' dramatic decline, a recovery program was developed and instituted in 2007 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service.</p> <p><strong>Quick and Cool Facts</strong></p> <ul> <li>The snowy plover frequently raises two broods a year, and sometimes three in places where the breeding season is long.</li> <li>The female deserts her mate and brood about the time the chicks hatch and initiates a new breeding attempt with a different male.</li> <li>Young snowy plover leave their nest within three hours of hatching. They flatten themselves on the ground when a parent signals the approach of people or potential predators. They walk, run, and swim well and forage unassisted by parents, but require periodic brooding for many days after hatching.</li> <li>The snowy plover performs broken-wing displays to distract a potential predator away from the nest.

Encountering a mass of the flies on the beach, a plover runs through the cloud of insects with its mouth open, snapping at them to catch them in mid-air.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Appearance</strong><br /> Plovers are small birds with long, dark or grayish feet and legs, a short dark bill, large eyes, a rounded head, and long, narrow wings that end in a sharp point. These birds have cryptic coloration. The color of their dorsal areas matches and blends with their surroundings, making them well camouflaged and difficult to see against the sand. They turn away from predators, sometimes crouching to hide their darker head and breast markings. When the birds stop running they seem to disappear, blending into the surroundings.These little birds are sand-colored above and white below, with a narrow dark stripe on the forehead and a dark stripe behind the eyes. They have two, small, dark, partial breast bands and dark ear patches. In breeding season the distinctive markings are darker in males than in females. In winter the difference in sexes is less apparent.</p> <p><strong>Range</strong><br /> Most western snowy plovers that breed in California's Central Valley and the Great Salt Lake migrate to California and Mexican coasts for the winter. During the winter months they rest and eat to build up their fat reserves for the migration to their summer breeding habitats. The California Pacific coast resident population usually congregates on sand spits and dune-backed beaches. In more urban areas they can be found on bluff-backed beaches.</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong><br /> In Channel Islands National Park, it is a permanent resident on Santa Rosa Island and is a summer resident on Santa Cruz Island. On the Channel Islands they forage in the wet sand and amidst surf-cast kelp in the intertidal zone and in dry, sandy areas above the high tide. In winter, snowy plovers are found on many of the beaches used for nesting as well as on beaches where they do not nest, and on estuarine sand and mud flats.</p> <p align=\"justify\"><strong>Feeding</strong><br /> Snowy plovers are primarily visual foragers, using the run-stop-peck method of feeding. They forage on invertebrates in the wet sand and amongst surf-cast kelp within the inter-tidal zone, in dry, sandy areas above the high tide, on salt pans, on spoil sites, and along the edges of salt marshes, salt ponds, and lagoons. They sometimes probe for prey in the sand and pick insects from low-growing plants. Western snowy plovers have a unique way to catch a meal of kelp or wrack flies. Encountering a mass of the flies on the beach, a plover runs through the cloud of insects with its mouth open, snapping at them to catch them in mid-air. Adults forage on invertebrates primarily along the water's edge.</p> <p><strong>Reproduction</strong><br /> The nesting season extends from early March through September, with peak nesting occurring from mid-April through mid-August. Their nests typically are shallow scrapes or depressions on the ground on flat, open areas with sandy or saline substrates, where vegetation and driftwood is sparse or absent. Plover nests are camouflaged and are barely visible to even the well-trained eye. 7 Typically, the plover lays three highly camouflaged eggs in the incubating process;this takes about 28 days, with the females sit on the eggs during the day, the males at night. To distract a potential predator away from the nest, the snowy plover performs broken-wing displays. By acting injured the bird appears to be easy prey and the predator's attention is drawn to the bird. The snowy plover frequently raises two broods a year, and sometimes three in places where the breeding season is long.The female deserts her mate and brood about the time the chicks hatch and initiates a new breeding attempt with a different male.</p> <p>Snowy plover chicks are about the size of a person's thumb when they hatch. They leave their nest within three hours of hatching. They flatten themselves on the ground when a parent signals the approach of people or potential predators. They walk, run, and swim well and forage unassisted by parents, but require periodic brooding for many days after hatching. Chicks reach fledging age about one month after hatching.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Status</strong><br /> The Pacific coast population of the western snowy plover was listed as threatened by the Fish and Wildlife Service on March 5, 1993. The population has declined due to many factors. Recreational and other human disturbance, loss of habitat to urban development, introduction of beachgrass and other nonnative species, and expanding predator populations have all contributed to a decline in active nesting areas and in the size of the breeding and wintering populations. It is estimated that about 2,000 snowy plovers may breed along the U.S. Pacific Coast and that there are 157 current or historical snowy plover breeding or wintering locations along the U.S. Pacific Coast (USFWS 2001).</p> <p>Channel Islands National Park is one of the few locations in southern California that still supports breeding and wintering populations of western snowy plovers. In the 1990s Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands had both breeding and wintering populations, but numbers have declined precipitously. A few birds also lived on The Nature Conservancy portion of Santa Cruz Island. On Santa Rosa Island the birds inhabited about 16 miles of coastline, while on San Miguel Island they were present on about 10 miles of shoreline (USFWS 2001). The Skunk Point area on Santa Rosa Island is an important nesting area and foraging area for juvenile and migrating plovers. Forty to fifty percent of the nests in this area have been found on rocky outcrops in the back dunes, about 490 to 980 feet (150 to 300 meters) from the shoreline (USFWS 1995).</p> <p>Much of the work done in the recovery and restoration of the western snowy plover on the west coast was based on a plan developed by the Pacific Coast Western Snowy Plover Recovery Team.This plan was acknowledged and utilized in 2007 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in their effort as the spearhead in the recovery effort. Much of the plan was implemented by the California Department of Parks and Recreation.</p> <p>A survey was taken in May 2012 that found the overall numbers of western snowy plovers on the west coast to be 1855, which was an increase from the initial recovery program survey in 2005. It is also a significant improvement over the population number of 1537, the number of plovers found in 2007 when the restoration program began. However, the species showed disappointing decline from a count of 1917 plovers in 2011.</p> <p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Snowy_Plover/lifehistory\">http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Snowy_Plover/lifehistory</a></li> <li><em><a href=\"http://sfbaywatertrail.org/discover-the-bay/about-bay-species/western-snowy-plover/\">http://sfbaywatertrail.org/discover-the-bay/about-bay-species/western-snowy-plover/</a></em></li> <li><em><a href=\"http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/AnimalDetails.aspx\">http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/AnimalDetails.aspx</a>?</em></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/western_snowy_plover\">http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/western_snowy_plover</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/plover_natural_history.pdf\">http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/plover_natural_history.pdf</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/arcata/es/birds/WSP/plover.html\">http://www.fws.gov/arcata/es/birds/WSP/plover.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/about_plovers.html\">http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/about_plovers.html</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/state_parks_sharing_beach_brochure.pdf\">http://www.westernsnowyplover.org/pdfs/state_parks_sharing_beach_brochure.pdf</a></li> <li>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2007.

Other whale watch operators are located in Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Channel Islands Harbors as well as down in the Los Angeles area.</em><br /> <br /> The waters surrounding Channel Islands National Park are home to many diverse and beautiful species of cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises). About one third of the cetacean species found worldwide can be seen right here in our own backyard, the Santa Barbara Channel. The 27 species sighted in the channel include gray, blue, humpback, minke, sperm, and pilot whales; orcas; Dall's porpoise; and Risso's, Pacific white-sided, common, and bottlenose dolphins.</p> <p>This diversity of cetacean species offers a great opportunity to whale watch year-round. The most common sightings are of gray whales from mid- to late-December through mid-March, blue and humpback whales during the summer, and common dolphins throughout the entire year. Whales and dolphins can be seen either from shore or from a boat. The best shore viewing is from a high spot on a point that juts out into the ocean. Some examples include Point Dume in Malibu, the Palos Verdes Peninsula near Los Angeles, and Point Loma in San Diego. The park visitor center has a tower with telescopes, which can be used for whale watching as well as island viewing. Watching in the early morning hours, before the wind causes whitecaps on the water's surface, will provide you with the best opportunity to see whales from shore.</p> <p>Closer viewing of whales is possible from public whale watching boats or private boats. Whales have been known to approach boats quite closely. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, boaters must stay at least 100 yards from whales unless the whale chooses to approach the boat.</p> <p>Many whales are on the endangered species list and should be treated with special care. All whales are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act; it is illegal to disturb or harm any marine mammal. Boaters who use private craft to watch whales must remember to stay at least 100 yards away from whales. Boaters who frighten or interrupt the whales' activities by approaching too close could drive the whales away from food or young calves. Please remember that whales are wild animals and can be unpredictable.</p> <p>We need to continue to explore the world of whales and dolphins. The well-being of the cetacean population is a good indication of the health of the ecosystem. Our ability to bring these species into the next century and beyond is an indication of the future of life on this planet. Every day we learn more about these mysterious and unique creatures that dwell beneath the water, yet rise above it to breathe.</p>",

J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

While the island has numerous perennial streams, water for domestic and livestock use had to be developed to provide adequate and healthy supplies. Other than a surface supply from Water Canyon, tapped by the Mores in the 1870s, developed sources of water on the island include only a remote spring and a system of wells located near the ranch complex.<br /> <br /> The More family developed a water system in the early 1870s to supply the ranch complex. A dam in Water Canyon, apparently no longer existing, impounded water that was delivered in riveted iron pipe for a distance of two miles.<br /> <br /> A circular, rock-lined reservoir at the ranch complex appears to have been fed by this line as well. Remnants of the original pipeline remain in Water Canyon, and the old reservoir is a landmark near the Russ Vail house, east of the south end of the eucalyptus windbreak. Part of the reservoir wall has been destroyed, and vegetation, including a eucalyptus tree, is encroaching.<br /> <br /> Vail & Vickers developed most of its cattle watering systems in the vicinity of the main ranch and Carrington Point. On the south side of the island, one small system was developed at Clapp Spring. While the island was well watered by natural sources (perennial streams), these sites needed development because of concentrations of cattle and lack of natural sources.<br /> <br /> The major source of water for ranch operations is located in the appropriately named Windmill Canyon west of the ranch house. At an unknown date before the 1930s someone drilled or dug a well and installed a windmill and a redwood storage tank. Water from this reliable source fed by gravity the ranch houses, outbuildings, and troughs in the ranch complex.<br /> <br /> For some time the Vails used a tractor or old Army vehicle on jacks to pump water from the well. Later the Vails built a pump house. As of 1984, two hand-dug wells, measuring four by four feet and 40 feet deep, were present; one was active, with a storage tank in place. In the late 1980s the NPS replaced and updated the well, windmill, and pump system. Water is piped from the sources in Windmill Canyon also to the NPS housing, campground, and main ranch residences.<br /> <br /> Clapp Spring, near the top of San Augustin Canyon, produces a fine and reliable water source. Water from the spring runs by gravity through a pipe from the springhouse at the source to a concrete watering trough on the Sierra Pablo road. No one knows who found and developed the spring. Clapp Spring allegedly got its name from an incident when its pure water cured an old cowboy's venereal disease. True or not, the water is excellent. Ranch workers bottled it in five-gallon containers for drinking water.<br /> <br /> For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the <strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> </strong></p>",

How did these shells get there? It must be the ocean at work-or is it?<br /> <br /> Archeologists identify these sites as \"middens,\" debris piles containing remnants of past societies-the Tongva, the Chumash, and their ancestors. The island's 30 or so midden sites suggest that occupation dates back at least 4,000 years, and probably even more than that. However, due to the lack of a steady supply of fresh water and the few terrestrial resources, permanent settlements were never established on Santa Barbara Island. The island was instead used on a seasonal basis and as a stopover between Santa Catalina and San Nicolas Islands.<br /> <br /> These midden sites offer us a window into the Tongva and Chumash world. By examining these sites, archeologists can piece together a picture of the ancient island life of these peoples. The Tongva and Chumash were skilled craftspeople and seafarers, with a vast knowledge of the world around them and how to use it for their survival. The predominance of shells and fish bones within the middens reveals that they subsisted primarily on fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms. They often plied the Santa Barbara Channel in search of this rich variety of marine food, traveling in tomols (canoes) made of redwood or pine planks caulked with tar from natural seeps.<br /> <br /> These middens also reveal that other items not available in this isolated island environment had to be traded for with villages on the mainland or other islands. One of the principal products manufactured and traded by the islanders were shell beads, which were used as currency of trade in the Tongva and Chumash areas and throughout California.<br /> <br /> To produce these beads, chert microdrills were used to bore holes in pieces of olivella snail shells. Chert, a hard, durable silica rock, was found in considerable quantities on Santa Cruz Island. Because Eastern Santa Cruz Island had chert of the proper type and quality needed for tool construction, this location became the center for manufacturing chert microdrills. One particular site contains evidence of the highest density of microdrill production in North America.<br /> <br /> Santa Barbara Island and the other Channel Islands were not isolated enough to protect the island Tongva and Chumash from the diseases the Spanish explorers and missionaries brought with them as they began colonizing California in the late 1700s. By the early 1800s, the island Tongva and Chumash had been devastated by measles and other introduced epidemics, as well as by drought and the disruption of their trade-based economy. The last of the islanders would leave their traditional island home by the mid-1800s.<br /> <br /> Although much of the islander's history and way of life has been lost, enough remains to remind us of this unique part of Santa Barbara Island's past. These midden sites, along with today's descendants of the island Tongva and Chumash, remind us how important and sacred these isolated islands are.<br />  </p> <p><b>Ancient Ocean Pathways Lead the Chumash Home</b><br /> In 1976, the Chumash Brotherhood of the Tomol built and paddled the tomol , helek (Peregrine Falcon), from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island. This historic ocean voyage, the first since the mid-1800s, brought the Chumash back to their island home and sustained their traditional way life.<br /> <br /> Then in 1997, a group of Chumash built the traditional style tomol , 'elye'wun (Swordfish), the first to be owned by the Chumash in 150 years, and paddled her from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island in 2001, completing the island circle begun by Helek .<br /> <br /> Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through annual tomol crossings to Santa Cruz Island. These journeys are an affirmation of tradition, which contemporary Chumash regard as a gift to their ancestors and children.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.<br /> <br /> <br /> <em><strong>Taking from or disturbing archeological sites or artifacts is a violation of state and federal law.

Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.</strong></em><br />  </p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash and Tongva History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash and Tongva on Santa Barbara Island</strong><br /> Due to the lack of fresh water and few terrestrial resources, Santa Barbara Island most likely did not support any permanent native settlements. Recent studies show evidence that occupation of the island dates back at least 4,000 years, suggesting seasonal visits to the island. Southern California Indians would have been drawn to the island by the rich marine life surrounding the rocky shores, being able to fish, harvest shellfish and hunt pinnipeds, as well as manufacture tools.<br /> <br /> Since early European explorers did not leave any indication of landing on the island, no information about native island use or occupancy of the island has come from those sources. Although the explorers did see the small island, it did not receive much documentation. Cabrillo's chroniclers dubbed the southern islands, which included Santa Barbara, the \"other islands of San Lucas.\" Sebastian Vizcaino gave the island its name in honor of the saint whose day was December 4, the day he arrived, in 1602.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a></p> <p><br /> <strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash. It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em><strong>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students,</strong></em> Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop . Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named ˜elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, ˜elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, ˜elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community</p>",

You are halfway between Arch Point and the Landing Cove. <br /><br />Circling above you are white sea gulls, with dark wings and tails. Their calls are a scratchy, hoarse mix of \"aow\" and \"ah-ah-ah\" sounds. More gulls can often be seen sitting on nests on the surrounding hillsides, evenly spaced apart from each other. Seen in contrast against the color of the ground cover, this creates a pattern of white dots that sometimes extends as far as the eye can see.<br />",

A number of vessels wrecked on or near the island although only one seemed to have been related to pilot error. The wreck of the <em>Winfield Scott</em> in 1853 was the most important of the Channel Islands shipwrecks.<br /> <br /> Westervelt and MacKay of New York built the <em>Winfield Scott</em> in 1850 for a route between New York and New Orleans. Named for the commanding general of the U. S. Army, Mexican War hero and presidential nominee, the 225-foot steam paddlewheeler began travel between the east and west coasts when she joined the New York and San Francisco Steamship Line in 1852. She set a record for that route (via Cape Horn) of less than 49 days. She then took passengers between Panama and San Francisco, usually in overcrowded conditions. In July of 1853 the Winfield Scott was sold to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.<br /> <br /> Loaded with over 300 passengers and crew and a reported $1 million in gold bullion (some accounts but the figure at $2 million), the <em>Winfield Scott</em> departed San Francisco on December 1, 1853. The next evening Captain Simon F. Blunt chose to pass through the Santa Barbara Channel to save time, but in a dense fog crashed into Middle Anacapa at full speed at 11:00 in the evening. Apparently Blunt had turned southeast thinking he had cleared Santa Cruz or Anacapa Islands. Purser Watkins gave this account, which was published by the Alta California:<br /> <br /> \"The ship's bow struck first, staving two holes in the bow; then, in backing off, her stern struck and knocked away her rudder. Most of the passengers had gone to bed but they came on deck in alarm. They could only look out into a thick fog and see nothing of the land. After losing the rudder, the ship drifted off the island a few hundred yards and then was swept back to strike the shore again with her bow. She had already taken on much water and now sank up to her guards.<br /> <br /> The Captain immediately sent out a boat to see where he could land the passengers. The purser reported that a little island separate from the main one was nearest and that the passengers could be placed on it for the night. The next morning the passengers, some mail, and the treasure were taken onto the main island. Captain Blunt stayed cool, provided bedding and provisions for the passengers, and moved among them unceasingly in his efforts to make them comfortable.\"<br /> <br /> After being brought from the small pinnacle some 200 yards offshore to the island in the ship's boats, the large group camped on the island for up to a week. The California saw smoke from the passengers' fires and rescued the women. It returned on December 9 and, in heavy swells, removed the rest of the passengers, leaving the ship's company on the island who attempted to save mail, baggage, furniture and some machinery from the wreck. Other boats appeared for salvage opportunities, including that of Captain Horatio Gates Trussell, who used wood and two brass thresholds from the wreck in the construction of his Santa Barbara home.<br /> <br /> On the 10th the steamer Southerner hove into sight and landed provisions for the officers and crew. Up to that time, the Winfield Scott had not been broken up by the action of the waves. When the Republic arrived the next day, however, the midship was sunk and Captain Blunt gave up all hope of saving her or getting her off the ledge. The crew went out to the ship and saved what they could before boarding the Republic for San Francisco. Some time later, the side-wheeler toppled off the ledge and sank. The valuable cargo was apparently saved although the lure of gold still attracts divers, who are prohibited by federal law from disturbing the wreck site.<br /> <br /> In 1894 and during World War II major salvage took place on the Winfield Scott. One firm blasted the wreck in order to remove hundreds of large copper bolts and much of the iron machinery. The wreck became popular to sport divers who are now prohibited by antiquity laws from removing any artifacts. The wreck of the Winfield Scott is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /> <br /> The wreck scatter is surveyed each year by the National Park Service. The scatter is considered to be small for such a large vessel, with the bow and stern missing. The most prominent piece of wreckage is purported to be the port paddle wheel, which stands above the bottom.</p>",

Prior to the December 7, 1941, bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japan, the United States activated a number of defense mechanisms on the Pacific Coast, but this event put coastal defenses at the forefront of military activity in California. Following the attack, at least three Japanese attacks occurred on the California coast, including the torpedoing of a freighter off Los Angeles and a submarine firing on the Ellwood Oil Field near Santa Barbara. The evolving war in the Pacific spawned a network of coastal lookout stations and aircraft warning installations from San Diego to the Canadian border. The Navy established coastal lookouts on all of the Channel Island, and radar posts on Santa Barbara and Santa Rosa Islands.<br /> <br /> The station consisted of a technical radar site overlooking the ocean near South Point, the housing and operations camp on a small, dry pond near Pecho Peak, and storage buildings and a barrack at Bechers Bay. The housing and operations camp had sixteen wood-frame buildings, including seven barracks, a mess hall, a bath house, a motor repair building, a generator building, various storage sheds, and a pit latrine. A water supply system was composed of one or two dams in upper Water Canyon and a lift system to a water tank, which then fed the water by gravity to the camp. The radar station included a buried concrete radio building, mobile anti-aircraft gun, buried five-room concrete operations or bunker building, generator house, storage building, pit latrine, water tank, and radar beacon unit.<br /> <br /> One of the most fascinating structures remaining at this Army camp is the flagstaff base, a concrete slab in the shape of a star, measuring 10 feet in diameter. A four-inch pipe supported the flagstaff, and the builders of the camp inscribed the date and their detachments in the slab: \"26 AUG 1943 / 770 / MP BATTALION / CO C / THIRD PLATOON\" and \"LAFW / 658 SIGNAL / AW CO / DET SIX.\" These inscriptions have provided the only clue as to who occupied the base: the 770th Military Police Battalion, Company C, Third Platoon and the Los Angeles Air Defense Wing, 658th Signal Corps Aircraft Warning Company, Detachment Six. Their activities, other than manning the radar site as a forward observation and warning system, which requires a relatively small crew, remains somewhat of a mystery. It is likely that the military police battalion used the island for training and provided general protection.<br /> <br /> After the Battle of Midway in June of 1942 the Japanese threat diminished, thus lessening the importance of outposts like this. The site was eventually abandoned by the end of 1945. The Army turned the camp over to Vail & Vickers, who used the buildings for a while, then disassembled them for materials or moved small ones to other locations on the island.<br /> <br /> <strong>For more detailed historical information and citations, please refer to the </strong> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/CHIS-Historic-Resource-Study-FINAL.pdf\">Historic Resource Study: Island Legacies - A History of the Islands within Channel Islands National Park </a> _</p>",

Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.</em><br />  </p> <p><u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u><br /> <br /> <b>Chumash on Santa Rosa Island</b><br /> Archaeologist Phil Orr's discovery of human bones in 1959 at Arlington Springs provided evidence of the oldest known habitation of the island. Recently radio-carbon dated to 13,000 years before present, these are among the oldest securely-dated human remains in North America. The age of the Arlington remains and a host of archeological sites on the Channel Islands that date to the late Holocene (10,000-6,500 years before present) indicate an early migration route from the Old World into North America along the West Coast.<br /> <br /> Santa Rosa Island and the other Channel Islands provided rich resources for seafaring peoples to thrive by hunting seabirds, sea mammals, fish and shellfish. With extensive trade networks on the mainland, the island Chumash were able to trade marine resources with mainland peoples for goods they could not harvest or produce on the island. With plentiful food and fresh water, the island supported several villages at the time of European contact.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo sailed up the coast of California in 1542, the first European to visit the Channel Islands, and documented three villages on Santa Rosa Island. A half-century later, Sebastian Rodriguez CermeÃ±o wrote about his interaction with the Chumash on the south side of the island on December 13, 1595, as he sailed southward along the coast: \"...and there came alongside a small boat like a canoe, with two Indians in it rowing. And having arrived at the launch, they brought some eighteen fish and a seal and gave them to us, for which we gave them some pieces of taffeta and cotton cloth in order that they should bring more. They went on shore and returned in the same boat with three Indians and brought nothing, At this island we went fishing with lines and caught some thirty fishlike cabrillas sea bass], which we soon ate on account of our great hunger....On both [Santa Rosa Island and Santa Cruz Island] the land is bare and sterile, although inhabited by Indians, there are no ports or coves in them in which to take shelter.\"<br /> <br /> <b>Chumash on the Channel Islands</b><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word <strong>Michumash</strong> , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <b>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</b><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using <strong>tomols</strong> . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by <strong>yop</strong> , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the <strong>tomol</strong> ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the <strong>tomol</strong> allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. <strong> 'Achum</strong> , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the <strong> tomol</strong> by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <b>Missionization</b><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <b>Contemporary Chumash</b><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br /> <br /> <strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong><br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> was married to the <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After <strong>Alchupo'osh</strong> gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. <strong>Limuw</strong> was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy <strong>Hutash</strong> . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, <strong>Hutash</strong> had the idea of making a bridge out of a <strong>wishtoyo</strong> (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on <strong>Limuw</strong> all the way to <strong>Tzchimoos</strong> , the tall mountain near <strong>Mishopshno</strong> (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> <strong>Hutash</strong> told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. <strong>Hutash</strong> felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students </em>. Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong><br /> Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called <strong>tomols</strong> , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called <strong>yop</strong> . <strong>Yop</strong> is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The <strong>tomol</strong> is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the <strong>Brotherhood of the Tomol</strong> . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built <strong>Helek</strong> , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of <strong> tomol</strong> construction. It was the first <strong>tomol</strong> built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long <strong>tomol </strong> which they named <strong>˜Elye'wun</strong> (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, <strong>˜Elye'wun</strong> made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the <strong>tomol </strong> began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the <strong>tomol</strong> and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, <strong>˜Elye'wun</strong> again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of <strong>Swaxil</strong> , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the <strong>tomol </strong> was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.<br /> <br /> <b>Ethnographic Island Place Names</b><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s. J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</strong></em></p>   <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing on a plateau, near the edge of a cliff that drops down to a sandy shoreline. Near the cliffs edge, a fence of metal poles and barbed wire has been blown over and is almost touching the ground. The plateau is blanketed in long grass and patches of coastal goldenbush, low plants with stalks covered in tiny grey-green leaves, and topped by small clusters of yellow flowers in spring and early summer. Nearby, a small canyon cuts inland, creating deeper a pocket beach on the sandy shore below. The tops of bright green shrubs or small trees can be seen, growing down along the bottom of the side canyon. <br /><br />If you are facing the ocean, you are looking east. Toward the southeast, the pier extends out into the ocean. It has sturdy pole supports, shaped like telephone poles; a long walkway with railing:, and, at the end, a platform with a large loading crane. <br /><br />To the south is a wooden fence, that continues back to some white, single story ranch buildings. Near the center of the fence, a small section is missing. In the distance, beyond another fence, is a small white wooden building, two two-story red-brown barn-like buildings, and several smaller, single-story wooden sheds. There are also squares of fencing, creating small pens, and a tall triangular metal structure. <br /><br />Near the buildings are some tall trees. Beyond them are rolling grassy hills with patches of grey-green scrub brush, and farther in the distance, a taller mountain ridge.<br />",

Radiocarbon dating suggests that this village was first populated over 1,000 years ago. Ethnographic records indicate that qʰšiwqʰšiw was the largest of Santa Rosa's historic villages, with about 120 inhabitants and four important Chumash chiefs. Many living Chumash descendants can trace their ancestry to this village.<br /> <br /> The area around East Point is dotted with other archeological sites, spanning several millennia. The majority of these sites are small campsites. It is presumed that, during the course of cultural evolution on the islands, the inhabitants of Santa Rosa Island moved from a foraging strategy (moving their campsites seasonally to be near a particular resource) to a collection strategy, where people lived in centralized residential bases (such as a village) and made excursions to resource areas.<br /> <br /> It is not yet known when or how this shift was accomplished. Studying the relationship of these smaller sites and contrasting them with the larger sites across the landscape and through time may one day help us answer this question.<br /> <br /> <b>Ethnographic Island Place Names</b><br /> Ethnographic island place names aid in native language revitalization, illustrate cultural values, and provide tangible connections to cultural landscapes and seascapes.<br /> <br /> Many of these place names were recorded by ethnographers and anthropologists in the late 1800 and early 1900s.

    "audioDescription": "You are on a sandy trail that crosses a broad valley, where the creek curves toward the coastline, then widens out to form a large marsh—Abalone Rocks marsh—and a lagoon, a wider body of water. A thin strip of sand usually separates the lagoon from the ocean, except when higher river water levels carve a channel through the sand, allowing the water to flow all the way into the ocean. During breeding season, small tan birds, with white heads and black collars, may sometimes be found, nesting on the sandy beach. The valley is grassy near the shoreline, but this grass is dried and brown for most of the year. The back of the valley is dominated by the scrubby green baccharis plant, also known as coyote brush, making it green year-round.

The island was home to the largest population of island Chumash and developed a highly complex society dependent on marine harvest, craft specialization and trade with mainland groups. The Santa Cruz Island Chumash produced shell beads that they used for currency, which formed an important part of the overall Chumash economy. Those living on the east end of the island mined chert from the numerous island outcroppings to make tiny blades for drilling holes to make the shell disc beads. Native villagers had no known contact with outsiders until the 16th and early 17th centuries. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who is credited with the first European exploration of the California coast, observed at least six villages, though he and his crew never stopped at the island. The villages were called Niquipos, Mazul, Xuga, Nitel, Macamo, and Nimitapal . Cabrillo named the island San Lucas, although the Chumash called it Limuw .<br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash, from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students</em>. Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop. Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol. The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek, which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named 'Elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, 'Elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, 'Elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil, now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p>   <p> </p>",

J.P. Harrington was an ethnographer who worked for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1915 to 1955. He interviewed American Indian consultants, including Chumash and Gabrielino Tribal members, and recorded information about native languages and culture.<br /> <br /> Chumash Indians Fernando Librado (Kitsepawit) and Juan Estevan Pico were the main sources for island place names. They were both born and raised in Ventura. They learned of the island places from Chumash elders, most notably Ursula (of wima) and Martina (of limuw.) Pico's interviews of Martina resulted in a list of island place names given in order from east to west (or vice/versa,) to anthropologist, H.W. Henshaw. Anthropologists have cross-referenced Pico's list with the archeological record, baptismals, and marriage patterns.<br /> <br /> Twenty-six new place names were recently identified and mapped by Mark Vestuto (Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians; Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival) with assistance from Kristin Hoppa (Archeologist, Channel Islands National Park) and the Chumash community. These names reference island peaks, water, landforms, islets, trails, caves, and beaches.<br /> <br /> <em>Please note that lowercase is used because capitalization is a convention in English which poses problems in the writing of native languages.</em></p>",

At the time of European contact (Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo's voyage in 1542) the village was home to approximately 95-160 Chumash, including many high-ranking families, a powerful chief, and tomol (plank canoe) owners.<br /> <br /> Xaxas appears to be the first place that Europeans set foot on Santa Cruz Island. During the land-and-sea expedition of Gaspar de Portolá in 1769, Father Francisco Palóu wrote that the Chumash at Xaxas welcomed the visitors \"with demonstrations of great joy\" and offered fish and helped with the water gathering. The newcomers gave them glass beads in return. The missionaries aboard the ship decided to go ashore to visit the village, where \"they were well received and presented with fish, in return for which the Indians were given some strings of beads.\" The priests returned to the ship and soon realized that they had left their staff at the village. They immediately gave it up as lost because it carried an iron cross and they believed that the Chumash would desire the metal. However, at daybreak an island dweller paddled his tomol to the ship and returned the staff with the cross. Climbing on board he delivered it to the priest and after being rewarded returned to the island. The island was subsequently called the Island of the Holy Cross (Santa Cruz) by the European explorers.<br /> <br /> Although Chumash occupation of Santa Cruz Island ended in the early 19th century, many individuals who trace their ancestry to specific villages retain a lively interest in the preservation and management of their heritage.<br /> <br /> <em>Taking from or disturbing archeological sites or artifacts is a violation of state and federal law. The archeological sites around the Channel Islands are a testament to the importance of the Chumash and other American Indians. Archeological sites are sacred to Chumash peoples today, are protected by federal law, and are a vital nonrenewable scientific resource. Please help us in protecting and preserving this rich part of California's heritage.</em><br /> <br /> <u><strong>More Chumash History</strong></u></p> <p><strong>Chumash on Santa Cruz Island</strong><br /> Archeological investigations indicate that Santa Cruz Island has been occupied for at least 9,000 years. The island was home to the largest population of island Chumash and developed a highly complex society dependent on marine harvest, craft specialization and trade with mainland groups. The Santa Cruz Island Chumash produced shell beads that they used for currency, which formed an important part of the overall Chumash economy. Those living on the east end of the island mined chert from the numerous island outcroppings to make tiny blades for drilling holes to make the shell disc beads. Native villagers had no known contact with outsiders until the 16th and early 17th centuries. Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who is credited with the first European exploration of the California coast, observed at least six villages, though he and his crew never stopped at the island. The villages were called Niquipos, Mazul, Xuga, Nitel, Macamo, and Nimitapal . Cabrillo named the island San Lucas, although the Chumash called it Limuw.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Chumash on the Channel Islands</strong><br /> Archeological evidence indicates that there has been a human presence in the northern Channel Islands for thousands of years. Human remains excavated by archeologist Phil Orr from Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island in 1959, recently yielded a radio-carbon date of over 13,000 years of age. Archeological sites on San Miguel Island show continuous occupation from 8,000 - 11,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> The native populations of the Channel Islands were primarily Chumash. The word Michumash , from which the name Chumash is derived, means \"makers of shell bead money\" and is the term mainland Chumash used to refer to those inhabiting the islands. Traditionally the Chumash people lived in an area extending from San Luis Obispo to Malibu, including the four Northern Channel Islands. Today, with the exception of the Islands, Chumash people live in these territories and areas far beyond. Approximately 148 historic village sites have been identified, including 11 on Santa Cruz Island, eight on Santa Rosa Island, and two on San Miguel Island. Due to the lack of a consistent water source, Anacapa Island was likely inhabited on a seasonal basis. A true maritime culture, the Chumash hunted and gathered natural resources from both the ocean and the coastal mountains to maintain a highly developed way of life.<br /> <br /> The southernmost park island, Santa Barbara Island, was associated with the Tongva people, also called Gabrieleno, although the Chumash also visited the island. Like the Chumash, they navigated the ocean and traded with their neighbors on the northern islands and the coast. Lacking a steady supply of fresh water, no permanent settlements were ever established on Santa Barbara Island. Tongva/Gabrieleno people lived primarily on the Southern Channel Islands (Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands) and the area in and around Los Angeles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Navigation, Trade, and the Tomol</strong><br /> These earliest inhabitants exploited the rich marine resources. Isolated from the mainland, they navigated between the islands and back and forth to the mainland using tomols . A plank canoe constructed from redwood logs that floated down the coast and held together by yop , a glue-like substance made from pine pitch and asphaltum, and cords made of plant materials and animal sinews, the tomol ranged from eight to thirty feet in length and held three to ten people. Sharkskin was used for sanding, red ochre for staining, and abalone for inlay and embellishment.<br /> <br /> The use of the tomol allowed for an elaborate trade network between the islands and mainland, between natives and non-natives, and amongst the island communities themselves. 'Achum , or shell bead money was \"minted\" by the island Chumash using small discs shaped from olivella shells and drills manufactured from Santa Cruz Island chert. The shell bead money was exchanged with mainland villages for resources and manufactured goods that were otherwise unavailable on the islands.<br /> <br /> Today, the Chumash Maritime Association, in partnership with Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Park, continues the tradition of the tomol by conducting Channel crossings.<br /> <br /> <strong>Missionization</strong><br /> By the time European explorers arrived in the Santa Barbara Channel, there were some 21 villages on the three largest islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, with highly developed social hierarchies that featured an upper class of chiefs, shamans, boat builders, and artisans, a middle class of workers, fisherman, and hunters, and a lower class of the poor and outcast. Because of the scarcity of fresh water, Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands did not support permanent habitation.<br /> <br /> Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo was impressed by the friendliness of the Chumash people he encountered. However, diseases introduced by the European explorers began a decline in the native population. As European colonists began to settle along the coast, introducing new economic enterprises, exploiting the marine resources, and establishing Catholic missions, the native food sources were depleted, native economies were altered, and island populations declined even further. By the 1820s, the last of the island Chumash had moved to the mainland, many of them to the Missions at Santa Ynez, San Buenaventura, and Santa Barbara.<br /> <br /> The mission system depended on the use of native labor to propel industry and the economy. The social organization of Chumash society was restructured, leading to the erosion of previous power bases and further assimilation. When California became part of Mexico, the government secularized the missions, and the Chumash sank into the depths of poverty. By the time of the California gold rush, the Chumash had become marginalized, and little was done to understand or help the remaining population.<br /> <br /> <strong>Contemporary Chumash</strong><br /> Today, Chumash community members continue to move forward in their efforts to revive what was becoming a forgotten way of life. Much has been lost, but Chumash community members take pride in their heritage and culture.<br /> <br /> With a current population nearly 5,000 strong, some Chumash people can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park. The Chumash reservation in Santa Ynez represents the only federally recognized band, though it is important to note that several other organized Chumash groups exist.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service invites you to visit Channel Islands National Park, Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and other local areas to learn more about the Chumash and other Native American cultures.<br /> <br /> More information about Chumash history and culture can be found at the following links:<br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Chumash Indian Life at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a><br /> - <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/nativeinhabitants.htm\">Santa Ynez Chumash History</a><br />  </p> <p><strong>Limuw: A Story of Place</strong></p> <p>Hutash , the Earth Mother, created the first Chumash people on the island of Limuw, now known as Santa Cruz Island. They were made from the seeds of a Magic Plant.<br /> <br /> Hutash was married to the Alchupo'osh , Sky Snake, the Milky Way, who could make lightning bolts with his tongue. One day he decided to make a gift to the Chumash people. He sent down a bolt of lightning that started a fire. After this, people kept fires burning so that they could keep warm and cook their food.<br /> <br /> In those days, the Condor was a white bird. The Condor was very curious about the fire he saw burning in the Chumash village. He wanted to find out what it was. He flew very low over the fire to get a better look, but he flew too close; he got his feathers scorched, and they turned black. Now the Condor is a black bird, with just a little white left under the wings where they did not get burned.<br /> <br /> After Alchupo'osh gave them fire, the Chumash people lived more comfortably. More people were born each year and their villages got bigger and bigger. Limuw was getting crowded. And the noise people made was starting to annoy Hutash . It kept her awake at night. So, finally, she decided that some of the Chumash people had to move off the island. They would have to go to the mainland, where there weren't any people living in those days.<br /> <br /> But how were the people going to get across the water to the mainland? Finally, Hutash had the idea of making a bridge out of a wishtoyo (rainbow). She made a very long, very high rainbow that stretched from the tallest mountain on Limuw all the way to Tzchimoos , the tall mountain near Mishopshno (Carpinteria).<br /> <br /> Hutash told the people to go across the rainbow bridge and to fill the whole world with people. So the Chumash people started to go across the bridge. Some of them got across safely, but some people made the mistake of looking down. It was a long way down to the water, and the fog was swirling around. They became so dizzy that some of them fell off the rainbow bridge, down through the fog, into the ocean. Hutash felt very badly about this because she told them to cross the bridge. She did not want them to drown. To save them, she turned them into dolphins. Now the Chumash call the dolphins their brothers and sisters.<br /> <br /> Excerpted from:<br /> <em>The Chumash People: Materials for Teachers and Students</em>. Santa Barbara, CA: Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 1991.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Contemporary Chumash Tomol Crossing</strong></p> <p>Each day, commercial and private boats take visitors across the Santa Barbara Channel to the shores of the Channel Islands. Can you imagine making that same journey in a canoe? It might take an entire day and would require tremendous physical strength to forge through the rough waters.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of years ago, the native island Chumash traveled these ancient waters for hunting, fishing, and trading. They built canoes, called tomols , from redwood trees that drifted down the coast, fastening the cut planks together with animal sinews and sealed with a tar-like substance called yop . Yop is a combination of pine pitch and asphaltum which occurs naturally in the Channel and along the coast from oil seeping into the water from below the earth's surface. The tomol remains the oldest example of an ocean-going watercraft in North America.<br /> <br /> The tomol is central to the Chumash heritage, constructed and paddled by members of the Brotherhood of the Tomol . The historic Brotherhood disbanded in 1834, but in 1976, a contemporary group built Helek , which means peregrine falcon, based on ethnographic and historic accounts of tomol construction. It was the first tomol built in 142 years and the modern paddlers travelled from San Miguel Island to Santa Rosa Island, and finally to Santa Cruz Island.<br /> <br /> Twenty years later, the Chumash Maritime Association completed a 26-foot-long tomol which they named 'Elye'wun (pronounced \"El-E-ah-woon\"), the Chumash word for Swordfish.<br /> <br /> On September 8, 2001, 'Elye'wun made the historic crossing from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island. The dangers of the past did not escape the modern crew. During the journey, the tomol began to leak and also encountered a thresher shark and several dolphins. Over 150 Chumash families and friends gathered to greet the tomol and paddlers on the beaches of Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Three years later, on September 11, 2004, 'Elye'wun again crossed the Channel to Santa Cruz Island, this time greeted by more than 200 Chumash and American Indians at the historic Chumash village of Swaxil , now known as Scorpion Valley. The 21-mile trip took over ten hours! A crew of Chumash youth aged 14 to 22 joined the paddlers, a significant accomplishment for the next generation of Chumash leaders.<br /> <br /> Additional tomol crossings took place in September 2005 and August 2006. Members of the Chumash community continue to celebrate their heritage and culture through this event.<br /> <br /> Centuries ago, the tomol was used to connect different island Chumash groups with each other and the mainland. Today, it links past generations of Chumash with the present-day Chumash community.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h2>Description</h2> <p>Low-profile wayside that is 36.5 x 24.5 inches. It has a semi-cylindrical base with two rectangular pillars supporting the panel. The panel is framed in black metal. The sign is located off 1st Avenue, on cement directly in front of Dry Dock 1. </p> <h2>Layout</h2> <p>At the top of the sign is a black banner with white text. The text includes the title, “'Old Ironsides’ in Dry Dock 1,” aligned to the left. Aligned to the right in the banner are two columns of two lines of text. The first column of text is “Boston National Historical Park,” followed by “Charlestown Navy Yard.” The second column states “National Park Service,” followed by “U.S. Department of the Interior.” The rest of the panel has a gray background with black text and mostly black and white images. The text and images are arranged in three rows and three columns. The top row features two columns of text, with spaces dividing the paragraphs. The third column features an image that spans two rows. The middle row includes three black-and-white diagrams with a bolded title and italicized caption. Two diagrams are under the first column of text. The image caption and third diagram are under the second column. The bottom row features five images. Two black-and-white images are in the first column side by side, a black-and-white image and a colored image are in the second column side by side, and a landscape, colored image fills the third column. A black banner divides the middle and bottom rows with image titles in white font above each image. Photo credits are in black font under the right corner of some images.  </p> <h2>Title</h2> <p>\"Old Ironsides\" in Dry Dock 1 </p> <h2>Main Text</h2> <p>USS <em>Constitution</em> first entered Dry Dock 1 in 1833. Though she was the first ship to test the new dry dock system, the tough oak hull of “Old Ironsides” had already seen several repairs. To rebuild the ship, woodworkers selected the best wood for each ship part, such as longleaf yellow pine for decking, and white oak for planking. Sawyers and hewers prepared the wood pieces. Carpenters connected the hull pieces with wood treenails, and caulkers sealed the hull with pitch and rope. Metal workers then laid on sheets of copper to protect the bottom of the wooden hull. In 1992, USS <em>Constitution</em> entered Dry Dock 1 for an overhaul to prepare her for third century of service. Despite her many repairs, a significant percentage of her original wood still exists below the water-line. </p> <h2>Image (third column, top and middle row)</h2> <p>In the center of the image, USS <em>Constitution</em>, or “Old Ironsides,” is docked in the Dry Dock at the Charlestown Navy Yard. The three-masted ship’s bow is pointed towards the camera. The three masts extend into the sky, and the sails are down. The left side of the ship’s hull is visible. In the foreground, a chain barrier lines the dry dock. Scaffolding rises from the ground and sits along the ship’s hull. A few workers in white helmets and dark clothes stand on the scaffolding. One of the large navy yard portal cranes sits next to the dry dock on the left side of the image. A building is behind the crane. Another crane rises in the background beyond more structures. A gangway extends from the ship’s deck across the dry dock on the right side of the image. A destroyer is in the background.  </p> <h3>Image Credit</h3> <p>U.S. Navy </p> <h2>Diagram (middle row, first column, left)</h2> <p>A tree with various branches and leaves extends from a patch of grass. A lightly shaded rectangle sits within the tree’s trunk. Above the rectangle is a darker boomerang shape, with one arm extending into a branch.  </p> <h2>Diagram (middle row, first column, right)</h2> <p>The tree trunk from the other diagram is drawn at a diagonal with short pieces of branches sticking out from the sides. Within the trunk is a rectangle. Above the rectangle is a dark three-sided shape with two straight edges connected at a right angle. The third side has a few curves like a boomerang. Below the image and to the right is the label, \"Hanging knee.\" </p> <h3>Diagram Title</h3> <p>A ship's knee.  </p> <h3>Diagram Caption</h3> <p>Live oak trees yield frames and \"knees\" that support the ship. Woods that were plentiful in the 1800s are harder to obtain today. Locating wood appropriate to the ship's original specifications is an ongoing challenge.  </p> <h2>Diagram (middle row, second column, right)</h2> <p>The drawing shows the left side of a ship's bare hull. It shows the ship's three lower enclosed decks, and the sides of the ship marking the top deck. Along the upper left side of each enclosed deck is a hanging knee from the other drawings. The middle knee, on the second deck up, is dark and solid, while the others are outlined. The illustration also shows vertical lines extending through the middle of the bottom two decks. The first enclosed deck from the top has smaller vertical lines through it, halfway between the left side of the hull and the middle vertical lines. </p> <h2>Image (bottom row, first column, left)</h2> <p> An image of a ship's hull. A dock and water are in the foreground of the image. A small rectangular wooden boat sits in the water to the left of the dock. Two men stand on the dock to the left of the boat. The man on the left is facing towards the water and is wearing dark suspenders over a light shirt. The man on the right faces the other man and wears a light cap, light shirt, and light pants. Boxes are on the ground dock next to the men. Rope extends along the dock. The hull is oriented, so the bow is towards the front and the left side of the ship is visible as the ship extends beyond the image’s border. Five men stand side by side on the deck and look over the side. At least two of the men are holding onto a piece of rope that is dropped over the side of the ship. The rope is connected to a man standing on posts in the water and working on the ship’s exterior. A sixth man stands on the deck a bit further from the others and is near the mast. Another man stands along the wharf in front of a large building.  </p> <h3>Image Title</h3> <p>Assessing needed repairs (1927) </p> <h3>Image Credit</h3> <p>U.S. Navy  </p> <h2>Image (bottom row, first column, right)</h2> <p>An image of men working on a long plank. In the foreground, one plank extends from the image’s left corner into the background. It rests on four logs spread out from the foreground into the background. Wood chips litter the ground. A second plank extends from the right corner just beyond the image’s border. It also rests on logs. Five men stand alongside the left side of the left log from the front to the back. The first two men up front are bent over the plank and holding axes. They wear dark hats, light shirts, and dark overalls. The third and fourth men are standing and looking at the camera while holding axes. They wear light hats, light shirts, and dark pants. The fifth man wears a light wide-brimmed hat, a light shirt, and dark overalls. He is bent over the plank with an axe in his hands. A sixth man stands to the right of the plank across from the fifth man. An open doorway is behind the men in the background, and a hose is on the ground to the left of the door.   </p> <h3>Image Title</h3> <p>Hewing planks by hand (1928) </p> <h3>Image Credit</h3> <p>U.S. Navy </p> <h2>Image: (bottom row, second column, left)</h2> <p> An image of men using a power saw on a large ship mast. A large wooden mast extends from the center of the foreground towards the background with its circular base in the foreground. It sits on raised beams. Two men stand on either side of the mast and face each other. They hold a large mechanical saw between them that is cutting into the wood. Both men wear dark work uniforms and hats. On the right side of the image, a partial mast extends from the midground beyond the background. A man wearing a light hardhat and dark uniform stands on its right with one hand on the beam and the other hand holing a level on the beam.  </p> <h3>Image Title</h3> <p>Trimming mast by power saw (1963) </p> <h3>Image Credit</h3> <p>U.S. Navy </p> <h2>Image (bottom row, second column, right)</h2> <p>A color photograph of men inspecting a ship's hull. A small part of a ship's hull fills the image's upper left corner. At least four beams extend from the ground in the bottom right corner toward the hull. Four men are below the hull. The man on the left is in a shadow as he faces towards the hull with his back towards the beams. He stands on what appears to be a ladder and wears a hard hat. In the center of the image, another man in a hard hat stands on a ladder and is also in a shadow. His back is to the other man as he uses a tool to work on the ship. Another man wears a hard hat and squats on the ground to work on a beam. Another man is barely visible behind the beam. Another ship’s hull is in the background.  </p> <h3>Image Title</h3> <p>Inspecting the hull (1992) </p> <h2>Image (bottom row, third column)</h2> <p>A color photograph of the Charlestown Navy Yard. In the foreground, a long white and brown mast extends from the bottom right corner towards the top left corner of the image. Rope is tied at both ends and runs along the mast, lifting the left part of the mast in the air. In the mid-ground, two men stand under the mast to the left and wear white shirts and dark pants. Another man to their left walks away from the mast. He wears a white hard hat, white shirt, and dark pants. Behind the men stands a large navy yard portal crane that sits on four legs. Another man stands to the right of the mast, which obscures his head. He also wears a white shirt and dark pants. Behind him is the <em>Constitution</em>, with its bow pointed towards the left and one mast still rising from the deck. A white gangway leads to the deck with U.S.S. CONSTITUTION writing along its side. A man stands on deck. In the background, there are trees behind the crane. Next to the trees are navy yard buildings that continue behind the <em>Constitution</em>.   </p> <h3>Image Title</h3> <p>Removing mast before dry-docking (1992) </p>",

Three boats are in the water in the foreground. To the left of the foreground are two large wooden ships. The far-left ship is docked along the wharf, and the other one is several feet from the dock. Both ships have tall masts that extend into the sky in the background. Red flags fly from atop both of their masts. The canvas of the left ship’s sails are down. Three mariners are visible on the deck, two men sitting in the bow and one standing at the stern. The left man in the bow is wearing a pink hat and blue shirt, while the man to his right is in a dark hat and green shirt. The man at the stern is in a black hat, black shirt, and white pants, and he is adjusting canvas on a sail. Five men are in the boat to the right, three in the bow and two at the stern. The front-most man in the bow is bent over to pick up what looks like a barrel. He wears a white hat and white shirt. The man behind him is slightly bent and wears a red hat, green shirt, and blue pants. Another man is standing behind him and wears a blat hat, red shirt, and blue pants. The two men in the stern haul a rope on deck that extends into the water. The man on the left wears a black hat, blue shirt and white pants while the man to the right wears a black hat, pink shirt, and blue pants. The ship’s sail is low on the mast but starting to be raised. To the right of the ship is a rowboat that faces the ship. A man stands at the bow of the rowboat facing the harbor. He wears a round hat, white shirt, brown vest, and blue trousers. Two men sit on the bench in the center of the boat with their backs to the man in the bow. The man on the left wears a top hat, a brown jacket, a white shirt, a pink scarf, and blue trousers. The man on the right looks towards the one on the left and wears a white blouse, brown trousers, and a pink hat. He holds an oar in his left hand that crosses in front of the other man as it sits in the water. A man sits in the stern of the rowboat and looks to his right. He wears a top hat, green vest, pink shirt, and blue trousers. A large dark building is visible behind the two ships in the background of the left side of the painting. A large structure extends into the sky in front of the building with an American flag flying from the top. Six boats are in the mid-ground of the painting. A two-masted ship white a dark hull and white sails is in the center of the painting. In front of it and between the right wooden ship and rowboat, is a small sailboat. A man sits in the bow and faces the stern. He wears a top hat, a blue jacket, and light trousers. Three sailboats are on the right side of the painting. The left ship has its sails raised, and a person is on deck. The ship to its right has its sails lowered and a man stands in the stern. The bow of the ship to its right disappears into the right edge of the painting. Two sails are raised, and three men stand in the stern. The ship tugs a rowboat behind it. Various other ships are in the background, along the coastline of Boston. Old North Church’s steeple is visible in the background. Smoke from a smokestack rises in the distance to the right. The water throughout the painting is dark and shimmering.  </p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>This 1833 view of Boston from the west end of the Navy Yard shows a harbor full of busy activity. The steeple of the Old North Church is still a prominent landmark. [Courtesy Library of Congress]  </p> <h2>Main Text</h2> <p> When Captain William Bainbridge took command of the Navy Yard in April 1812, he found little but a tract of marshy land and nine buildings in disrepair. Only 12 years old, the yard still had no deep water wharf for ships or adequate storage for supplies. A state-owned magazine miles away housed the Navy’s gunpowder. Bainbridge repeatedly tried to improve the Yard’s facilities, but the Navy Department did not have the funds. In 1813, workers erected a new brick storehouse and blacksmith shop, and in 1814 an enormous shed or “shiphouse” covered the ship of the line under construction. Despite these improvements, many years passed before the Yard assumed the character of the industrial complex seen today.  </p>",

The far-left ship is docked along the wharf, and the other one is several feet from the dock. Both ships have tall masts that extend beyond the top of the painting. The canvas of the sails are resting on the docked ship, whereas the sails are partially up on the ship to its right. Mariners are visible on the deck of both ships, however they are very small. A large dark building is visible behind these two ships in the background of the left side of the painting. In the center of the painting in the mid-ground are more ships and smaller boats. There is a smaller boat with a sail and a person sitting in it in the center of the painting. A large ship with a dark hull and white sails is behind it. Three sailboats are on the right side of the painting, each sailing in various directions with their sails facing slightly different directions. In the background is the coastline of Boston. Visible is Old North Church’s steeple, which is identified with typed out text and a line pointing to it. The text reads “Old North Church.” The water throughout the painting is dark and shimmering. Just below the right corner of the painting is the text “The Bostonian Society/Old State House.”</p> <p>A boat just right to the center of the image extends from the painting onto the gray background, as if the boat is being rowed into the painting. A man stands at the bow of the rowboat facing the harbor. He wears a round hat, white shirt, dark vest, and dark trousers. A two men sit on the bench in the center of the boat. The man to the left has his back to the man in the front of the boat, while the other man faces toward the man in the front. The man sitting to the left wears a top hat, a brown jacket, a white shirt, and dark trousers. An oar rests in front of him. The man to the right wears a white shirt and dark trousers. A man sits in the stern of the rowboat and looks to his right. He wears a top hat, a dark vest, a pink shirt, and dark trousers. Oars extend over either side of the boat.</p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>Boston in 1833, as seen from the Charlestown Navy Yard. Note the spire of Old North Church in the North End.</p> <h2>Text (Bottom, Left column)</h2> <p>Since the colonial period, Boston has drawn its livelihood from its harbor and the sea. A center for coastal and foreign trade, Boston developed as one of the principal colonial ports in America. Looking at the harbor and city today, you can see the results of 350 years of change. Yet nestled among the skyscrapers and apartment buildings can be found landmarks familiar to city dwellers more than 200 years ago. The 1723 spire of Old North Church, a beacon for Paul Revere, is still the centerpiece of Boston’s historic North End.</p> <h2>Map (Bottom, Middle column)</h2> <p>The map depicts Boston, Charlestown, and East Boston. Text above the map, in the black strip, reads “Boston Harbor, in 1775 and today. The 1775 land mass is a salmon color. Roads are depicted in a light tan color. Today’s coastline and land mass is illustrated in light tan, surrounding the 1775 land mass. This difference is made clear by labels next to the 1775 coastlines that state “Shoreline in 1775.” Each of the three areas have places of interest marked by either text or text and a number. Boston encompasses the top right quadrant of the map and expands into the center of the map. The top right edge of the map has the text “DOWNTOWN BOSTON.” Below this title to the left is the text “(5) Custom House Tower.” The 5 is located in today’s area of Boston, off the 1775 coastline. Below the Custom House is long thin salmon line that extends to the left to the 1775 coastline. Text marks the end of this line as “Long Wharf.” To the left of this text in the water is a black arrow identifying that the direction of North is to the bottom of the map. A couple streets below the Custom House and slightly to the right is a black dot and the text “Faneuil Hall.” To the right of this text and closer to the right edge of the dark pink land mass is the text “BEACON HILL.” The bottom right portion of the downtown Boston area shows that in 1775 there was a pond in between two small peninsulas, enclosed by a strip of land connecting these two peninsulas. Text on the pond area reads “Mill Pond.” Under the pond and peninsula strip on today’s landmass is a black dot and the text “North Station.” The peninsula to the left is larger and titled “NORTH END.” Here there are two points. In the middle is “(1) Old North Church.” On the water’s edge of the light tan outline for today’s map is a pier with the text “(4) Hartt’s Shipyard.” That is the extent of the text for the Downtown Boston section. On the left side of the image is the edge of East Boston, with the text “EAST BOSTON.” On the light tan outline for today’s map is the text “(6) Logan Airport” with a black arrow beneath it pointing to the left. The final land area is the bottom right portion of the map. In the center of the salmon land mass is the text “CHARLESTOWN.” Below this text towards the bottom border of the map is a point: “(3) Redoubt 1775.” While the shoreline of Charlestown in 1775 is somewhat smooth, today’s shoreline extends beyond this shoreline and includes several piers jutting out into the harbor. The pier furthest to the right has a point “(2) Pier 1 Navy Yard.” Additionally, at this point is a white text box with a black border and black text stating “YOU ARE HERE.” The last remaining text on the map is in the water areas. The water in the upper left portion of the map is labeled “Inner Harbor Channel.” The water between East Boston on the left border of the map and Charlestown is labeled “Mystic River.” The thin stretch of water between today’s coastline of Boston and Charlestown, approximately running horizontal through the middle of the right side of the map and off the edge is labeled “Charles River.”</p> <h3>Map caption (Bottom, Right column, Left)</h3> <p>On April 18, 1775, two lanterns shone in the spire of Old North Church (1), and Paul Revere began his famous ride – in a boat. Ferrying past the British man-of-war Somerset, he crossed from Boston to Charlestown, just to the right of where you now stand. Two months later, British reinforcements landed on the Charlestown shore (2), now the head of Pier 1. The Battle of Bunker Hill began when they marched against Charlestown’s redoubt, now marked by the 1842 monument (3).</p> <h3>Map caption (Bottom, Right column, Middle)</h3> <p>Independence was hard-won and just as hard to keep. Built to defend the young nation’s commerce, USS Constitution launched in October of 1797 from Hartt’s Shipyard (4) in Boston. Appropriately, the site is now a U.S. Coast Guard Station. By mid-century, a new Custom House adorned the head of Long Wharf, proof of the area’s continued importance to overseas trade. Now a quarter-mile inland due to landfill, the Custom House is marked by its clock tower (5), built in 1915.</p> <h3>Map caption (Bottom, Right column, Right)</h3> <p>Boston’s seascape has been changing for centuries. The mud flats of Charlestown gradually disappeared under the docks and asphalt of the navy yard. Developers chopped nearly 60 feet off the summit of Beacon Hill to fill in the Mill Pond in 1824. In East Boston, once an island, Logan Airport (6) stands almost entirely on fill.</p>",

She holds a sunshade and wears a white mobcap and a light blue dress with black shawl. The man looks at the woman and wears a black hat, black waistcoat, black tailcoat, high lace collar, and tan pants that are tucked into all black boots. A dog to their right runs towards the water. The base of the hill flattens by the harbor, which is depicted in the mid-ground of the painting. A row of trees and bushes runs from left to right in this portion of the painting. The trees and bushes get increasingly smaller as they reach the water in the mid-ground of the painting. In front of the trees is a wooden split-rail fence that disappears as it gets closer to the water. Behind the trees and shrubs are four cows at the water’s edge.

[Courtesy The Bostonian Society]</p> <h2>Main Text</h2> <p>When the Federal government established a navy yard in Massachusetts in 1800, it naturally looked to Boston Harbor. A thriving town of more than 34,000 people, Boston was home to hundreds of skilled ship carpenters, riggers, caulkers, and other maritime tradesmen. With such a community close at hand, the Navy established the new yard just across the Charles River on Charlestown’s grassy tidal flats. During the War of 1812, many Boston tradesmen and laborers worked to build and repair US Navy vessels. Local merchants supplied hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of timber, paint, canvas, rope, clothing, and foodstuffs needed to send the ships to sea. Thousands of local men signed on as crew.</p> <h2>Left Image</h2> <p>A painting of workers in the shipyard. In the foreground, piles of lumber are scattered on the ground. Seven workers are also painted in the foreground, just behind the lumber. On the left, two men work on one pile of lumber. The leftmost man’s back is seen as he is bent over his work. He has on blue pants, an orange shirt, and brown hat. The man to his right faces him and wears blue pants, a red jacket, and brown hat. He is also holding a long pole pointed towards the ground and wood pile. To his right is another man who is standing and overseeing the workers. He faces towards the right and wears a black cocked hat, dark blue jacket, tan waistcoat, and breeches. The worker to his right, who is located in the center of the painting, appears to be chopping wood. He faces right and wears a brown hat, white shirt, and beige pants. Two workers to his right are kneeling on the ground and using a two-man saw to cut lumber. The man on the left faces right and wears a brown hat, blue shirt, and blue pants. The man on the right faces left and wears a brown hat, yellow shirt, and brown pants. In the middle ground is a raised wooden platform slanted slightly up from the mid-left side of the painting to the upper right corner of the painting. Workers walk across it from left to right. A wooden ramp to the platform is angled down towards the right middle section of the painting. On the left part of the platform, four men carry a log across the platform. The legs of another man are visible on the right portion of the platform. Beyond the platform and ramp in the background are a series of buildings. Trees are to the left and right of the buildings. A cabin sits on the right-hand side of the painting. A man in a black hat, black shirt, and black pants stands in the doorway. Six other workers are seen in the background. To the left, in front of the buildings, is a man facing left. In the center are two men walking towards the buildings while carrying wood across their right shoulders. To the right of those men is another man looking up towards the platform with his right arm raised. He wears a brown hat, brown shirt, and yellow pants. Two other men are to his right and are carrying a piece of wood between them. To their right and to the left of the man at the cabin is a man kneeling and facing left.</p> <h3>Left Image Caption</h3> <p>Workmen in a shipyard, 1800.

The panel is made from black metal. The sign is located on cement in front of Building 10, the old Shipyard Galley. The building sits across the pavement from where the USS Constitution is docked and is next to the portal crane. </p> <h2>Layout</h2> <p>The sign is black metal with white text and black and white images. Centered at the top is the sign’s title in uppercase letters. The text and images are arranged in two columns. The first column features the first two paragraphs of the main text separated by a space. A square photo is below the text. The image’s caption is to the right of the image’s bottom right corner. The second column features a square image with its caption centered below the image. Below the caption is the last paragraph of the main text.</p> <h2>Title</h2> <p>Building 10 </p> <h2>Main Text</h2> <p>Constructed in 1853, Building 10 is typical of structures in the Charlestown Navy Yard: it has seen many uses and been modified numerous times to meet the Navy’s changing needs. The structure was also moved to this location from elsewhere on Pier 1, as a result of changes to the pier itself. The building originally served as a pitch house where tar used in the construction of wooden ships was prepared. In the 1890s it became the navy yard paint shop; after the invention of radio, it served it served as a wireless station providing peacetime radio assistance to all ships at sea. During the period spanning both world wars, the structure served as a laundry for families stationed here as well as for the crews of ships in for repair. The building was enlarged to its present size in 1948 when it became of the Navy’s first sonar facilities to serve the Atlantic Fleet. Here essential sonar components were repaired, maintained, and tested in a water tank built into one end of the structure, until in the late 1950s, changes in technology and procedures again outmoded the structure.  </p> <h2>Image (first column)</h2> <p>In the foreground a cobblestone road extends from the left to the right of the image. Script is written along the bottom in the center that says, “Paint Shop C &R.” Building 10 rises in the mid-ground of the image. It is a two-story rectangular brick building with a gabled roof. The building sits at an angle, so its front and the side to the left are visible. On the facade, three windows line the second floor, with the middle window slightly larger than the other two. A beam with a rope dangling from it extends from the house above the larger window. On the first floor, there is a doorway extending out from the house with a window on either side of the door. Five windows are on the second floor along the side to the left of the building. Along the first floor are three windows, a door, and then one more window. A chimney stack rises from the backend of the house. In the background are navy yard buildings and a clear sky.  </p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>Relocated, Building 10 appears to have always been here. What changes in the building as it appears today can you identify? </p> <h2>Image (second column)</h2> <p>In the foreground, cut timber is stacked together in multiple towers. Slabs of wood are strewn over the dirt ground around the tower bases. Parts of two buildings are seen on the right side of the image. Two lines of script are centered along the bottom: Paint Shop, Looking West, Boston Navy Yard, Aug 2, 1900. A two-story rectangular building with a gabled roof sits atop the timber stacks. The building is angled so the back and the side to the left of the building are in view. The back of the building has three windows along each floor.

The British frigate Shannon waited off Boston Light to fight the American ship. Bostonians expected an easy victory. After all, many American warships had sailed from Boston and returned triumphant. Excited crowds gave the officers and crew a hero's welcome. However, <em>Chesapeake</em> never returned. After a quick, fierce engagement the Americans surrendered. During the battle, American Captain James Lawrence suffered a mortal wound. He directed his Surgeon's Mate to tell the crew to \"fire faster and not give up the ship.\"</p> <h2>Left Image</h2> <p>Painting of a White man in a dark navy Naval uniform.

It has a rectangular base with two rectangular pillars supporting the panel. The panel is framed in black metal. The sign is located off of 1st Avenue, on cement directly in front of Dry Dock 1.</p> <h2>Layout</h2> <p>At the top of the sign is a black banner with white text. The text includes the title, “Dry Dock 1,” aligned to the left. Aligned to the right in the banner are two columns of two lines of text. The first column of text is “Boston National Historical Park,” followed by “Charlestown Navy Yard.” The second column states “National Park Service,” followed by “U.S. Department of the Interior.” The rest of the panel has a gray background with black text, a color drawing, and black and white images. The text and images are arranged in three rows. The top row features a square of the main text in the left-hand corner. To the right is a colored drawing that fills three-quarters of the row. A caption for the drawing sits above it in the right corner. The middle row features four images. The two images on the left are squares that sit below the main text. A black bar above them connects the images but separates them from the main text. The right two landscape images are divided between the remaining three-quarters of the row. The bottom row are the photo captions. For the square images, the captions are directly below the image, but for the rectangular images, the captions are aligned left. All image captions are italicized with bold titles.</p> <h2>Main Text</h2> <p>This stone and metal structure is Dry Dock 1, completed in 1833. As one of America’s first two granite dry docks, Dry Dock 1 made the repair of large naval ships faster, easier, and safer. Returning warships to sea duty in less time was a crucial gain for a young nation with a limited budget and a small navy. Costing more than $1.5 million, the dry docks here in Charlestown and in Norfolk, Virginia, were the largest civil works projects the federal government had ever undertaken. They proved that the nation was prepared to use its navy to protect its overseas trade. The first vessel to enter Dry Dock 1 for repairs was USS <em>Constitution</em> in 1833. Today, Dry Dock 1, a working pioneer, is preserved as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.</p> <h2>Image (top row, right)</h2> <p>A drawing depicting a careening ship. In the left part of the image, a tan and brown ship is shown on its left (port) side, partially submerged in water. The bow of the ship faces the front of the drawing and chains drop from the ship into the water. The ship’s masts are connected by rope to a dock that juts out from the right side of the drawing. Part of the rope leads to a wooden capstan, or a simple machine used to haul up ship's anchors and equipment, that sits in the middle of the dock and has the rope wrapped around it. Instead of a sky, the background is the gray background of the sign.</p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>Careening. Without a dry dock, a ship must be careened at dockside. Careening, or “heaving down,” a ship exposes only half of the hull at a time, requires major dismantling, and places great stress on a wooden hull. Occasionally, a ship would sink while being careened.</p> <h2>Image (second row, left square)</h2> <p>A black-and-white portrait of Loammi Baldwin. Loammi faces left, staring off into the distance with a serious expression on his face. He has light skin, dark eyebrows, and light, short hair. He wears a white neckcloth with a high collar that sits just below his chin underneath a black coat. It blends in with the black background. Beneath the image’s bottom read corner is text that reads “M.I.T. Historical Collection.”</p> <h3>Image Title</h3> <p>Loammi Baldwin (1780-1838), by Chester Harding</p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>Chief Engineer Baldwin adapted concepts he had observed in Europe to design a dry dock complex that functioned as one large mechanism.</p> <h2>Image (second row, right square)</h2> <p>A white sheet of paper depicting a Loammi Baldwin plan for the steam engine. Text below the photo’s bottom right corner reads “Baker Library, Harvard University.”</p> <h3>Image Title</h3> <p>Dry Dock Plan, signed “Nov. 4, 1828, L. Baldwin”</p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>Baldwin’s innovative plan used the yard’s first steam engine, 16 large pumps to empty the dock’s basin, and a floating gate that sealed the dock from the sea.</p> <h2>Image (second row, left rectangle)</h2> <p>A drawing of a ship in a dry dock. The hull of a ship called the USS <em>Constellation</em> is in the dry dock with its stern in the foreground right of center. The hull is oriented so that the left side is visible at an angle and the bow of the ship is in the background left of center. A man stands in the stern. Wooden planks span the gap from the left edge of the dry dock to the left side of the ship’s hull at two levels. Supporting the lower level of planks is a row of planks that extends from the ground at an angle. Resting perpendicular on the two levels of planks are additional planks that extend alongside the ship’s hull and make a standing area. Workers stand all along it and work on the ship. Boards are also extended on the upper level with more workers. On the ground to the left of the ship, is one man holding a wood plank. Another wooden plank is on the ground behind him. Planks also extend from the right side of the ship with the outline of a few workers standing on them, but that side is mostly hidden from view in the drawing. On the left side of the painting, a man overlooks the dry dock from the edge of the dry dock. Buildings and trees line the left background, along with an American flag that flies above the dry dock. People walk along the dry dock overlooking the workers. On the right side beyond the dry dock in the background are people and carriages standing next to a building with a cupola.</p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>1851: USS <em>Constellation</em> in Dry Dock. In the dry basin, keel blocks and supports held the vessel upright with its entire hull exposed. Workers could then quickly replace planking and re-caulk and re-copper the ship’s bottom.</p> <h2>Image (second row, right rectangle)</h2> <p>An image of a destroyer in the dry dock from above. The destroyer USS <em>Fred T. Berry</em> extends from the bottom right corner of the photo towards the left top corner, with the left side of the hull visible. The ship’s stern is just out of view in the bottom right corner. The ship’s deck is covered in wires, boxes, and guns. A hangar and flight deck for the ship’s drone helicopter is in the center of the ship, and smokestacks are towards the bow. People work along the left railing of the ship. Gangways extend from both the left and right of the ship to connect the deck to the edge of the dry dock. Tools line the edge of the dry dock. A man walks along the left side of the dry dock. Buildings and cars line the background. A truck drives along the right of the ship, crossing in front of a building and building supplies. A portal crane rises into the right corner of the image, with most of the crane out of view.</p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>1961: USS<em> Fred T. Berry</em> in Dry Dock 1. The techniques of dry-docking, as well as Dry Dock 1 itself, are still in use today.</p>",

Watching a battle in this war, Francis Scott Key wrote a poem, “The Star Spangled Banner,” about this flag. Later set to music, it became our national anthem in 1931.</p> <h2>Image (second row)</h2> <p>British ensign circa 1812. A solid red flag with the current flag of Great Britain in the top left corner.

[Courtesy US Naval Academy Museum]</p> <h2>Main Text</h2> <p>During the day, workers at the Charlestown Navy Yard built, repaired, and supplied American warships. In the evening, these men left for their homes. Only the Commandant, a few administrative officers, and a detachment of Marines stayed behind. The Commandant and his assistants lived close to their work. As protectors of public property, Marines kept watch over the Yard at all times. After living in a leaky shed for 10 years, the Marines received money to build proper barracks. Marines constructed most of the building themselves, finishing it in 1811. Over the next 150 years, the barracks they lived in and the sites they protected changed. Still, the Marines and the commandants they served called the Navy Yard home.</p> <h2>Left Oval Image</h2> <p>A four-story Federal Style building that sits atop a small hill surrounded by green space. The building consists of red brick and white painted wood. The main building has two bowed bays with flat roofs. The front of the main building has a covered porch with narrow Doric columns built on arched brick piers that wrap around the left and right side of the building. The covered porch has three round-arched windows. In front of the building are shrubs and grassy hill that the house sits upon. A tree behind the house to the left has no trees, but a tree in the foreground on the right side of the picture has a tree full of fall colored leaves.</p> <h3>Left Oval Image Caption</h3> <p>The Commandant's House</p> <h2>Right Oval Image</h2> <p>A four stories tall, eleven bays long, and five bays deep building. The first floor exterior is primarily painted a mint green while the upper levels are primarily painted white. Two brick towers divide the south façade of the building into three sections, with 5 bays in between them. The towers have four-light windows at the location of the landings for the staircases. An arch over the entrance in the center of the building has a red sign. In front of the building is a large grassy area.</p> <h3>Right Oval Image Caption</h3> <p>The Marine Barracks</p>",

The text includes the title, “Serving the Fleet,” aligned to the left. Aligned to the right in the banner are two columns of two lines of text. The first column of text is “Boston National Historical Park,” followed by “Charlestown Navy Yard.” The second column states “National Park Service,” followed by “U.S. Department of the Interior.” The rest of the panel has a gray background with black text and black and white images. The text and images are arranged in two rows and three columns. The top row takes up roughly two thirds of the sign’s height. A thick black line separates the two rows. The top row features a column of text with a space dividing the paragraphs. The second column features a bolded image title followed by an italicized image caption. The third column features a large square image that is slightly less than half the width of the sign. The bottom row’s first column features a large rectangular image that extends into the top row, right under the text, and covers where the thick black line would be. The second column features a bolded image title followed by an italicized image caption. The third column features two square images side-by-side.  </p> <h2>Title</h2> <p>Serving the Fleet </p> <h2>Main Text</h2> <p>By 1940 this navy yard supported a powerful fleet of modern steel ships. Where once carpenters, joiners, and sail-makers responded to the morning shipyard bell, now a shrill steam whistle summoned welders, boilermakers, and electronics specialists to their work stations. Engines, railways, and cranes filled the navy yard. During World War II, the navy yard built 320 vessels, docked 2,000, outfitted 11,000 and overhauled or repaired 3,000.</p> <h2>Image Title (top row):</h2> <p>The yard in 1960.  </p> <h3>Image Caption:</h3> <p>Larger warships meant a bigger navy yard. Bounded by the Charles and Mystic rivers and the surrounding urban community, the yard expanded into the harbor with long piers, dry docks, and shipways. </p> <h2>Image (top row):</h2> <p>An aerial view of the Charlestown Navy Yard. In the foreground, the Mystic River flows alongside the left side of the image and meets up with the Charles River to form inner Boston Harbor in the mid-ground of the image. The Navy Yard extends from the foreground to the mid-ground along the image’s right side with docks and piers extending into the water on the left. A crane sits alongside the first pier in the foreground. Other cranes sit on the docks and piers into the mid-ground. Cars are parked throughout the yard and various buildings sit throughout the yard. A few battleships are docked alongside the piers. The Charles River separates the Navy Yard from the Boston skyline in the background.  </p> <h2>Image (bottom row into top row)</h2> <p>A large portal crane carries a ship through the air. The portal crane sits on the left side of the image and rises from the bottom to the top of the image. There is a large gap separating the left and right legs. Some men stand outside of the left legs, while another stands between the legs and beneath the base. The crane’s body has a rounded back that juts out over the left side of the base. In the middle of the back is an open flap. The right side of the crane has a window and stairs leading from an open doorway alongside the side to the upper level. Two lights are positioned on either side of the doorway, while a man stands on a small landing in front of the door. On top of the crane’s body, stairs lead to three multi-level platforms. At the top of the stairs is a small, enclosed space to the right next to the crane. This space has an open door with a light above it on one side and has glass windows on the other visible sides. The silhouette of a man is visible. The crane rises behind this room into the sky towards the right, with cabling connecting it to the multi-level platforms. The crane holds a ship aloft to the right of the base. Cables along the left side of the boat connect it to a destroyer that sits behind the crane. Three men are on deck near the cables, and they stand alongside three large guns on deck. A gangway is visible between the crane’s legs and leads to the destroyer’s deck. Another crane rises behind the destroyer, along the image’s right side. A bridge is in the background, behind the destroyer and crane.  </p> <h2>Image Title (both left and right images in bottom row, third column)</h2> <p>Peak performance. </p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>In 1943, shipyard workers could build one “DE” (destroyer escort) in 4 months, and one “LST” (landing ship tank) in less than 4 weeks.  </p> <h2>Image (bottom row, third column, left)</h2> <p>Men paint numbers on a destroyer. In the foreground, scaffolding rises from the bottom left corner of the image. A piece of rope extends from just outside the left of the image towards the top of the image. Four men are on top of the scaffolding. The man on the left wears a light hardhat, light shirt, and light pants. He leans towards his left as he holds either a rope or metal pole in his left hand. The man next to him wears a white sailor hat, sunglasses, a light shirt, and dark pants. He also holds the rope but in both hands. The arm of a third man is visible behind him. A fourth man is to the right. He kneels on the scaffolding and wears a dark hat, dark shirt, and light overalls. He holds the rope in his left hand while his right arm holds a paintbrush and extends towards the destroyer. The dark destroyer fills the background from left to right. White numbers 31 are painted on the side. Part of a propeller is to the right of the numbers. Sky is visible in the image’s top left corner.  </p> <h2>Image (bottom row, third column, right)</h2> <p>Welders works on the side of a destroyer. Part of a destroyer’s hull fills the right side of the image. Two welders stand on the left and work on the destroyer. One man wears a welder’s mask, dark coat, and lighter pants. The man to his left wears a white hat, dark coat, and dark pants. Buildings are in the background behind them.  </p>",

A quote within this main text is italicized and begins at the bottom of the first column of text and ends at the top of the second column of text. The bottom row is similar to the top row because it has two images, but the bottom row features two rectangular images side-by-side with each spanning half of the width of the sign. Each image has a caption in the right-hand corner in italicized black font.</p> <h2>Image (top row, left)</h2> <p> A black and white landscape of the Charlestown Navy Yard in the 1850s. In the foreground are ten people standing in front of a fenced-in field, which is depicted in two-thirds of the mid-ground of the drawing. On the left side of the image is a little boy playing “rolling the hoop.” He wears dark clothes and a dark hat and stands to the right of a tree that extends up the drawing’s left side. To his right, a man in a dark uniform faces the field. To his right are three soldiers walking to the right along the field’s fence. They wear light pants, dark hats, and carry guns. To their right, a little girl, a woman, and a little boy stand on grass in the center of the image. The little girl, wearing a light dress, stands to the left of the woman and holds her hand. The woman is in a dark dress and holds a sunshade in her other hand. The little boy wears a dark jacket and dark hat and stands to the right. The side-profiles of a man and woman standing arm in arm are to the right of the woman and children. The man wears dark clothing and is holding a cane in his right hand. The woman is wearing a light bonnet and light dress. The couple walks on wooden planks that extend along the bottom of the drawing. A little further back in the sketch, near the forward right corner of the field is a large tree. Five people stand to the right of the tree, alongside the fence. Two more people stand to the left of the tree. Another person stands to the left of them, alongside the fence. The sky takes up most of the image’s background. Trees line the left side of the fenced-in field. Three white buildings are towards the rear of the field. One is a small barn, which is in front of a multi-story building, while another multi-story building is to the right. A large American flag is raised on a pole on the right side of the field and waves over the field. A smattering of trees and a grassy area disappear into the background along the left side of the image. Two large white buildings sit on the horizon, to the right of the field, with plumes of smoke rising from chimneys. More smoke is in the distance from other buildings. Soldiers stand in formation in front of the buildings. The Charlestown Dry Dock with a ship in it is in front of the buildings, to the right of the soldiers. A masted ship is beyond the dry dock in the distance.  </p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>Looking east toward the dry dock in the 1850s. </p> <h2>Image (top row, right)</h2> <p>A black-and-white aerial view of Charlestown. In the foreground, a highway overpass bisects homes and buildings as it runs from the left middle of the image diagonally towards the bottom. Dark and light multi-story buildings fill the bottom left corner of the image and continue on the other half of the image to the right of the highway. The Charlestown Navy Yard is seen in the center mid-ground of the image and continues to the right. A destroyer sits in the dry dock in front of the building in the center of the image. Behind it are numerous light-colored images. The harbor fills the right top quarter of the image and ships are docked near the yard. The harbor continues through the background of the image. The outline of East Boston is in the background beyond the harbor and docks jut out into the water along the harbor.</p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>Looking east past the dry docks in the 1950s. </p> <h2>Main Text</h2> <p>In its first years, the navy yard consisted of a small dock and several wooden storehouses, surrounded by mud flats and rolling pastures. In 1812, the commandant noted: “the establishment...afforded no advantage or facility for naval purposes...a few temporary wooden buildings were all it contained, except the commandant’s house and the Marine barracks — unenclosed, it was even exposed to the inroads of cattle from the highway.” The navy yard soon changed, keeping pace with the country’s growth and power. Two imposing “shiphouses,” 210 feet long and six stories high, sheltered new 74-gun “ships of the line.” Timber sheds, a mast house, a ropewalk, sail lofts, and wharves crowded the yard. Steam, and later electricity, further transformed the yard. Machine shops, a forge, and foundries now served a navy made of steel. Hemmed in by river and town, the yard pushed into the harbor with piers, railways, and cranes.  </p> <h2>Image (bottom row, left)</h2> <p>A drawing of the Charlestown Navy Yard as seen from the harbor. In the foreground is a dock that extends into the harbor from the left corner of the image. A wooden fence lines the left side of the dock, while barrels line the right side. On the left side of the dock, a man holds a stick or cane in his left arm and his right arm reaches out to a horse on the right that is pulling a two-wheeled buggy away from the water. Towards the end of the dock, another man stands and looks out at the water. The harbor engulfs the rest of the foreground as well as the mid-ground of the drawing. A boat is docked at the end, with its mast rising in the center of the dock. To its left, wooden beams stand upright next to the fence. To the left of the dock and in the water several wooden beams bound together. Two other masts stick out above the wooden fence of the dock. To the right of the dock, a small boat is in the water. Two men are sitting in the bow, while a pile of boxes sits in the stern. The boat is rowed towards a large three-masted ship, likely the USS <em>Constitution</em>, docked in the harbor on the left of the drawing. A sailboat is in the water to the right of the small boat. Light multi-story Navy Yard buildings extend from the left to the right of the background behind the ships and harbor. An American flag on a pole flies in front of the buildings on the left. Four chimneys rise from buildings in the center of the background. Smoke rises to the left from three of them. Smaller one-story buildings are in front of two large buildings in the center of the image. Another American flag waves from a tall pole in front of them. Three five-level buildings are lined up along the harbor on the right side of the drawing. Two three-masted ships are docked in the water in front of them. There is light colored sky above the buildings. In the distant background to the right, past the end of the Navy Yard, is a grassy area with trees and another building.</p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>Seen from the harbor in 1873. </p> <h2>Image (bottom row, right)</h2> <p>Photo of the Charlestown Navy Yard from across the harbor. Choppy harbor water fills the foreground of the photograph. The Navy Yard itself is in the mid-ground of the image and extends from left to right. Four ships are docked in the left half of the photo with their masts rising into the sky. Multi-story buildings are behind them. In between the third and fourth ships sits a building with an archway. Three chimneys rise from the buildings behind the ships. Another building and archway is to the right of the chimneys. A ship is docked in front of it. A multi-story building is behind that ship to the right. Another ship is to the right. The background of the image features the sky.  </p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p>Seen from the harbor in 1922.  </p>",

The third and final row are italicized captions beneath each of the three images. The headers of the captions are bolded and the sub-text is italicized.</p> <h2>Main Text (Top row, Left corner)</h2> <p>Thousands of civilians spent their work days in the yard, then returned home to their Boston neighborhoods. For a few naval personnel, however, the yard was both a work-place and a home. For those who lived here, whether in the luxurious Commandant’s House on the hill, the elegant officers’ quarters to your left, or the spartan Marine Barracks on the hill to your right, the navy yard became their “community.”</p> <h2>Image (Top row, Middle)</h2> <p>Black and white of an interior porch. The far left wall is full of grid-paned windows with blinds. A man in black stands by the window, with his left hand resting on the window. He looks outside the window. In the foreground in front of the man is a glass table with white trim and ornamental designs on the edges of each corner. White chairs have matching designs for the backs. Further in the room behind the man are additional chairs with a woman in a dark outfit resting in a chair. Her chair is next to a glass-paned door that has rectangular windows on either side and above it. To the right edge of the photograph are two chairs with a cabinet between them.</p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p><em>(Left)</em> The porch of the Commandant’s House in the 1960s, facing the yard.</p> <h2>Image (Top row, Right corner)</h2> <p>Black and white sketch of four men sitting around a table. Two of the men are in dark clothing with the other two in light colored clothing. Two men sit on a long bench next to table, another sits across from them, and the final man sits on top of the table with his right leg resting up on the table. Above them are wooden beams.</p> <h3>Image Caption</h3> <p><em>(Right)</em> Sleeping quarters in the Marine Barracks in 1850. The Marine Corps enforced law and provided security for the yard. Over the years the detachment varied from 15 marines to its World War II strength of 600 marines.</p> <h2>Image (Bottom row, Left)</h2> <p>Black and white image of a row of five town houses with people wearing late 19th century clothing posed on the lawn in front of the houses. These town houses are two stories with a basement. The basement has visible windows flush with the ground, while staircases lead up to the first floor. The doors are on the right side of each town house and two windows are to the left of the doors. The second floor of each house is three windows across. Each house has a dormer and two chimneys. Young children and women stand in front of the homes, a couple of the women have strollers in front of them. There are trees in front of the far-left town house and the far-right town house. The trees do not have leaves.</p> <h3>Image Caption Title (Bottom row, Left)</h3> <p>Officers’ Row in 1882</p> <h3>Image Caption Text (Bottom row, Left)</h3> <p>In 1833, the Navy built a row of five houses for master tradesmen. These warrant officers, such as the master sailmaker and the master carpenter; managed the principal shops of the yard for the commandant. Today these houses are private residences for National Park Service and Navy families.</p> <h2>Image (Bottom row, Middle)</h2> <p>Black and white print of a garden in the foreground with a building in the background to the right. A tall tree with leaves borders the left edge of the image. Grass or dirt is in the foreground. The garden is contained by a four-bar fence. The garden has shrubbery and a few tall trees. A person and a child stand facing the fence with backs turned. Additional people walk along the fence of the garden. The building is three stories. The side facing the garden consists of two adjoined curved walls, similar to two towers side by side. Each curved wall has a window with shutters on each floor. A staircase leads up to the second floor of the building.</p> <h3>Image Caption Title (Bottom row, Middle)</h3> <p>Commandant’s House in 1852</p> <h3>Image Caption Text (Bottom row, Middle)</h3> <p>Built in 1805, the house on the hill was a home for the commandant of the yard and his family. For 170 years, the 14-room mansion was also the scene of local, national, and international receptions. Today the house continues to host receptions and special events.</p> <h2>Image (Bottom row, Right)</h2> <p>Two rows of marines standing at attention outside a multi-story building. The Marines are dressed in 19th century uniforms, carrying rifles. The butt of the guns rest on the ground while the marines hold the barrel in front of them. A few people watching the marines stand in the background underneath the awning of the building. Large windows with shutters are under the awning. The two stories above the awning each have nine windows with shutters visible.</p> <h3>Image Caption Title (Bottom row, Right)</h3> <p>Marine Barracks in the 1860s</p> <h3>Image Caption Text (Bottom row, Right)</h3> <p>Today’s Marine Barracks still contain elements from the original structure built in 1810, and are thus the oldest surviving marine barracks in the United States.

The text includes the title, “USS <em>Cassin Young</em>,” aligned to the left. Aligned to the right in the banner are two columns of two lines of text. The first column of text is “Boston National Historical Park,” followed by “Charlestown Navy Yard.” The second column states “National Park Service,” followed by “U.S. Department of the Interior.” The rest of the panel has a gray background with black text, black and white images, and a color map. The top third of the panel has a diagram of a destroyer looking at the starboard side of the ship. The mast of the ship intersects the black banner at the top. Above the left end of the diagram are two columns of text serving as a diagram caption. The caption title is bolded, while the other text is italicized. Above the right end of the diagram is a short list of measurements about the ship. Directly below the diagram is two columns of text, taking up two-thirds of the panel’s width. Beneath these columns of text is a black bar with three images spaced beneath it. In the black bar are titles of the images. To the right of the text and images in the bottom right third of the panel is a map outlined in black. A thicker black strip above the map features white text aligned left. The map has mostly black labels with areas of importance labeled in red. Beneath the map are two short columns of text related to the map. Dates are bolded. Points that are labeled in red in the map are also printed in red within this text.</p> <h2>Ship Diagram</h2> <p>The ship fills the full width of the panel, with the stern on the left and the bow on the right. The ship’s hull is divided into the three sections from top to bottom. The bottom portion of the ship is a salmon color, likely to indicate the part of the ship that is beneath the water. The middle section is a thin black bar on the hull of the ship. The top portion of the hull is white. On top of the hull is the rest of the ship which includes guns, smoke stacks, and an observation deck, which are mostly white with black outlines. Different parts of the ship are sometimes identified by a black vertical line with text adjacent to the left. From stern to bow (or from left to right of the diagram) the first is at the stern of the ship where a track is visible. This is identified as the “Depth charge release track.” Directly to the right of this marker is a gun on the deck that is a “20 mm anti-aircraft gun.” A little bit of empty space on the deck separates this gun from a larger gun on the deck that points over the stern. Raised to the right of this gun is another one, pointing in the same direction. To the right is a smaller gun that is identified as a “40 mm anti-aircraft gun.” The next gun to the right is similar to the two prior to the 40 mm gun. It is labeled as a “5” air/surface gun.” To the right of this gun is a “21” torpedo mount.” At the center of the ship are two smokestacks, one after another, separated by another torpedo mount. To the right of these smokestacks is a raised platform that serves as the observation deck of the destroyer. To the right of the deck is the bow of the ship, which has two more 5” guns, one raised above the other and both pointing out towards the bow.</p> <h2>Text (Above Diagram, Left)</h2> <p>The Fletcher Class. A destroyer’s design balances speed and weaponry. Often the ship’s mission is to “screen” or protect a ship of greater strategic value. Of 175 Fletcher Class destroyers built during World War II, 171 went to war in the Pacific. The Charlestown Navy Yard built 14 of these ships.</p> <h2>Text (Above Diagram, Right):</h2> <p>DD-793 as built December 1943<br /> Length 376ft.-6in.<br /> Beam 39ft.-8in.<br /> Draft 17ft.-9in.<br /> Displacement 2050 tons std.<br /> Top Speed 36 knots (41 MPH)<br /> Crew 325</p> <h2>Main Text</h2> <p>USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793), a Fletcher-class destroyer built in San Pedro, California, was commissioned on December 31, 1943. The ship honors Captain Cassin Young, who earned the Medal of Honor at Pearl Harbor, and later died in the Battle of Guadalcanal. USS <em>Cassin Young</em> logged nearly 150,000 miles in the Pacific in World War II. While on radar “picket duty” at Okinawa, the ship sustained two kamikaze hits, leaving 127 Americans dead or wounded. USS <em>Cassin Young</em> again served in the Korean Conflict, and during the 1950s visited the Charlestown Navy Yard four times for modernization and repair. The ship was decommissioned in 1960 but returned to Dry Dock 1 in 1978 for an overhaul to restore a 1950s appearance. USS <em>Cassin Young</em> opened to the public in 1981 as part of Boston National Historical Park.</p> <h2>Image (Bottom Left)</h2> <p>Black and white photograph looking down on sailors in uniforms on the deck of the ship. Along the bottom of the photograph are two rows of four sailors, beginning at the bottom of the image. Their backs are turned towards the water. Facing the water is a row of six sailors. Each sailor stands along the railing of the deck and points their rifle over the side out to the water. Behind the two men closest to the other sailors is another sailor. The sailor, possibly an officer, faces the men with the guns.</p> <h3>Image Title (Bottom Left)</h3> <p>Burial at sea (1945)</p> <h2>Image (Bottom Middle)</h2> <p>Black and white photograph of six ships floating in choppy water side by side. The ship on the far left is almost twice the height of the rest of the ships. It is dark and the deck is barely visible from the water. The rest of the ships are all the same size and design, with the observation decks visible and radar antennas pointing into the sky. Small people are barely visible on the decks. Below the image in the right corner is text reading “National Archives.”</p> <h3>Image Title (Bottom Middle)</h3> <p>DD-793 (far right) alongside a tender at Ulithi (1944)</p> <h2>Image (Bottom Right)</h2> <p>Black and white group photograph of 14 sailors. They are divided among three rows. The four men in the first row sit on the ground with their legs crossed. The man on the left wears a long-sleeve shirt while the other three have rolled up their sleeves beyond their elbows. They wear dark pants and dark caps. The five men in the middle row are crouched on their knees. They also rolled up the sleeves of their shirts. The man on the left and the man in the middle wear light-colored hats while the other three wear dark caps. Five men stand in the back row. The man on the left is an officer and wears an officer’s uniform and hat. The man to the right wears an all-white uniform. The final three men wear light shirts and have rolled up their long sleeves. The also wear dark caps.</p> <h3>Image Title (Bottom Right)</h3> <p>Fire control crew (1944)</p> <h2>Map</h2> <p>This map is of the Pacific Ocean and surrounding countries. The ocean is blue and the land masses are light tan. The right two-thirds of the map is mainly ocean, with part of Alaska peaking out from the top right corner, labeled “Alaska.” The water is labeled “Pacific Ocean.” Land fills the top left corner of the map. This area is labeled “Soviet Union.” Just southeast of the Soviet Union is Korea with Japan off its coast. Both of these countries are labeled. China is visible in the center of the left edge of the map and is also labeled. To the southeast of China are islands that are labeled “Philippines.” Peeking out from the bottom border of the map, about one-third of the width from the left bottom corner is land labeled “Australia.” A legend is labeled and located in the right corner of the map, in the middle of the ocean. The legend consists of two lines. The first includes a small plane next to the label “Kamikaze hits.” The second line has a cross labeled “USS Princeton sinks.” Above the legend on the right side of the ocean is an island labeled “Midway” (left) and “Hawaiian Islands” across islands to the right. Within the Hawaiian Islands is a label “Pearl Harbor.” The focus of the map is on two thick blue sweeping lines with arrows at the end. They both begin near the bottom border of the map, about a third of the width from the right border. They are labeled in blue as “Allied Offensives.” The right line sweeps up towards the center of the map with a slight curve to the left. It passes islands labeled “Kwajalein” and “Wake.” There is a bend in the curve where the line reaches “Saipan,” labeled in red. Here, a thin blue line breaks off west and points to the Philippines, passing “Leyte Gulf,” also labeled in red. Two thin blue lines break off this thin line and each point South. The one to the right points to “Guam.” The one to the left points to an island next to Leyte Gulf. An island between these two lines is labeled “Ulithi.” The original thick blue line continues past the bend and curves up. It passes Iwo Jima and Okinawa, both labeled in red. The arrow ends just beyond Okinawa where there are two planes from the legend. The second thick blue line travels up into the map to the left of the other thick blue line. It passes by Guadalcanal and moves up towards the Philippines. It travels past the Leyte Gulf where the small arrow meets it. The big arrow points to islands in the Philippines labeled “FORMOSA” and beneath it, “Luzon.” Off the eastern coast of Luzon is the cross from the legend. A final thin blue line points away from the Philippines southwest and travels between the continent and an island. On the coast of the continent is a spot marked “Cam Ranh Bay” in red.</p> <h3>Map Title</h3> <p>USS <em>Cassin Young</em> in the Pacific Theater, 1944-1945</p> <h3>Map Text</h3> <p>May/June 1944: Sails from Pearl Harbor.

The panel is framed in black metal. The sign is located on the sidewalk on the northwest side of 1<sup>st</sup> Avenue, facing the large anchors and tennis courts. The Marine Barracks are visible beyond the tennis courts.</p> <h2>Layout</h2> <p>At the top of the sign is a black banner with white text. The text includes the title, \"Working in the Yard,\" aligned to the left. Aligned to the right in the banner are two columns of two lines of text. The first column of text is \"Boston National Historical Park,\" followed by \"Charlestown Navy Yard.\" The second column states \"National Park Service,\" followed by \"U.S. Department of the Interior.\" The rest of the panel has a gray background with black text and black and white images. Titles of captions are bolded, while additional information is in italics. The panel is divided into three columns. The left column has a long portrait-oriented image that fills approximately the top 4/5 of the column. The image has a credit line beneath the bottom right corner. Below this image are two columns, each with a caption. The top third of the middle column is text. Below the text is a thick black bar separating it from the images below. A two x two grid is below this black bar, with the top two grid squares consisting of images, and the bottom left section also having an image with an image credit beneath it. The final grid section in the bottom right has captions. The right column has the same format as the left column. It has a long portrait-oriented image that fills approximately the top 4/5 of the column. Below this image are two columns, the left has a caption and the right has a quote. The quote is not-italicized while the name of the speaker is italicized.</p> <h2>Image (Left column)</h2> <p>Black and white photograph of workers leaving the Navy Yard. The photographer took the picture from several feet up in the air, possibly the roof of a nearby one or two-story building. A large mass of workers exit the Navy Yard through a large arch gateway. The right side of the arch is visible, however, the left side is not visible. Just the bottom portion of the arch’s pediment is visible in the top of the photograph. At the very top center is the bottom half of an engraved sign that states \"Navy Yard.\" Below this sign in the middle is a decorative eagle atop a shield. Most of the arch is dark brick, but the interior of the arch gateway has light brick or granite. Two light posts with large round lights are on either side of the interior entrance of the arch. The arched gateway is several feet deep with additional lighting on the walls. A stream of men walk through the archway. All are wearing a variety of hats as well as dark and light-colored coats. The stream of people is visible through the archway to the other side, with the shapes of people barely visible. A building is also visible through the archway to the right, with an escape ladder along its side.</p> <h3>Image Credit</h3> <p>Boston Globe</p> <h3>Image Caption Title (Left column, Bottom left)</h3> <p>(Above) Shift change during World War II.</p> <h3>Image Caption (Left column, Bottom left)</h3> <p>The portal over Gate 1 was demolished after the war.</p> <h2>Main Text (Middle column)</h2> <p>When the Charlestown Navy Yard opened in 1800, Boston's skilled maritime workers provided a ready source of labor. As sail gave way to steam, and wooden hulls gave way to iron and steel, the work of building, repairing, and maintaining a fleet changed with modern technology. The size of the work force also changed, varying with war, peace, and the size of the fleet. During World War II, more than 50,000 full-time employees worked round-the-clock in such specialized jobs as ship fitter, boilermaker, and foundry worker.</p> <h2>Image (Middle column, Top-left image in grid)</h2> <p>Black and white photograph of a very long room, with the end of the room barely visible in the background. A machine spans the entire length of this room. The machine is several feet high, approximately only half the height of the room. It is light in color, whereas the floor next to the machine is dark. In the foreground, a man sits facing forward next to the machine. He has short-cropped dark hair and wears a light-colored shirt and slightly dark pants. His right hand is on the machine while his left-hand rests on his leg. To the right, a small sign hangs from the ceiling stating \"No Passing Through.\"</p> <h2>Image (Middle column, Top-right image in grid)</h2> <p>Black and white photograph of foundry workers. Featured in the foreground are a few links of die-lock chain hanging from above the top border of the photograph. They hang and drape down to the mid-ground of the photograph where half a link rests on a machine. A worker uses two hands to hold a metal tool that is clasping half a link. He is placing it on the resting half of a link. The worker is wearing gloves, a protective suit, and goggles. He has dark short-cropped hair. Behind him in the background is another worker watching the process. He also wears glasses but is not wearing a protective suit. Instead, he has a hat, light-colored shirt, and dark pants.</p> <h2>Image (Middle column, Bottom-left image in grid)</h2> <p>Black and white photograph of an octagonal building. In the foreground in front of the building is a short grassy hill that engulfs the bottom quarter of the image. On top of the short hill is a tree that aligns with the left border of the photograph. Two cannons are visible on the hill. The very tip of one is visible on the left edge of the photograph, and the other is on the right side of the hill, in the mid-ground of the picture. The building juts up behind this little hill in the background. The second and third story are visible. These floors have two windows on each side of the building. A slanted roof is above the third story. A cupola tops the roof. It has a clock and arched windows. Its roof has a steep slant that is slightly curved inward. Behind it, in the background, is another building.</p> <h3>Image Credit (Bottom right)</h3> <p>Boston Public Library</p> <h3>Caption Title (Left column, Bottom right)</h3> <p>(Right) The Muster House.</p> <h3>Caption (Left column, Bottom right)</h3> <p>Until the 1890s, employees gathered three times daily at the octagonal Muster House for work assignments and attendance. As the labor force grew, workers reported directly to their shops.</p> <h2>Caption Title (Middle column, Bottom-left section of grid)</h2> <p>Supplying the ships.</p> <h3>Caption (Middle column, Bottom-left section of grid)</h3> <p>(Above, left) Workers produced rope in the quarter-mile-long Ropewalk, built in the 1830s. (Above, right) In 1926, navy yard workers invented die-lock anchor chain in the Chain Forge.</p> <h2>Image (Right column)</h2> <p>Black and white photograph of nine women welders working on the hull of a ship. Two columns of metal span the hull of the ship from the top left of the photograph to the bottom right side of the photograph. Horizontal bars of metal are laid across the hull evenly spaced from the top of the photograph to the bottom of the photograph. The women are spread out across the hull of the ship, with cords weaving to where each of them works and use their power tools. Each woman wears a light-colored long sleeve shirt with dark pants, as well as gloves and welder's masks. Bright light is visible where some of the women have their welder’s tools on the hull of the ship.</p> <h3>Caption Title (Right column, Bottom left)</h3> <p>Women welders in 1943.</p> <h3>Image Caption (Right column, Bottom left)</h3> <p>During World War II, as more and more men left for combat, women took over positions traditionally held by men, including welders, riveters, and machinists.</p> <h2>Quote (Right column, Bottom right)</h2> <p>We all felt that we were doing our job, and the harder we worked, the faster we would get the ships out, and the faster (the war) would get over.

    "bodyText": "<p>When the first European colonists settled in Boston in the 1620s, the area of the city we now know as Beacon Hill comprised of three peaks. The colonists referred to this area as the Tri-mountain, or Tra-mount or Tre-mount. They also called it Sentry Hill.<sup>1</sup> In 1635, these early English settlers erected a tall wooden beacon atop the hill to warn the countryside of any danger, attack, or outbreak. From that day forth, the area became known as Beacon Hill.</p> <p>Thomas Hancock, a wealthy merchant, built the first home on Beacon Hill in 1737.<sup>2</sup> Following his death, and that of his widow, this mansion became the home of his nephew, the merchant and patriot leader <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-hancock.htm\">John Hancock</a>. During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a>, 1775-1776, the British military took over this house and used it as their headquarters.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>At this time, British commander General Gage removed the beacon from Beacon Hill. According to historian William W. Wheildon:</p> <blockquote>After the discomfiture of the 19th of April, and on account of the gathering of Provincial troops at Cambridge, he found it necessary to increase and, extend his defences; and among other things a small fort was built on Beacon Hill and the Beacon removed.<sup>4</sup></blockquote> <p>Following the British evacuation in March 1776, Bostonians quickly replaced the beacon. It remained there until a storm blew it down in 1789. The Beacon Hill Eagle Memorial, designed by Charles Bulfinch, now stands in its place as a lasting reminder of Boston's revolutionary legacy.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Bulfinch also played a prominent role in the transformation of Beacon Hill into an enclave for wealthy and powerful Bostonians, who became known as the Boston Brahmins. Bulfinch designed the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/massachusetts-state-house.htm\">Massachusetts State House</a>, completed in 1798, which continues to serve as the seat of political power in the Commonwealth. He also joined with four other businessmen to form the Mount Vernon Proprietors. This real estate syndicate purchased land from the artist John Singleton Copley and began developing the southern slope of Beacon Hill, overlooking <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-common-ma.htm\">Boston Common</a>, with lavish homes for Boston’s elite.</p> <p>The north and western slopes of Beacon Hill, on the other hand, served as the home of a working and middle class community, including many free African Americans. This area became a hotbed of abolitionist and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/boston-an-underground-railroad-hub.htm\">Underground Railroad</a> activity in the years leading up to the U.S. Civil War. Today, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/virtual-black-heritage-trail-tour.htm\">Black Heritage Trail<sup>®</sup></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.maah.org/\">Museum of African American History</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boaf/index.htm\">Boston African American National Historic Site</a> commemorate this remarkable and often overlooked history of Beacon Hill.</p> <p>To fill in land around the city, Bostonians removed parts of the three hills that made up the original Tri-mountain, leaving the landscape we see today. Throughout its history, Beacon Hill has served as home for wealthy merchants and poor immigrants, industrialists and skilled artisans, social reformers and activists, political and religious leaders, writers, artists, and laborers. Its residents, their homes, and their gathering spaces played a transformational role in Boston's unique social, cultural, and political history.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>William Wheildon, <em>Sentry, or Beacon Hill; The Beacon and the Monument of 1635 and 1790</em> (Concord, MA: Author’s address, 1877) 9, accessed February 2022 through archive.org, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/orbeaconhi00wheildon/page/10/mode/2up\">https://archive.org/details/orbeaconhi00wheildon/page/10/mode/2up</a>.</li> <li>Wheildon, <em>Sentry, or Beacon Hill</em>, 48.</li> <li>\"The John Hancock House, Boston, Mass.\" <em>Historic New England</em>, accessed February 2022, <a href=\"https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections-access/gusn/103657/\">https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections-access/gusn/103657/</a>.</li> <li>Wheildon, 58.</li> <li>\"Massachusetts Facts,\" <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts</em>, accessed February 2022, <a href=\"https://www.sec.state.ma.us/cis/cismaf/mf3.htm\">https://www.sec.state.ma.us/cis/cismaf/mf3.htm</a>; \"Beacon Hill Eagle Monument,\" <em>Museum without Walls, Culture Now</em>, accessed February 2022, <a href=\"https://culturenow.org/entry&permalink=05702&seo=Beacon-Hill-Eagle-Monument_Charles-Bulfinch-and-Boston-Art-Commission\">https://culturenow.org/entry&permalink=05702&seo=Beacon-Hill-Eagle-Monument_Charles-Bulfinch-and-Boston-Art-Commission</a>.</li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Considered the oldest public park in the United States, Boston Common played an important role in the history of conservation, landscape architecture, military and political history, and recreation in Massachusetts. The Common and the adjoining <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-3e4de616-7fff-deb0-551a-3c5feb54a5da\"><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/places/boston-public-garden.htm\">Public Garden</a></b> are among the greatest amenities and most visited outdoor public spaces in Boston. The history of the Common's use by the city illuminates the conservation movement in Massachusetts and mirrors similar models carried out by American conservationists throughout the nation.</p> <p>In 1634, the townspeople of Boston voted to tax each household six schillings for the purchase of William Blackstone's farm to be used as a community common. The newly established Common served a combination of public, military, agricultural, and recreational purposes. In the 1600s and 1700s, companies from Boston and surrounding communities performed military training on the Common. During the winter of 1775 and 1776, British soldiers installed artillery entrenchments on the Common, and a garrison of 1,700 soldiers remained encamped there. Other early public uses of the Common included public hangings and whippings. The Common also served agricultural purposes. The Common was a pasture for cattle from the time of its creation through the early decades of the 1800s. As an early example of \"utilitarian\" conservation, regulations protected the land from overgrazing by restricting the number of cattle each family could graze on the Common.</p> <p>There were also indications the Common was a place for recreation as early as the 1660s. John Josselyn wrote about men and women of Boston enjoying evening strolls on the Common: \"On the South there is a small, but pleasant Common where the Gallants a little before Sun-set walk with their Marmalet-Madams…till the nine a clock Bell rings them home to their respective habitations, when presently the Constables walk their rounds to see good orders kept, and to take up loose people.\"</p> <p>Children enjoyed the Common, too, wading in the Frog Pond in summer, and skating and sledding in the winter. Gradually recreational activities began to dominate the Common. The changes in land use mirrored changes in landscape design. The first wide, tree-lined mall added along Tremont Street in 1722 is one reflection of these changes. As the city grew, livestock grazing was further and further restricted, with cows forbidden altogether in 1830 and pasture fences removed in 1836.</p> <p>In the 1800s as the Urban Parks Movement gained momentum, the Common began to acquire monuments, fountains, and artwork. Erected in 1897, the most famous of these memorials honors <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/robert-gould-shaw-and-massachusetts-54th-regiment-memorial.htm\">Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Infantry</a>, a celebrated regiment of free Black soldiers who fought in the American Civil War. Distinguished sculptor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/augustus-saint-gaudens.htm\">Augustus St. Gaudens</a> was the designer and McKim, Mead, and White were the architects of the memorial. The 50-acre Common today is remarkably intact, due to the continued vigilance of local citizens. In the 1890s, a proposal to build a trolley line across the Common caused great public opposition that forced the examination of other transportation options, and in 1895, Boston installed the first subway in the United States. The first subway station, the Tremont Street Subway, still exists today bordering the Common along Tremont Street.</p> <p>Since its inception, activities held on the Common stretched beyond relaxation and recreation to include public assembly. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">George Washington</a>, John Adams, and General Lafayette celebrated our nation's independence in this space. In the 1800s, abolitionists strove to abolish slavery and the United States Army recruited soldiers to fight in the Civil War. During the fight for the 19th Amendment, women suffragists drew crowds at open-air meetings and rallies. In the 1900s, Charles Lindbergh spoke to crowds on the Common about the future of commercial aviation. Anti-Vietnam and Civil Rights rallies, including one led by Martin Luther King Jr., took place on the Common. Today, Bostonians still gather on the Common to protest grievances and promote new ideas.</p> <p>Used, enjoyed, and largely protected by generations, the Boston Common exemplifies the spirit of public conservation in Massachusetts and the trend in American cities to preserve nature within growing urban areas. Today visitors can enjoy ball fields, a tot lot, and the Frog Pond where the public skates in winter and children frolic in the summer. Other additions to the Common over time include a large underground parking garage and tennis courts. Despite these changes, the Common still retains its original function for the people of Boston: a relaxing open space in a congested city. Boston Common is one of the nine parks that are part of the Emerald Necklace, a 1,100-acre chain of parks linked by parkways.</p> <p>Boston Common was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1972. <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Read the full nomination at the National Archives</a> (learn more about the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">National Register of Historic Places program</a>).</p> <p>It was designated a National Historic Landmark on February 27, 1987 (learn more about the <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">National Historic Landmark program</a>).</p> <p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />You can learn more about Boston Common in the Teaching with Historic Places lesson plan,<b> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-emerald-necklace-boston-s-green-connection.htm\">The Emerald Necklace: Boston's Green Connection.</a></b></p> <p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />To discover more Massachusetts history and culture, visit the<b> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/subjects/travelmassconservation/index.htm\">Massachusetts Conservation Travel Itinerary website. </a></b></p>",
    "audioDescription": "Sprawling 50-acre park that is bordered by Beacon Street to the north, Park Street to the northeast, Tremont Street to the southeast, Boylston Street to the south, and Charles Street to the west. There is a slight incline moving from west to east and south to north, so the highest point of the Common is the northeast corner. While mostly composed of lawns split up by sidewalks, there are several significant elements. At the northeast corner, across from the Massachusetts State House, stands the Robert Gould Shaw/Massachusetts 54th Memorial, which is a two-sided marble sculpture with a bronze relief of soldiers on the north side facing the State House. The southeast corner contains two main entrances to Park Street MBTA station next to a plaza with a large, circular fountain that is three levels. The first level has figures in the Greco-Roman style; the second level has cherubs, and the top level has some ornamentation. About 200-300 feet southwest is the Visitor Center, a small hut that has stables attached behind it. Continue walking south to reach the Parkman Bandstand, a white gazebo. Tucked away in the southeast corner is Central Burying Ground, which contains hundreds of old headstones. West of the Bandstand and northwest of the Burying Ground are two tennis courts, as well as a baseball field and softball field that are facing each other. North of the Bandstand is a hill on which the Soldiers and Sailors Monument stands. The monument is composed of a white marble obelisk with bronze figures at each corner representing different military groups. The square base of the monument has different bronze reliefs of soldiers. Northeast of that hill is Frog Pond, a shallow, man-made concrete pond. Next to it is a one-story concrete building that holds restrooms, lockers, and refreshments for purchase. Finally, east of the pond is the Tadpole Playground, an enclosed playground with structures.",

Offering a diverse array of ecosystems as well as integral shelter, the Harbor and its islands have been a vital resource for inhabitants of the area for thousands of years.</p> <p>Boston Harbor served as a major trading port for the English colonies during the 1600s and 1700s, as ships carrying commodities often made their way through Boston before traveling down the coast. Boston and its harbor served as a significant stop in Atlantic trading routes, supporting an empire that trafficked enslaved individuals and traded goods consumed and produced by enslaved labor.</p> <p>Due to its strategic location, Boston Harbor became a center of conflict during the era of the American Revolution. As punishment for the 1773 Boston Tea Party, Parliament passed the Boston Port Act in 1774, which closed Boston Harbor to all ships. The first of what became known as the Coercive (or Intolerable) Acts, the Boston Port Act contributed to the organizing of the First Continental Congress later that year. During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a> in 1775 and 1776, skirmishes between British forces and colonial militia occurred across the islands as both sides battled for control of the Harbor and its resources. British forces eventually left Boston Harbor in June 1776.</p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/a90667c2-2194-472a-84fc-a466b2f27a04?\"><img alt=\"A painting of Boston and Boston Harbor.\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/a90667c2-2194-472a-84fc-a466b2f27a04/original.jpg?\" style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 80%;\" /></a> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\"View of the City of Boston from Dorchester Heights\" (Credit: Library of Congress)</em></p> <p>Maintaining its status as a fortified port and trading center throughout the 1800s, Boston Harbor played a significant role during abolition. Many enslaved individuals, especially those coming from states along the coast, utilized ships bound for northern ports to gain their freedom.

    "bodyText": "<p>Due to its close proximity to Boston and its pivotal role during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-bunker-hill.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a>, Breed's Hill in Charlestown is mostly remembered for its colonial and revolutionary ties. Settled by English colonists in 1625 and first known as \"Cherton,\" Charlestown became an important location of craft production thanks to deposits of clay and other raw materials. Home to three hills, there have been disagreements about the names of these heights since the 1600s. According to historian Richard M. Ketchum:</p> <blockquote>To the south of it [Bunker Hill], and connected to it by a lower, sloping ridge, was a height of land not sufficiently distinguished to bear any particular name. Some called it Charlestown Hill; others, considering it an appendage of Bunker Hill, referred to it by that title; while some of the local people, out of deference to a farmer whose cattle grazed there, called it Breed’s. Its steep western flank, covered with orchards and gardens, leveled out near the settlement of Charlestown.<sup>1</sup></blockquote> <p>By 1775, the population of Charlestown hovered around 2,000 to 3,000 people with 400 structures in it, mostly situated on the south shore facing Boston. Bunker and Breed's Hills, named after George Bunker and Ebenezer Breed, were mostly undeveloped with some farmhouses and pastures.<sup>2</sup> Lacking trees along the hills, residents of Boston had an unobstructed view of the Charlestown Heights from the northern section of town.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>After the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord, both the British and colonial forces focused on defensible locations surrounding the town of Boston. As the colonials dug trenches in Roxbury and Cambridge, the British forces began to prepare to take both the Charlestown and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/dohe.htm\">Dorchester Heights</a>: \"First, a detachment would move out against Dorchester Neck, throw up two redoubts there, and then attack the rebel post at Roxbury. Once Boston was safe from attack in that direction, Howe would take a large force to Charlestown Heights and either attack the Americans in Cambridge or outflank that post.\" Planned for June 18, General Gage and his staff felt confident they would prevail by the end of the day.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Learning of the plan, the colonial forces arrived at the Charlestown Heights first on June 16, 1775. Though there are conflicting reports of where the redoubt should have been placed, construction began around 12:30 am on June 17 at Breed's Hill. After building their defenses throughout the course of the day, the colonists held the high ground as the British troops landed along the Charlestown shoreline. Over the course of about two hours, the battle raged throughout the peninsula. Pitting 2,200 British troops against a varying number of Provincial (colonial) troops led by Colonel William Prescott, it would become one of the bloodiest battles of the American Revolution. Over 1,000 British soldiers, officers, and Marines were killed or wounded. Approximately 300 to 500 of the 1,400 to 1,800 provincial soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured. Breed's Hill would remain in the hands of the British Army until March 1776.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Though the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bh-ksl.htm\">King Solomon's Lodge Masons</a> dedicated a Monument dedicated to Joseph Warren in 1783, a new effort to honor all those who fought during the battle did not begin until the 1820s. On June 17, 1825, on the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the battle, a large crowd gathered for a cornerstone-laying ceremony for the future Bunker Hill Monument located at the top of Breed's Hill. Among those present that day were the General Marquis de Lafayette and former Massachusetts senator, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/daniel-webster.htm\">Daniel Webster</a>. It took another 18 years for the Monument to be realized.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Established on just four of the original 10 acres of the battle, the rest of the area soon became house lots and, eventually, the original Charlestown High School. Annexed by Boston in 1874, Charlestown became a popular neighborhood for working-class Irish immigrants.</p> <p>In 1923, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, then the caretaker of the Bunker Hill Monument, installed this plaque (below) on the exterior of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bh-lodge.htm\">Bunker Hill Lodge</a> adjacent to the Monument. Breed family members had appealed to the state, as they had previously appealed to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bhma.htm\">Bunker Hill Monument Association</a> when the Association owned the Monument, that the name \"Breed's Hill\" was not displayed somewhere prominently on the hill. State officials agreed and installed this plaque.<sup>7</sup></p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/22938209-0608-4a9f-9c38-69ad6efdfbe2\"><img alt=\"Plaque about Breed's Hill.\" class=\"center\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/22938209-0608-4a9f-9c38-69ad6efdfbe2/original.jpg?\" style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 60%;\" /></a> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This plaque states: \"Breed's Hill Site of the Battle of Bunker Hill Fought June 17, 1775 Although orders were issued by the Committee of Safety to Seize and Fortify Bunker Hill the Colonial Officers After Consultation Fortified this Hill on June 16, 1775.\" (NPS Photo).</em></p> <p>Today, Breed's Hill hosts about 2% of the population of Boston with 18,058 residents.<sup>8</sup></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Richard M.

    "bodyText": "<p>Building 10, now the Shipyard Galley, has been the site of many different activities, reflecting the changing needs of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/cny.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard</a> since 1853. During its first 50 years, Building 10 was known as the Pitch House, where workers produced the tar that helped keep sailing ships watertight. At the turn of the 20th century, the Pitch House became the Paint Shop. For ten years, staff of Building 10 mixed gallons of paint. They used this paint to help preserve wooden and metal ships.</p> <p>The role of the building shifted in 1911 when Building 10 became a radio-transmitter station for messages to ships at sea. For example, in April 1912, sailors sent a message from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-howard-taft.htm\">U.S. President Taft</a> to the rescue ships of the Titanic. Starting in 1918 and throughout World War II, Building 10 served as the Laundry, where civilians and sailors cleaned the clothing of navy personnel and their families.</p> <p>In 1948, the use of this two-story, Federalist-style building changed again to become a sonar equipment testing and repair facility. The Navy expanded Building 10 by adding 2 bays on its north side for the sonar tasks.</p> <p>Building 10 took on its last naval function in 1958. When the sonar program re-located, this building converted into a charging station for ship batteries. Building 10 charged batteries for about 15 years until 1972, two years before the federal government closed the Charlestown Navy Yard.</p> <p>In 1973, Building 10 reopened as the <a href=\"https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/\">USS Constitution Museum</a> because of its close location to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/ussconst.htm\">USS <em>Constitution</em></a>. When the Museum moved into its current location in 1976, Building 10 became the Shipyard Galley.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p>USS Constitution Museum: <a href=\"https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/locations/building-10-pitch-house-and-oakum-loft/\">Building 10 - Pitch House and Oakum Loft</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/charlestown-navy-yard-building-10.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard: Building 10 </a></p> <h2>Sources</h2> <ul> <li>Black, Frederick R. and Edwin C.

    "audioDescription": "Building 10 is a two-story, three-bay-by-five-bay, rectangular brick building designed in the Greek Revival style. It has a slate shingle-clad, front-gable roof, two shed-roof dormers on the east and west slopes, and a denticulated brick cornice. The brick walls are laid in common bond. An addition extends the 5-bay side to 7-bays. The primary entrance is located in the center of the south (facade) elevation and consists of a wood panel door with a granite lintel. Secondary entrances with wood panel double doors are located in the south ends of the west and east elevations. The windows in the original building has granite lintels and sills while those in the addition have concrete lintels and sills. A white door is located next to the far left window on the second story of the facade. It opens to an exterior square platform with a staircase running parallel to the building, leading down to the ground. A large wood sign over the primary entrance reads \"Shipyard Galley Bldg 10.\"",

The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/commandants-house.htm\">Commandant's House</a> (1805) and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/marine-barracks-cny.htm\">Marine Barracks</a> (1811) are the only buildings constructed before Building 5 (1816). This warehouse's plain, Federalist-style façade reflects its early storage function.</p> <p>Building 5 resembles other warehouses built in Boston in the early 1800s. This sturdy building is over 200 feet long and three-stories high. While its pitched slate roof remains, original chimneys have been removed and many doors have been converted into windows.</p> <p>No other building in the Charlestown Navy Yard has had as many strikingly different uses as Building 5, reflecting the complexity of the 175-year history of the US Navy in Boston.</p> <p>Building 5 primarily stored lumber and other shipbuilding materials and was known as the Navy Store. By 1869 and into 1900, the Navy expanded the use of this large building to include various offices, as well as a dispensary (clinic), a print shop, a Naval Museum, and a library.</p> <p>In the early 1900s, wishing to increase the services available within the Charlestown Navy Yard, the US Navy further expanded the use of Building 5. The U.S. Navy added a commissary (grocery store), a barber shop, and a clothing store. After the dispensary moved into its own building in 1905, a dental office opened in Building 5 (1906 to 1910). Also, during the first decades of the 1900s, the chaplain and the Naval Reserve had offices here. Naval officers and servicemen also refined their marksmanship at Building 5's Rifle Range and rehearsed for the Navy Band in the building's practice space.</p> <p>In 1936, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) renovated the interior of Building 5. Still visible on the first floor are the huge, steel girders that the WPA installed to stabilize this heavily-used, over 200 year-old building. At this time (1936), the Navy Yard installed an exterior plaque at the northeast corner of Building 5 that marks the landing of British re-enforcements in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-bunker-hill.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775</a>.</p> <p>World War II changed the use of Building 5 yet again. It became the Officers' Club and mess, office space, classrooms, and the Bachelor Officers' Quarters. These uses continued until 1974.</p> <p>That year, the Charlestown Navy Yard closed and the National Park Service was charged with preserving the history of this Navy Yard and some of its buildings. Building 5, being close to the main entrance to the Yard (Gate 1) and the USS <em>Constitution</em> and Museum, made it an ideal location for a visitor center and exhibition space.</p> <p>In 2008, the first floor of Building 5 opened as a visitor center with an exhibit on the history of the Charlestown Navy Yard called \"Serving the Naval Fleet.\" Currently, the National Park Service and U.S. Navy share the other floors of Building 5.</p> <h2>Sources</h2> <ul> <li>Carlson, Stephen P.

    "bodyText": "<p>With an elevation of 110 feet, Bunker Hill is one of the tallest hills near Boston. Like other hills around Boston, Bunker Hill is a drumlin, or elongated hill, formed by a retreating glacier eons ago. George Bunker, an early resident of colonial Charlestown, once owned the land that included this hill. Provincials used Bunker Hill for agricultural purposes.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/historyculture/april-19-1775.htm\">Battle of Lexington and Concord</a> in April 1775, the Provincials, or colonial forces, looked at Bunker Hill and other hills as military positions. These hills provided high ground with panoramic views and placements for cannon. Provincials planned a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a> to drive out the British military that had been in Boston since 1774 as part of the British Coercive Acts.</p> <p>British military leaders in Boston saw the advantage of occupying both Bunker Hill, located north of Boston, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/dorchester-heights.htm\">Dorchester Heights</a>, located in the south, to break the Siege of Boston. Before the British could act, the Provincials took Bunker Hill for themselves on the night of June 16, 1775.</p> <p>A Provincial force of about 1,000 militiamen took Bunker Hill and built a redoubt, or earthen fort, on the adjacent smaller hill, sometimes called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/breeds-hill.htm\">Breed's Hill</a>. People have since debated the decision to build a redoubt on Breed's Hill rather than the more prominent Bunker Hill but both hills played a role in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/bhm.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a>.</p> <p>In the early hours of June 17, 1775, the British Navy tried to dislodge the Provincials from their redoubt on Breed's Hill with a two-hour barrage of cannon fire from ships in Boston Harbor. This failed and over 2,000 British Regulars tried to remove the Provincials from both hills. The Regulars ferried across the harbor from Boston to Charlestown.</p> <p>The Provincials built an elevated, fortified position that spread across sections of both Bunker and Breed’s Hills. With effective musket fire volleys, the Provincials drove back two assaults by the British Regulars. The Regulars pursued a third assault that dislodged the Provincials from both Breed's Hill and Bunker Hill. The British victory came at a big cost as they suffered over twice the casualties as the Provincials. Also, the Siege of Boston to drive out the British remained intact.</p> <p>Nearly fifty years after the Battle of Bunker Hill, people from Boston and beyond became inspired to formally commemorate the battle. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bhma.htm\">Bunker Hill Monument Association (BHMA)</a> formed in 1823 with the goal of preserving the battlefield and building a monument. The BHMA decided to build the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bunker-hill-monument.htm\">Bunker Hill Monument</a> on Breed's Hill since that is where most of the Provincials died.</p> <p>It took over fifteen years to complete the monument, mainly due to the unexpected cost of the endeavor. In 1840, the BHMA almost resigned itself to a 160-foot monument, until <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/sarah-josepha-hale.htm\">Sarah Josepha Hale</a> offered to run a week-long fair in Boston’s Quincy Market. Hale's \"Ladies' Fair\" raised the large sum of $30,000 and with other last-minute contributions, the 221-foot obelisk was completed in 1842.</p> <p>The BHMA owned and managed the Bunker Hill Monument and its surrounding four acres for nearly seventy-five years but passed the complex over to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1919. As the mid-1970s approached, BHMA members, local, state, and federal officials decided that the National Park Service take over this significant national site as the nation’s Bicentennial approached in 1976. The Bunker Hill Monument became part of the National Parks of Boston in 1975. It became a stop on the Freedom Trail in 1977.</p> <p>Today, Bunker Hill is a residential area with a church on top of the hill. Bunker Hill still offers a great panoramic view of the surrounding area.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Massachusetts Gate serves as the primary entrance for visitors who travel to Bunker Hill. The four entrances to the grounds of Bunker Hill are named after the three colonies that sent militia to the Battle of Bunker Hill (Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire), as well as the United States. The Massachusetts gate is the entrance to the south east, and is generally seen as the \"main\" entrance to the park because the Freedom Trail leads visitors to Bunker Hill via this gate. This entrance also provides an accessible ramp up the hill.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Massachusetts Gate serves as the primary entrance for visitors who travel to Bunker Hill. The gate is located along Monument Square, at the intersection with Monument Avenue. The Bunker Hill Museum is located across the street. The Massachusetts Gate consists of a series of steps which lead to the Bunker Hill grounds. The steps are divided into two sections, left and right, by a iron railing which lays down the center of the gate’s staircase. There are three tiers of steps with a landing in between: the first tier has five steps, second tier has six steps, and the final tier has five steps. On the sidewalk before the stairs are a series of 16 waist-height granite pillars. There is a handicap accessible ramp on the southeastern part of the gate, which leads visitors to the top of the Connecticut Gate and the Monument grounds. On the first lasting, there are two stone markers on either side of the Massachusetts Gate. The marker on the southwest reads, “Colonel William Prescott of Massachusetts led the colonial forces on Breed’s Hill. His commanding figure and strong will inspired the farmer soldiers to the greatness of the day. Dr. Joseph Warren, commissioned a Major General, elected to serve Prescott as a private in the battle. Dr. Warren, an early leader in the Revolution, was killed on this battlefield in the waning moments of the conflict.” The marker on the southeast consists of an insignia and inscription. The Insignia is an adult male dressed in colonial clothing. A sword is in his right hand, while his left holds a document. The text wrapped around the figure in a circular pattern reads, “ Massachusettensis 1775 Sigillum Coloniae.” There is text to the right of the insignia. It reads, “June 17, 1775. This hand opposed to tyrants searches with a sword for peaceful conditions under liberty.” There is a final inscription on the bottom that reads, “Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Metropolitan District Commission.”",

It is centered between the southwest and southeast lawns, and is visible from the Bunker Hill Museum. Located in the center of a granite brick-paved square, two sidewalks from the Massachusetts Gate run on the left and the right side of the square, with grass patches in front and behind the square. The statue sits on a light-red granite pedestal. The front face of the pedestal reads, “Colonel William Prescott. June 17, 1775.” William Prescott is shown to be wearing colonial era clothing, which includes a long coat and hat. The hat is tilted slightly up and Prescott looks ahead with his neck angled slightly to the right. His right foot is a step in front of his left foot, causing the coat to hang by his right hip behind his right outstretched foot. He holds a sword in his right hand, with the sword pointed downward. His left arm is stretched down by his side, angled slightly behind him with his left hand is open.",

    "audioDescription": "Bunker Hill monument is a cream-colored granite obelisk. It is 221 feet tall. At the base, it is 30 feet square. At the top it is 15 feet square with a pyramid topper pointing 13 feet high. An enclosed spiral staircase built inside the monument provides access to a viewing deck at the top. Seven small rectangular windows are only on the north side of the monument in the stairwell, visible at each pass of the spiral staircase. Square windows are on all four sides of the monument at the viewing deck level. In the center of the monument is a circular newel that runs from the base up to the viewing deck. At the base of the newel, behind an iron gate, is a marble Tuscan column about 8 feet high as a memorial to Joseph Warren. The monument stands at the peak of a hill. The park is largely green space with symmetrical pathways leading from the streets up to the monument. The monument is surrounded by an iron picket fence. Immediately to the north of the monument is the Bunker Hill Lodge, a relatively small, one story granite structure with its primary outdoor feature being six fluted granite columns supporting a pediment that forms the entry point. Inside is a domed entry vestibule with yellow and cream Italian marble and a white marble mosaic floor. To the left is an information desk. Entryways to the left, right, and ahead are arched. To the right is a corridor with closed rooms and closets and a water fountain. Ahead is a room that comprises the full width of the building and half the depth of the building with a white marble statue of Joseph Warren in the center of the room against the back wall. Flags flank Warren. Portraits and seating line the walls.",

    "audioDescription": "The Bunker Hill Museum is located at the intersection of Monument Avenue, and Monument Square. The museum is a three storied building constructed out of red brick. The two doors on the first level are painted red, and is across the street from the Massachusetts Gate. Above each door the words “Free to All” are carved into the stone that is located at the top of the door frame. There is a venting system in between the two doors. Above that on the second story are three windows, each with a small stone arch above them. There are two double stacked windows on the third floor located above the two front doors. Each of these windows has a small curved balcony outside of them. Hanging off of the balcony on the left side is the Grand Union Flag. It has a Union Jack in the top corner of the flag, a red plus sign outlined in white laid over a red x outlined in white over a background of blue. There are seven red stripes and six white stripes on the flag. Hanging off of the balcony on the right side is the Battle of Bunker Hill flag. The flag is almost entirely blue in color. In the upper left corner is a white field with a red cross on it. In the upper left quadrant of the white field is a green pine tree. It is depicted as a series of increasing green triangles one under the other, four in total. There is a small amount of grass under the brown trunk of the tree. In between the two double stacked windows are three square windows . Below that, and above the arches of the second floor windows, is a stone inlaid with three sections. The left section has “Boston Public Library” carved into it. The right side has “Charlestown Branch” carved into it. In the middle is a decorative medallion with two young boys standing on either side of a circular stone with a book on it and some Roman numerals which are very small. To enter into the building, visitors can go through the red door on the left side. There is a handicap door button to the left side of the door. Inside there are stairs leading to the first floor and an elevator which accesses each floor. The bottom floor consists of the public restrooms and an educational space. The second floor serves as the primary entrance into the museum. On this floor, the exhibits are about the town of Charlestown, the history of the monument, as well as the Gift Shop. The third floor contains exhibits specific to the Battle of Bunker Hill.",

Then in the beginning of the 1900s, radio, RADAR, and underwater sound detection equipment meant that every ship collected a massive amount of information all at once. By the 1930s, the U.S. Navy began to organize rooms specifically to collect, organize, and then transmit information. This room became the “Combat Information Center,” or, CIC. CIC, however, is just one central element to a larger 4-deck “stack” of critical information and navigational needs.</p> <p>Inside CIC itself are RADAR operating stations, charts, and circuits to all the other operations and communications stations. The crew inside Combat Information Center took in, verbally, all sightings from lookouts, RADAR operators, and underwater sound operators. Furthermore they took in other communications coming from inside and outside the ship, as well as the navigational data about the course and speed of the ship. With this data, the CIC crew filtered and evaluated everything happening around them. They disseminated critical information to the Bridge and the Commanding Officer, gunnery crews, as well as other ships and aircraft. In short, they constantly maintained giving a real-time picture of everything happening relative to the ship.</p> <p>Above CIC on the next level is Radio Central and the Chart Room. Inside Radio Central, an officer decoded sensitive cryptographic information, while radiomen managed voice and Morse code communications between ships and aircraft.

    "bodyText": "<p>One of five peninsulas in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a>, Castle Island boasts 22- acres of land, a little more than two miles of walking trails, and the oldest fortified site in what was considered British North America. The former island has been connected to the mainland since 1928.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Similar to many other islands in the harbor, Indigenous people have accessed Castle Island seasonally for thousands of years. When Europeans arrived and colonized the area, they saw this area (then a true island) as a strategic military location. In the 1630s, Governor John Winthrop ordered the construction of the first fortification on this site. Originally named for William II of England, the fortification became known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-independence-castle-william.htm\">Castle William</a>. The General Court of Massachusetts ordered the imprisonment of at least one Quaker, Indigenous people, and French prisoners starting on the island as early as 1661.<sup>2</sup> </p> <p>Growing tensions between residents of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and England led to the withdrawal of the colony’s charter in 1684. The crown appointed Sir Edmund Andros as the governor. Tensions continued to mount, and when news of the Glorious Revolution in England (the shift from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy) reached Boston in 1689, colonists arrested Sir Edmund Andros and sent him to Castle William. Andros tried to escape by dressing in women’s clothing, making it past two guards before being caught by a third guard. This failed attempt did not stop Andros from trying again. In his second attempt, Andros made it all the way to Newport, Rhode Island, before being captured and returned to Castle William. Eventually sent to England, he regained his freedom overseas.</p> <p>The 1700s brought expanded uses of Castle Island. For example, in 1764, the island housed around 3,000 patients during a smallpox epidemic. Sometime later, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/dr-joseph-warren.htm\">Dr. Joseph Warren</a> opened an inoculation site on the island.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/boston-massacre.htm\">Boston Massacre</a> in 1770, the Sons of Liberty requested the removal of British troops from Boston. Two regiments retreated to Castle William, and the island served as a refuge to loyalists for next six years. The British eventually deserted Castle Island as they evacuated Boston in spring 1776, leaving the fort and the island in flames.</p> <p>Beginning in 1785, the General Court of Massachusetts appointed the island as a place for thieves and other convicts who had been sentenced to hard labor. The federal government took control over the island in 1798, and the two agencies reached an agreement, where the state prison continued to operate on the island.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>In 1799, President John Adams designated the fortification, formerly known as Castle William, to Fort Independence. That same year, a Marine Hospital dedicated to sick sailors also opened on the island. The hospital used existing barracks and welcomed all officers of the Navy, Marines, as well as all seamen. The first facility of its kind to be built with Marine Hospital funds, the money came from a 20-cent tax on sailor’s salaries. It is also said that the Commonwealth’s first prison opened on the island to house French prisoners in 1799, remaining open until 1801.</p> <p>In 1800, construction began on a new fort on the island engineered as part of the First System defenses, otherwise known as the first forts built by the new United States.<sup>5</sup> During the War of 1812, the island served as a training site for soldiers mostly from Dorchester and the surrounding area.</p> <p>In late 1816, engineer Simon Bernard and his board convened to select sites for a new and cohesive coastal defense network. Fort Independence became one of the earlier generations of fortifications selected to be reengineered into a Third System fortification. Meant to serve as a secondary line of defense to Fort Warren on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/georges-island.htm\">Georges Island</a>, construction on Fort Independence began in 1833 and took nearly twenty years to finish.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>In 1826, 18-year-old Edgar Allan Poe enlisted in the military under the name \"Edgar A. Perry.\" Poe spent five months on Castle Island. While at Fort Independence, Poe heard the story of a duel that had occurred in 1817. According to the story, two lieutenants argued over a card game on Christmas day. After agreeing to a duel, the less popular lieutenant killed the other. In retaliation, the dead lieutenant’s friends sealed the killer in a vault. This story is believed to have inspired Poe’s 1846 short story <em>The Cask of Amontillado</em>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-albion-andrew.htm\">Massachusetts Governor John Andrew</a> sent the Fourth Battalion Massachusetts Infantry to Castle Island in 1861, and by 1863, the remodeled Fort Independence had become the headquarters for new Massachusetts recruits. After the Civil War, those stationed at Fort Independence had been transferred to Fort Warren.</p> <p>In 1890, the government granted the land surrounding the fort to the city and allowed for a park to be built.<sup>7</sup> Frederick Law Olmsted served as the park designer. Following the construction of the wood pile bridge in 1892, the city welcomed visitors to the island.</p> <p>Castle Island has been connected to the mainland via a concrete causeway since 1928. In 1962, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts took ownership over both Fort Independence and Castle Island. Today, Castle Island is operated as a state park and remains open for year-round visitation.<sup>8</sup> </p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>\"<a href=\"https://www.masshist.org/database/418\">A plan of Fort Independence</a>,\" Collections Online, Massachusetts Historical Society (MHS), accessed February 8, 2022.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, (Boston: National Park Service, 2017) 83-85.</li> <li>\"<a href=\"https://www.sec.state.ma.us/mus/pdfs/Castle-Island.pdf\">A Beacon and a Fort</a>,\" Massachusetts State Archives, accessed April 2023; \"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/smallpox-inoculation-revolutionary-war.htm\">Smallpox, Inoculation, and the Revolutionary War</a>,\" National Park Service, last modified January 13, 2023, accessed April 12, 2023; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, 85.</li> <li>\"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-independence-castle-william.htm\">Fort Independence- Castle William</a>,\" National Park Service, modified January 16, 2023, accessed April 12, 2023; \"<a href=\"https://www.sec.state.ma.us/mus/pdfs/Castle-Island.pdf\">A Beacon and a Fort</a>,\" Massachusetts State Archives.</li> <li>\"<a href=\"https://www.sec.state.ma.us/mus/pdfs/Castle-Island.pdf\">A Beacon and a Fort</a>,\" Massachusetts State Archives; Nathaniel Shurtleff, <em><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_UWkUAAAAYAAJ/page/n3/mode/2up?q=castle+island\">A Topographical and Historical Description of Boston</a> </em>(Boston: Printed at request of the city council, 1871), 484-49.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, 88,106,123,141; Shurtleff, <em><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_UWkUAAAAYAAJ/page/n3/mode/2up?q=castle+island\">A Topographical and Historical Description of Boston</a></em>, 484-49.</li> <li>\"<a href=\"https://www.sec.state.ma.us/mus/pdfs/Castle-Island.pdf\">A Beacon and a Fort</a>,\" Massachusetts State Archives; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, 88,106,141.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, 106.</li> <li>\"<a href=\"https://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/edgar-allan-poe-writes-a-story-based-on-a-boston-harbor-legend/\">Edgar Allan Poe Writes a Story Based on a Boston Harbor Legend</a>,\" New England Historical Society, accessed April 12, 2023; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, 90-96.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"><b>Volume 1: Historical Overview</b></a>, 92-93,189-190.</li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Built in 1904, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/charlestown-navy-yard-chain-forge.htm\">Chain Forge</a> (Building 105) runs along an entire city block of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/charlestown-navy-yard.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard</a> (also known as the Boston Naval Shipyard). As the US Navy faced a new era, it required facilities to support one of the world's largest navies. The Chain Forge and nearby Buildings 104 and 106 all have a similar design and were built together.</p> <p>At the beginning of the 1900s, the US Navy started replacing its wooden ships with metal ones. Navy architects designed the Forge as a large, spacious factory for making anchors, anchor chains, and other metal products for the Navy. Building 105 has an innovative steel frame, covered with a brick veneer in a Classical Revival style. This \"Cathedral of Industry\" also has a central, gabled portico flanked by two wings with numerous arched windows.</p> <p>Though the Forge dominates the interior of Building 105, the building also included space for a power generator, offices, restrooms and even a repair facility for the Yard's railway locomotives.</p> <p>While Forge workers made ship propellers and any metal item the Navy needed, they became best known for producing anchor chain. Every US Navy ship needs a reliable anchor and anchor chain. The well-known Navy song \"Anchors Away\" pays homage to that basic part of a successful mission, a working anchor and chain. Previously during the Age of Sail, Navy sailors used rope to help anchor ships, rope that was made in the Charlestown Navy Yard <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/ropewalk-cny.htm\">Ropewalk</a>.</p> <p>Starting in the 1880s, the Navy relied on the Charlestown Navy Yard for most of its anchors and anchor chains. Initially, this work spanned Buildings 40 and 42 in the Yard. Over the years, workers steadily improved metal anchor chains, but chains still had a flaw: chain links could break apart, sending a ship adrift from its detached anchor.</p> <p>In its constant search for more reliable anchor chains, the Navy consolidated chain making in Building 105 starting in 1904. Here, Chain Forge Master Mechanics James Reid and Albert M. Leahy with Engineer Carlton G. Lutts invented a method they called \"Die-Lock.\" They devised a nearly indestructible anchor chain that is still unmatched today. Due to the durability of the Die-Lock chain, it became the only anchor chain made by the US Navy after 1928, and most of it was made in the Chain Forge.</p> <p>Enormous hammers, some with the force of twelve tons, the weight of a city bus, were crucial to the Die-Lock method. These hammers forged anchor chain links that could never break apart. The largest hammer in the Forge sat on its own concrete foundation 35 feet deep to prevent Building 105 from shaking.</p> <p>To test a new chain for strength, the Forge had another piece of extraordinary equipment called the Tinius Olsen Testing Machine, named for its inventor. This machine subjected a chain to enormous stress. Once tested, the surface of the chain was smoothed, mostly by sandblasting it, and then painted.</p> <p>Navy Yard workers produced anchor chains in 90-foot lengths called \"shots.\" Making and repairing anchor chains was more manageable in these lengths. These shots, or lengths of chain, are joined together by detachable links which were another unique invention by the staff of the Chain Forge. Anchor chains on Navy ships are 12-15 shots or over 1,000 feet long. In addition to making varied chain lengths, the Forge made different size anchor chains for the Navy’s different sized ships.</p> <p>Throughout the 1900s, the Navy made structural changes to the Chain Forge to better fit the production needs at the Yard. A variety of ventilation systems populate the roof of the Chain Forge, installed over the years to exhaust the toxic smoke and heat created in the Forge as the Navy expanded production.</p> <p>In 1943 during World War II (WWII), Yard managers expanded Building 105 with large, rectangular additions on both its north and south sides and covered them with fireproof siding that eliminated some of the original brick veneer. During WWII, the Forge had a staff of 550 people working three shifts, including a small number of women and African Americans.</p> <p>With its massive machines and fiery furnaces, the Chain Forge could be a dangerous place to work. One of the worst accidents occurred in 1944 when a large anchor chain slipped loose and knocked a worker to the ground, breaking his legs and cracking his skull in the process. This worker survived his injuries.</p> <p>After over sixty years of service, the Chain Forge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 and it is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The location of the Chain Forge is also a notable Revolutionary War site: Moulton's Point. Here, British troops from Boston landed in Charlestown to engage in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-bunker-hill.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a> in June 1775. In 1936, workers for the Works Progress Administration (WPA), installed a bronze plaque on Building 105 commemorating the landing site as they performed renovations in the Forge. They installed a related plaque on Building 5 at the same time.</p> <p>When the Navy Yard closed in 1974, Forge workers were making some of the largest chain it had every produced. At the time, workers forged chain for the nuclear aircraft carrier the USS <em>Eisenhower</em>. Each link was about 30 inches long and weighed 360 pounds. It's still one of the largest anchor chains used in the US Navy.</p> <p>Over 100 pieces of equipment remained in the Chain Forge in 1974, about 20 of these are considered significant. The Chain Forge was transferred to the Boston Redevelopment Authority in 1978, but not the equipment. In 2001, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers refurbished this equipment and removed hazardous materials from Building 105.</p> <p>The Chain Forge and its innovative workforce helped the Navy solidify its place as one of the world’s top three navies. Forge workers devised anchor chains that are still renowned for their strength and durability, and they were the main supplier of these chains to the U.S. Navy from 1904 to 1974 during two World Wars and the Cold War. Their work took place in a uniquely designed vaulted spacious factory that workers updated to better fit their needs.</p> <p>Building 105 is now privately owned and there are plans to convert it into a hotel or residential housing. There are also plans for the building to house some of the Chain Forge equipment, particularly the hammer with the twelve-ton force, nicknamed the \"Mighty Monarch.\" The equipment will give the public a glimpse into the storied past of the Chain Forge, as told by staff of the National Parks of Boston. Some of the Chain Forge story can be seen in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/cny-vc-exhibits.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard Visitor Center (Building 5)</a> in an exhibit called \"Serving the Naval Fleet.\" Huge anchors made in the Forge can still be seen on the grounds of the Charlestown Navy Yard.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/charlestown-navy-yard-chain-forge.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard: Chain Forge</a></p> <h2>Sources</h2> <ul> <li>Carlson, Stephen P. <em>Charlestown Navy Yard Historic Resource Study, Vol 1-3.</em> Boston, MA: Division of Cultural Resources, Boston National Historical Park, National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, 2010.</li> <li>Carolan, Jane, Charissa W.

Accounts provide mixed details on the conditions of the jail and the perspectives of the imprisoned women. The Boston City Council had declared Charles Street Jail \"an unfit, inhumane structure\" in 1918, yet reporters who visited the conditions of the women's section claimed, \"on every side were clean white walls and high windows...the whole place was scrupulously tidy.\"<sup>1</sup> Some suffragists complained of the lack of access to proper food, clothing, and facilities, while others gave positive reviews and \"looked extremely cheerful.\"<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Despite the eight-day sentence, authorities slowly released the women, sometimes against their will, over the course of the week, when family members or anonymous citizens paid their fines. None of the sentenced suffragists completed her full sentence.

    "bodyText": "<p>Known also as the Boston Naval Shipyard and the Boston Navy Yard, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/cny.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard</a> was a shipyard for the U.S. Navy for 174 years.</p> <p>Long before the United States established the Charlestown Navy Yard, the tidal flats of this area provided seasonal sustenance to local indigenous communities for thousands of years. These communities, whose descendants are the Massachusett, called the land <em>Mishawum</em> or \"Great Springs.\" These flats also became a landing for British infantry transports in the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775.</p> <p>In 1800, the U.S. Navy established the Charlestown Navy Yard as one of the nation's first six navy yards. Over time, the Navy Yard grew to cover nearly 130 acres with over a hundred buildings, three dry docks, numerous piers, its own railway, and more. In 1974, the federal government closed the Navy Yard and set aside 30 acres of it as a national historic site; the remaining acreage became privately owned.</p> <p>Thousands of workers in the Charlestown Navy Yard built over 200 ships and repaired thousands more over its 174-year history. Dry Dock 1 helped make this work possible. Built in 1833, and one of the first in the country, it provided a dry area to build and repair ships. The building that now houses the <a href=\"https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/\">USS Constitution Museum</a> once contained huge steam-powered pumps that moved seawater in and out of the granite Dry Dock. Today, workers still use Dry Dock 1 to repair the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/uss-constitution.htm\">USS <em>Constitution</em></a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/uss-cassin-young.htm\">USS <em>Cassin Young</em></a>.</p> <p>Two other outstanding features of the Charlestown Navy Yard are the Ropewalk and the Chain Forge buildings. Workers in the Ropewalk made all the rope needed by the U.S. Navy; they could make fiber or metal rope the length of the Ropewalk, or about four football fields long. Ironworkers in the Chain Forge made links of anchor chain for ships, using a unique process called Die-Lock. This process made links used for anchor chains incredibly strong. The Ropewalk and the Chain Forge buildings are repurposed now and privately owned.</p> <p>The most productive years of the Charlestown Navy Yard were during war time, particularly World War II. Over half the ships workers ever built in the yard were built during this war when the Yard had over 50,000 employees. During this time of crisis, the Navy Yard opened its doors to women and people of color. For the first time, the opportunity to make livable wages was available to thousands of people. While these workers provided critical labor and many excelled in their positions, some experienced racism, sexual harassment, and discrimination. It was the job of the U.S. Naval officers who ran the Yard to resolve these problems as well as issues involving wages, working hours, conditions, and apprenticeship programs.</p> <p>The Navy Yard was like any other industrial plant and it had a mostly civilian workforce. To these workers, the Yard was a workplace that they commuted to, but for Naval personnel, the Yard was the source of their everyday needs such as food, shelter, medical care, recreation and more.</p> <p>The residential areas of the Navy Yard include some of the oldest structures in the Yard. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/officers-quarters-cny.htm\">Officers' Quarters</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/commandants-house.htm\">Commandant's House</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/marine-barracks-cny.htm\">Marine Barracks</a> seem untouched by time. These buildings now provide housing and office space for National Park Service employees.</p> <p>The USS <em>Cassin Young</em>, part of the National Parks of Boston since 1980, brings back memories of World War II and the Cold War to the Charlestown Navy Yard. Although workers in the Charlestown Navy Yard made destroyers, they did not build the <em>Cassin Young</em>. However, these workers developed sonar technology which was installed in the USS <em>Cassin Young</em> during the Cold War.</p> <p>In 1934, the U.S. Navy made the Charlestown Navy Yard the permanent home for the USS <em>Constitution</em>. This 54-gun frigate has long been associated with the Navy Yard; Edmund Hartt built the USS <em>Constitution</em> nearby in 1797. The USS Constitution Museum has been a partner to the ship since 1972.</p> <p>Many U.S. Navy ships and Naval personnel have left the Yard to protect and supply U.S. interests around the globe. From the Charlestown Navy Yard, the USS <em>Jamestown</em> delivered food to the people of Ireland during the Great Famine in 1847 and Admiral Richard Byrd's Antarctica scientific expedition sailed from the Yard in 1933.</p> <p>Many sitting U.S. Presidents and Secretaries of the Navy have visited the Charlestown Navy Yard including one person who held both positions over his long public career, Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p> <p>From the age of sail to the age of steel, tens of thousands of civilian workers and U.S. Naval personnel in the Charlestown Navy Yard kept the Navy supplied with ships and equipment for 174 years. By preserving a portion of the Charlestown Navy Yard, the National Park Service memorializes their contributions.

    "audioDescription": "The Charlestown Navy Yard occupies about 130 acres of waterfront land on the Charlestown side of the Charles River as it opens up to Boston Harbor. Its borders extend to Chelsea Street. Most visitors enter from the southwest at Constitution Road, which leads them to the original main entrance of the Yard, Gate 1. Gate 1 has a one-story mid-century style unoccupied guardhouse. Continuing down the street brings visitors to the main campus of the Navy Yard, which is mostly asphalt with some green space to the north. To the immediate right is the entrance to the Visitor Center, which is a long brick building. Visitors must go through a security hut next to the Visitor Center to access the USS CONSTITUTION (behind it). The Visitor Center contains bathrooms, a small theater for films and events, a gift shop, and some exhibit space about the Navy Yard. Most of the rest of the campus is asphalt with numerous brick and stone buildings, most notably the USS Constitution Museum (stone building directly facing the Visitor's Center) and the Commandant's House (brick building on the north side of campus close to Chelsea Street). There are at least six piers as well as two dry docks. Continuing past the security entrance to the Visitor's Center is Pier 1, which has the USS CASSIN YOUNG, a fletcher-class destroyer, docked there. In between Pier 1 and Pier 2 is dry dock 1. Behind the USS Constitution Museum is Pier 3 and Pier 4, separated by dry dock 2, which is currently filled. The water shuttle runs from Pier 4. The red Freedom Trail enters and exits through First Avenue from Constitution Road and leads to the entrance to the Visitor's Center, the USS CONSTITUTION, and the USS Constitution Museum.",

Below the text is a large color wayfinding map.</p> <h2>Main Text</h2> <p>The Charlestown Navy Yard was established in 1800 to build, repair, and supply the nation’s warships. For 174 years the yard expanded and adapted to serve a growing, changing navy. In early years, skilled workers built and repaired wooden sloops, frigates, and ships of the line, using hand tools and muscle power. During World War II, specialized crews of welders, pipe fitters and electricians worked round-the-clock to build and overhaul steel warships. Decommissioned as a naval facility in 1974, the yard adapted again, becoming space for homes, businesses, and recreation. More than 30 of the most historic acres of the yard now form part of Boston National Historical Park.</p> <h2>Map</h2> <p>Map of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/charlestown-navy-yard.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard</a> oriented with the Mystic River at the top, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a> to the right, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/uss-constitution.htm\">USS <em>Constitution</em></a> to the bottom, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/commandants-house.htm\">Commandant's House</a> and the Freedom Trail leading up to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bunker-hill-monument.htm\">Bunker Hill Monument</a> to the left. This map is in color with buildings in varying shades of brown and red. The ground is either white or a light tan with grass depicted in green. The legend is to the right in Boston Harbor in black text. It identifies icons for Information, Restrooms, Phone, Food Service, and the Water Shuttle to downtown Boston. Black text identifies some buildings. “YOU ARE HERE” is marked in an open space to the center left of the map. Dry Dock 1 is to the right of this marker and to the left is a road that travels from just below this point to the top of the map. The Freedom Trail begins at the bottom left of the map and runs up through the entrance of the Navy Yard, past a Trolley Stop labeled on the map, and alongside a building on the right. The Freedom Trail turns to the right (below the “YOU ARE HERE” marker) and along the edge of the Building. It turns again to the right, almost boxing in the building. This Building is marked with an Information, two Restroom, and Phone icons. The Freedom Trail line leads to the USS <em>Constitution </em>which is in the water to the right of the Information building. The Trail line continues from USS <em>Constitution </em>up to a building across from the Information building, passing a dry dock labeled Dry Dock 1 on the right. This building is marked as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/uss-constitution-museum.htm\">USS Constitution Museum</a> and has an Information icon. The Trail continues to the left, above the “YOU ARE HERE” marker, and continues up the street and turns left at the first intersection. It continues left along this street, passing the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/marine-barracks-cny.htm\">Marine Barracks </a>on its left and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/ropewalk-cny.htm\">Ropewalk</a> and Muster House on its right. An arrow points the Trail off the left edge of the map with text stating “Freedom Trail to Bunker Hill Monument.” Other buildings of note on the map are identified. Halfway down the pier just above the USS <em>Constitution </em>is a building with seasonal restrooms and food services. At the end of the pier is the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/uss-cassin-young.htm\">USS <em>Cassin Young</em></a> and a seasonal water shuttle. The Commandant’s House is to the far left of the Yard, overlooking the Navy Yard and the Harbor. Three piers above the first pier is another water shuttle. The rest of the Yard is filled with buildings of varying sizes.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Less than a month into the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a>, General Artemas Ward, commander of the siege, directed Colonel John Nixon of Massachusetts and Colonel John Stark of New Hampshire and their militias to remove hay and farm animals off Noddle's and Hog Islands in Boston Harbor and bring them to the mainland. Ward and the Massachusetts Committee of Safety wanted to deny these items to the 6,500 British Regulars in Boston.</p> <p>Since the British Regulars arrived in Boston in October of 1774, they had been relying on loyalists and other local people to supply them with food and supplies. Some islands in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a>, which had been turned into agricultural-use by colonists, provided some of this food. In the Siege of Boston, the Massachusetts leaders planned to stop British access to these islands.</p> <p>On May 27, 1775, colonial forces, known as Provincials, began burning down buildings on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/noddle-s-island.htm\">Noddle’s Island</a>, inadvertently alerting the British Navy to their activity. British Admiral Samuel Graves had orders to sail to Noddle’s Island and stop the Provincials.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>The British Navy sent marines to pursue the Provincials on foot on Noddle's Island and also sailed up a narrow tidal waterway called Chelsea Creek on the HMS <em>Diana</em>. A series of land and sea skirmishes occurred involving hundreds of men over two days; both sides fired small cannons and muskets in close proximity in a lethal cat-and-mouse game. The <em>Diana </em>ran aground and the Provincials ransacked and burned it. Casualties on both sides were light but higher on the British side. In the end, the colonial forces denied the British forces the supplies of Noddle’s and Hog Islands. These colonial forces also laid waste to Noddle’s Island and neither side used it for the rest of the siege.</p> <p>This skirmish that occurred May 27 and 28, 1775 became known as the \"Battle of Chelsea Creek.\" Like many Revolutionary War confrontations, Americans did not recognize its significance until after the 1820s, starting with the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of that battle.</p> <p>For some historians, the Provincial action at Chelsea Creek showed that the Provincials were looking to contain the British Army within Boston. Gaining experience from the French and Indian War, Provincial leaders like Colonels Stark and Nixon and General Putnam spared no time in responding to the Lexington Alarm and led the Chelsea Creek action. Provincials who wished to drive the British military from Boston saw that experienced Provincial officers and their men from three colonies could work cooperatively. Colonial forces would need that cooperation and experience in less than a month, at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-bunker-hill.htm\">Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775</a>.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Neither Noddle’s nor Hog Islands exist on a modern map; they are now part of East Boston and Logan Airport.</li> </ol> <h2>Source</h2> <p>Brown, Craig, Victor Mastone, and Christopher Maio, \"The Revolutionary War Battle America Forgot: Chelsea Creek, 27-28 May 1775.\" <em>The New England Quarterly</em> Vol. 86, No. 3 (September 2013), pp. 398-432.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "The Commandant's House is constructed in the Federal Style. This four story building sits atop a small hill surrounded by green space and with views of the Navy Yard and the Harbor. The building consists of red brick and white painted wood. The main block measures approximately 39 feet wide by 48 feet long with two bowed bays on the south elevation. The main portion of the building has a slate shingle-clad, front-gable roof with three pedimented dormers on both the east and west slopes. Two corbelled, interior-end brick chimneys are also located on the east and west slopes of the roof. The bowed bays have flat roofs roofs with short brick parapets capped by a wood balustrade. Three stretcher courses of projecting bricks with dentils of single brick headers topped by copper gutters run under the eaves on the east and west elevations and along the bowed bays. The brick walls are laid in common bond with projecting wood rakes along the south gable. A raised brick and granite block foundation is exposed a full story on the west, south, and east elevations, but meets grade on the north elevation. A covered porch with narrow Doric columns built on arched brick piers wraps around the main level of the west and east elevations leading to an enclosed one-bay-by-three-bay sun room in the center of the south elevation. To the right of the building is an addition of a two-story, two-bay-by-two-bay kitchen ell with a slate shingle-clad, hip roof. The primary entrance is located on a west side of the building at the one-story, three-bay brick addition to the basement level and contains a single panel door flanked by full-height sidelights with an elliptical fanlight. Additional secondary entrances are located on the west and east elevations in the basement level and first story, and in the south elevation on the kitchen ell. The east and west elevations of the sunroom have matching fifteen-light, single-hung doors flanked by seven-light sidelights with a three-light rectangular transom. Windows primarily consist of six-over-six, double-hung wood sash in varying sizes with splayed wood lintels and wood sills. A round-arch, three-over-three, double-hung wood sash window is located off-center on the second story of the east elevation. The fenestration on the south elevation of the sunroom has Doric pilasters separating three round-arched opening each containing nine-light single-hung windows flanked by three-light single-hung windows with round arched fixed sash above. A walkway ending in a set of a dozen stairs leads up to the first floor of the south side of the house. An additional five stairs leads up to the building. At the top of these stairs are two additional stairs cases, one going up to the right and the other going up to the left. Also at the top of these five stairs is a 3 by 4 grid-paned window with white paneling extending on either side to approximately the fourth stair of the additional staircases. The rest of the wall is constructed in brick. The staircases lead up to the porches on the east and west sides of the building respectively.

    "bodyText": "<p>Established in 1660, Copp's Hill Burying Ground became the resting place for thousands of people of who lived, worked, and died in the North End. Among those interred on the hill are merchant John Pulling Jr. and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-north-church.htm\">Old North Church</a> sexton, or caretaker, Robert Newman, the two men believed to have held the signal lanterns on the night of April 18, 1775 to warn of the British advance on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mima/index.htm\">Lexington and Concord</a>. Also buried here are Increase, Samuel, and Cotton Mather, all three influential and infamous theologians of Boston.</p> <p>Copp's Hill also serves as the final resting place for early Bostonians of African descent. Many enslaved and free African Americans are buried on this hill, including Black educator, community leader, and Masonic Grand Master Prince Hall. In Boston, Prince Hall and his fellow masons led their community as activists for the abolition of enslavement and for the recognition of their rights as equal citizens in Massachusetts. Hall's modern brothers erected the monument that currently stands next to his original, modest headstone.</p> <p>During the Revolutionary War, some historians suggest British soldiers performed target practice on some headstones here. Copp's Hill also played a pivotal role in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-bunker-hill.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a> due to its view of the harbor and neighboring towns. From this spot on June 17, 1775, Generals John Burgoyne and Henry Clinton directed British soldiers to bombard Breed’s Hill with naval guns. These guns aimed at the fortifications colonists had built the night prior on the hill. Ultimately, the use of artillery from Copp’s Hill helped the British push colonial forces off Breed's Hill.</p> <h2>Sources</h2> <p>Boston National Historical Park. \"Bunker Hill: Battle, Monument, Memory.\" Fort Washington, PA: Eastern National, 2007.</p> <p>\"Copp's Hill.\" <em>City of Boston.</em> Accessed February 8, 2022. <a href=\"https://www.cityofboston.gov/parks/HBGI/hbginfo.asp?ID=4\">https://www.cityofboston.gov/parks/HBGI/hbginfo.asp?ID=4</a>.</p> <p>MacDonald, Edward. \"Old Copp's Hill and Burial Ground : with historical sketches.\" Boston: Benjamin Parks, 1882.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Built in 1750, the Dillaway-Thomas House is said to be one of the oldest buildings in Roxbury. Reverend Oliver Peabody originally built the house as a parsonage for the First Church of Roxbury. His successor, Reverend Amos Adams, lived here with his family until 1775, when the American Revolutionary War broke out.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Due to its prime location at the top of a hill, the house became the headquarters for General John Thomas of the Continental Army during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a>. As stated in Francis S. Drake's <em>The Town of Roxbury</em>:</p> <blockquote>The headquarters having, as we know, been on Meeting-House Hill, this would naturally be a most eligible situation, as from its rear windows Boston, the British works on the Neck, and even the heights of Charlestown were in full view. The battle of Bunker's Hill and the conflagration of Charlestown were witnessed from its upper windows by the general and his officers.<sup>2</sup></blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">General George Washington</a> may have held a meeting with his officers at the house while General Thomas stayed there.<sup>3</sup> Thomas is perhaps best known for his leadership during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/dohe.htm\">fortification of Dorchester Heights</a>. On the evening of March 4, 1776, he led 3,000 men from Roxbury to Dorchester Heights with pre-made fortifications and cannon brought by Colonel Henry Knox form Fort Ticonderoga in upstate New York. They successfully fortified the area in a single night, an accomplishment that \"compelled the evacuation of Boston by the enemy, terminating the siege\" a couple weeks later.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>After the war, the house’s ownership transferred to Charles K. Dillaway, an esteemed educator who later served as the superintendent of Roxbury schools. He and his wife, Martha, used the house as a \"women’s day school and home for international students.\"<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Almost demolished in 1927, the Roxbury Historical Society and local residents successfully fought to save and preserve the building. It became a museum in the 1930s and has undergone several renovations over the past century. In 1992, it became the headquarters for the Roxbury Heritage State Park.<sup>6</sup> The Dillaway-Thomas House continues to serve as a space for exhibits and community meetings, many of which center on Black history and issues.</p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Boston Preservation Alliance, “Dillaway-Thomas House,” <a href=\"https://www.bostonpreservation.org/advocacy-project/dillaway-thomas-house\">https://www.bostonpreservation.org/advocacy-project/dillaway-thomas-house</a>.</li> <li>Francis S.

    "bodyText": "<p>Due to its role during the Siege of Boston, Dorchester Heights serves as a landmark in our nation’s revolutionary landscape. Also known as Telegraph Hill or Thomas Park, Dorchester Heights has become a gathering space for the local community as well.</p> <p>Today, towering high above the neighborhood of South Boston, stands a marble monument atop the highest hill in the area. The monument is known as Dorchester Heights, and it marks the last surviving hill of a collection of hills that once commanded Boston and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a>.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>People have long inhabited Dorchester Heights and the neighboring areas. Local Indigenous people lived on this land, particularly on the southern coast of Dorchester Neck, which was known as Mattapannock.<sup>2</sup> The first Europeans settled on Dorchester Neck in 1630 with the landing of the English ship Mary and John. These settlers gave the land the name \"Dorchester\" after Dorchester, England.<sup>3</sup> For the following century, Dorchester Neck served as farmland and grazing pastures for cattle.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>When the Siege of Boston began in April 1775, residents on Dorchester Neck became nervous of their proximity to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-independence-castle-william.htm\">Castle William</a>, a British military stronghold on Castle Island just off the coast of the peninsula. In the summer and fall of 1775, these residents moved inland to distance themselves from the fort.<sup>5</sup> A few months later, on February 13, 1776, the British military sent a small force to Dorchester Heights to explore how to fortify the site, but they recognized it would be difficult to do so with the frozen ground.<sup>6</sup> British Lieutenant-General Archibald Robertson documented that the soldiers \"took 6 Rebel prisoners, burnt 6 or 8 Empty uninhabited houses and barns, and return’d about ½ after 6 o’clock.\"<sup>7</sup></p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">George Washington</a>, Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, and his generals agreed to fortify Dorchester Heights in an attempt to finally dislodge the British from Boston. To fortify the Heights undetected, Washington planned a distraction. On the nights of March 2, 3, and 4, Washington ordered a large bombardment of Boston using additional artillery General Henry Knox recovered from Fort Ticonderoga. This attack diverted the attention of British forces to the west of town.</p> <p>Finally, on the night of March 4, 1776, Washington directed General John Thomas and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/richard-gridley.htm\">Colonel Richard Gridley</a>, the chief engineer of the army, to fortify Dorchester Heights. Over 1,200 soldiers and volunteers and 300 oxcarts transported tools and materials to the site as stealthily as possible. The dawn of March 5, 1776 – the 6-year anniversary of the Boston Massacre – revealed to everyone what the Continental forces achieved overnight. A fortification with cannon towered over Boston, as well as the only shipping routes out of the Harbor. British General William Howe commented, \"My God, these fellows have done more work in one night than I could make my army do in three months.\"<sup>8</sup></p> <p>General Howe planned an attack on Dorchester Heights in response to this aggressive act by the colonial forces, yet a storm prevented an immediate response. Having been surrounded by Washington’s army, Howe recognized he was at a military disadvantage and determined to remove his troops from the city. On March 17, 1776, the British forces evacuated Boston, along with over a thousand colonial Loyalists.</p> <p>Shortly after the evacuation of the British, Chief Engineer and Colonel Richard Gridley reconstructed the fortification on Dorchester Heights into a star shape. This new structure would better defend against a future attack, which never came. Similarly, during the War of 1812, U.S. forces refortified the site, but British forces did not attack Boston. Over time, the fort degraded, leaving only remnants in the mid-1800s.</p> <p>In the late 1840s, the growing community in South Boston called upon the city to improve city services for local residents, which included better access to water and more public spaces. The city selected Telegraph Hill as a site to build both a reservoir and a park.<sup>9</sup> The city of Boston constructed Thomas Park on Dorchester Heights between 1852 and 1854. This 5.43-acre park became one of the first public parks in the city.<sup>10</sup> Its original elliptical-shaped plan still stands today.</p> <p>One hundred years after the fortification of Dorchester Heights and Evacuation Day, the community held a memorial to recognize this significant moment in the site’s history.<sup>11</sup> Initially the community installed a granite Centennial Monument in 1877. However, in the 1890s local residents called for \"a more substantial monument.\"<sup>12</sup> This led to a design competition for a new monument. Boston architectural firm Peabody & Stearns won this contest and in 1901 constructed the 115-foot-tall marble commemorative tower.<sup>13</sup> Dedicated on March 17, 1902, the Georgian Revival Style tower commemorates the fortification of Dorchester Heights during the Revolutionary War.</p> <p>Throughout the 1900s, Dorchester Heights continued to be a feature of the local community, leading to efforts to protect and preserve this site. In 1951, the Secretary of the Interior and the Mayor of Boston announced the designation of Dorchester Heights as a National Historic Site. Twenty-seven years later, in 1978, Dorchester Heights National Historic Site joined <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/index.htm\">Boston National Historical Park</a>, with the transfer of ownership occurring in 1980. Today, the National Parks of Boston continues to steward Dorchester Heights.</p> <p>To learn more about the history and legacy of this local and national site, explore the articles and digital content on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/dohe.htm\">Dorchester Heights webpage</a>.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>\"Cultural Landscape Report: Dorchester Heights / Thomas Park, Boston National Historical Park,\" Danielle D.

    "bodyText": "<p>Since its completion in 1833, Dry Dock 1 has played an integral role in shipbuilding at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/charlestown-navy-yard.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard</a>.</p> <p>In the early 1800s, with the consequences of the War of 1812, the U.S. Congress sought to strengthen the United States Navy with more ships to defend the country. With this call for warships also came a need for appropriate dockyard facilities that could accommodate the construction and repair of larger vessels. As one of the six original naval ships yards in America, the Charlestown Navy Yard became host to another monumental undertaking. In March of 1827, Congress passed an act ordering for the design and construction of two stone dry docks: one at the Charlestown Navy Yard and the other at Gosport Navy Yard in Virginia.</p> <p>The man tasked with overseeing the construction had ties to both the American Revolution and Charlestown. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/loammi-baldwin-jr.htm\">Loammi Baldwin Jr.</a>, leading citizen of Charlestown and son of a revolutionary veteran, served as the engineer commissioned by the Navy. Worldly and experienced, Baldwin played an integral part of the design and completion of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bunker-hill-monument.htm\">Bunker Hill Monument</a>. He carried a similar drive into the construction of the two dry docks with identical plans. Work began on the Charlestown Dry Dock in June of 1827, with granite being drawn from nearby Quincy, Massachusetts.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>It took six years of labor to complete construction of the dry dock at the Charlestown Navy Yard. When it opened in 1833, Dry Dock 1 received its first warship, Frigate <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/uss-constitution.htm\">USS <em>Constitution</em></a>. The completion of the dry dock cost the Navy just under one million dollars.<sup>2</sup> The sturdy construction impressed all that witnessed. Scottish engineer David Stevenson remarked on a visit in 1837 that the Charlestown and Gosport dry docks were, \"The finest specimens of masonry which I met with in America.\"<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Baldwin designed the dry dock as a three-sided basin, with a plug or caisson on the seaward side. While its concept is simple, the dry dock required a complex engineering system to make it functional. First, workers floated a ship into the dock before the caisson sealed off the basin from the sea. Then a series of tools acted as a well-coordinated machine to drain the dock of water. Finally, the vessel was settled on a cradle to make its hull accessible for service.</p> <p>For over one hundred and forty years, Dry Dock 1 has serviced U.S. Navy ships, particularly during times of war. One of the ships built at the Navy Yard was the USS <em>Hartford</em>, flagship of Admiral David Farragut during the American Civil War. Following the end of the nations bloodiest conflict, the Navy Yard was reduced in capacity and labor as demand decreased. Though there was a upswing in work during World War I, economic downturn slowed work down to a crawl. The coming of World War II brought the yard to full capacity, with workers using Dry Dock 1 to construct and repair ships. To support these needs of the Yard, Dry Dock 1 has been expanded throughout its history. Originally built at three hundred and five feet, the granite dock now stands just shy of four hundred.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Though no longer in official use since the yard's closure in 1974, Dry Dock 1 still serves purpose to this day. Visitors may see the dock in use for repair work on <em>Constitution </em>and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/uss-cassin-young.htm\">USS <em>Cassin Young</em> (DD-793)</a>. It serves also as a reminder of the roots of the United States Navy and the civilian laborers who poured sweat and soul into their craft.</p> <h2>Learn more...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/charlestown-navy-yard-dry-dock-1.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard: Dry Dock 1 </a></p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Richard D.

They not only protested the arrest of fugitive slaves but also actively organized against the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fugitive-slave-laws-boston.htm\">fugitive slave laws</a> here. They pressured state and local officials to resist enforcing these federal laws and formed <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/faneuil-hall-and-boston-vigilance-committees.htm\">vigilance committees</a> here to assist those seeking freedom on the Underground Railroad.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/fh.htm\">Faneuil Hall - Boston National Historical Park</a></p>",
    "audioDescription": "Faneuil Hall is a three story brick building, with a triangular pediment on top of those three stories, an A-Frame roof, and a white wooden cupola on the top of the building on the eastern side. The floor-plan is rectangular in shape. The east and west faces of the building have seven arch shaped windows on each of the three floors of the building. On the ground floor, double doors are in place of windows in the second, fourth (middle), and sixth spaces. On the north and south sides of the building, there are nine arch shaped windows spaced evenly on the first and second floor. On the third floor each window is rectangular and a semicircular window is above each one a few feet higher. On each floor and each face of the building, there are bricks protruding from the face of the building, on either side of the windows, to look like Doric columns. A small entablature stretches across the building's faces as if to show a separation of the three stories. On the pediment in the east or west, a semi-circular window is in the center. The semicircle is no wider than any of the other windows on the lower floors, making it appear quite small on the pediment itself. There is white molding that frames the semicircle window, separated from the window by the bricks of the pediment. There are two circular windows on either side of this framing, nestled into the corners of the pediment, sitting above the second arched window from either side on the floors below it. The cupola is painted white and made of wood. The top of the cupola is gilt. A large grasshopper weather vane is on top of the cupola. On the pitch of the roof on the north and south sides there are five evenly spaced circular dormer windows protruding from the roof.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Fort Hill, a historic neighborhood in Roxbury, played an important role during the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a>. Several thousand Continental soldiers positioned themselves in the area and built a series of forts to guard Boston Neck, a thin strip of land that served as the only land route between Boston and Roxbury. As described in Francis S. Drake's <em>Town of Roxbury</em>:</p> <blockquote>Bunker's Hill demonstrated the value of defensive works, and under the direction of Col. Rufus Putnam, aided by Henry Knox and Josiah Waters, the Roxbury lines, considered marvels of strength in those days, grew rapidly, until at length a complete series of redoubts and batteries protected every exposed point from Dorchester to Brookline. The American militia-men manifested a degree of skill and activity in constructing fieldworks that was a constant surprise to the veteran European soldiers of former wars.<sup>1</sup></blockquote> <p>The High Fort, or Upper Fort, sat on the highest point in Roxbury, providing the colonists with an optimal vantage of the British army. According to Drake, it is believed to have been \"regarded by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">Washington</a> as the best and most eligibly situated of all the works.\"<sup>2</sup> It is also said that the Fort Hill neighborhood is named for the High Fort.</p> <p>The fort itself no longer exists, and in that space now stands the Cochituate Standpipe, or Fort Hill Tower. Built in 1869 by Nathaniel Bradlee, the standpipe previously stored water from Lake Cochituate in Natick and helped modernize Roxbury’s water system.

    "bodyText": "<p>Fort Independence, formerly known as Castle William, sits on top of Castle Island. Due to its strategic location on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a>, this site has served as the home to military fortifications for hundreds of years. It is considered the \"oldest fortified military site in British North America.\"<sup>1</sup></p> <p>The first known fort at this site dates back to the 1630s, when Governor John Winthrop ordered the construction of a fort on Castle Island.<sup>2</sup> The fort expanded in the 1640s and in the 1690s due to the constant fear of attacks by French naval forces. In 1701, the fort became officially known as Castle William, named after William II of England.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Castle William's role shifted from protecting against potential attacks from European powers to providing a refuge for British soldiers facing colonial upheaval in Boston. After the Boston Massacre in 1770, Bostonians called for British troops stationed in the city to be removed to Castle William.<sup>4</sup> British forces maintained their presence at Castle William for the next six years.</p> <p>In the beginning of March 1776, the Continental Army fortified nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/dorchester-heights.htm\">Dorchester Heights</a> in the dead of night. British forces from Castle William witnessed this fortification and organized an attack. General William Howe, with 11,000 soldiers at his command, ordered an attack on Dorchester Heights.<sup>5</sup> However, due to poor weather, British forces had to return to the safety of the fort.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">George Washington's</a> Continental Army surrounding Boston, General Howe and his troops prepared to leave the city. In one final act of aggression against the enemy, British forces fired upon the Continental Army as they constructed new fortifications on Dorchester Point.<sup>7</sup> This attack proved unsuccessful, injuring British soldiers due to a misfired cannon. Documenting the events of the day in his diary, British Lieutenant General Archibald Robertson wrote,</p> <blockquote>20th [March]… Between one and two found the Rebels had begun a new Work on Dorchester Point opposite Castle William. We fired at them from the Castle and by a Gun bursting had 7 men wounded.<sup>8</sup></blockquote> <p>Hours later, British forces evacuated Boston and set Castle Island, including the fort, on fire.<sup>9</sup> Robertson noted the General's order to load mines at the Castle and the following destruction:</p> <blockquote>Accordingly at 8 o'clock 6 Companies Embark’d and the Boats lay off untill the mines were fired, which was done 1/2 an hour Afterwards and they had a very good Effect. The Barracks and other houses were then set on fire and at 9 ... we got all safe on board the Transports.<sup>10</sup></blockquote> <p>After the smoke cleared, Continental forces quickly rebuilt the fortifications at Castle William into a star-shaped fort.<sup>11</sup> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/paul-revere.htm\">Lieutenant Colonel Paul Revere</a> led the troops stationed here.<sup>12</sup></p> <p>When the war ended, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts used the fort as a state prison. In the late 1790s, the federal government took command of the fort, repairing and expanding it. In 1799, President John Adams renamed Castle William to Fort Independence.<sup>13</sup></p> <p>When the country faced times of war, the US Military prepared Fort Independence for battle. During the War of 1812, and later from 1834 to 1851, the fort was repaired and expanded.<sup>14</sup> Fort Independence served as an armory during the Civil War, with the Fourth Battalion of Massachusetts Infantry stationed here.<sup>15</sup> The Fort also remained active during the World Wars in case of a coastal attack.<sup>16</sup></p> <p>Today, Fort Independence is part of a state park on Castle Island. Throughout the warmer months of the year, the Castle Island Association provides free tours of Fort Independence in partnership with the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.</p> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>\"A plan of Fort Independence,\" Collections Online, <em>Massachusetts Historical Society (MHS)</em>, accessed February 8, 2022, <a href=\"https://www.masshist.org/database/418\">https://www.masshist.org/database/418</a>.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation and National Park Service, \"Cultural Landscape Report for the Boston Harbor Islands,\" <em>Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em> vol 1 (Boston, Massachusetts: 2000/2017), <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf</a>, 84.</li> <li>\"Cultural Landscape Report for the Boston Harbor Islands,\" 85.</li> <li>\"Cultural Landscape Report for the Boston Harbor Islands,\" 86; Richard Frothingham, \"History of the siege of Boston\" (Boston: C.

They fired from a Small Vessel from Boston Neck, from the wharf, from Fort Hill, &c. Supposed they Fired 1000 Shott as it Lasted the whole Night. Our people Fired in Boston from Roxberry.

By March 17, the British troops began their evacuation, along with many loyalists from the Greater Boston area.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Though parts of the fortifications remained visible until 1824,<sup>5</sup> they were soon demolished and covered. Located in the path of the Old Colony line, Foster’s Hill disappears from area maps after 1807. It was not until 1899 that the Massachusetts Society Sons of the American Revolution marked the site of the hill with a brass plaque. Located on the side of the old Lawrence School building at B and Athens Streets, it commemorated \"the seizing of Nooks Hill by a detachment of the forces under Gen. Washington.\"<sup>6</sup> Today, the neighborhood of South Boston has grown up among the former hills of Dorchester Heights.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>There are some arguments over what the proper name for this hill should be. According to a National Park Service document published in October 1993, the actual name of this hill should be Nook’s Hill. \"The final hill of importance in an historical context was Nook's Hill on the western edge of the peninsula, opposite the Boston Neck across the water. Because of the unregulated spelling of that era, Nook's Hill was sometimes spelled 'Newks,' or even 'Nukes.' Some cartographers mistakenly applied the name 'Forsters' or 'Fosters' to Nooks Hill.' Child Associates. n.d. “National Register of Historic Places ... - Npshistory.com.” <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Dorchester Heights/Thomas Park, Boston National Historical Park, South Boston, Massachustts,</em> National Park Service, acessed February 7, 2022. <a href=\"http://www.npshistory.com/publications/bost/nr-dorchester-heights.pdf\">http://www.npshistory.com/publications/bost/nr-dorchester-heights.pdf</a>.</li> <li>Henry Bedinger, <em>Journal of Major Henry Bedinger, from July 17, 1775 to May 24, 1776 Followed by Journal & Remarks of Henry Bedinger from Berkeley County, VA, </em>1957.</li> <li>“Dr Enoch Dole (1742-1776) - Find a Grave Memorial,” <em>Find A Grave</em>, October 23, 2006. <a href=\"https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/16302522/enoch-dole\">https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/16302522/enoch-dole</a>.</li> <li>Child Associates, “National Register of Historic Places ... - Npshistory.com.” <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Dorchester Heights/Thomas Park, Boston National Historical Park, South Boston, Massachustts,</em> National Park Service, accessed February 7, 2022. <a href=\"http://www.npshistory.com/publications/bost/nr-dorchester-heights.pdf\">http://www.npshistory.com/publications/bost/nr-dorchester-heights.pdf</a>.</li> <li><em>Cultural Landscape Report: Dorchester Heights/Thomas Park, Boston National Historical Park, South Boston, Massachustts,</em> National Park Service.</li> <li>“Not On That Site: School Committee Does Not Want Engine House Next to the High School Building,” <em>Boston Journal</em>, April 26, 1899.</li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p>As one of the original entry points to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/charlestown-navy-yard.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard</a>, Gate 1 has played a vital role to the operation of the yard. It acted as the main entrance to this major naval facility, and here US Marines monitored the entry of vehicles, workers, and visitors to the yard.</p> <p>In the early 1800s, Gate 1 consisted of a guardhouse with a picket fence. In 1847, granite posts and iron gates replaced the picket fence. The US Navy ordered an impressive Beaux-Arts style Gate 1 in 1901 (see in photo gallery). However, in the 20th century this gate was too narrow for the increased vehicular traffic, requiring Gate 2 to be constructed nearby to handle the congestion. While some civilian employees entered through this gate, the Charlestown Navy Yard had other gates dedicated to serving these employees arriving by foot.</p> <p>Before it was removed in the 1950s, the formidable Gate 1 served another valuable purpose: it provided living quarters for the Marine guards of Gate 1 for over fifty years.</p> <p>The US Navy built the current guardhouse for Gate 1 in 1959 and the gate could easily handle two-way traffic. As the caretaker of the Charlestown Navy Yard after 1974, the National Park Service limited Gate 1 to pedestrians. The former Scale House became the vehicular entrance to the Navy Yard, guarded by the National Park Service Protection Division.</p> <p>The National Park Service renovated the entire Gate 1 area in 2019.</p> <h2>Learn more...</h2> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/charlestown-navy-yard-gate-1.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard: Gate 1 </a> <h2>Sources</h2> <ul> <li>Black, Frederick R. and Edwin C.

    "audioDescription": "Gate 1 is an open tar walkway with three black posts approximately 1 foot wide and a 3 feet high. These posts have square black bases that are approximately 5 inches tall. The Freedom Trail red brick line is inlayed in the ground with a granite outline, and two columns of brick on either side. To the north of Gate 1 is the Gate 1 Gatehouse. The Gatehouse is a brick building with aluminum and glass curtain walls and a deep roof canopy. The west elevation is three-bays across, with the two-bays further south being glass. Each bay is divided in three sections from top to bottom. The bottom two are squares where as the top is a rectangle that is half the height of the square. The north and south elevations are five-bays across with the bay to the east having an inlet where the glass door is located. The bay to the west has a glass door with a metal ramp leading up to it that runs parallel to the building. The design of the window bays has the same design as the west side. The bottom sections of all the window bays are painted with a teal-mint color. The roof canopy is held up with three cylindrical posts equally spaces at the south end of the canopy. Aluminum letters along the cornice line read \"Gate 1.\"",

Grape Island is recognized as a wildlife haven, offering an abundance of wild berries for birds and other animals to enjoy. An island for the outdoor enthusiast, Grape Island features trails, beaches, picnic areas, and camp sites.</p> <p>Similar to many of the Boston Harbor Islands, Grape Island likely provided valuable resources for early inhabitants of the area. With the arrival of European settlers in the 1600s, several of the islands, including Grape, became converted into farmland. Throughout the 1600s and early 1700s, several farmers and farming families shared ownership of the island.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>At the time of the Revolutionary War, Elisha Leavitt, a Tory Loyalist, owned the island. As British forces searched for resources in the islands during the Siege of Boston, Leavitt gave British forces access his hay. In what became known as the Battle of Grape Island, townspeople of Weymouth and the local militia saw British soldiers taking hay on May 21, 1775. Sounding the alarm, local colonial forces initially fired upon the British before taking boats to the island and driving the British away.<sup>2</sup> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abigail-adams.htm\">Abigail Adams</a>, living in the area, recalled the event to her husband, John Adams:</p> <blockquote>You inquire of me who were at the engagement at Grape Island. I may say with truth all of Weymouth, Braintree, Hingham, who were able to bear arms, and hundreds from other towns within twenty, thirty, and forty miles of Weymouth. Both your brothers were there; your younger brother, with his company, who gained honor by their good order that day. He was one of the first to venture on board a schooner, to land upon the island.<sup>3</sup></blockquote> <p>Later caretakers of the small agricultural island include a Captain Smith in the late 1800s, Captain Billy McLeod and his wife from the early 1900s to the 1930s, and finally the Torresson family, who left the island around 1940.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>During the 1970s, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management designated 16 islands, including Grape Island, as part of the new Boston Harbor Islands State Park.<sup>5</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-grap.htm\">Island Facts: Grape Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Edward Snow, <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=0\">The Islands of Boston Harbor</a></em> (Carlisle, MA: Commonwealth Editions, 2002), 160.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 30; Snow, <em>The Islands of Boston Harbor</em>, 161; Richard Frothingham, <em><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/historyofsiegeof02frot/page/108/mode/2up \">History of the Siege of Boston</a></em> (Boston: C.

    "audioDescription": "Kings Chapel is a two story, sandy colored church building made of brick and stone with two separate parts: the entryway, and the body of the church most commonly used by the congregation, also known as the nave. Both the nave and the entryway are rectangular in shape. The entry way is only slightly less wide than the body of the church, but is much more narrow. The entryway itself is made up of columns supporting a balcony. There are 6 columns supporting the front of the balcony, with three additional columns supporting either side. Directly resting on top of the columns is a sandy colored, plainly decorated cornice, or molding, on top of which a small, stone fence marks the edge of the balcony. On top of the balcony is a brick cube with small, arch shaped windows placed in the center of each visible face. This is the bell tower with a bell inside. The nave itself, or portion of the church mainly used by the congregation, has arch shaped windows evenly spaced on each of the two stories. The second story arched windows are longer than those on the first story. There are five windows on each floor. There is a metal fence framing the entryway to the church. Inside the entryway under the bell is a kind of vestibule. In the sanctuary of the church there is one main aisle and box pews filling the space on either side. A pulpit is near the back of the church to the left. A balcony runs on the long sides and to the entry-side of the church sanctuary, supported by columns. A pipe organ is over the entryway on the balcony. In the neighboring burying ground, well over 100 graves are marked with various slate, granite, or weathered marble headstones. The majority feature a death's head with angel's wings and date from the 1600s. Paths meander to different areas. An iron fence and gate separate the burying ground from Tremont Street.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Little Brewster Island sits 9.3 miles from downtown Boston. The island is characterized by a large cliff on the northern side of the island, and mussel beds that connect the island to Great Brewster Island during low tide.<sup>1</sup> Perhaps best known as the home of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-light.htm\">Boston Light</a>, this 7-acre island is rich with history.</p> <p>Mariners first petitioned to erect a lighthouse in the outer mouth of the harbor as early as 1713. In response, a committee led by Lieutenant Governor William Tailer scouted several islands for the most suitable place for a light. In 1715, the General Court of Massachusetts passed the Boston Light Bill. This bill named the location for the light as the southern part of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/great-brewster-island.htm\">Great Brewster Island</a>, then called Beacon Island, and today known as Little Brewster Island. The town of Hull granted the island for use and construction began.<sup>2</sup> Built of rough-cut stone, and first lit in 1716, Boston Light, became the first lighthouse in the United States. Other structures built on the island during this period included a house, wharf, and a barn.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>The first keeper, Georges Worthylake, grazed sheep on Great Brewster Island. In November 1718 while on a trip back to Little Brewster, Worthylake drowned just off the edge of the island. Perhaps even more tragically, several others drowned with him, including his wife, daughters, an enslaved person named Shadwell, and a servant. The following year, the third lighthouse keeper, John Hayes, requested a fog gun be placed on the island to aid vessels in fog. The court approved his request and installed a cannon on the island in 1719. The cannon remained on the island for 132 years.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Following the passage of the Boston Port Bill, the British arrived in the harbor and took control of the island. In July 1775, a detachment of soldiers, under command of Major Vose, landed on the island and burnt the wooden parts of Boston Light. Although British Marines began repairs immediately, 300 soldiers sent by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">General Washington</a> descended upon the island two weeks later and rendered the light unserviceable. The British began repairs once more, but they had not finished by the time they evacuated Boston in June 1776. As they left, they destroyed Boston Light.</p> <p>Little Brewster Island remained dark until 1783 when the Massachusetts Legislature paid to erect a new lighthouse on the base of the original light.<sup>5</sup> The new light stood at 75 feet, raised to 89 feet in 1859. Built with rubble stone and lined with brick, its foundation is granite. The Commonwealth maintained control of the light, until 1790 when the federal government took control of both the light and by default the island as well.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>The rocks that surrounded Boston Light still proved themselves dangerous and wrecks continued into the 1800s. Keepers at Boston Light actively participated in lifesaving missions. In 1840, the keeper rescued 30 people from the Diana. which had filled with water during a storm. In 1860, a keeper housed the crew of the Ewan Crerar, who had rowed to Little Brewster Island after their brig had gotten caught on a ledge along <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-graves.htm\">the Graves</a>. In 1861, Hull Pilot Boat No 2 rescued 13 survivors off the coast of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/shag-rocks.htm\">Shag Rocks</a>; those who did not survive washed up on the shore of the island days later.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>To pass the time on the secluded island, different keepers had different strategies. Some, such as George Worthlake, had families living with them. Others supplemented their income by entertaining sailors. Tobias Cook, keeper from 1844 until 1849, enjoyed hosting visitors on the island. This included a short-lived \"Spanish\" cigar factory, which brought young girls in from Boston. Cook’s successor, William Long, kept an active social agenda as well. His daughter’s journal recounts trips to Great Brewster and around the Brewster Spit during low tide. She also highlights numerous visitors to the island, even saying:</p> <blockquote>As many as six pilots landing at once to enjoy a social hour or two at the light.<sup>8</sup></blockquote> <p>During World War I, Boston Light dimmed in response to U-boat alarms. In 1940, the U.S Coast Guard took control of the light and extinguished the light during World War II. In 1948, the Coast Guard electrified the light.</p> <p>Though electrified, Boston Light continues to be permanently staffed, as authorized by Congress in 1989. Current lighthouse keeper Dr. Sally Snowman has served since 2003. Snowman is both the first civilian keeper of the light and the first female keeper. The island is not accessible to visitors, due to a dock broken during a winter storm several years ago.<sup>9</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-libr.htm\">Island Facts: Little Brewster - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <h2>Footnotes </h2> <ol> <li><em>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,</em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> <em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 78, 101-110.</li> <li>Ralph Smith, \"<a href=\"BOSTON LIGHTHOUSE - The Mariners\">Photograph, Gelatin- Silver Print</a>\" Accessed April 11, 2023;  Moses Foster Sweetser, <em>King's Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 216-218.</li> <li><em>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> <em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 101-110.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,</em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> <em>Volume 1: Historical Overview</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 60-62; National Park Service Boston Harbor Islands, \"Boston Light,\" Accessed April 11, 2023.</li> <li>Ralph Smith, \"<a href=\"BOSTON LIGHTHOUSE - The Mariners\">Photograph, Gelatin- Silver Print</a>\" Accessed April 11, 2023; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 60- 62.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation<em>, Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> <em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 101-110; United States Coast Guard, \"<a href=\"Boston Light > United States Coast Guard > All.\"> United States Coast Guard > All.|\">Boston Light</a>,\" Accessed April 11, 2023.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> <em>Volume 1: Historical Overview</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 65-68.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation,<em> </em><em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,</em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> <em>Volume 1: Historical Overview</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 62, 65-67.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> <em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 101-102.</li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Just five miles out from Boston sits the biggest of the Boston Harbor Islands, aptly named Long Island. At 225 acres, the island is composed of three drumlins and a freshwater marsh on the west side of the island. Today, Long Island is owned by the City of Boston and is not accessible by public ferry or private boat.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Prior to European colonization, local Indigenous communities accessed Long Island seasonally. When European encroachment of the region led to Metacom's Rebellion (also known as King Philip's War) from 1675-1676, colonists used Long Island as an incarceration site for \"Christianized\" Indigenous peoples whom colonists feared might join the rebellion. Many of those incarcerated here had been moved from Deer Island, an internment camp that had become overcrowded. Hundreds perished due to extreme conditions and starvation. A burial site remains on the island today.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a> in 1775, about 500 continental soldiers boarded the island from whale-boats and took all the sheep and cattle on the island, along with 17 British prisoners. The following year, continental soldiers occupied Long Island and placed several batteries here and on other islands in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Boston Harbor</a>. They destroyed a British cargo vessel carrying military supplies and reinforcements. The captain of the vessel and 36 others died with the ship. All were brought ashore and buried on Long Island.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>In 1818, The Boston Marine Society recommended a light be placed on Long Island. The light went into service in 1819 and stood 20 feet tall, with a keeper's house connected to the light. By 1844, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/long-island-light.htm\">lighthouse </a>needed to be replaced in its entirety as a result of neglect. The new lighthouse became the first cast iron lighthouse in the country.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>By the 1800s, several mansions and hotels had been built on the island. The Long Island Company purchased the island in 1849, with plans to build hotels and summer residencies. The start of the Civil War brought troops to the island once again; it housed about 1,000 conscripts and several heavy artillery companies. The Long Island-House Hotel served as the headquarters for the island camp called Camp Wrightman.<sup>5</sup> The author of the regimental history for the Ninth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry remembered his time on Long Island fondly, saying,</p> <blockquote>The transference of the regiment from Faneuil Hall to Long Island was indeed, a great blessing to all parties interested. The freedom of the island, with its green fields, pure salt air and bright sky, infused new life in both officers and men...<sup>6</sup></blockquote> <p>Around 1882, the City of Boston evicted a Portuguese fishing village from Long Island, forcing them to move to nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/peddocks-island.htm\">Peddocks Island</a>.<sup>7</sup> The city then acquired the island’s biggest hotel and turned it into an almshouse.</p> <p>In 1899, Camp Wrightman formally received the name Fort Strong in honor of Major General George C. Strong, who died of wounds sustained at the Battle of Gettysburg. Replaced again in 1901, Long Island Head Light was moved further west on the island in order to avoid damage from gunfire at the expanding fort. Althought it had grown to eight batteries by 1906, Fort Strong saw minimal use during World War I and went into maintenance status in 1922.</p> <p>Returning to operation during World War II, Fort Strong controlled the northern minefields in the harbor. This lasted until 1943 when control was transferred to forts that had more modern equipment. Although operators at Fort Strong continued to perform maintenance on the mines, the fort went into standby status and all big guns on the island were removed.</p> <p>The military used Fort Strong in some capacity until 1948.<sup>8</sup> Construction on the bridge that connected Long Island to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/moon-island.htm\">Moon Island</a> concluded in 1951, successfully joining Long Island Hospital to the mainland. At the time, Long Island Hospital focused on chronically ill patients. Since the placement of the almshouse in the 1880s, Long Island has served as the home to various social services, including a hospital, nursing school, mental health facility, and homeless shelter.<sup>9</sup> The City of Boston removed the structurally unsound bridge in 2015, ending all programs on the island.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-long.htm\">Island Facts: Long Island - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-long.htm\">\"Island Facts: Long Island,\"</a> <em>National Park Service</em>, accessed November 2022.</li> <li>Julianne Jennings, \"Deer Island: A History of Human Tragedy Remembered,\" <em>Indian Country Today,</em> last modified September 12, 2018, <a href=\"https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered\">https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/deer-island-a-history-of-human-tragedy-remembered</a>; \"Legacy of Genocide Resurfaces in Boston as Construction Planned on Burial Site,\" <em>Cultural Survival,</em> last modified July 27, 2019, <a href=\"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/legacy-genocide-resurfaces-boston-construction-planned-burial-site-0\">https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/legacy-genocide-resurfaces-boston-construction-planned-burial-site-0</a>.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a> </em>(Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 29-33, 76-86. </li> <li>Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/long-island-head-light.htm\">\"Long Island Head Light,\"</a> <em>National Park Service</em>, date last modified February 26, 2015.</li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a>,</em> 61-64, 187. </li> <li>Daniel George Macnamara, <em>The History of Ninth Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, Second Brigade, First Division, Fifth Army Corps: Army of the Potomac</em> (Boston: E.B Stillings & Co.

    "bodyText": "<p>Located at the base of today's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/state-street-boston.htm\">State Street</a>, Long Wharf served as the nucleus of Boston's maritime trade. By the end of the 1700s, it reigned pre-eminent amongst Boston's 80 wharves, handling both international and coastal trade. Regaining its prominence as a commercial center, Long Wharf remains one of the city's most well-known wharves today.<sup>1</sup> </p> <p>Acting upon the suggestion of Henry Deering in 1707, the Selectmen of Boston granted permission to a private group of men (headed by Capt. Oliver Noyes) for the construction of a wharf at the base of King Street. Constructed around 1710-1721, the new wharf extended half a mile into the harbor and became known as \"Long Wharf.\" Early maps show that it was by far the most ambitious undertaking on Boston's waterfront.</p> <p>An immediate success, Long Wharf's site at the base of King Street allowed direct access to the heart of the town—the intersection of King and Cornhill Streets (now State and Washington Streets). Its extreme length of 1,586 feet allowed up to 50 vessels to dock and unload directly into warehouses without the use of lighters or boats. With its site and length, the wharf soon became central to the commercial trade of Boston.</p> <p>Supported by powerful New England merchant families, commercial trade in Boston grew substantially as the town became integrated into the Atlantic trading empire.<sup>2</sup> Due to its location, Boston served as an ideal location as a port of call for ships traveling across the Atlantic ocean. Boston, and Long Wharf in particular, became immersed in the Mid-Atlantic slave trade and what is known as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-middle-passage.htm\">Middle Passage</a>. Newspaper advertisements in the 1700s document that some ships docked at Long Wharf held enslaved Africans; merchants and captains also sold them alongside their other imports. Installed in 2020, a marker recognizes this history at the end of Long Wharf today.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>In addition to its economic role in the Atlantic trading empire, Long Wharf played a part in the early military history of Boston. In 1758, victors from the pivotal Battle of Louisbourg during the Seven Years' War landed here to gun salutes and cheering citizens. The arrival of British troops via Long Wharf just over a decade later received a different response, as they came to enforce the King's rights in 1770 (ultimately ending in the Boston Massacre). As part of the Intolerable Acts, British Parliament shut down the port of Boston in 1774, therefore closing Long Wharf stores and docks. According to Frothingham's <em>History of the Siege of Boston</em>, some of the British forces at Bunker Hill arrived from Long Wharf.<sup>4</sup> Wounded from both sides of the Battle of Bunker Hill were brought back across the harbor to Long Wharf in June of 1775. At the end of the Siege of Boston, the British evacuated Boston from Long Wharf in March 1776. In July 1776, the ship that brought word of the Declaration of Independence from Philadelphia landed at Long Wharf. John Adams sailed from it to secure European financial and military support for the Revolutionary War. During this time, privateers and blockade runners sailed from Long Wharf and military stores were kept in its warehouses. Decades later, during the War of 1812, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/uss-constitution.htm\">USS <em>Constitution</em> (\"Old Ironsides\")</a> docked at Long Wharf.</p> <p>After the wars, trade resumed its dominant position on the wharf. Two new buildings, the Custom House Block and the Chart House, joined the Wharf's landscape. The Chart House dates from the 1830s with perhaps some colonial sections. Built in 1848, the Custom House Block provides an example of the monumental granite structures that lined Boston's docks during the height of its commercial prosperity. Both of these buildings help Long Wharf maintain its historic character today.</p> <p>The city of Boston achieved its acme of commercial prosperity in the 1840s-1850s. While trade with Europe continued throughout this period, Boston merchant houses thrived on the China and East Indies trade—silks, madras, and cashmere were transported to Long Wharf warehouses.</p> <p>During this time, Long Wharf also witnessed flashpoints in the city's abolitionist history. In 1851, local authorities marched captured freedom seeker <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-the-whole-land-is-full-of-blood-the-thomas-sims-case.htm\">Thomas Sims</a> down Long Wharf to board him on the brig <em>Acorn</em>, which took him back to slavery in Savannah, Georgia. About a hundred abolitionists protested this rendition, as result of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/fugitive-slave-laws-boston.htm\">1850 Fugitive Slave Law</a>. Opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law grew rapidly three years later when another freedom seeker, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/-god-made-me-a-man-not-a-slave-the-arrest-of-anthony-burns.htm\">Anthony Burns</a>, faced the same fate. After a short trial and a failed rescue attempt, hundreds of federal troops marched Anthony Burns down State Street to Long Wharf as 50,000 people lined the streets to protest.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>After the American Civil War, trade declined in Boston and so did the importance of Long Wharf. The primary business of the wharf shifted from international trade to coastal trade and fishing. Atlantic Avenue was built to enlarge the waterfront just at the point when Boston's great maritime era was closing. In 1914, major fish dealers moved to the completed Fish Pier in South Boston.

A permanent detachment of 20 Marines was assigned to the Yard in 1805, but they lacked barracks. Construction of a permanent barracks building, intending to house up to 150 Marines, began in 1810 with the stipulation that the Marines work with construction material not in use by the Navy. On February 19, 1811, the Marines moved into their new barracks, then a single story building flanked by two three-story wings. The barracks eventually was expanded to the four-story structure visitors see today with improvements made between 1861 and 1948.</p> <p>The Marine Barracks included not only housing, but also a barbershop, post exchange, chaplain’s office, movie theater, brig, and pistol range. The duties of the Marines included controlling access to the Yard, guarding the naval prison, and deploying as required to conflicts around the world. The Marines even responded to civil emergencies throughout Boston, including prison riots, crowd control, and fire relief. The detachment reached its greatest numbers during World War II with 643 Marines stationed here. The Marines lowered the Yard’s American Flag for the last time on July 1, 1974, when the Yard closed.</p> <p>Today the Marine Barracks serves as the administrative center and park housing for Boston National Historical Park.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Marine Barracks is four stories tall building, eleven bays long, and five bays deep. The first floor exterior is primarily painted a mint green while the upper levels are primarily painted white. It has a U-shape plan with the three-story rear wing extending out from the center of the north elevation. The granite boundary wall runs along the north side of the building, creating two courtyards on the easy and west sides of the rear wing. Two brick towers (consisting of staircases) divide the south facade of the building into three sections, with 5 bays in between them. The towers have four-light windows at the location of the landings for the staircases. On the exterior of the second floor of each of the towers are mint green speaker phones pointed south. The primary entrance on the first floor consists of a pair of partially-glazed steel double doors recessed in a segmental arch opening in the center of the facade. Over the arch opening is a sign stating \"Marine Barracks\" with the insignia of the Marines. Secondary entrances are located in the first story of the south elevation of the east and west wings. Two rectangular openings on the first story of the east elevation are capped by shed roofs clad with slate shingles and copper flashing supported by scroll brackets. The five bays across the facade is vertically divided by Doric pilasters with groups of three, eight- and six-light horizontal sliding aluminum windows. The rest of the windows primarily consist of two-over-two, double-hung sash in varying sizes with splayed brick lintels and concrete sills. Some window openings on the upper stories of the east elevation are filled in with brick. A two-entrance rounded driveway leads up to the Marine Barracks. In front of driveway is a grassy area that served as the Marine Barracks Parade Ground.",

    "audioDescription": "The primary central structure is a red brick, federal style building with two main stories. A smaller third story, which is approximately one third of the length of the bottom two stories rests immediately in the center of the building. This smaller third story provides a base for a brick pediment, outlined in a white trim, which provides the base for an immense gold dome. On top of the dome rests a small cupola, which appears to be made of white wood and adorned with gold decoration. On the top of the cupola is a small pine cone, the state's symbol. Jutting out from the main building is a two-story brick and stone entryway and covered balcony, lined on the first floor with seven brick arches. Each of these arches have a white adornment at the keystone, and thin, white imposts connecting them. The second level is held up by white Corinthian columns, with four main columns at the center, flanked by two sets of two columns on either side. There are five rectangular windows visible in the center facade of the building, evenly spaced, and are framed on either side of this portion of the building by two white doors leading inside. Set back from this bumped out area, along the plane of the main rectangular building, are three sets of windows on either side of the main bump out feature. On the first floor they are rectangular and evenly spaced. Mirroring this placement on the second story are arched windows. On the third floor of this central building feature which has the pediment that supports the immense dome, there are five square windows spaced evenly with white pilasters between them. White marble wings emerge from either flank of this original \"core\" building. They are three stories tall. They protrude further back from the main building. After they protrude a few hundred feet, a perpendicular rectangle structure in much the same style caps these wings. The building sits back away from Beacon Street, and is secured by a raised stone barrier with an iron fence along the top. There is a main central staircase leading to the primary building that has two large stone pillars on either side and two smaller stone pillars in between to hold up an iron gate that holds a lantern at the center. There are four levels of stairs going up to the main facade and entrance, with green shrubs on either side. Two bronze sculptures stand on stone pillars on either side, closer to the building's entryway. Two flag posts stand on either side of the lawn, one waving the American flag above the POW flag, and the other waving the Massachusetts flag. There are separate side entrances going leading to the other buildings, known as the wings.",

William Noddle lived at Noddle’s Island sometime around 1630. Not much else is known of Noddle as he drowned in 1632.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>The Island had an active presence during the Siege of Boston in the Revolutionary War. In May 1775, colonial forces of 300, led by General Stark, raided farms on Noddle’s Island and other surrounding islands. A conflict occurred with some British Marines, who drove colonists back to nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/chelsea-creek.htm\">Chelsea Creek</a>. More skirmishes occurred over the next day before British forces retreated to their post in the harbor. Colonial troops returned to several islands a few days later to finish dispersing livestock and destroying supplies.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>After the British evacuated in 1776, Noddle’s Island became heavily fortified with a fort that became known as Fort Strong. Noddle’s Island later became outfitted with barracks to serve as a hospital for the French in 1780. These barracks remained in place until 1833.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>In the mid to late 1800s, Noddle’s Island became one of several islands that served as one of the locations of Boston’s growing shipbuilding industry in East Boston. As King’s <em>Handbook of Boston Harbor</em> noted:</p> <blockquote>Some of the finest ships that ever sailed were constructed here…between 1848 and 1858 more than 170 vessels were built at East Boston; of which 99 exceeded 1,000 tons each, and 9 were above 2,000 tons.<sup>4</sup></blockquote> <p>Sometime in the 1900s (likely mid-century), Noddle’s Island became absorbed into East Boston.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Edward Snow, <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=0\">The Islands of Boston Harbor</a></em> (Carlisle, MA: Commonwealth Editions, 2002), 146-147.</li> <li>Olmstead Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>, <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 76; Moses Foster Sweetser, <em><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=45EtAQAAMAAJ\">King’s Handbook of Boston Harbor</a></em> (Cambridge, MA: Moses King, 1883), 112; Richard Frothingham,  <em><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/historyofsiegeof02frot/page/108/mode/2up\">History of the Siege of Boston</a></em> (Boston: C.

    "audioDescription": "Quarters B-F faces east and is comprised of five Federal style brick row houses. Each quarter is two-and-one-half stories tall, three-bays wide, and four-bays deep on a raised brick foundation with a granite watertable on the east (facade) elevation. The primary entrances are located in the north-most bay of the facade of each unit. Granite steps with wrought iron handrails lead to recessed openings with a projecting surround of white chamfered pilasters and a wide white lintel topped by a shallow pitch roof. The entrances are located within the recessed openings and consist of simple, modern panel doors with a window and a storm door. On the white lintel is a small black circle with a white block letter written in it. The letters are B through F, as each townhouse is lettered B-F. Windows primarily consist of six-over-six, double-hung sash in two sizes, taller on the first story and shorter on the second, with granite lintels and sills. A window is located in each bay on the second floor, and two windows are located in the two southern most bays of each unit. Windows in the basement level on the facade are three-over-six, double-hung sash. A slate shingle-clad, side-gable roof spans the entire building with one to three gable dormers per unit on the east slope, and large shed dormers at irregular intervals and sizes arranged on the west slope. The windows in the dormers vary between one-over-one and eight-over-eight, double-hung sash. Two corbelled brick chimneys rise from between each unit for a total of ten chimneys. A cement pathway runs in front of all of the town houses, with additional cement pathways running perpendicular to lead up to the staircase of each townhouse. A lawn with a couple large trees is in front of the townhouses.",

    "audioDescription": "The Old Corner Bookstore is situated on the corners of School and Washington Streets. It has a gambrel roof, with the roof pitching down toward Washington Street. The School Street side shows the four stories that make up the building. On the first floor of the building, there are two bay windows that extend out over the sidewalk. There are twenty four panes of glass and the framing is yellow wood. On the edges of the first floor at the corner are a set of double doors leading into the structure. There is also a historic plaque made of dark metal on the first floor on the corner of the School Street and Washington Street sides. In between the first and second floors is a sign for Chipotle Mexican Grill, the current tenant as of 2020. On the second floor are five windows spaced evenly along the floor. Each window has twenty four window panes that are edged in yellow wood. On the corner of each side of the building, there are lighter red bricks extending slightly out of the wall to give it a textured look going up one story to the bottom of the roof edge. In between the second and third floor is a double horizontal line of red bricks that are slightly extended out of the building face. It extends across the top of the five windows of the second floor. The third floor has only three windows spaced, each with twenty four panes of glass edged in yellow wood, evenly across it due to the roof slope. In between the third and four floor is a double horizontal line of red bricks that are slightly extended out of the building face. It extends across the top of the three windows of the third floor. Located at the top center of the fourth floor is one window with twenty four window panes edged in yellow wood. The Washington Street side only has three visible floors. There is a historic sign on the corner of Washington Street and School Street made of dark metal. On the first level there are two bay windows with twenty four panes of yellow wood. They extend out over the sidewalk of Washington Street. In between the two bay windows is a doorway. Above the windows and door on the first floor is another sign for Chipotle Mexican Grill. The second floor has three windows spaced evenly across it with twenty four panes of glass and edged in yellow wood. The roof line is just above these windows. The roof is made of grey shingles with white wood edging it. There are two dormer windows that extend out of the roof. They are made of white wood on the extension with grey shingles. The building is surrounded by many red brick buildings and red brick sidewalk. The remaining two sides immediately abut the neighboring buildings.",

    "audioDescription": "The Old North Church Complex consists of three main buildings: the Historic Chocolate Shop, the Old North Church Gift Shop, and Christ Church. The Complex can either be accessed from Salem Street to the northwest or from Unity Street and Paul Revere Mall/Hanover Street from the southeast. Both entry points are enclosed by iron fences. The Historic Chocolate Shop is in the Clough House, a three-story brick structure from the 1710s, situated on Unity Street. Each level has five glass-paned windows with 24 panes each and edged in maroon wood. On the first floor, instead of a central window there is a red door that allows access into the structure from the street. There are two small rooms that visitors can access, one on the left and one on the right. These spaces are used by the Old North staff to portray reenactors and trades of the 18th century. Visitors can also enter and exit the building from within the complex, but it requires walking up about 12 stairs. The Gift Shop building is an old brick church building facing Salem Street. Its brick facade juts out from the building and has an arched entryway above the door, with a small pediment on top of the arch. A stone Corinthian column stands on either side as if to hold up the small pediment. Above the entryway is a circular window and a large brick pediment outlined in stone. There are two entrances, one facing the Clough House and the other directly after the gated entrance on Salem Street. Several stairs must be maneuvered for access through either entrance. The shop is very small and crowded with items related to Old North, Paul Revere, and chocolate. A Georgian-style building, Christ Church was constructed in 1723 by William Price. Its main entrance faces Salem Street, and Hull Street runs right up to its entrance. This facade shows how the square tower structure is connected to the rectangular church and serves as the entryway to the nave. On the first level is are red doors leading into the church, with an arched glass window directly above it. Both the doorway and the window are edged in light-colored stone. A historic bronze plaque is attached left to the doors, while a red entry plaque marking the entrance to The Old North Church is attached to the right of the doors. A row of several bricks jut out from the facade to mark the each level of the building. Directly above this is a stone marker labeled \"Christ Church 1723.\" A large glass-paned arched window sits above this marker. Instead of a window on the third floor is a stone marker denoting the church's historical significance to Paul Revere's nighttime ride. A final shuttered window sits on the forth story. Atop the brick portion of the tower sits a square wooden cupola, with two shuttered windows on each side. This is painted white and has a balcony with railing. Above that the steeple is shaped as a narrowing triangle. At the top point of the steeple is a golden weather vane with the cardinal directions as letters and a object that looks like a pair of pants flapping sideways in the wind. The full height of the building is revealed in the tower and steeple that is 175-feet tall. While there are no stairs to get into the building, the floors are uneven, and the space is tight compared to modern churches as the building is shaped like a narrow rectangle. There are two floors inside, the second one being held up by white pillars sitting on the first floor. There are three aisles to walk down: right, center, or left. In between each of these aisles are wooden box pews that rise about shoulder height. Each box pew has a half door that is unlocked with the turning of a knob and a step up and inside. At the front of the room is the pulpit, which is inaccessible to the public, but has a staircase up to it as it sits about 6 feet above the floor. Behind that is the altar, historic plaques, and icons of Jesus. There is a large, multipaned arched window set in the wall behind the altar. The balcony level is accessible only during services by a set of stairs by the entrance. There are wooden bench pews on that level. Also on the second floor is a large organ with multiple golden pipes. These pipes extend about 6 to 10 feet into the arch of the ceiling and are encased in a dark wood. There is a clock on the balcony wall in front of the organ. Hanging from the pillars on the second floor are historic flags.",

    "audioDescription": "The Meeting House is made of red brick. The main body of the Meeting House is shaped like a three story house, rectangular with a gently sloping roof. Attached to the front of this rectangle is a five story tower that is topped with a steeple. This tower has doors on all three outside faces that serve as the main entrance. Before the tower forms into a weathered green copper steeple, there is a large clock face on all three outer faces of the tower. On the first story of the main rectangular building feature facing Washington Street, the wall has two arched windows spaced evenly on either side of the tower. The windows have multiple panes and are edged in white wood. The second story has the same set up as the first story. There is a horizontal line of bricks that are protruding out of the wall between the second story and third story. This line travels around the building itself and the tower. The third story of this Washington Street wall has a small circular window located on either side of the tower. The long sides of the building have the same arched windows on the first and second stories. In the middle of the side facing Franklin Street is a double doorway. There are stairwells on either side leading to basement spaces. In middle on the opposite side is a much larger arched window spanning both first and second floors. The roof is gray slate shingle. Inside the sanctuary of the church it is very open. Box pews cover the vast majority of the main floor. A pulpit of wood panels, carved wood, and columns, all painted white, is above the main floor centered in front of the larger arched window visible on the outside which spans the first and second floor. A white octagonal sounding board hangs from the ceiling over the pulpit. The wall the pulpit is against has shutters in the arched sills for each window with no further decoration. The remaining three walls all have a connected balcony supported by white columns. On the shorter walls (the Washington Street wall and its opposite) is an additional second balcony, shallower than the larger lower first balcony, supported by smaller white columns to scale with the larger ones below. On the balcony directly opposite the pulpit, a gold eagle statue is in place with a string of gold beads in its beak.",

    "audioDescription": "The Old State House is flanked by three streets: Washington Street to the west, State Street to the north, and Devonshire Street to the south. Made almost entirely out of red brick, the building stands three stories tall with a cupola tower adding an additional two stories at the center top of the building. The footprint of the building is a long rectangle. It is on a sloped area of the ground. On the west side of the building there is a doorway flanked by two large rectangular windows with 24 panes of glass with cream trim, while on the opposite east side the brick foundation is more exposed with three half height windows of eight panes at street level, and three large rectangular windows in symmetry on the first floor. On the first floor of the long (north and south) sides of the building are ten rectangular windows with twenty four panes of glass edged in cream colored wood. These windows are spaced evenly through the building, five on either side of a door that is extending out of the wall. The entrance has small columns on either side that end in a triangular shaped pediment. The pediment has grey shingles on it. Both doorways on either north and south sides are up granite stairs. The second floor of the north/south sides has eleven of the same rectangular shaped windows on it, spaced evenly from left to right. On the third floor there are five dormers, or windows that project vertically from a sloping roof, spaced evenly on the roof. These are covered in grey slate shingles on their sides though the windows have the cream colored wood. Extending vertically from the center of the roof is a white tower made of an unknown material. The second level of the tower has a small white railing around its edges with many balusters, which is a shaft cut from a rectangle and used for decoration on railings. It is a smaller tier above the base below it. On each side of the next level of the tower is a large arched window. Inside the arch are two smaller arches with multiple panes of glass on each. The top space between these arches is filled with an upside down rounded triangle window to fit in that small space. The level above that has another tower has a small white railing around its edges with more balusters on it. On the west side of the building above the doorway are three more symmetrical large windows of the same size as the others, and on the east side the second floor has two large windows flanking a stone balcony shallowly protruding from the building. The doorway mimics the other windows, but is surrounded by cream stone columns and an arched pediment. The third floor of the short sides of the building appear to be full floors, and hiding the pitched gable roof are embellished rectangular facades. The brick facades on the third level feature small circular windows symmetrically flanking a center rectangular window that matches the other large rectangular windows. On the west side above this third floor is an eagle sculpture. On the east side on shelves in the facade are two statues: a lion rampant on the left and a unicorn in chains on the right. Above the central window on the east side is a clock face. Inside the building it is very symmetrical. Inside, the center room accessed by the central south door from outside opens into a room with a circular staircase. The room is curved to mimic the staircase. A large room is on either side of this stairwell chamber both on the first and second floors featuring a gift shop, exhibits, and recreated historic spaces.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Established in 1737, Old West Church has a long history in Boston. From its time as a church, to its stint as a library from 1896-1961, it has also served as a crucial gathering space for the community and welcomed advocates of social justice.<sup>1</sup> For example, in the 1850s, minister Charles Lowell called for the abolition of slavery and the end of racial segregation. In the 1970s, Old West became home to the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC), a groundbreaking queer Christian organization. MCC offered weekly services, Sunday school prayer groups, bible studies, and choir. MCC also opened its space to community activists and hosted the first meetings of what soon became GLAD, a leading LGTBQ+ rights organization.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnote</h2> <ol> <li>US Department of the Interior, National Park Service, \"Old West Church: National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form,\" 1969.

    "audioDescription": "On the corner of Park Street and Tremont Street and across the street from the Boston Common resides the Park Street Church. It is constructed in red brick and white wood, and the shingles on the gabled roof are a dark slate gray. It appears to be constructed similarly to many American Protestant churches from the early nineteenth century. There is a tall steeple on the front of the church. The nave of the church, or the extended area of the church that is most often used by the congregation, is about two stories tall. The west and east sides of the nave (facing Boston Common and Granary Burying Ground, respectively) has series of windows on both stories. The ground floor/basement on the west side have glass-paned windows with white trim that get progressively larger moving down the slope to Tremont Street. The first floor has five 20 glass-paned windows spaced evenly. In the center of the side is a short stairway leading to a white door, while the northwest corner has a more ornamental arched glass entryway. The second floor of the nave of the church contains seven tall arch shaped windows, all spaced evenly apart and adorned with white trim. The front entrance of the church, facing Tremont Street, is shaped as a semicircle. This semicircle shaped area, known as the apse of a church, connects the nave to the steeple of the church. Both sides of the the apse have two stories and six glass-paned windows with white trim - three on the first story and two on the second story, all spaced evenly apart. There are four white, decorative columns which separate and frame the windows length wise. Slate gray shingles are on the roof of the building. The roof of the apse is just below the roof of the nave. The steeple has two distinct parts - a red brick base and a wooden pyramid shaped top which is painted white. The red brick portion is a rectangular prism, and extends all the way to the top of the a-frame roof of the nave. The wall of the steeple is in line with the walls of the apse. On the top of the brick portion of the steeple is a black clock with golden roman numerals and golden hands. The clock has a white frame with semi-circles at each quarter of the frame. There is a white steeple that towers another three stories above the brick section of the steeple and extends into a point at the top. Each story on the steeple has an arch shaped window.",

    "audioDescription": "The House is made of wood and it has been painted blue grey. Totaling three stories in height, the House is rather small compared to modern houses today. The house faces North Square and the facade is no longer than about 40 feet. The first floor has two nearly square windows with diamond panes of glass, and a door on the far right. The second story hangs over the first story by about two feet. At each end of the overhang, there are wooden decorations that hang down in the shape of a square with an attached globe. There are three sets of windows on the second story. Each window has the multiple panes of diamond shaped glass with metal in between each pane. Each pair is set evenly across the level. There is also a singular window of diamond shaped panes of glass with metal on the far right side. It is located approximately above the door on the first floor. The roof of the Paul Revere House is a gable roof pitched down toward the street and the back of the house, covered with different grey shingles. In the far right part of the roof there is a red brick tower shaped chimney. There is a second chimney that rises on the right side on the back side of the house. The floorplan of the house is roughly a 'L' shape. The base of the L faces the street and the stem of the L is an extension of the house with a kitchen on the first floor and an additional bedroom on the second. In the main part of the house, there is just one room on the first and one room on the second floor. A stairwell is immediately inside the front door. Visitors do not use the front door of the house. To the left of the front of the house is a brick wall approximately 5 or 6 feet tall and a gate. A ticket booth is located just inside a gate. Beyond the gate is a small courtyard of different low tiers. A back door into the kitchen is the primary visitor entrance. Visitors leave from the rear second floor bedroom onto a catwalk that leads to a dwelling converted into a visitor center.",

The day before, police arrested these suffragists for protesting during President Woodrow Wilson's visit to Boston. 19 suffragists appeared in court after spending a night in the House of Detention, while four more joined them after being released on bail. Judge Wilfred Bolster moved the hearings to a smaller room after NWP members packed the original courtroom to show their support. Facing the judge either individually or in small groups, the suffragists had to pay a $5 fine for loitering. Four women paid the fine, two had their cases filed or postponed, and one was acquitted. The rest of the protestors, 16 in total, refused to pay the fine. Judge Bolster sentenced them to 8 days at Charles Street Jail.</p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/f05bd9fd-894f-4774-af9e-2af0b1d3b399\"><img alt=\"Large stone building next to a square.\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/f05bd9fd-894f-4774-af9e-2af0b1d3b399/proxylores.jpg?\" style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%;\" /></a> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Pemberton Square Courthouse in Boston, MA, ca. 1855-1895.

Conversely, operators could move the cranes along railroad tracks, driving them over blockages and repositioning them where needed.</p> <p>The combination of its open portal, revolving top, and ability to move made the portal crane remarkably flexible and well-suited to its work at the Navy Yard. These cranes played a pivotal role in the building and repairing of ships at the Yard starting from their introduction in the 1940s until the Yard’s closure in 1974.</p> <p>Leading up to and during World War, technological improvements and advancements in shipbuilding led to a reliance on electric motor cranes to fit together prefabricated sections of ships to form a complete vessel. Crane 62 and Crane 65 are good examples of the type of crane used during and after World War II for this style of construction.</p> <p>After the war, the Charlestown Navy Yard found itself increasingly called upon not for new ship construction but for the refitting of older ships. Portal Cranes performed much of the conversion work of dozens of ships in the 1950s and 60s.</p> <p>When the Yard closed in 1974, many of the cranes were scrapped or moved.

As one of the hills closest to the city of Boston, it played a pivotal role in the line of defensive works constructed after the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-bunker-hill.htm\">Battle of Bunker Hill</a>.</p> <p>Located just 2 ½ miles from Bunker and Breeds Hill, General Israel Putnam led the retreating colonial troops to safety at Prospect Hill. Almost immediately, the men began to fortify the area with a redoubt like the one placed on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/breeds-hill.htm\">Breed's Hill</a> on June 17, 1775.<sup>1</sup> Over the next nine months, the men stationed at Prospect Hill sustained multiple attacks from the British cannons stationed on the north and west sides of Boston.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Communications between the Continental Army and British government were, at best, strained. By January 1, 1776, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/georgewashington.htm\">General George Washington</a> received a copy of a speech King George III gave to Parliament on October 26, 1775. During the speech, the King urged a quick end to the \"rebellion\" in the colonies.<sup>3</sup> Writing to Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Reed a few days later, Washington recalled:</p> <blockquote>We gave great Joy to them (the red Coats I mean) without knowing or intending it, for on that day, the day which gave being to the New Army (but before the Proclamation came to hand) we had hoisted the Union Flag in compliment to the United Colonies...<sup>4</sup></blockquote> <p>Initially intended to provide a moral boost to his soldiers, General Washington inadvertently caused some British soldiers to assume their enemies were surrendering. While there is some disagreement about what specific flag General Washington raised on Prospect Hill in 1776, most scholars believe that it was the Grand Union Flag.<sup>5</sup> Containing thirteen alternating stripes of red and white with a Union Jack in the canton, or upper corner, this flag is also considered the First Navy Ensign. By June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress authorized a new flag to replace the Grand Union.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Between November 1777 and October 1778, the Prospect Hill barracks served as a temporary prison for British prisoners-of-war captured after General John Burgoyne’s surrender at Saratoga, New York. Included in that group was Thomas Walker, a Black drummer with the 29<sup>th</sup> Regiment. Present at the skirmishes before the Boston Massacre seven years earlier, Walker remained one of only four men from the 29<sup>th</sup> Regiment still imprisoned. Thomas Walker would later die at the barracks in Lancaster, Pennsylvania on July 18, 1781.<sup>7</sup></p> <p>Though Prospect Hill played a significant role in the early months of the American Revolution, by the 1800s the land had multiple new uses. During the 1860s, Civil War regiments used the land as a training field and campsite. As Somerville grew in population, the land on Prospect Hill began to be subdivided into residential lots. By 1900, the city created a committee to build a monument to commemorate the actions that occurred on the hill during the 1770s. Designed in the style of an English castle and made of granite and surrounded by a public park, the completed structure opened to the public in October 1903 to great fanfare.<sup>8</sup></p> <p>Today, the city of Somerville continues the tradition began by General George Washington in 1776. Every January 1, the Grand Union Flag is once again hoisted to the top of Prospect Hill.</p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>“II.

While many sections are gone—either torn up or paved over—the surviving pieces provide a reminder for the extensive rail network at the Yard. This network transported materials from building to building and out to the dry docks and piers.</p> <p>For decades the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/charlestown-navy-yard.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard</a> had no railroad, particularly because railroads did not really exist when the US Navy established the Yard in 1800. There were roads made of rails, but these simple wooden or wrought iron “wagonways” and “plateways” found use primarily in mines or quarries. Trains of railcars were either pulled by animals or allowed to roll by gravity.</p> <p>The Navy first laid tracks down at the Charlestown Navy Yard in the 1860s, relying on animal-drawn railcars. By using these trains, workers could move bulk materials, such as coal, around the yard.</p> <p>With the advancement of locomotive and rail technology, by 1904 the Navy had overhauled the entire rail system of the Yard. Standard gauge railcars could now directly enter the Yard from anywhere in the country, delivering materials more quickly and reliably. Additionally, these gauge rails could also operate locomotive cranes that assisted workers in hoisting material and ship components. To meet the needs of this rail system, part of Building 105 turned into a maintenance shop for the Navy Yard’s railroad.</p> <p>While the use of these railroad tracks for steam locomotives proved successful, the Navy Yard switched to diesel locomotives in the mid-1900s. These locomotives promised more power, less maintenance, and cheaper operating costs. However, soon the Navy recognized that diesel trucks could also efficiently move loads around the Charlestown Navy Yard, without requiring infrastructure like the railroads. By the end of the 1950s, the Navy had made changes to the Yard to better accommodate truck traffic, making the need for the railroads obsolete.</p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/charlestown-navy-yard-railroad-tracks.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard: Railroad Tracks</a></p>",

    "audioDescription": "Robert Gould Shaw 54th Regiment Memorial is made of bronze and granite. The side of the Memorial facing Beacon Street consists of the bronze relief encased in a granite frame. On either side of the bronze is a column with scrolls at the top (an ionic column). The top granite frame of the monument is slightly arched. The bronze relief fits within this frame and depicts the soldiers of the 54th Regiment in full scale and in varying levels of relief, which means some men in the background are outlined in the bronze, while other men in the foreground are in high relief and 3-D. The color of the monument is dark brown and where the light shines on it, the metal is shiny. Each individual soldier is depicted in a very lifelike manner and is different from the soldier beside or in front of him. From left to right, there are multiple lines of men who are shown as if they are walking together in the background of the sculpture. Each man who is depicted is shown wearing the items of a Civil War soldier: boots, trousers that extend to their ankles, a circular canteen or water bottle attached to their belt at the hip, long sleeve jacket that extends to their wrists, a kepi or cap that sits on the top of their head. The soldiers are all carrying rifles that are braced on their right shoulders in the air. They also all have knapsacks on their backs with a bedroll or sleeping bag on the top of the knapsack and items inside of it. They have blank faces that stare straight ahead of them, portraying them as calm, determined, and stoic. In the highest relief on top of the soldiers is a full size depiction of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw riding a horse that is walking. Colonel Shaw is sitting in a saddle on the horse with his feet in the stirrups. He is wearing boots, long trousers, a long sleeve jacket, and kepi or cap. There is a bedroll located behind the saddle. His right arm is along his side and in his right hand Shaw carries a long sword which is pointed at a downward angel towards the ground. The horse is shown with wide opened eyes and his lips pulled back from his teeth as if to show fear. Above the men is an angel that is floating horizontally. She is part of the back wall of the Memorial, partly in high relief. She is traveling in the same direction as the men. She is dressed in a flowing gown that extends from her shoulders down her body. The dress has many folds and some of the dress is in low relief. The other side of the memorial is visible from the Boston Common. Stairs on either side of the memorial take visitors down to this side of the monument, or up to street level to see the bronze side of the Memorial. The side facing the Common is made out of granite and engraved with text. It is twice the height of the memorial with the top half being the back side of the bronze memorial and the bottom matching the height of the staircase. At the top of the memorial is an eagle with its wings outstretched so that it's body is facing the viewer in high relief. A large round wreath hangs around the eagle's neck so that the eagle's claws rest on the bottom of the wreath. The text \"The Fifty Fourth Regiment\" is engraved to the left of the eagle and \"of Massachusetts Infantry\" is engraved to the right. A ribbon is flows below the eagle. Immediately below the eagle is text recognizing the White officers and Black soldiers of the Regiment. Below this text are five rectangular stone slabs that are portrait oriented. The combination of the slabs is the full width of the memorial. On each slab is an engraved wreath. Below these slabs are stone blocks with engraved text. The title of the text states \"The Memory of the Just is Blessed\" and below are names of the soldiers engraved in the granite. Within the text are three sculpted heads of lions evenly spaced across the width of the memorial. They each have openings in their mouths to shoot water into the fountain on the ground in front of it. The fountain is a thin rectangle against the memorial with a half-circle extending an additional 4-5 feet away from the memorial.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Charlestown Navy Yard Ropewalk is an extraordinary granite building along the northern boundary of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/charlestown-navy-yard.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard</a>. Here, ropemakers manufactured all the rope needed by the US Navy for nearly 120 years.</p> <p>Since its establishment in 1794, the US Navy purchased rope from private American ropemakers. The Navy became concerned about the quality and cost of rope from private firms and decided to make its own rope. In 1833, the Navy persuaded the US Congress on the practicality of a single ropewalk supplying all the Navy's rope. A ship of sail at this time, such as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/uss-constitution.htm\">USS <em>Constitution</em></a>, needed more than 40 miles of rope.</p> <p>While people have made rope to help sail ships since the days of early Egypt and China, in the mid-1600s, ropemakers in the American colonies created outdoor spaces on straight and level ground that they called ropewalks.</p> <p>The length of a ropewalk determined the longest rope that could be made in it. Workers walked the length of a ropewalk as they twisted plant fibers into rope by hand. By the time the Navy decided to make its own rope, ropewalks were enclosed buildings, and steam engines mechanized many ropemaking tasks.</p> <p>The Navy asked architect Alexander Parris and machinist Daniel Treadwell to design and outfit the Charlestown Navy Yard Ropewalk. Parris was already employed by the Navy, starting in 1825. During twenty years of Navy service, Parris supervised the construction of seven granite structures in the Charlestown Navy Yard. Treadwell was a well-known builder of ropemaking machines.</p> <p>Based on their plans, the US Navy constructed the Ropewalk building: a quarter-mile long, one-and-two story granite building with a slate roof. The length of the Ropewalk equaled the height of the Empire State Building.</p> <p>The Ropewalk is 45 feet wide with walls that are two-feet thick. The thick walls made this Greek-Revival structure both formidable and fireproof. Similar to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/cny-dry-dock-1.htm\">Dry Dock 1</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bunker-hill-monument.htm\">Bunker Hill Monument</a>, builders transported granite for the Ropewalk from a nearby Quincy quarry. After two years of construction, the Ropewalk opened in 1837.</p> <p>The Charlestown Navy Yard Ropewalk made rope mostly from two plants, manila and hemp. Manila, a plant from the Philippines, was naturally water-resistant. On the other hand, workers had to coat the more widely-grown hemp with tar in the Tar House adjacent to the Ropewalk to waterproof the hemp.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/cny-ropemaking.htm\">The Charlestown Navy Yard Ropewalk conducted every phase of the ropemaking process starting with the plant fibers.</a> On the second floor of the Ropewalk, workers spun plant fibers into ribbon-like lengths called slivers. Machines twisted these slivers into yarn and then wound the yarn onto spools, or bobbins.</p> <p>Workers brought these bobbins of yarn to the first floor and placed them on an upright rack at one end of the Ropewalk. Then, workers tied together yarns from multiple bobbins to a twisting device on a moveable cart. As this cart moved on a track down the length of the Ropewalk, it pulled the yarns from the bobbins and twisted the yarns into a single strand. Here number of yarns determined the thickness of the strand. A similar process twisted strands into a finished rope (<em>see photo gallery below</em>).</p> <p>A rope's strength comes from the multiple and opposite twisting of its components: ropemakers twisted slivers clockwise to form yarns, then twisted yarns counter-clockwise to form strands. Finally, three strands were twisted together clockwise to form a typical rope. This twisting also prevented the rope from unravelling.</p> <p>The Ropewalk experienced its highest level of productivity during World War II (WWII). In 1942, the workers in the Ropewalk made 20 million pounds of rope. Being highly mechanized, the Ropewalk had a small fraction of the overall Yard employees.</p> <p>As Navy Yard workers entered the armed forces in WWII, the Navy hired women to take their place in the Charlestown Navy Yard. While women became 17% of the Yard's workforce, the proportion of women ropemakers was much higher (44%).</p> <p>The Navy Yard Ropewalk made rope for the US Navy from 1837 to 1971. Over the years, the Navy expanded the Ropewalk, replaced obsolete machines, and converted from steam engines to electric motors to operate ropemaking machines.</p> <p>After 1955, the Ropewalk no longer made all the rope for the US Navy. The Navy changed the mission of the Ropewalk to research and manufacture nylon rope, which had begun replacing plant fibers in ropemaking. All ropemaking activities ended in 1971 when the Navy closed the Ropewalk. The entire Charlestown Navy Yard, by then called the Boston Naval Shipyard, closed three years later. At this time, private firms began to supply the rope needs of the US Navy.</p> <p>When in operation, the Ropewalk was a place of noisy and difficult work, but people saw its whimsical side as well. Popular writer Henry W. Longfellow captured this in his poem \"The Ropewalk\" in 1854:</p> <blockquote>In that building, long and low,<br /> With its windows all a-row,<br /> Like the port-holes of a hulk,<br /> Human spiders spin and spin…</blockquote> <p>Later in the 1890s, the Yard managers built a tree-lined walkway along the southern length of the Ropewalk; it became known as \"Flirtation Walk,\" and it served as a popular promenade.</p> <p>The US government sold the Ropewalk building to a private company that converted it into residential housing in 2021. The National Park Service will manage a public exhibit on the history of the Charlestown Navy Yard Ropewalk within this housing complex. Some of the Ropewalk story is on display at the Charlestown Navy Yard Visitor Center in an exhibit called \"Serving the Naval Fleet.\"</p> <h2>Learn more...</h2> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/charlestown-navy-yard-ropewalk.htm\">Charlestown Navy Yard: Ropewalk </a> <h2>Sources Referenced</h2> <ul> <li>Bearss, Edwin C. <em>Historic Resource Study: Charlestown Navy Yard, 1800-1842, Volume I and Volume II</em>.

    "audioDescription": "The building has a wood-timber frame and rough Cape Ann granite block exterior with brick backing and is divided into three distinct sections. At the east end of the building is a three-story, five-bay-by-five-bay, Greek Revival-style head house. The head house has a slate shingle-clad, hip roof with a pediment over the center three bays on the east (facade) elevation. The center and west sections form the \"Laying Ground\" of the building. The center section is two stories tall and approximately 830 feet long with a slate shingle-clad gable roof. Skylights and cupolas are irregularly spaced along the length of the two-story section. The west section is one story tall and approximately 440 feet long with a slate shingle-clad gable roof. Window and door openings have been filled with modern plywood, brick, or concrete block. The primary entrance is recessed within a granite surround with a heavy lintel in the center of the east (facade) elevation of the head house. Loading bay doors flank the primary entrance and are also located intermittently on the north and south elevations of the entire building. A metal bridge connects the second story of the Ropewalk to Building 60 immediately to the south. Painted wood signs reading \"Ropewalk Bldg 58\" and \"Ropewalk 97\" are affixed to the facade and south elevations.

Other editors, contributors, and supporters included notable activists, such as: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/mary-livermore.htm\">Mary Livermore</a> (first editor), <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/julia-ward-howe.htm\">Julia Ward Howe</a> (contributor and early stakeholder), <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-lloyd-garrison.htm\">William Lloyd Garrison</a> (contributor), <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/thomas-w-higginson.htm\">Thomas Wentworth Higginson</a> (contributor and early stakeholder), Agnes Ryan (later editor and board member), <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/florence-luscomb.htm\">Florence Luscomb</a> (later stakeholder and \"peddler\" of the <em>Journal</em>), and others.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Since the publication's editors held leadership roles in the state, regional, and national organizations, the offices of the <em>Journal</em> often shared office spaces with other suffrage organizations. Its first offices occupied rooms at 3 Tremont Place; later office locations included 3 Park Street, 6 Beacon Street, and 585 Boylston Street.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>The final move to 585 Beacon Street resulted from the publication expanding its operations. Editor Agnes Ryan described how over the course a few years, the <em>Journal </em>went from a staff of three to a staff of 24 people and about 10 departments. She noted the excitement of working in the office, recalling an occurence after the 1915 failed state referendums on women's suffrage:</p> <blockquote>We find working in the <em>Woman’s Journal</em> office year after year is in some ways like living in a fairy story. We never know what is going to happen next. The day after election – and defeat in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Jersey—a woman came to the <em>Journal </em>office bearing a check for $1,000 in her hand and saying in substance. ‘Here is a small check to cheer Miss Blackwell and the <em>Journal </em>in the face of yesterday’s defeats at the polls.’ Here is an example of the way suffragists feel toward the <em>Woman’s Journal</em>. To them it symbolizes the cause.<sup>4</sup></blockquote> <p>The <em>Woman’s Journal</em> ran until 1917, when it joined with other suffrage publications to become <em>The Woman Citizen</em>, published in New York.<sup>5</sup></p> <h2>Footnotes:</h2> <ol> <li>\"The Woman’s Journal,\" <em>The Woman’s Journal</em>, January 8, 1870, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, <a href=\"https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:48852545$5i\">https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:48852545$5i</a>.</li> <li>Barbara Berenson, <em>Massachusetts in the Woman Suffrage Movement</em> (Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press, 2018); Agnes E.

MWSA originated as a stand-alone organization that worked closely with regional and national organizations. By the 1880s, towns and neighborhoods across Massachusetts created smaller branches that reported to the main organization in Boston.<sup>1</sup> First headquartered at 3 Tremont Place, the MWSA offices moved several times throughout its long history; later office locations include 3 Park Street, 6 Marlborough Street, and 585 Boylston Street.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>MWSA members used a variety of tactics to garner support for the suffrage cause, from petitioning the state legislature and speaking at hearings to creating broadsides and holding lectures. Its early efforts led to the success of women gaining the right to vote in school committee elections in 1879.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>By the early 1900s, the MWSA stood as one of the largest state organizations in the country. New leaders shifted the organization’s tactics to more public and direct action, such as outdoor rallies and suffrage parades.<sup>4</sup> One of these actions included \"Suffrage Bluebird Day\" in 1915, during which suffragists posted thousands of metal bluebirds on fences, trees, and public spaces in towns and cities across the state to gain support for their cause.<sup>5</sup></p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/22bff295-5e9e-455c-b400-5a83c54e0178\"><img alt=\"A suffrage bluebird that reads votes for women nov. 2\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/22bff295-5e9e-455c-b400-5a83c54e0178/thumbxlarge.png?\" style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 20%;\" /></a> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Suffrage Bluebird, MWSA's symbol in 1915.

    "bodyText": "<p>The 1901 Boston Equal Suffrage Association for Good Government (BESAGG) originated as a civic organization dedicated to social reform. While interested in a variety of social issues, BESAGG soon shifted its primary goals to focus on women’s full enfranchisement and civic education, believing reforms would more likely occur if women had the ballot.<sup>1</sup> Its founders included the talented local suffragists Pauline Agassiz Shaw, Maud Wood Park, and Mary Hutcheson Page. Though of different generations, these three women brought a renewed strength to the suffrage movement in Massachusetts.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>BESAGG represented a new generation of women interested in progressive reform and women’s rights. Called New England’s “most innovative woman suffrage group” by historian Sharon Hartman Strom, leaders looked to the tactics of English militant suffragettes for inspiration.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Leaders of BESAGG encouraged taking the suffrage cause directly to the people through open-air meetings and rallies. The organization strove to maintain a highly visible presence in the landscape of Boston, establishing its popular <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sunflower-lunchroom.htm\">Sunflower Lunchroom</a> on Cornhill and later Tremont Street, as well as its <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/votes-for-women-shop.htm\">Votes for Women Shop</a>. Members also sought support among a wider variety of women, including those of different class, racial, ethnic, or religious backgrounds.<sup>4</sup> With its more aggressive campaigning, BESAGG helped regenerate support for the suffrage movement in twentieth-century Boston.</p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/bbca9c33-af79-4d07-9117-7cbda4a10a7a\"><img alt=\"Gold Banner that reads Boston Equal Suffrage Association for Good Government founded 1901 by Pauline Agassiz Shaw.\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/bbca9c33-af79-4d07-9117-7cbda4a10a7a/proxylores.jpg?\" style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 40%;\" /></a> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Banner for BESAGG.

    "bodyText": "<p>Founded by Radcliffe alumnae Maud Wood Park and Inez Haynes Irwin in 1900, the College Equal Suffrage League (CESL) targeted the support of local college women and alumnae in the suffrage fight. While the CESL originated in Boston, suffragists quickly began establishing leagues throughout Massachusetts and across the country. In 1908, Maud Wood Park helped form a national organizational structure for CESL, headquartered in New York.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>The CESL reflected the founders’ belief in recognizing the work of the early women’s rights activists who fought for women to obtain higher education; she insisted it was college women’s obligation to carry on the fight of their foremothers.<sup>2</sup> Park believed these college leagues would help revitalize the movement and encourage the involvement of younger women who considered the established suffrage organizations outdated.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>The CESL used an educational strategy to bring the suffrage question to campuses. Members organized meetings to introduce women’s suffrage to students, held debates to encourage discussion, and circulated flyers and publications to spread suffrage information.<sup>4</sup> Members of the Boston CESL and other Massachusetts chapters also undertook active campaigning, particularly during the campaign for the 1915 suffrage referendum.<sup>5</sup></p> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/8bb68c9a-78db-4500-8c65-e409e13566ee\"><img alt=\"Gold Banner for the College Equal Suffrage League.\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/8bb68c9a-78db-4500-8c65-e409e13566ee/proxylores.jpg?\" style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 40%;\" /></a> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Banner for the College Equal Suffrage League.

Suffragists first adopted the sunflower as a suffrage symbol for a Kansas suffrage campaign in 1867, and it soon became a national symbol of the suffrage movement. BESAGG's Sunflower Lunchroom was originally located at this address on Cornhill, before moving to 167 Tremont Street. According to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-woman-s-journal-office.htm\"><em>The Woman's Journal</em></a>, the Sunflower Lunch had one of the best 25 cent fixed-course lunches in the city.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>In addition to offering meals, the Lunch room also served as a space for suffragists and other women’s groups to meet. For example, in 1916, BESAGG held a series of lectures from members of various women’s groups.<sup>2</sup></p> <a href=\"hhttps://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/74178d0d-3642-4397-8f7a-641a2eb1c975\"><img alt=\"Printed Menu of the Sunflower Lunch.\" src=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/74178d0d-3642-4397-8f7a-641a2eb1c975/proxylores.jpg?\" style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%;\" /></a> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Sunflower Lunch had a variety of options for diners.

Nearby, the engine telegram levers link with the engineering department, telephones connect throughout the ship, and a deck on the outside enables the Commanding Officer or the Officer of the Deck designated when the Commanding Officer is elsewhere on the ship to take in everything on the deck and on the horizon. But nothing happens in this position of navigation and command without the rest of the entire crew.</p> <p>The most illustrative example involves the engines on the ship. Moving the telegram in the Bridge to signal full speed only changes dials in the ship's two boiler rooms and engine rooms. Nothing is “automatic.” When the requested speed changes, the crews in all four chambers below decks have to coordinate how to create more steam and channel it from the boilers to the turbines to generate more thrust from the propellers at the far back of the ship. This could take some time to build up steam, and likewise, once moving, it takes a good distance to slow down and stop. This means the crew on watch on the bridge constantly monitors speed and heading. They have to constantly look out for obstacles and coordinate with other ships their movements.</p> </div>",

This is established by military rank and tradition. Traditionally, commissioned officers have their own sleeping, living, and dining spaces separate from the rest of the crew. Here in the wardroom, you stand at the center of the commissioned officers' living space. Serving as the living room, dining room, conference room, courtroom, and formal ceremonial hall, it was the the most open and comfortable space on the ship. Nevertheless, enlisted seamen could serve on this ship for a year and never see this room.</p> <p>As a privilege of rank, the officers had stewards assigned to the wardroom to prepare and serve their meals out of the nearby pantry. The food, however, was paid for by the officers themselves. Just below this deck are the officers' staterooms. Smaller than most college dormitories, officers still had to share the stateroom with one or two other officers.</p> <p>Yet even tradition yields to the mission of a ship to serve the fleet and the nation. If you look above the wardroom table, a surgical lamp hangs overhead. In time of need, this room served as the primary casualty station and the ship' operating room. In one emergency in particular during 1944, the ship's doctor and his chief pharmacist' mate performed an appendectomy right on this table.</p> </div>",

    "audioDescription": "The USS CASSIN YOUNG is a grey steel hulled Fletcher-class destroyer. It measures 376 feet in length and 40 feet in width. Block letters on bow read 793, as the designation of the USS CASSIN YOUNG is DD-793. This destroyer has a flush deck, meaning it has an unbroken deck from bow to stern (from the front to back). The beam is 40 feet tall and is located a third of the way from the bow of the ship. On the top of the beam are two rectangular radars, one being an SC Radar. In front of the beam is a raised steel structure that is about half the height of the beam. Here is where the bridge is located on the ship, which serves as its' command center. Behind the beam are two steel smokestacks. They are cylindrical in shape with most of the body being grey steel and the top being black. The smokestacks are positioned one behind the other. Visible on the deck are several weapons. There are five 5-inch/38 caliber guns. The gun mounts are box-shaped with the top of the box curving from the back to the front, where the barrel of the gun is located. On the bow are two 5-inch/38 caliber guns, the forward one positioned on the deck and the one behind it slightly raised so that the barrel points over the forward gun. Both guns are pointing straight ahead towards the bow. Three additional 5-inch/38 caliber guns are located on the back half of the ship. One is a third of the way from the stern and points towards the aft (back) smokestack. The final two 5-inch/38 caliber guns are positioned similarly to the two on the front of the ship, the one in the very back is on the fantail and the other in front of it is slightly raised, and they both point directly towards the stern of the ship. Also located on the fantail is a 20 mm gun that is grey steel with a black barrel. On the far side of the fan tail are located a number of cylindrical depth charges, anti-submarine weapons. In between the smokestacks are two quad-40mm guns. Each of these guns have grey steel mount and four black barrels. Each points out over either side of the ship. Sometimes for special occasions and in the spring/summer season, the USS CASSIN YOUNG is decorated with colorful signal flags. Each signal flag uses a colorful design to symbolize letters and indicate a message. They are hung from a rope that is connected from the bow of the ship to the beam, over the smokestacks and to the stern of the ship. Visitors can board and disembark the USS CASSIN YOUNG by climbing a set of stairs and walking along a gangway.",

    "audioDescription": "The USS Constitution has three masts that are located at the front (bow), center (amidships), and back (stern) of the vessel. The mast at the front of the ship is the Foremast. The second mast is the Mainmast and the third mast at the rear is the Mizzenmast. Each of these masts are painted white and are very tall. In the winter, only the lower masts are visible and in place. In the summer, the middle and top sections of the mast are generally installed. Also when fully rigged, extending at regular intervals from each of the masts, are yards. They are pieces of horizontal wood from which the sails are set. Each mast has four yards, for a total of twelve on the ship. These yards begin about thirty feet off of the deck of the ship. There are lines, or rope, extending from the top of each mast down to the deck and also down to either the bow or the stern. This makes the ship look slightly like an organized, but messy knot of yarn. There are also shrouds, or ropes, tied into netting that run from the side of the ship's hull (gunnels) to the top of each mast segment. Crewmembers climb these nets to gain access to fighting top platforms on the masts. The bow, or front of the ship, has a few items on it. From the water surface and up about three feet, it has white numbers painted onto it. These numbers help determine the depth of the water below the ship. They go up to 24. Above that, extending from the hull and up the bow, there is a decorative black and white scroll. This is located in the place where a ship’s figurehead, a carved wooden decoration, would be. Above that, are the bowsprit, boom, and jib which extend about twenty feet from the main ship’s body at a forty five degree angle. These items are thinner than the masts but are what a number of the lines from the Foremast are attached to. The broadsides of the vessel are painted dark navy blue except for a white stripe running down the length of either side, one deck below the main deck. This marks the gun deck, and protruding from 15 square hatches are the muzzles of gun tubes sticking out. Red tampions with black stars are typically placed in the muzzles at all times. The stern of the ship has two bay like windows protruding out on either side and wrapping around the stern. During the day, after 8 am and before sunset, the ship's jack is flown at the bow, typically a 13 red and white striped flag with an elongated rattlesnake stretched from the lower left to the upper right corners. Below this snake are the words \"DONT TREAD ON ME\". At the stern flies the ship's ensign. typically the national flag of the United States, however on special occasions she flies a 15 star flag appropriate to the 1812 period. The crew alternate when the ship's bow and stern face toward the short. Visitors access the ship via one gangway on one side of the ship, and generally debark from the opposite gangway.",

    "audioDescription": "The USS Constitution Museum consists of two buildings. The first is a grey granite stone square building that is three stories tall. All windows on this structure are rectangular with a 4 by 6 window pane grid pattern. The longest side of the rectangular structure is the façade and back of the building (the South-West and North-East sides). The entrance side of the building faces South-West, and visitors can see the entrance as they walk into the Navy Yard from the Gate 1 entrance. The first floor of the façade has a red double door directly in the center that serves as the entrance to the building to the public. Directly above this door is a black sign that spans the width of the door. Painted in yellow is \"Museum Store.\" Centered above this sign is a much longer sign that is about the length of a third of the building. It is also black with yellow writing that states \"USS Constitution Museum.\" On either side of this text within the sign is a small five-pointed star. On the ground floor at the far left side of the building is the beginning of a ramp that travels parallel to the building up to the entrance. Directly in front of the red entrance doors is a set of four stairs with handrails on either side. To the right of the red entrance doors is a row of three windows. To the right of these windows is a white door with three steps leading up to it, and then a final window to the right. To the left of the red door are two windows. To the left of these windows is a white double door with a final window to the left. The second and third floor of the façade consist of 10 windows across. A granite rectangular stone between the two middle windows on the third floor is painted black with 22 painted white within it. This identifies the building as Building 22 at the Navy Yard. Occasionally, some of the windows on the first floor of the museum are decorated with red, white, and blue pleated fan bunting. The North-West and South-East sides of the building also have 10 windows on each floor. On the North-West side of the building between the second and third floors is a black sign with yellow writing that states \"USS Constitution Museum.\" The roof of the building is slightly slanted with brown/grey shingles. The edge of the roof slightly extends beyond the building. A second red-brick building is connected to this first building by a 50 feet long corridor from the North-East side of the first building. This second building has an A-frame structure, is two-floors, and is rectangular in shape with the longest sides being those on the North-East side and South-West side. The windows on this building are also rectangular and are 4-glass paned windows. The longest sides have 10 windows across on the second floor and 5 windows and one door on the bottom floor. On the shorter side of the building that faces North-East there is a white double door with a window on either side. The second floor has three windows across with a half-moon window above the center window. A black painted sign \"USS Constitution Museum\" in yellow paint is between the center window and the half-moon window.",

    "bodyText": "<p>A peninsula that extends into Hingham Bay, Webb Memorial State Park offers visitors beautiful scenes of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/boston-harbor.htm\">Harbor</a>, trails to enjoy, and picnic areas to gather.</p> <p>The peninsula provided an abundance of natural resources for original local Indigenous communities in the area. European occupation of the peninsula resulted in most of the area being converted into agricultural farmland.</p> <p>This peninsula played a role in the 1775 skirmish known as the Battle of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/grape-island.htm\">Grape Island</a>. During the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/siege-of-boston-map.htm\">Siege of Boston</a>, British forces searched for resources in the islands, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/grape-island.htm\">Grape Island</a>. From this location, townspeople of Weymouth and the local militia saw British soldiers taking hay from Grape Island on May 21, 1775. Sounding the alarm, local colonial forces initially fired upon the British before taking boats to the island and driving the British away.<sup>1</sup> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abigail-adams.htm\">Abigail Adams</a>, living in the area, recalled the event to her husband, John Adams: </p> <blockquote>You inquire of me who were at the engagement at Grape Island. I may say with truth all of Weymouth, Braintree, Hingham, who were able to bear arms, and hundreds from other towns within twenty, thirty, and forty miles of Weymouth. Both your brothers were there; your younger brother, with his company, who gained honor by their good order that day. He was one of the first to venture on board a schooner, to land upon the island.<sup>2</sup></blockquote> <p>A memorial in Webb Memorial State Park commemorates this event, reading:</p> <blockquote>Grape Island Alarm: Sunday May 21, 1775<br /> From this Site Weymouth militiamen repulsed an attempt by the British to secure supplies from Grape Island for General Howe’s Beleaguered Army in Boston</blockquote> <p>The Bradley family owned most of the peninsula during the 1800s. In 1872, they converted a portion of their land into a manufacturing plant for the Bradley Fertilizer Company.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>In the mid-1950s, the US Army temporarily installed NIKE-Ajax missiles at the tip of the peninsula.<sup>4</sup> The military then transferred land ownership to the State of Massachusetts in 1977. Webb Memorial State Park opened in 1980, named after former Weymouth police captain and selectman William K. Webb.<sup>5</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-webb.htm\">Island Facts: Webb Memorial State Park - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes</h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>, <em><a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\">Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 30, 76; Snow, <em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Islands_of_Boston_Harbor/-oNCNoMuwjgC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover\">The Islands of Boston Harbor</a></em>, 161; Richard Frothingham, <em>History of the Siege of Boston</em> (Boston: C.

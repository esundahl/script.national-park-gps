The memorial is located sixty feet to the east set beside a circular pool area and surrounded by benches. <br />The sculpture consists of three bronze figures. In the center is a boy wearing a uniform, neckerchief, and garrison hat stepping forward and carrying a walking stick in his left hand. To his right side is a male figure, nearly nude, who carries a bundle of leaves and drapery in his left arm. Part of the drapery blows across his middle as he strides forward with his right leg. To the boy's left is a female figure who holds a torch in her left hand that has a gold-colored flame. Her left hand extends slightly, her palm is facing upward, and she strides forward on her right leg. <br />The boy stands about five feet tall, the man eight feet, and the woman about seven feet. They are set on a five-foot-tall hexagonal-shaped pink granite base that measures eight feet wide and seven feet long. <br />A panel on the west side of the pedestal features an inscription, around a beaded bronze border that reads: <br />On my honor I <br />Will do my best <br />To do my duty <br />To God & my <br />Country and to obey the <br />Scout law to <br />Help other people <br />At all times <br />To keep myself <br />Physically strong <br />Mentally awake <br />And morally <br />Straight <br />Another inscription on the ground at the statue base describes the memorial.<br />The statues stand at the north end of a one hundred sixty-five feet circumference round pink granite plaza area. To the west of the statues is a fifty-foot long, twenty-five-foot wide two-foot deep pool area. Eleven benches line the edge of the plaza, and six trees sit in the grass area around the memorial. At the end of each bench is a three-inch bronze emblem of a shield of the American flag across a bald eagle and set atop a trefoil background. <br />An inscription around the edge of the pool reads: <br />In grateful tribute to the men and women whose generosity, devotion, and leadership have brought Scouting to the nation's youth and to honor all members of the Boy Scouts of America who in days of peace and times of peril have done their duty to God and their country this memorial was authorized by the Congress of the United States and erected in recognition of the fiftieth anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION <br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>Mystery has surrounded Archibald Butt and Francis Millet ever since their tragic death aboard the RMSÂ <em>Titanic</em>Â on April 15, 1912. Believed to be the only officials of the United States who perished aboard the ship, Congress passed a joint resolution soon after their death authorizing the construction of a memorial in their honor.</p> <p>Sculpted by Daniel Chester French, the Butt-Millet Memorial Fountain was the first memorial built on the Ellipse. Both the design and location of the memorial fountain were carefully chosen to represent the two close friends.</p> <p>Both men were widely known in Washington's cultural, social, and political circles. Millet was a painter and a member of the Fine Arts Commission. He also directed the American Academy in Rome, Italy. Major Butt had been a military aide to both President Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. The fountain is not far from where Major Butt's White House office was located. The military figure with sword and shield represents Major Butt, and the artist with palette and brush represents Mr. Millet. Besides being a memorial, the fountain was designed to double as a water fountain for the horses ridden by U.S. Park Police while on patrol.</p> <p>Some historians have asserted that Butt and Millet were involved in a romantic relationship. Millet and Butt were close friends and housemates, often attending social gatherings and parties together. The two had vacationed in Europe together and were returning home to the United States aboard theÂ <em>Titanic</em>. Buttâs eulogy in theÂ <em>Washington Times</em>Â recalled that, âthe two men had a sympathy of mind which was most unusual.â Noting that Butt was, âmourned by Washingtonians of all walks of life,â the article claimed, âNone could help admiring either man.â<br /> <br /> Memorial authorized 1912 (37 Stat. 644), dedicated 1913<br /> <br /> Sculptor: Daniel Chester French<br /> <br /> Inscriptions<br /> In memory of Francis Davis Millet 1846-1912 and Archibald Willingham Butt 1865-1912. This monument has been erected by their friends with the sanction of Congress.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Butt-Millet Memorial Fountain<br />(270 words) <br />The Butt-Millet Memorial Fountain is located at the north edge of The Ellipse, on the south side of E Street, NW between 15th and 17th streets, about 300 feet west of the National Christmas Tree, and just south of the White House. Facing north, the fountain sits between the sidewalk and E street. <br />The Butt-Millet Memorial Fountain stands twelve feet high. An octagonal light brown granite base supports an eight-foot-wide bowl of golden-brown marble. A grey granite column of about seven feet rises from the center of the bowl. <br />Two figures in low bas-relief are depicted, one on the north and one on the south side of the column. The northern figure of a woman with paint brush in her right hand and palette across her chest with her left hand. She looks off slightly to her left. The southern figure is of a man in armor and helmet, holding a shield. Four globes in the bowl surround the granite column and emit water, which cascades over the edge of the bowl into a shallow receptacle in the light brown granite base. Pairs of rosette engravings surround the lower eight sides of the pedestal base.<br />A three-foot wide, forty-foot long walkway of one-foot square light grey stone blocks leads from the sidewalk at a northeast angle to the fountain. The stone pattern continues in a circle around the base of the fountain.<br />A three-inch tall inscription around the lip of the bowl reads: <br />In memory of Francis Davis Millet 1846-1912 and Archibald Willingham Butt 1865-1912.

Located near the White House at the northwestern corner of Lafayette Square,Â Decatur commissionedÂ the house asÂ hisÂ familyâs Washington residenceÂ where he entertained friends andÂ dignitaries. After DecaturâsÂ deathÂ in a duel inÂ 1820, the property temporarilyÂ housed severalÂ prominent Washington statesmen including Senator Henry Clay and future-president Martin Van Buren.Â During the 19thÂ century, theÂ Decatur HouseÂ served asÂ a social center for Washingtonâs elite and as a residence for manyÂ prominentÂ Washington politicians and foreign envoys.Â Â <br /> <br /> Born in 1779 on Marylandâs Eastern ShoreÂ in a small fishing town, Stephen Decatur was the son of a merchant seaman who fought the British and French NaviesÂ during the Revolutionary War. As a teenager, Decatur joined the fledgling American Navy and distinguished himselfÂ as an able fighter and skilled seamanÂ in the Quasi-War (1798-1800) with the French Republic. After being promoted to the rank of lieutenant, Decatur battled the Barbary Pirates in North Africa and successfullyÂ raided Tripoli HarborÂ in 1804. His actions in the southern Mediterranean won Decatur international fame and earned him the captaincy of theÂ USS <em>Philadelphia</em>Â at the age of twenty-five. During the War of 1812, Decatur was further promotedÂ to the rank of Commodore and won glory afterÂ theÂ capture of the British WarshipÂ HMS<em> Macedonian</em>Â off the coast of the Azores.Â Â <br /> <br /> With money acquired from his capture of the British frigateÂ <em>Macedonian</em>, Decatur and his wife, Susan Wheeler Decatur, commissioned famed architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe to design an elegant three-story,Â Federal-styleÂ brick mansionÂ at the northwest corner ofÂ Lafayette Square near the White House in Washington D.C.Â Latrobe, whoÂ designed nearby St. Johnâs Episcopal Church and the White HouseÂ portico, was instructed by the Decaturâs to create a luxuriousÂ privateÂ residence âfit for entertaining.â Latrobeâs design included spacious double-drawing rooms that allowed theÂ familyÂ to host balls and other social gatherings attended by Washingtonâs political elite and European dignitaries. Commodore Decatur had lived in the house for only fourteen months when he was killed in a duel with Commodore JamesÂ BarronÂ in March of 1820Â after Decatur publicly criticized Barronâs capture by BritishÂ forcesÂ in 1807.Â <br /> <br /> After her husbandâs death, Sarah Decatur relocated to Georgetown and rented theÂ house to a series of foreign diplomats.Â During this period,Â Decatur House became the unofficial residence of theÂ U.S.Â Secretaries of State including Henry Clay, Martin Van Buren, and Edward Livingston who successively occupied the property between 1827 and 1833.Â After becoming heavily indebted, Susan Decatur sold Decatur House to John GadsbyÂ in 1836, a prominent Washington area hotelier.Â Gadsby purchased the Decatur House as a retirement home for him and his family and moved ten enslaved individuals from his National Hotel to reside and work at the property. After Gadsbyâs death in 1844, his wife, Providence, leased the property for twelve yearsÂ during which time it was occupied by Vice President George M. Dallas and Senator Judah P. Benjamin. In 1871, the Decatur House was purchased by CaliforniaÂ statesmanÂ Edward Beale whose family owned the property until 1952Â when it was donated to the National Trust for Historic Preservation.Â The Decatur House served as one of the first headquarters of the National Trust and as the Trustâs first house museum property.Â In 1967,Â the property was designated a National Historic Landmark andÂ becameÂ a public museum.Â The property is currently leased to the White House Historical Association.<br /> <br /> Generations of enslaved families livedÂ and worked at theÂ Decatur House prior to Emancipation. The quarters where the enslaved workers livedÂ still stands today as a rare example ofÂ an extantÂ urban slave dwelling in the nationâs capital.Â Many of the prominent American politiciansÂ living at Decatur HouseÂ enslaved people who residedÂ and worked atÂ the property. One enslaved resident, Charlotte Dupuy sued herÂ owner, noted politician and statesman Henry Clay, for her freedom triggering a lengthy legal battle that eventually resulted in her emancipation in 1840. Throughout his ownership of the Decatur House, John Gadsby purchased and sold many slaves, often from outside of Washington D.C.Â with the explicit intent to sever family connections. Gadsby owned several enslaved individuals that worked at the Decatur House and were housed in the two-story structure facing H Street.<br /> <br /> The Decatur House isÂ both anÂ architectural landmarkÂ andÂ aÂ historical landmarkÂ as the first private residence inÂ the neighborhood of the White House and as one of the fewÂ remainingÂ residential designs of renowned Architect of the Capital Benjamin Henry Latrobe. Throughout its two-hundred years ofÂ existence, theÂ Decatur House has been the residence of many influential American politicians andÂ militaryÂ figures of the 19thÂ century and a site of enslavement for generations of African Americans.Â Through the legacy of the individuals that resided and worked there and through its architectural expression, the Decatur House remainsÂ aÂ symbol of the United StatesâÂ growingÂ political and culturalÂ ambitions during the 19thÂ century.Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{3a9e30b2-99e3-4ffe-800a-df461f381c0b}{248}\" paraid=\"2013037136\"><br /> <u>Sources:</u>Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{3a9e30b2-99e3-4ffe-800a-df461f381c0b}{254}\" paraid=\"1195789854\">Allison, Robert J.Â Â <br /> 2005Â Stephen Decatur: American Naval Hero, 1779-1820,Â University of Massachusetts Press, Boston, MAÂ </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{19}\" paraid=\"558016836\">De Kay, James T.Â Â <br /> 2004Â A Rage for Glory: The Life of Commodore Stephen Decatur,Â Free Press Publishers, New York, NYÂ </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{39}\" paraid=\"480689417\">Long, David F.Â Â <br /> 1979Â William Bainbridge and the Barron-Decatur Duel: Mere Participant or Active Plotter?,Â The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 103, No. 1Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{59}\" paraid=\"214562037\">National Park Service,Â <br /> American Federation of Labor Building NationalÂ Register of Historic Places Inventory- Nomination Form,Â National Park Service, Department of LaborÂ Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{79}\" paraid=\"1203683834\">White House HistoricalÂ AssociationÂ <br /> The Historic Decatur House,Â White HouseÂ AssociationÂ Website,Â <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/the-historic-decatur-house\">https://www.whitehousehistory.org/the-historic-decatur-house</a></p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{116}\" paraid=\"1655579538\">White House HistoricalÂ AssociationÂ <br /> Commodore Stephen Decatur: An Early American Naval War Hero,Â White House Association Website,Â <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/commodore-stephen-decatur-an-early-american-naval-war-hero\">https://www.whitehousehistory.org/commodore-stephen-decatur-an-early-american-naval-war-hero</a></p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{143}\" paraid=\"1539173108\">White House Historical AssociationÂ Â <br /> Slavery in the Presidentâs Neighborhood Press Collection,Â White House Historical Association Press Collection,Â <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/press-room/press-collections/slavery-in-the-presidents-neighborhood-press-collection\">https://www.whitehousehistory.org/press-room/press-collections/slavery-in-the-presidents-neighborhood-press-collection</a><br /> Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{166}\" paraid=\"1746462312\"><a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/117691809\">NHL Nomination</a>Â Â <br /> Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{175}\" paraid=\"508302343\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nhl/index.htm\">National Historic Landmarks (NHLs)</a>â¯are historic places that possess exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States.

    "bodyText": "This memorial proclaims the heroism of the soldiers of the First Division of the American Expeditionary Forces who gave their lives during World War I. The monument was dedicated by President Calvin Coolidge on October 4, 1924. Additions to the memorial were made in 1957 to honor the dead from World War II and in 1977 to honor those who died in the Vietnam War. The most recent addition, dedicated in 1995, commemorates those who died during Desert Storm in 1991. The symbol of the First Division is \"the Big Red One.\" A bed of red flowers in front of the memorial spells out a huge numeral one from spring to fall. The symbol is modeled after the \"big red one\" in the center of the division's patch. This pink Milford granite column from Massachusetts is one of the largest pieces ever taken from a quarry in the United States. Standing atop the sphere is a 15-foot-tall, gilded bronze figure of Victory. She is supported by wings, suggesting the perfection of body and soul. In her right hand she carries a flag, while her left extends in a blessing of the dead.<br /> <br /> General John Pershing, commander of U.S. troops in WWI, was particularly proud of the First Division, which came to be known as \"Pershing's Own.\"The soldiers of the First Division were the first American troops to arrive in France in 1917 and the last to leave Europe in September 1919. When the war was over, many wanted to honor the service and sacrifice of these men with the First Division Monument, an impressive pedestal listing the names of 5,516 First Division soldiers who gave their lives. Pershing said of the division that it had \"a special pride of service and a high state of morale never broken by hardship nor battle,\" a quote inscribed on the pedestal of the monument.<br /> <br /> More than 6,000 veterans and guests gathered to dedicate the First Division Monument on October 4, 1924. Major General Summerall served as grand marshal and spoke movingly of the spirit of the First Division. President Coolidge gave the dedication address and the ceremonies concluded with a benediction followed by the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" played by the massed bands of the First Division.<br /> <br /> The First Division Monument was highly praised for both its design and its mission. For many years it was the only memorial in Washington dedicated to the soldiers of World War I.

    "audioDescription": "(538 words) <br />The First Division Monument sits on an elevated plaza in President's Park, west of the White House and south of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the corner of 17th street NW and State Place, NW. 17th street is to the west and E street NW is to the south. <br />Facing north from the sidewalk on E street, a grass lawn of about two hundred sixty feet runs up to the base of the monument. Red tulips are planted in the shape of a huge number one, about fifty feet wide at its base and two hundred feet long, south to north from the sidewalk to the memorial. <br />Three-foot tall black metal posts joined by chain links line the sidewalk. Access to the monument is very limited, beyond viewing from the sidewalk. A stone walkway leads from the right side of the lawn and bends around to the front of the memorial. <br />Thirty feet of lawn separates the walkway from ten, fifty-foot wide steps that lead up to the memorial plaza area. <br />At the top of the stairs, a thirty-five-foot tall round pink granite column sits atop a three-foot high square base of white granite in the center of the plaza. Three feet of cobblestone walkway surrounds the base of the memorial. <br />A fifteen-foot tall, gilded bronze, winged goddess in helmet and chest plate stands on a gold sphere atop the memorial column. She holds a flag above her head in her right hand. Her left arm is extended outward with palm open and facing downward. The monument's height from ground to top is seventy-eight feet. <br />Engravings of a saber and wreath surround the base of the column, along with text that reads:<br />Erected by the Memorial Association of the First Division and patriotic friends to the memory of the dead of the division who gave their lives in the World War that the liberty and the ideals of our country might endure. <br />Campaign names and dates follow this text.<br />A ring round the bottom of the column is engraved to read: <br />First Division United States Army American Expeditionary Forces June 1917 September 1919 <br />Atop a two-foot high and three-foot deep ledge along each side of the memorial base is an eight by three-foot bronze plaque featuring hundreds of names. The top of front plaque, on the south side of the column, reads: <br />The Names of Our Immortal Dead are Here Enshrined <br />Six other similar-sized bronze plaques lay atop a three-foot high granite border that surrounds the plaza area. <br />Inscriptions are also carved into the two-foot wide granite plaza floor around the memorial base, which list division names and train companies. <br />A four by three-foot bronze plaque laid into the plaza floor at the base of the memorial reads:<br />First-Infantry Division - United States Army<br />World War Two<br />A list of the organic units follows this text.<br />Along the eastern side of the memorial column is a one hundred-foot long, fifty-foot wide garden of red tulips. A bronze plaque at the far east end of the garden reads:<br />To the Soldiers of the First Infantry Division (MECH)<br />Who Made the Supreme Sacrifice in<br />Desert Storm (Iraq and Saudi Arabia) 1991 <br />A list of names follows this text.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

His right hand is open and outstretched and left foot set slightly forward. <br />Lafayette stands atop an ornate, carved marble pedestal approximately twenty-five feet in height, and surrounded by seven additional bronze sculptures at its base. <br />In the front is a seated, half-naked woman stretching her arm forth to hand Lafayette a sword above. Inscribed on the pedestal above her inside an ornate design featuring a menacing-looking lion face, reads: <br />TO GENERAL LAFAYETTE AND HIS COMPATRIOTS<br />1777-1783 <br />An inscription on the bottom left front corner of the pedestal reads: <br />ALEXANDER FALGUIERE<br />ANTONIN MERCH<br />STATUAIRES <br />PAUL PUJOL<br />ARCHITECTE <br />On the opposite side are two cherubs. Their bodies face the pedestal, but their heads turn back and they rest their outer hands on the lower part of an inscription above them, which reads: <br />By the Congress, in commemoration of the services rendered by General Lafayette and his compatriots during the struggle for the independence of the United States of America. <br />To Lafayette's left are two men in curled wigs, military uniform with sashes and long boots. They are turned to each other as if in conversation. The man on the left has his right hand raised while the right man rests his left hand on his sword handle. <br />The right side also features two men in curled wigs, military long coats and boots. These two appear to be walking in stride. The man on the left has his left arm wrapped around the shoulder of the man to his right. A shield sits on the ground at the feet of the man to the right. Inscribed along the edge of the shield is: <br />MAURICE DENONVILLIERS FONDEUR<br />PARIS 1890 <br />The statue rests on a twenty-five-foot wide circular granite base surrounded by a one hundred seventy-foot circumference grass lawn. <br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

The building serves as the headquarters of the Treasury Department. Treasury's responsibilities encompass revenue collection, money production, accounting, and economic policy formulation. Treasury's architectural significance and the department's role in America's economic history rank the building among Washington's most important landmarks. <br />Like the White House, Treasury has been in its original site since 1800. From 1836 to 1869, the present building was constructed by notable American architects. Following the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, the building served as the temporary presidential office of Andrew Johnson while First Lady Mary Todd remained in the White House. <br />Below to the left is a color image of a four-story sandstone building with eight tall columns supporting an angled roof in its center. Purple and red flowers sit in a garden area at the front of the picture. Text below reads: <br />Treasury's South Facade. <br />To the right is a picture of a stately room with long wooden table, hutch and mirror. An American flag stands behind the table and the blue carpet is decorated with white stars. Text below reads: <br />Restored Andrew Johnson Suite. <br />A drawing below shows about fifteen men is long suit coats gathered in a room. Two men shake hands in the center. Text below reads: <br />President Johnson meeting with the ambassadors, 1865. <br />The right side of the sign features a map titled President's Park. The map is oriented with north at the bottom and south to the top. Constitution Avenue runs across the top of the sign with the circular Ellipse set below to the north. Further north, below E Street, is the South Lawn of the White House, followed by the White House itself.

    "bodyText": "<p>The seven acre Lafayette Park is directly north of the White House. The land that comprises Lafayette Park had been used as a race track, a showplace for caged animals, a graveyard, a slave market, and an encampment for soldiers, as well as for many political protests and celebrations that continue today. The park was planned by architect Charles Bulfinch in 1821, and upon completion several years later, it was named for the first foreign guest of state to stay at the White House, General Marquis de Lafayette.<br /> <br /> Originally named Lafayette Square, it was once a prime residential address. Many important residents included Vice Presidents, members of Congress, and foreign ambassadors. Naval hero Stephen Decatur's and former first lady Dolly Madison's houses still stand. The park has a rich history with St. John's Church, often referred to as the \"Church of the Presidents.\" Where the Treasury Annex stands was once of the Freedman's Bank, of which Frederick Douglass was a director.<br /> <br /> By the 20th century the park was known as Lafayette Park. The present park design was created by John Carl Warneke in the 1960s. The historic efforts of President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy, in the 1960s, led to the preservation of the park and the buildings surrounding it. The area was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(633 words) <br />Lafayette Park is a seven-acre brick-lined park north of Pennsylvania Avenue NW and the White House, south of H street, NW and bordered by Madison Place to the east, Jackson Place to the west. <br />In the center stands a bronze equestrian statue surrounded by four cannons on wheeled carriages. Four additional bronze statues sit in the four corners of the park. To the east and west sides of the park are fountains set in ninety foot-long, fifty-five-foot-wide pool basins. <br />The center statue features Jackson atop a horse reared back on its hind legs. Jackson raises his hat with his right hand. Four bronze canons on wheeled carriages sit at the corners of the pedestal. The statue is surrounded by a circular grass lawn and a spiked black metal fence. Fifty-foot-wide grass lawns lined with flowerbeds stretch from the statue to the north and south ends of the park. <br />The General Von Steuben Statue stands in the northwest corner of the park. Flanking the bronze figure below on the pedestal are two bronze sculptures. To his left is a sculpture of a young boy kneeling at the left side of a bare-chested woman with a robe across her lap. The right side features a sculpture of a naked young man standing next to a seated warrior wearing a helmet and robe over his bare right shoulder. The boy holds a sword in his right hand and the warrior's left hand is outstretched to assist him. <br />In the northeast corner of the park is the General Kosciuszko Statue. Kosciuszko stands proudly in military coat with shoulder epaulettes, tricorne hat and boots. He holds a furled piece of paper in his right hand and a sword in his left. A bronze eagle with spread wings stands atop a sword, flag, and shield laid on a quarter hemisphere showing the United States along the front base of the pedestal. Along the west side of the pedestal base is a bronze statue of a wounded man in military uniform, lying on top of a basket at the feet of a standing man. The wounded man looks up at the man above him and points with his right hand to the north. <br />The General Lafayette Statue is set in the southeast corner of the park. Lafayette stands atop an ornate, carved marble pedestal surrounded by seven additional bronze sculptures at its base. In the front is a seated, half-naked woman stretching her arm forth to hand Lafayette a sword above. On the opposite side are two cherubs. To Lafayette's left are two men in curled wigs, military uniform with sashes and long boots. They are turned to each other as if in conversation. The right side also features two men in curled wigs, military long coats and boots. These two appear to be walking in stride. The man on the left has his left arm wrapped around the shoulder of the man to his right. <br />The General Rochambeau Statue stands in the southwest corner of Lafayette Park. Rochambeau points to the south with his right index finger and holds a paper down by his left side. Rochambeau's sword rests at his left hip while a cannon and cannonball are set behind his left foot. Below him stands a bronze sculpture of a woman dressed in robes and armor-like garb, raising two staffs with flags in her left hand. A sword in her downturned right hand protects a bald eagle, its wings outstretched, mouth open and left talon raised off the ground. The eagle's right talon clutches a stone shield with thirteen stars and stripes beneath them. <br />Set at the center south end of the park, directly across from the White House are two five-foot tall, four-foot wide bronze urns set atop eight-foot tall, five square foot wide granite pedestals. <br />END OF DESCRIPTION <br />",

    "audioDescription": "(389 words) <br />Located at the northeast quadrant of the Ellipse and just south of the White House on E street, NW between 15th and 17th streets is the National Christmas Tree. <br />The tree is a living evergreen planted just southwest of the Zero Milestone. The Ellipse area is a wide open fifty-two-acre circular grass lawn. Facing the tree, the Washington Monument stands tall in the distance, about 650 yards to the south. The Jefferson Memorial is also visible slightly to the southwest. <br />The tree sits on a one-foot-high raised planting bed surrounded by a curb of stone blocks. About thirty feet from the sidewalk, a three-foot tall iron gate forms a perimeter of about forty feet around the tree area. <br />In front of the tree, on its northern side, is a green two by one-foot plaque set atop a one-inch tall cement block on the ground. A relief of an evergreen tree is on the righthand side of the plaque. The left side features raised text which reads: <br />National Christmas Tree<br />Transplanted October 11, 1978<br />Christmas Pageant<br />of<br />Peace<br />Committee <br />Just off the sidewalk, about twenty feet to the left as you face the front of the tree, is a four by three-foot wayside sign, titled in black letters: The National Christmas Tree. Below the title is text that reads:<br />The National Christmas Tree has been located at the site in front of you since 1973. Calvin Coolidge was the first president to light the National Christmas Tree on Christmas Eve, 1923. Since that time presidents have continued the tradition in various ways. In 1926, a signal flare announced the lighting to the city. In 1932, holiday carols played over loudspeakers hidden in the branches. The ceremony today includes live music and dance performances broadcast to the nation. <br />The sign shows a color picture of the Christmas tree at dusk, forming a perfect point at its top and brightly lit with large illuminated stars and lights all around. The White House sits off to the left in the background. The tree is encircled by a two-railed white fence and along its outer edge, smaller six-foot tall holiday-decorated evergreen trees surround the entire fence. A train set has been setup around the tree and four visitors can be seen on the left-hand side. <br />In the lower left corner is a six by five-inch black and white picture showing people in winter coats standing at dusk and facing to the right. One man stands apart in front of the others, holding his hat in his hand. A crowd watches to their left. <br />Beneath the picture text reads: <br />President Calvin Coolidge (1923-29)<br />Becomes the first president to light a Christmas Tree on the Ellipse on December 24, 1923. <br />In the bottom right corner text reads: The National Christmas Tree in 2012. <br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Although it didnât bear the name we know it by today â the White House â until around 1811, President John Adams and wife Abigail were the homeâs first residents, and it has been the official residence of the president ever since.</p> <p>The White House was designed by Irish architect James Hoban, whose winning design was selected by President George Washington in a competition for the honor of designing the home of the American president. With heavy influence from Georgian and neoclassical designs of Hobanâs native Ireland, the Presidentâs Palace quickly became a focal point of French engineer Pierre Charles LâEnfantâs city.<br /> <br /> The story of the White House and Presidentâs Park cannot be told without accounting for the enslaved people who helped construct the house and grounds. The original laborers and stonecutter constructing the White House were African American slaves hired from their owners. Many other cultures were represented at the construction site; most of the crews were comprised of immigrant skilled workers and independent laborers. As an example of this cultural diversity, the stone masons were Scots and the designer of the Presidentâs house was Irish. Â The 1795 payroll for the project lists three carpenters.</p> <p>The White House has undergone constant revisions, additions, and renovations by architects and residents throughout its history. Perhaps the most notable reconstruction came in the wake of 1814 â an invading British army torched the White House, Capitol Building and Treasury on August 24, 1814 during the War of 1812 in retaliation for an American attack on the Canadian capitol York the year prior. President James Madison and First Lady Dolley fled the attack, but not before rescuing the Gilbert Stuart portrait of President Washington.</p> <p>Although the exterior walls stood following the attack, weakened by the fire, little of the original structure would remain intact. Reconstruction of the home began in 1815 supervised by architect Benjamin Latrobe, according to Hobanâs original design. The White House re-opened to the First Family in 1817, with President James Madison and First Lady Elizabeth moving back in.</p> <p>The home would continue to evolve to meet the needs of a changing presidency and a changing nation, including adding the West Wing in 1901, a second story in the 1930s, structural renovations from 1949 to 1951, and an extensive interior redecoration from 1961 to 1963.</p> <p>Today, the White House and/or White House grounds areÂ open periodically to the public for tours.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The current White House Kitchen Garden was planted on the lower South Lawn by First Lady Michelle Obama in 2009. The garden provides locally grown vegetables, fruits, and herbs for the first family and White House guests.The garden continues a long tradition of growing vegetables and fruits on the White House Grounds. Even before President John Adams moved into the White House in November 1800, he requested that a vegetable garden be planted. During the mid-19th century, the White House produced much of its own fresh fruit and vegetables on a one-acre kitchen garden. During the Civil War, First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln regularly visited local hospitals to distribute strawberries and other fresh fruits to wounded Union soldiers.Â Â  During World War II, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt planted a Victory Garden encouraging Americans to grow their own food to supplement food shortages during the war. In the late 1970s President Jimmy Carter planted a small herb garden. First Lady Jill Biden added a floral cutting garden to the north end of the current garden in 2021 in order to continue her tradition of bringing fresh cut flowers as gifts when she travels.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service cares for the White House grounds including the Kitchen Garden. Our team of dedicated professionals, many of whom have cared for the White House grounds for decades, maintains the soil, plants the crops, tends the garden, and harvests the crops with the White House kitchen staff. The best times to get a close-up view of the White House Kitchen Garden are during the Spring and Fall Garden Tours, as well as the Easter Egg Roll. Outside of these special events, you can catch a glimpse of the garden from outside the South Lawn fence. When standing within view of the White House near the Zero Milestone, look to the left to spot the garden and the apiary.</p>",

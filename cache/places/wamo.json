He championed placing the capital along the Potomac River then personally selected the site. He chose architect Pierre L'Enfant to design the city. L'Enfant envisioned a capital with symbolically-placed key buildings, a cross-grid street system with intersections for future commemorative sites. At its center, L'Enfant planned a grand space known as the Mall, with houses of government perched on its edges and a monument to George Washington at its cross-axis. The basic concepts of L'Enfant's design still can be seen today. <p> </p>",

Follow the path to the right about two hundred twenty feet. To the west is a one-story stone building with two columns lining double glass front doors with windows at either side.<br />On the back, west side of this building, is a half-moon-shaped plaza area, bordered by a two-foot high, curved retaining wall. Set in the grass lawn, about two feet in front of the wall are three, three by four-foot wayside signs.<br />The sign to the left is titled in the upper left corner in gold letters to read:<br />Washington: The Man<br />The right two thirds of the sign feature a painting of a man with white, ear-length hair, standing proudly while wearing a black coat with high white collar and ruffled tie. He holds a sword in his left hand and extends his right hand outward.<br />Text below to the left reads:<br />Background: A Gilbert Stuart portrait painted in 1796, near the end of Washington's second term.<br />White House Historical Association<br />The sign in the middle is titled in the upper right corner in gold letters to read:<br />Washington: The Monument<br />The left side of the sign features a color photograph of the Washington Monument, taken from an elevated height and facing northeast. The white obelisk stands tall from the center of an open field, encircled by walking paths that arc and intertwine through the green grass field below. The red roofs of the Andrew Mellon Auditorium and Internal Revenue Service, white buildings of the Smithsonian Museum of American History and Natural History, the Post Office Building Tower and other government buildings sit in the background.<br />In the lower right corner of the sign sits a black and white photograph of one dozen men standing shoulder-to-shoulder in long dark coats and military uniform. The two men standing furthest outside hold flags on poles set on the ground. Behind them in the faded distance is an obelisk with a flat top. Text below reads:<br />Soldiers drill on the White House Ellipse during the Civil War. The monument behind them remains unfinished.<br />The sign furthest to the right has a blue background and is titled in the upper left corner in gold letters that read:<br />Washington: The City<br />The right two-thirds of the sign feature an image in blue of the Potomac River flowing from top to bottom. To the right is a blue grid of small boxes ordered symmetrically in horizontal and vertical lines. Darker blue lines dissect the grid at angles, forming a crisscross pattern over the grid. A dark rectangle at the east side of the Potomac River is labeled: Washington Monument Site.<br />A four by two-inch image in the lower right corner shows a white one-story building with white columns and a tall white obelisk protruding from its center. The image is labeled at the bottom in red letters around a black dotted circular design:<br />Sketch of Washington National Monument<br />By Roby:Mills, Arct.<br />Below in white letters reads:<br />National Archives and Record Administration<br />To the left in gold letters in written:<br />Slow Progress<br />Below in white text reads:<br />In 1836 the Washington National Monument Society held a contest to design the monument.

    "bodyText": "<p> </p> <h3>Washington: The Man</h3> <br /> <br /> George Washington shaped the United States in both war and peace. He led the Continental Army against the British in the American Revolution. After eight long years, his small force defeated the world's strongest military. The new nation looked to Washington as a unifying figure, electing him the first President of the United States of America. Washington helped define the presidency by leaving office after two terms, setting the precedent of a peaceful transition of power.<br /> \"He was, indeed, in every sense of the words, a wise, a good, and a great man.\"<br /> Thomas Jefferson, January 2, 1814 <h3>Washington: The Monument</h3> <br /> <br /> The Washington Monument honors George Washington, hero of the American Revolution and the first president of the United States. When this stunning stone obelisk was completed in 1884, it was the tallest building in the world. Today the monument towers over Washington, DC, reminding us of Washington's life and legacy.<br /> <b>Just the Facts</b><br /> Height: 555 feet, 5 1/8 inches<br /> Steps: 896<br /> Stones: about 36,000<br /> Weight: 81,000 tons (as much as 6,480 school buses)<br /> 150 feet up the stones change color because they came from different quarries during two construction periods. <h3>Washington: The City</h3> <br /> <br /> George Washington shaped many aspects of the nation's capital. He championed placing the capital along the Potomac River then personally selected the site. He chose architect Pierre L'Enfant to design the city. L'Enfant envisioned a capital with symbolically-placed key buildings, a cross-grid street system with intersections for future commemorative sites. At its center, L'Enfant planned a grand space known as the Mall, with houses of government perched on its edges and a monument to George Washington at its cross-axis. The basic concepts of L'Enfant's design still can be seen today. <p> </p>",

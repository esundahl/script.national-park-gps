The cabin included a living room, kitchen, and a bedroom for the resident ranger and family. After completion, this cabin served as the park headquarters and was the first stop as visitors arrived to tour Jewel Cave.<br /> <br /> Over the years, the cabin and surrounding area were modified to fit the needs of a monument with growing popularity. Eventually, visitation exceeded what the current facilities could support. In 1972, the modern visitor center opened, and the cabin was no longer needed except as a meeting place for tours through the historic entrance. The cabin now serves as a reminder of the great work completed by the CCC and the rangers who followed.</p>",

After enlarging the hole, the Michaud brothers discovered the beauty of what is now called Jewel Cave. The brothers developed the cave and began to offer tours to visitors. Word spread of this amazing find, and in 1908 Jewel Cave became a National Monument. It wasn't until the 1930s that Jewel Cave came under the management of the National Park Service, but it has been protected by various groups since it's discovery. Now, over 100 years later, visitors can still take a tour through the very opening enlarged by the Michaud brothers to follow their first footsteps into the darkness of Jewel Cave.",

Advanced sales are offered for all cave tours and are offered for the scheduled times.

Tours often sell out by mid to late morning during the summer season (May through September). During the peak season or a holiday weekend, it is advised that visitors arrive in the early morning to purchase on-site tickets.<em> Arriving 30 minutes to an hour before the tour time may mean you arrive after that tour is already sold out.</em> During the off-season (October through April), tickets may be sold in the Visitor Center.

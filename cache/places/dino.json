The species \"<em>louisae</em>\" was named after Andrew Carnegie's wife, Louise. Carnegie financed most of the excavations of the quarry at Dinosaur and had many of the specimens sent to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where they still stand in the museum that bears his name.<br /> <br /> The \"Discovery Bones\" that led to the discovery of the Carnegie Quarry were tail vertebrae (back bones) of <em>Apatosaurus louisae</em>. This specimen, a nearly complete skeleton with a skull, became the type specimen of <em>Apatosaurus louisae</em>. This means that it was the first of its species ever found and scientifically described.Like many sauropods and dinosaurs in general, <em>Apatosaurus</em> skulls are extremely rare. The skull bones are thin and easily crushed. Skulls are mostly hollow to hold soft tissues that cannot be preserved. Fine sediments compress the skull to flatten it the way you might step on an empty tin can. These skulls may be preserved, but some of the three-dimensional structure is lost.<br /> <br /> The only <em>Apatosaurus</em> skull in the world was found in the Carnegie Quarry because the sand-sized sediment preserves bone in great detail without compressing it. Today a cast of the <em>Apatosaurus</em> skull is still on display with the rest of the specimen at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The real skull is not on display due to the fragile nature of the bone.",

    "bodyText": "Like chapters in a book, the geologic formations (layers) on this tilted rock trail are chapters of ancient environments deposited here over millions of years. While standing behind the Quarry Visitor Center, look at the Frontier Sandstone cliff beside you. High above the trailhead sign and on the cliff, notice the wavy ripple marks within the large dark brown patches. These ripples were created when water moved over sand. If you were hiking here approximately 100 million years ago, you would have been walking along the sandy shores of the Cretaceous Interior Seaway. <a href=\"https://www.cretaceousatlas.org/geology/\">Cretaceous Atlas of Ancient Life | Geology</a> A vast difference from the high desert environment of today!<br /> <br /> On the ground, behind and to the left of the trailhead sign is another notable feature, a huge chocolate-colored rocky sphere known as a concretion. This concretion also has a delightful star-shaped crack that filled in with minerals which crystalized. Concretions are masses of mineral matter embedded in the sandstone. They often form when minerals settling out ground water gather around a nucleus, such as a pebble or shell. Concretions can be any size, but the hefty dimensions of this one (and others here) is due to the presence of large amounts of water from the former seaway. <br /> <br /> While staying on the trail, there are a number of other large concretions in this area How many others can you locate? Hint: There are five others, but some are badly weathered and have broke apart.<br /> <br /> As you proceed along the Frontier Formation, you may see animals such as squirrels, marmots, birds, rabbits, snakes, or lizards. <a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/Search/SpeciesList/DINO\">NPSpecies- Search for a Park Species List</a><br /> Keep wildlife wild and yourself safe by observing all creatures from a distance.<br /> <br /> Once you reach the end of the Frontier Formation, just around the corner, you'll see how ancient people used the geology here. Petroglyphs were pecked into this rock with tools to make symbols of people, animals or patterns. Pictographs are painted symbols. These were created approximately 1,000 years ago by ancient people archaeologists call the Fremont. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dino/learn/historyculture/fremont-culture.htm\">Fremont Culture - Dinosaur National Monument (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a>. Since the Fremont did not have a written language (as did the Egyptians for example, with their hieroglyphs) the exact meaning of the Fremont symbols is unknown.<br /> Help us protect these and all petroglyph sites for future generations by not touching them. <br /> <br /> Hike on to discover the next chapter in our ancient book - the Mowry Shale Formation.",
    "audioDescription": "When standing on the Fossil Discovery Trail behind Dinosaur National Monument's Quarry Visitor Center, the cliff next to you is the Frontier Sandstone Formation. It is a tan color, approximately 100 feet tall by a half mile long. Near the top of the cliff is a large brown patch with a wave pattern within, also known as ripple marks. These ripples indicate water flowing over a sandy beach from approximately 100 million years ago, when the Western Interior Seaway once covered this area - a vast difference from today's high desert landscape! In this same area, located on the ground behind and to the left of the trailhead sign, there is a huge dark-brown rocky sphere called a concretion. It's approximately 2 feet tall, 2 feet wide and the largest in the monument. Concretions form when minerals settling out of ground water gather around a nucleus, such as a pebble or shell. Most concretions in Dinosaur are pea to marble-sized, but the hefty dimensions of this one (and others here) is due to the presence of large amounts of water from the former seaway. ",

Both adult and juvenile <em>Camarasaurus</em> bones have been found at Dinosaur. A juvenile, nearly complete and articulated-meaning that most of the bones were discovered in life position-is the most complete sauropod skeleton ever found. Even the ear bones and skull were intact! In fact, it's such a nice specimen that it has never been completely removed from the sandstone block in which it was found. Enough of the rock was removed to reveal the left side of the specimen. The back legs and tail were straightened before being put on display. When it was discovered, the tail curled back so it was almost touching the skull. Aside from a few minor changes, the specimen looks just as it did when it was discovered and can still be seen at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<br />  </p> <p>A larger specimen is one of the most complete <em>Camarasaurus</em> ever found. This includes a skull, bones from all four legs, and most of the backbone and tail. Although pieces of <em>Camarasaurus</em> are fairly common in the Morrison Formation, the thin bone and hollow space in the skull make preservation difficult. It was prepared, or removed from the rock to display, as an exhibit at the 1933 World's Fair. Today it's on display at the National Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian) in Washington, D.C.</p>",

The beak-like front of the skull did not have teeth but was used to nip vegetation. <em>Camptosaurus</em> may have lived in small groups. It depended on its speed to escape predators. <em>Camptosaurus</em> is the ancestor of later large herbivores, such as iguanodonts, and duck bills.<br /> <br /> <em>Camptosaurus aphanoecetes</em> is a species of ornithopod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of North America, found in the Morrison Formation. Its bones are exposed on the quarry wall at Dinosaur National Monument.<br /> <br /> Despite not having been found with a skull, the specimen from Dinosaur is the most complete <em>Camptosaurus</em> ever found. Like <em>Camarasaurus</em> it was on display for many years in the same block in which it was found. When the Carnegie remodeled their dinosaur exhibits, they decided to remove <em>Camptosaurus</em> from its stony prison to mount as a skeleton. Surprisingly, this specimen, which was identified as <em>Camptosaurus medius</em> for many years, was discovered to be an entirely new species in 2008.<br /> <br /> <i>Camptosaurus aphanoecetes</i> is a new species of Camptosaurus, described by Ken Carpenter in 2008. The species name<i> aphanoecetes</i> comes from Greek <i>aphanoe-</i> meaning “hidden”, and <i>-cetes</i>, meaning “to dwell”. This name refers to the fact that a new species had been “hidden in plain sight” at the Carnegie Museum for over seventy-five years as a mounted skeleton.<br /> <br /> A <em>Camptosaurus</em> embryo was also found at Dinosaur. Although these bones were found without eggshell fragments, it has been identified as an embryo. The bones themselves are more fibrous in surface texture than those of the adult. Certain parts of the backbone on this specimen had not yet fused together as they are in adults. The <em>Camptosaurus</em> would probably have spinal cord damage when walking around if these bones never fused. These features are present in dinosaur embryos studied all over the world.",

Do your part to respect and protect the past and report any vandalism you find.",
    "audioDescription": "As you make your way along a narrow path through the plants, the Deluge Shelter spur of the Jones Hole Trail leads you to a vertical sandstone rock face. The rock is rough and ranges from tan to reddish in color. In many of the petroglyphs, the paint has faded, but the etchings are still visible. In areas where the rock is shaded by ledges, some pictographs are still vibrant because the pigment has not been faded by the sun. The ledge extends alongside the narrow trail and features many humanoid figures, animal figures, abstract shapes, and pockmarked designs. There is a wayside exhibit here, titled \"Sheltering Ancient Images.\" The main picture shows a line drawing of two people, one standing, one kneeling, creating petroglyphs and pictographs. The text reads: \"Approximately 800 to 1,400 years ago, this area was home the Fremont people. They left evidence of their presence in the form of petroglyphs, patterns chipped or carved into the rock, and pictographs, patterns painted on the rock. Few Fremont structures remain, but known dwelling sites range from natural shelters, such as rock overhangs or shallow caves, to small villages. Because the Fremont moved according to the availability of water and food, they occupied many of the dwelling sites for only part of the year. They may have used this site, Deluge Shelter, in this way. For a thousand years, this rock overhang has shaded these pictographs from the strong midday sun. This limited exposure to sunlight may have helped to preserve the vibrant colors in these ancient images.\" On the right side of the exhibit are photos of the images on the rocks. The first is of a red pictograph. It features an animal-figure resembling an antelope with long frond-like horns sweeping back over its body, followed by another small dog-like animal. The text reads, \"Are these original colors? Yes, the Fremont created these colors using pigments made from minerals, clays, or other natural materials.\" The image immediately below is of a reddish-brown pictograph featuring three humanoid figures, standing shoulder to shoulder. Each has six thin protrusions sticking up from the crown of its head. The text reads, \"Why have the colors lasted so long? The ancient pictographs that have survived are generally located in protected areas, like rock overhangs or shaded ledges. Weather, rockfall, and vandalism can affect their appearance. The final image shows a humanoid figure with two large, curved protrusions emanating from the crown of its head. The text states, \"Why did they make these designs? Archeologists have several theories: the images may have related to hunting, identified clans, served ceremonial or religious purposes, or simply expressed the artist's imagination.\"",

    "bodyText": "From here you can see directly down into Echo Park. Beyond Steamboat Rock, just out of sight, is the confluence of the Green and Yampa rivers. Both are part of the Upper Colorado River system, and each has its own unique story.<br /> <br /> From almost the beginning of American settlement in the West, demand for water has exceeded availability. In 1950, the United States Bureau of Reclamation presented the Colorado River Storage Project, a proposal to construct several dams throughout the Colorado River system. The initial project included a dam downstream of Echo Park that would have flooded both the Green and Yampa rivers, destroying many of the natural and cultural features that had been protected as part of Dinosaur National Monument since a boundary expansion in 1938.<br /> <br /> This proposed dam had the potential to set a precedent that put every national park and monument at risk of development, and environmental groups took a strong stand against it. The movement to defeat the Echo Park Dam garnered tremendous public support and ultimately was successful. However, a dam was still built upstream on the Green River at Flaming Gorge.<br /> <br /> In its natural state, the Green River flooded almost every spring, carrying loads of silt and scouring its banks. Life in the river was so well-adapted to this environment that many organisms depended on this seasonal influx of water and sediment to survive. In 1964, the Flaming Gorge Dam was completed, trapping silt behind its walls and regulating water flow at a constant rate. Native species, ill-adapted to this cold, clear water, began to suffer. <br /> <br /> Today, the dam regulates water releases in an attempt to mimic the natural rhythms of the Green River and aid in the recovery of native species.<br /> <br /> The Yampa River stands in contrast to the today’s Green River. The Yampa is the last major free-flowing tributary in the Colorado River System. It serves as a sanctuary to native fish and invertebrates, like mayflies, that are adapted to its natural fluctuations. Where the two rivers meet at Echo Park, the Yampa rejuvenates the Green with its warm, silty waters for miles downstream, effectively creating a hybrid river, both regulated and wild.",

    "bodyText": "The Echo Park Road is a 14-mile (one way) unpaved road that takes drivers from the Harpers Corner Road to the banks of the Green River at Echo Park. While much of this road is graded and covered with gravel, high clearance vehicles and four-wheel-drive are strongly recommended due to several dry wash crossings and a steep descent down a series of switchbacks known as \"the dugway\" over the first two miles. The road is not suitable for RVs. Due to the clay soil, the road is not passable when wet. Always check the weather before heading down the Echo Park Road.<br /> <br /> The Echo Park Road leads visitors through rugged and scenic canyons. Places of interest along the way include historic sites, such as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/historic-chew-ranch.htm\">Chew Ranch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/pool-creek-petroglyphs.htm\">petroglyph panels</a> at Pool Creek.<br /> <br /> Food, fuel, restrooms, and supplies are not available along this road. The primitive Echo Park Campground, located at the end of the 14-mile road, offers vault toilets, picnic tables, and potable water (when weather allows). Visitors must pack out all trash.",
    "audioDescription": "From the Harpers Corner Road, the Echo Park road begins by heading down an unpaved section of steep switchbacks known as \"the dugway.\" There is a sign at the first switchback that reads, \"Caution: No Trailers. Passenger cars not advised. Impassable when wet.\" In many places, the dirt is a bright rust-red color. For those not driving the vehicle, the dugway provides some sweeping views of the valley down into Echo Park. Sage, juniper trees, and other desert plants sparsely carpet the landscape. Colorful sediments of yellow, tan, gray, are visible beneath the greenery. You may feel the car bounce over rocks and potholes throughout the duration of your trip. At the bottom of the dugway, the sweeping vistas disappear for a while. After about 10 miles, there is a fork in the road. A brown sign behind the fork says, \"Echo Park, 4 miles\" with an arrow pointing left. Below this, there is an arrow pointing right. The text beside it reads, \"Castle Park, 9 miles. Elk Springs, 42 miles.\" The arrow pointing right towards Castle Park and Elk Springs directs visitors down the Yampa Bench Road. After turning left to continue towards Echo Park, you will pass through the historic Chew Ranch. A metal-covered wagon stands on wooden wheels between a log cabin and a decaying wooden fence that was once a corral. Across the road, the whitewash paint is fading from an abandoned house, which sits beneath the shade of some large Fremont cottonwood trees. The remaining four miles leads you over some small creeks, which may or may not be dry. You will pass an abandoned cabin with a roof of thatch and red clay. Shortly after, a sign reading \"Petroglyphs,\" denotes the secluded location of the petroglyph site at Pool Creek. As you continue descending into Echo Park, huge sandstone walls seem to rise up and envelop the view. At the bottom of one of these steep rock faces, there is a short shallow alcove. The sign there reads, \"Whispering Cave.\" Not far beyond this point, you will reach the end of the road at the Echo Park Campground. Vault toilets are available in the small, concrete shelter. A bulletin board offers information. Potable water for drinking is available at pumps in various locations when weather allows.",

    "audioDescription": "Near the junction of Ely Creek and Jones Hole Creek, there is a small camping area to your right as you head down the trail towards the river. The ground here is flat and sandy, with enough space to accommodate two tents per campsite. Trees surround the site and provide intermittent shade. Cut logs and boulders provide seating. At the edge of the campsite, there is a brown-colored bear locker for storing food and scented items. The locker has a picture of bears on it, along with written bear safety information. To the left of the bear locker, a narrow trail slopes up the small hill. Following this trail will lead you to an enclosed vault toilet a short distance away from from the campsite. As you walk in, the toilet is to the right back corner of the structure. Toilet paper is usually provided, and is located just below the accessible handrail to your left when you're sitting on the seat. Signs on the trees around the campsite warn of dangerous wildlife. The bear sign reads: \"WARNING: Black bears have recently been reported in this area. If you see a bear: avoid it if you can, back away slowly and leave the area. Make noise so the bear knows you are there. If a bear approaches you: Remain calm and face the bear. Back away slowly; do not run. You cannot outrun a bear. Stand tall, appear large, wave arms or jacket. Group together, pick up small children. Make noise, throw things, try to scare it off. Fight back aggressively and use bear spray if the bear attacks. Please report all black bear sightings to the nearest ranger or call the park. Leave your name and phone number with the date, time, and place the bear was seen. Removal of this sign is illegal and may result in injury to others.\"",

    "bodyText": "The broad valley before you, ringed by mountains, is called the Uinta Basin. Here, animals and plants from the Great Basin, Colorado Plateau, and Rocky Mountains come together to form a unique mix of ecosystems. The diversity of life within Dinosaur is enhanced by drastic elevation changes, ranging from 4750 to 9000 feet (1448 to 2743 m). <br /> <br /> Some plants, like manzanita (a green, round-leafed shrub), have very specific habitat needs. The only place within the monument with the right combination of soil type, sun exposure, and moisture level to support manzanita is here at Escalante Overlook. Some species, like arrowleaf balsamroot (a yellow-flowering plant with wavy arrow-shaped leaves), are less picky and more widespread. <br /> <br /> For the remainder of the Harpers Corner Drive, desert shrubland species such as greasewood give way to the sagebrush steppe, a grassland ecosystem characterized by the dominance of sagebrush and shrubs. As their names imply, the sagebrush sparrow and greater sage-grouse are two birds who rely on this habitat for their survival. Semi-desert woodlands characterized by pinyon pine and Utah juniper occasionally intermix with the sagebrush, attracting a variety of birds. Some of these include the Clark's nutcracker (a jay-sized bird colored gray, black, and white) and the juniper titmouse (a tiny all-gray bird with a tiny, adorable crest on its head).<br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The road to the Escalante overlook is paved and hook-shaped, with a small loop at the end. This loop features several wayside exhibits along a flat, paved sidewalk, which offers views of the Uintah Basin. A sloping ridge sweeps away from the sidewalk. Patches of bare rock peek out from a blanket of diverse plant life, which includes a mix of sagebrush, manzanita, and juniper trees. The valley below is flat in comparison to the rocky outcrops lining your vision. Visibility depends on haze, but on clear days, the town of Vernal, UT can be seen in the distance. Three waysides line the sidewalk where you face the valley. The leftmost one is an older wayside titled, \"Polluted air. Where is it coming from?\" A map of the western U.S. shows air currents coming into the area from different directions, with color-coded squares indicating urban air pollution, coal and oil-fired power plants, copper smelters, and oil refineries and fields. A blue arrow pointing down from the north is labeled, \"Clean Air Under Some Meteorological Conditions.\" A gray arrow points towards Utah from southern California, labeled, \"Dirty Air Most Often.\" A gray arrow pointing towards us from south Texas reads, \"Dirty Air Under Some Meteorological Conditions.\" Other pictures show cities with urban air pollution, coal and oil-fired power plants, copper smelters, and oil refineries. The text reads, \"Prevailing winds bring air pollution from southern California as well as local sources. A white steam plume from an electric generating facility 25 miles southwest is usually visible. The power plant burns low-sulfur coal and uses efficient air pollution control technology, which cuts its emissions of sulfur dioxide to about 500 tons each year.\" The middle wayside is titled, \"The quality of your view depends on the quality of the air.\" It features three pictures of the view before you, but with different levels of haze. The text reads, \"National Park Service natural areas are created to preserve the natural scene of primitive America. In the arid west, spectacular views are an important part of that natural scene. Monitoring has shown that 90% of the time, scenic vistas are affected by manmade pollution at all monitoring locations within the lower 48 states. Sulfates limit visibility more than any other pollutant, causing about half of the haze in this region. Sulfur dioxide emitted from industrial processes is transformed in the atmosphere to fine sulfate particles, which scatter light very efficiently. Sulfates can cause haze hundreds of miles from its source. Local visibility is also impaired by smoke from home wood heating stoves. Sulfur dioxide comes mainly from coal and oil-fired power plants, copper and aluminum smelters, and from oil, oil shale, and natural gas extraction and refining. Many of these industries are located near Dinosaur National Monument The final wayside titled, \"Are we there yet?\" features text above an old spanish-style map. A picture in the upper left-hand corner shows a Spanish missionary holding the reins of a horse. Beside him, an indigenous person sitting atop a horse points ahead. The caption reads, \"How many different maps or devices did you use to arrive at this spot today? The Dominguez-Escalante expedition could only rely on geographical and astronomical observations, local guides, and trial and error to select their route. Father Escalante Discovers Utah Valley by E. Keith Eddington.\" The main body text reads, \"From this spot in the fall of 1776, you might have seen a small expedition crossing the plains below, heading west into Utah. The group was led by Atansasio Dominguez and Silvestre Velez de Escalante, two Franciscan friars attempting to find a northern route from Santa Fe, New Mexico to newly-established Spanish missions in Monterey, California. Their expedition was the first known group of Europeans to enter what is now Dinosaur National Monument. Maps and journal entries described many of Dinosaur's prominent landmarks and included details of crossing the Green River near the modern-day Quarry Visitor Center on September 16, 1776. Eventually, the friars would explore Utah Valley, south of modern-day Salt Lake City. After abandoning their quest to reach California, they endured an arduous journey back to Santa Fe, navigating the canyon country surrounding the Colorado River in what is now Southern Utah. Although they did not achieve their stated goal, the Dominguez-Escalante Expedition is credited as the first group to map vast areas of the American West, paving the way for later travelers. Their journey would set in motion dramatic changes for the Native peoples who inhabited the area.",

    "bodyText": "The smooth surfaces of the 90 million year old Frontier Sandstone, a shoreline of an ancient interior seaway, provided an ideal canvas for these petroglyphs left by the ancestral indigenous people of the region over a thousand years ago. These designs include both petroglyphs (patterns chipped or carved into the rock) and pictographs (patterns painted on the rock). Pictographs are relatively rare here, perhaps because they are more easily weathered. Some petroglyphs show traces of pigment, possibly indicating that many designs originally included both carved and painted areas. These designs are very fragile. Touching the petroglyphs and pictographs can damage the designs by leaving oils behind that abrade the rock. Tracing and rubbings can damage the soft sandstone designs. For these reasons, please do not touch the designs.<br /> <br /> The style and content of indigenous designs vary throughout the region. The “Classic Vernal Style” predominates in Dinosaur National Monument. This style is characterized by humanlike figures, animal-like figures, and abstract designs. Human figures typically have trapezoidal bodies, which may or may not include arms, legs, fingers, and toes. Elaborate decorations on the bodies suggest headdresses, earrings, necklaces, shields, or other objects. Why did these ancestral cultures create these designs and what did they mean? Perhaps the designs served some ceremonial or religious purpose, related to hunting activities, identified clans, or simply expressed the artist’s imagination – or perhaps all or none of these. Attempts to interpret the designs by comparing them with recent Native American groups may provide clues, but the true meaning remains a mystery.",

    "bodyText": "From its origin high in the mountains of the Wind River Range in Wyoming, the Green River rushes through steep-walled canyons and traverses sage-covered valleys. After emerging from the Flaming Gorge Dam, the river wanders placidly through an open valley beginning 30 miles upstream from here. Early trappers and traders to the area named this valley Browns Hole after Baptiste Brown, a French-Canadian trapper. He choose this area to settle because of its mild winters and plentiful beaver pelts.<br /> <br /> Travelers that passed through the area later included John Wesley Powell on his historic float through the Grand Canyon. Powell gave the area its current name of Browns Park. However, most local cattle ranchers still referred to the valley as Browns Hole until a spirited young Elizabeth Bassett convinced them to adopt what she termed the much more “eloquent” name of Browns Park. Because of its isolation, Browns Park served as home to not only ranchers but also outlaws including Butch Cassidy, Matt Warner, and the notorious bounty hunter Tom Horn. Today, Browns Park remains sparsely populated by people, but it provides critical habitat for a variety of wildlife.",

Because there is minimal impact from artificial lights, you can still see the stars of our Milky Way galaxy with startling clarity. The majority of residents of the United States live in places where the Milky Way is no longer visible, even on a moonless night. Night skies are a vanishing resource and increasing development, even in many rural areas, expands the impact of light pollution.<br /> <br /> The skies above the monument are an important resource to enjoy and protect just like the fossils, stunning scenery, and wild rivers. Natural night skies also provide a important environment for animals and plants that require darkness. Due to isolation, night skies at Gates of Lodore still look similar to those that native peoples and early explorers experienced.

No one knows for sure why this is the case, but one theory suggests that a few million years ago the river flowed eastward, away from the mountains. When that route was blocked by uplift along the present continental divide, drainage in this area stagnated. Browns Park gradually filled to the brim with sediments. Meandering along on top of that fill, the Green River eventually spilled over the buried crest of the mountains and down their southern slope. This gave it the energy to begin down cutting once more and as it washed out most of the recent sediments, it also rasped its way into the older rocks to carve the Canyon of Lodore.",

    "bodyText": "Today, the rugged walls along the Green River are a haunt of the bighorn sheep. These sure footed climbers were probably abundant here in the past based on the number of images of them that appear in the thousand year old rock art of the Fremont People. As the west became more settled with the arrival of Europeans, the bighorn sheep began to die out from a combination of over hunting, disease, and competition from domestic livestock. The last native bighorn sheep seen in Dinosaur was reported in 1944. In 1952 a new herd of animals from elsewhere in Colorado were transplanted into the area. Their population has increased significantly to the point where bighorn sheep are now a common sight along the river corridors. Due to their unique padded hooves, bighorn are able to climb the steep, rocky canyon walls with speed and agility, making them well adapted to life in Dinosaur.",

This evening, as I write, the sun is going down and the shadows are settling in the canyon… and now it is a dark portal to a region of gloom, the gateway through which we are to enter on our voyage of exploration tomorrow, what shall we find?”<br />  <br /> John Wesley Powell wrote these words as he camped near here on June 7, 1869, expressing the combination of excitement and fear he and his companions often felt as they made the first full length expedition down the Green River. Since most of this canyon country was still literally a blank spot on the map, Powell and his men had the opportunity to fill in the blanks with new names. Andy Hall, the youngster of the group, suggested the name of this canyon after recalling “The Cataract of Lodore” by the English poet Robert Southey: “All at once and all o’er, with a mighty uproar and this way the water comes down at Lodore.”<br /> <br /> These lines soon proved to be appropriate, for the first large rapid below here wrecked one of the party’s four wooden boats and earned itself the name Disaster Falls. The crew salvaged what they could, and approached the later rapids more cautiously. Powell ultimately floated all the way down the Green and Colorado Rivers through the Grand Canyon.",

    "bodyText": "What Powell had called “the great unknown” is now explored by thousands of people every year in rafts and kayaks. River running is very popular in Dinosaur National Monument. The monument uses a permit system both for boater safety and to reduce the impact of too many people concentrated in narrow canyons. To some, imposition of such regulations is contradictory to the freedom of wilderness travel; to others, some control necessary to preserve the wilderness itself. How we protect our public lands, while also allowing for their use, is a continual debate.<br /> <br /> Rafters may not have been able to enjoy these wild rivers if proposed dams had been constructed within the monument boundaries. The Echo Park Dam would have flooded the entire Canyon of Lodore and also that of the Yampa River, the Green’s major tributary. Protestors of the dam pointed out that Dinosaur National Monument had been enlarged to protect these canyons in their natural state, not as artificial reservoirs. After years of contentious debate in the 1950s and 60s, the decision was made to not build a dam within the monument boundaries.<br /> <br /> Though the water that passes through the Gates of Lodore today is not quite the wild and unknown torrent that Powell saw, it is still a flowing river. The current still gnaws inch by inch into ancient rock; beaver still burrow and feed along the banks; bighorn still find footholds on the canyon walls; and modern explorers thrilled by the sights, the roar of a rapid and the song of a canyon wren can attest that this river is a rare and valuable resource.",

Great cattle herds once roamed the range. Unlike native animals, cattle grazed on native grasses faster than they could reproduce and new invasive plants took their place. Cheat grass is one of the most common of these species. Originally introduced in grain shipments from the Mediterranean, it spread rapidly across the American west. Not only does it provide poor forage for native animals, but its seeds have the ability to hitchhike to new destinations by catching in fur or your socks.",

The dam’s greatest affect is not the river’s color, but its flow. After its completion in 1969, the great spring floods of former years are now trapped behind the dam. This altered the habitat downstream and made it more difficult for native fish to survive. In response, dam operators release extra water in the spring to<br /> simulate natural flooding and create conditions for the fish to spawn successfully. For the rest of the year, gradual releases from the dam keep the flow at a relatively constant level.",

Perhaps as much as a billion years ago, this area lay near sea level and was being slowly buried by pebbles, sand, and mud washed down from mountains. Partly due to the weight of these sediments, the land gradually sank and the sediments piled up, reaching a thickness of over 24,000 feet. Tremendous pressure and cementing action of dissolved minerals solidified the sediments into the conglomerates, sandstones and shales that today we call the Uinta Mountain Group.",

    "bodyText": "If you have traveled from a moister climate, you might not think of this area as forested. The Utah juniper, however, manages to cover much of this arid country. What it lacks in stature, the juniper makes up for in toughness, longevity, the fragrance of its wood, and the beauty of its often gnarled, twisted trunks. Also, from a more utilitarian viewpoint, junipers have fueled many a campfire since prehistoric times, supported miles of fences and perhaps right now are providing you with a bit of welcome shade.<br /> <br /> The junipers’ companion in much of the canyon country forests is the pinyon (piñon) pine. Though you might think of pines as growing best on snow-capped mountains, many species, especially the pinyon group are well adapted to lower, drier areas. All leaves have pores through which plants breathe but in pine needles these are sunk in deep pits. Along with a waxy coating the needles help to reduce the amount of moisture lost through evaporation. Also, in many pines a type of root fungus helps draw water from the soil, since the fine strands of the fungus can penetrate into more nooks and crannies than relatively coarse roots. Perhaps you’ve seen or tasted the “pine nuts” sold throughout the Southwest. These are the seeds of the pinyon pine, borne in small cones which ripen in the fall. Harvesting them is a fall tradition for many native cultures. Additionally, pinyon seeds are a staple food for wildlife including the Clarks Nutcracker, Golden Mantled Ground Squirrel and the Juniper Titmouse.",

All overlooks along the route are wheelchair accessible. The Harpers Corner Road is also the jumping-off point for several paved paths and hiking trails. <br /> <br /> Fuel, food, water, and other services are not available along this route. Vault toilets are located at picnic areas and a few overlooks along the route. The nearest services are in Dinosaur, Colorado, two miles west of the Canyon Visitor Center on U.S. Highway 40. Harper's Corner Drive is closed at Plug Hat Butte when heavy snow falls. The road reopens in spring when conditions allow.",
    "audioDescription": "The Harper's Corner Road begins off of Highway 40, near the Canyon Visitor Center, which is an older stone building with a rocky façade and an overhang for shade. A potable water fountain and bottle filling station is available under the overhang. Restrooms with flush toilets are located around the corner from the fountain, across from the Center's entrance. Picnic tables and trash receptacles are available in the parking lot. From the Canyon Visitor Center, the road steadily climbs in elevation, winding around multicolored sandstone cliffs dotted sparsely with juniper trees and desert shrubs. About 7 miles in is the Plug Hat Butte area, which offers picnic tables, a wheelchair-accessible trail, and sweeping views of Bull Canyon. As the road continues, the landscape changes from canyons to rolling hills. Private land lines either side of the Harper's Corner Road for the first 24 miles. Ranching homes, farming equipment, and cattle are common sights. You may feel your vehicle bounce over cattle guards from time to time. There are several scenic overlooks of the canyons and valleys along the way. After the Echo Park Road turnoff, the scenery opens up again to reveal beautiful canyons. Warmly colored rocks of sandy yellow, gray, orange, and rust-red are visible beneath the patchy carpet of rough sage plants. Juniper trees cling precariously to the sides and tops of canyons with their twisted gray-brown roots. At the end of the tour, the road loops around. It passes a parking lot for the Harper's Corner Trailhead before directing drivers back the way they came.",

    "bodyText": "By now you may have spotted some of the local wildlife. The higher elevations of Harpers Corner are home to a variety of birds, some of which can be found fairly easily and others that are a bit more inconspicuous. Look for dark black ravens that are at home in the canyon country you see before you. Typically traveling in pairs, they are generalist species and are able to survive in almost all the environments found in the monument, from high forests to low dry deserts. Other birds you may encounter along the trail include the melodious Mountain Chickadee, the vibrant blue Scrub Jay, the mischievous Black-billed Magpie, and the boisterous Dark Eyed Junco.<br /> <br /> If you glance behind you into the trees, you might see a bird that is uniquely adapted to this environment. In high forests across the west, the black and gray Clark’s Nutcracker can be seen flashing from tree to tree. They have a specially designed beak that allows them to pry open pinecones and remove their seeds; underneath their tongue they have a unique pouch that allows them to store the seeds so they can cache them for later use. In preparation for winter, they will hide seeds all around the forest. Even the smartest birds don’t remember exactly where they left all of them and over the years many will grow to become new trees.",

    "bodyText": "Seashells far above the sea, great blocks of rock bent and broken, deep and tortuous canyons - was this land the site of some great cataclysm? To us, accustomed as we are to thinking in terms of minutes, hours, and days, the scene may look like the result of some chaotic upheaval but it wasn’t. All around us the forces that shaped it are still in action. Rivers deepen their channels grain by grain; minor earth tremors occur daily in one place or another; and lands have risen or fallen, slowly but measurably, within historic times. We measure our history in years, but the Earth measures time in millions of years, enough time for each tiny change to be multiplied over and over into a major change. The upturned layers of the Mitten Park Fault below you dramatize such a change. This is the same fault noted at stop number seven, but here the Green River has sliced through it to reveal the broken rocks in cross section. Movement along the fault probably began with the uplifting of the region around 50 million years ago, and may have continued off and on almost to the present. Each shift, perhaps accompanied by what we would call a major earthquake, might have been only a few inches, but over the ages many little shifts added up to a total displacement of about 3,000 feet (920 meters) from one side of the fault to the other.",

    "bodyText": "People can also alter the land. While our changes are usually not on the same scale as natural forces, they often occur much more rapidly. In the 1950s, controversy arose over a proposal to build a dam for water storage and power generation in Dinosaur National Monument directly below this point at the head of Whirlpool Canyon. Many people protested that the Green and Yampa Canyons deserved to remain in their natural state. Ultimately, the protests were heeded and a dam was instead built at Flaming Gorge, 70 miles (113 Kilometers) upstream on the Green River from here.<br /> <br /> Even though the dam was located outside the monument, it still affects this area. Stream side plants, some considered invasive, are no longer scoured out by spring floods and are spreading. Native fish, adapted to muddy water have retreated to the Yampa River because most of the Green River’s sediment now settles behind the dam. Four of these fish are now Federally listed as Endangered Species.<br /> <br /> Changes such as these may or may not seem significant, but they illustrate an important, sometimes forgotten fact: despite our power to shape our world, we are still subject to interdependent, natural processes. Every change we make sets in motion more changes, often far reaching and acting faster than some natural systems can react.<br /> <br /> National Parks and Monuments were created to preserve places like Harpers Corner. If you could come back 100 years from now, what changes do you think you would see? As you retrace your steps along the trail, take a moment to think about your role as a steward for wild places like Dinosaur National Monument.",

Pat wandered into the area in the early 1880s and for 30 years lived a hermit’s life in caves and cabins along the lower Yampa Canyon and Pool Creek. The latter area is often called Pat’s Hole after him.<br /> <br /> The canyon walls have sheltered people since ancient times. Drawings pecked into Pool Creek’s cliffs show that the Fremont people, who were hunters and farmers, lived here nearly 1000 years ago. They were probably lured by the magic of water in a thirsty land, just as many people have been since then.</p>",

    "bodyText": "Echo Park, at the junction of the Green and Yampa Rivers, is not only the geographic heart of Dinosaur National Monument, but a key location in the area’s history. The ruggedness of the land limited exploration by routes other than by water. William H. Ashley, a trapper looking for beaver pelts, conducted the first recorded expedition down the Green River in 1825. In the weeks that it took his party to pass through these canyons, the rapids nearly wiped out his small, hide covered bullboats. Having survived the ordeal, Ashley and his men went on to explore other areas of the American West.<br /> <br /> Nearly half a century passed before the Green River was seriously challenged again, this time by John Wesley Powell in 1869. Powell’s group lost a wooden boat in a rapid upstream from here, which they appropriately named Disaster Falls. Echo Park, where they listened to their voices bouncing off Steamboat Rock, was a welcome rest after days of battling white water. The party followed the Green to its junction with the Colorado River and continued on through the Grand Canyon. Echo Park, where Powell camped, remains a peaceful retreat.",

When geologic forces uplifted this area to its present elevation, faulting occurred. The rock layers were bent and broken as some blocks of land were pushed higher than others. You are standing on the edge of one of the high blocks from which the younger sandstone has been eroded away. In the low block to the east erosion has not progressed as far. The older limestone and shale are still buried beneath the sandstone, Faults contribute to the vastly different appearance of each canyon.",

Not likely, but their rounded shape does suggest that they rolled a long way from somewhere. The same quartzite forms much of the Uinta Mountains west of here, so these rocks may have been washed down from the mountains long before the Green River had carved Whirlpool Canyon. Now, stranded far from their source; they add another element of mystery to a landscape which has puzzled geologists since Powell’s time.",

    "bodyText": "In 1910, Jack Chew was searching for a good home for both his family and his cattle. He found it here, in the area known as Pool Creek. In a time and place where self-reliance was as necessary as water, Pool Creek provided the raw materials the Chew family needed to build their future. In addition to critical water sources, the surrounding hills offered good winter grazing and timber for building homes, storage houses, fences, and fires in the cold winter. In their time here, the Chew family planted orchards and gardens, and dug irrigation ditches. With hard work and nature's support, they made a home that sustained them for more than half a century. Jack's son, Rial Chew, sold the 1,900 acres of the ranch within Dinosaur National Monument to the National Park Service in 1966.<br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "At the historic Chew Ranch, a metal-covered wagon stands on wooden wheels between a log cabin and a decaying wooden fence that was once a corral. Across the road, the whitewash paint is fading from an abandoned house, which sits beneath some river cottonwoods, which shade the home on warm afternoons. There is a wayside exhibit near of one of the log cabins. The predominant picture is black and white and blurry, and shows three people in front of a log house coved with ivy. The picture description reads: \"Mary Chew and sons Rial (left) and Ralph (right) stand in front of the cabin built in 1911. The cabin burned in 1942\". Above this picture, the main wayside text reads: \"A Good Home. Jack Chew was searching for a good home for both his family and his cattle. He found it here at Pool Creek, one of the first ranches established in what is now Dinosaur National Monument, and home to three generations of Chews. When the Chews arrived, there were just the raw materials of a promising future. Pool Creek provided water, nearby areas offered good winter grazing, and trees in the surrounding mountains supplied timber. For the Chews and others who homesteaded this rugged, arid landscape, self-reliance was as necessary as water. The Chews established orchards, planted gardens, and dug irrigation ditches. With hard work and nature's resources, the Chews made a home that sustained them for more than half a century.\" On the right-hand side of the wayside is a timeline. All the pictures are small squares in black and white beside informational text. The first picture shows Jack and Mary chew in front of a log house circa 1940. The text reads, \"1910. Jack and Mary Chew and 6 of their 12 children move to Pool Creek. The family lives together in a dugout house. In 1911, they build a one-room cabin.\" The second picture shows Rial Chew on a horse in 1916. The text states, \"1920s. Mary and sons, Rial and Douglas, manage the ranch. Rial, who eventually becomes the sole owner of the property, increases the ranch to more than 2,250 acres.\" The third picture shows Rial Chew's sheep herd in a photo without a date: \"1930s. In addition to cattle, Rial begins raising sheep. Because sheep produce two marketable crops, wool and mutton, they're often more profitable than cattle.\" The fourth picture shows Rial Chew and four of his family members in 1955. The text beside it reads, \"1940s. Rial Chew builds the ranch house for his growing family. The family begins to spend winters in Vernal so that the children can attend school.\" The fifth and last picture shows the Dinosaur National Monument sign at the Utah entrance to the park: \"1966. Rial Chew sells the 1,900 acres of the ranch that are within Dinosaur National Monument to the National Park Service.\"",

Two large blocks of land have slipped downward along the Yampa Fault and the Red Rock Fault, forming giant steps, or benches. Although the underlying rock of each bench is the same Weber Sandstone, differences in elevation and moisture dramatically affect the vegetation. Sagebrush and grasses dominate the lower benches, while pinyon pines and juniper trees forest this area. The pinyon-juniper landscape at this stop is a hallmark of many arid areas in the West. At Dinosaur, these forests support diverse native vegetation and can be very old. Intense fires, capable of altering entire stands of trees, are fairly rare here; some pinyons are over 700 years old. Today, pinyons and junipers are almost always associated with each other and are expected to be seen together, but this has not always been the case. Junipers actually arrived in the area about 9000 years ago. Pinyons arrived much later, around the mid-1200s.",

This grassy area near the river features abundant forage, attracting many early settlers, including the Ruple family. In April 1883, Henry and May Ruple homesteaded in Island Park and established a cattle ranch. They built a multi-story cabin with a stone fireplace—a fine house for anyone in such a remote area. After they finished construction, they were 18 miles from the nearest neighbors. The family ran cattle from Island Park to Wild Mountain, 10 miles away. In 1915, the Ruple’s son Hod took over the property and switched from cattle to sheep ranching. Sheep were better suited to the harsh, high desert climate and were an important part of the region’s early economy. The Ruples sold the majority of the property in 1945, but the family still retains a portion of the original homestead outside of the monument boundary.",

    "bodyText": "This hike takes you through a diversity of scenery, including the multi-hued panorama of Island Park, grasslands, desert shrub community, and sandstone canyons. The Island Park Trail connects the Jones Hole Trail with the Island Park area. It follows the historic route that rangers used to access the Jones Hole area prior to the construction of Jones Hole National Fish Hatchery and its access road.<br /> <br /> Approximately midway along the route, the trail leaves the monument and crosses land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for several miles. The trail receives minimal maintenance and may be faint or hard to follow in places. Route finding skills and the ability to use a map and compass are important if you plan to hike this trail.<br /> <br /> A detour down Sage Creek will take you to the dramatic upturned rock layers of the Island Park Fault. Hikers will need to plan on hiking the trail to return to their start point or arrange vehicle shuttles. This is not a loop trail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Length:</strong> 8 miles one way between Ruple Ranch and the junction with the Jones Hole Trail at Ely Creek. If you hike from the Jones Hole Fish Hatchery all the way to Ruple Ranch, the length will be 10 miles one way.<br /> <br /> <strong>Level of Difficulty: </strong>Difficult. Trail may be tough to follow in some areas. Route finding may be necessary. Portions are steep and rocky. Other areas pass through grasslands with no shade.<br /> <br /> <strong>Trailhead Location:</strong> You can access the trail from either the Jones Hole Trail at Ely Creek or Ruple Ranch. The trail is easier to follow going from Jones Hole to Ruple. If you start from Ruple Ranch, park near the historic corrals and follow an overgrown road/trail northeast towards the low hills. A rock cairn at the foot of one of the hills marks the trail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Your Safety:</strong> Be prepared for desert hiking. Take a hat, sunscreen, and water. Let someone know where you are going, and when to expect you back. Wear comfortable shoes, such as hiking or athletic shoes. Use caution near cliffs! The trail passes through grasslands where there is no shade. This is mountain lion and bear country. Keep children close. Store food properly.<br /> <br /> <strong>Rules and Regulations:</strong> <ul> <li>Pets are not allowed on this trail or other areas in the monument's backcountry.</li> <li>Carry out all trash.</li> <li>Collecting artifacts, fossils, plants, antlers, rocks, or other objects is prohibited.</li> <li>Do not feed or approach wildlife.</li> <li>Biking is not permitted on this trail.</li> <li>Backcountry permits are required for overnight camping in the monument's backcountry.</li> </ul>",

Josie Morris once poured heart and soul into endless hours of chopping wood, cooking meals, milking cows, entertaining guests, and tending the chicken coop and vegetable garden.<br /> <br /> Look closer at the walls and envision a bed where Josie slept through bitter cold nights. Breathe in and imagine the rich aroma of Josie’s homebrewed coffee and homemade biscuits. Envision how it would have been to be a guest at the generous hostess’ table. Take a moment to sit in the shade of the trees surrounding Josie’s cabin – trees she carefully planted to provide the shade and fruit necessary for survival in a harsh environment.<br /> <br /> Walk the short trails into Box Canyon and Hog Canyon, where Josie penned her livestock; the wooden fence still stands. Imagine living in this place without plumbing, electricity, or neighbors for over fifty years. Relax and let the stillness enchant you; it is this same peacefulness that Josie may also have felt here.",
    "audioDescription": "This outdoor area features a low log cabin surrounded by tall trees. Fences and the remains of some out buildings ring the former homestead. A large rock mountain rises to the north of the parking area. Water gushes from a piped spring and flows into a nearby channel towards a pond Josie Morris built. Nearby waysides provide information on the site. The text on the first one reads: Josie Bassett Morris made her home here until 1964. Today you’re welcome to explore her homestead. Sit under the trees near Josie’s cabin. She planted and nurtured them to provide fruit and shade. Walk the short trails to the canyons where Josie penned her livestock; the wooden fences she built still stand. Follow the spring water that flows through ditches Josie dug to irrigate her gardens and orchards. Can you imagine what it was like to live here as Josie did for 50 years...without plumbing, electricity, or neighbors? The text on the second one reads: Old homesteads are scattered throughout Dinosaur National Monument, each a memorial to hope and hard work. This cabin and the nearby structures are part of the homestead established by Josie Bassett Morris in the early 1900s. Nearing 40 years of age, divorced and with her children grown, Josie wanted a home of her own. She chose this spot for its plentiful water and good pasture, the natural resources necessary to grow fruits and vegetables and raise cattle. Braided rugs softened the cabin floors, handmade quilts warmed the beds, and Josie’s favorite pictures hung on wallpapered walls. In summer, beds of cosmos, marigolds, and poppies ringed the cabin. Family and friends from Vernal often visited. There was always lots of work and never much money, but life at Cub Creek suited Josie’s independent spirit. She lived in this cabin until shortly before her death in 1964 at age 90.",

    "bodyText": "The vegetation here is markedly different from that of the surrounding sagebrush steppe. This north facing slope experiences less direct sunlight and therefore retains more moisture. These conditions encourage the growth of large trees, like aspens and Douglas-firs. This montane forest is only found over 7000 feet elevation and covers less than 5% of Dinosaur’s<br /> 211,000 acres.<br /> <br /> Douglas-fir trees live an incredibly long time; some are hundreds of years old. Over the years, they have survived many harsh winters and provided animals with food and shelter. Each cone contains 20 to 30 winged seeds, dispersed by wind. These seeds provide critical nourishment to a variety of birds and small mammals like mice, voles, shrews, and chipmunks.<br /> <br /> Aspen trees have also adapted to this higher elevation. The thin white layer of outer bark conceals a green layer underneath. This part of the bark is photosynthetic, allowing these trees to produce energy throughout the winter when leaves are absent. An entire stand of trees is often only one individual organism sharing an interconnected root system. As conifers grow and eventually replace aspen trees, the root system remains dormant underground for years. While a forest fire may destroy a conifer stand, it provides aspens with an opportunity to regrow, beginning the cycle anew.",

    "bodyText": "Each step leads you through rock layers with different colors, textures, and fossils. Sometimes these differences are subtle, sometimes striking. Most of the Morrison Formation is mudstone and clay, but watch for the trail spur that follows a sandstone cliff. This part of the Morrison Formation is made up of river-deposited sand and gravel. Based on radiometric dating from volcanic ash, in older and younger layers on either side of the sandstone wall, this layer is estimated to be about 151 million years old. Fossil fragments of dinosaurs are embedded in the cliff along with impressions of freshwater clams. The Morrison Formation trail spur follows the same sandstone layer that is exposed in the Quarry Exhibit Hall. However, this cliff has not been worked on by paleontologists to make the bones easier to see. The first fossils along the spur are fragments that are shiny and dark orange in color. Some have a spongey-looking interior which contained bone marrow. Their texture is generally smooth and their size ranges from 1/2 inch to 10 inches in diameter. <br /> <br /> As you hike along the cliff, the quality and size of the fossil bones increases. Just past the mid-point of the spur, the trail dips a few feet. From here, look up about 10 feet on the cliff face to see eight vertebrae. At the very end of the spur, a large femur rests in the rock. Sharp eyes can find more bones, depending on the angle of the sun. More than eleven species of dinosaurs have been discovered in the Morrison Formation within the monument. They range in size from about seven inches to nearly 100 feet, with some sauropods exceeding 50,000 pounds. New research on non-dinosaur fossils such as small animals, plant remains, pollen, and insect trackways tell us more about the environment in which these animals lived. Based on this research, scientists believe that around 150 million years ago, the area was semi-arid and warm, with year-round streams. Ferns dominated the plant life, along with conifers, ginkgo trees, tree ferns and horsetail rushes. <br /> <br /> When you return to the main trail, you return to the mudstone and clay layers of the Morrison Formation. Soon you will leave the Jurassic period and enter the Cretaceous, marked by a brown sandstone in the Cedar Mountain Formation. A species of sauropod named Abydosaurus mcintoshii was found during the 1990s in this formation in the monument, proving that paleontologists still have much left to discover. ",

Look for the silvery gray mounds of shale rock between the prominent ridges of the Muddy and Frontier sandstones. The older Muddy Sandstone contains 100 million year old beach sand stained bright orange and yellow by iron-rich minerals. The younger Frontier Sandstone, formed from 90 million year old beach sediments. Along the coast of an ancient sea, volcanoes (near the present California/Nevada border) spewed ash which fell into salty waters. By studying minerals decaying in the shale, geologists determined that the ash was deposited between 99 and 97 million years ago. The ash likely killed most of the fish swimming here. Currents at the bottom of the sea then scattered their scales. Look for tiny, shiny gray-to-golden fish scales fossilized in these rocks. Taking the time to discover even the tiniest of fossils can bring ancient ecosystems to life in our imaginations. ",

Pets have been attacked by wildlife, harassed and killed wildlife, bitten or disturbed other visitors, and fought with other pets.</p> <p>Pets are welcome at Dinosaur National Monument, but as a unit in the National Park Service there are regulations regarding pets that are enforced within the monument.</p> <h4>Please Keep Your Pet Leashed</h4> <p>All pets must be on a maximum 6-foot leash or physically restrained at all times. Pets may not be left unattended or tied to an object.</p> <h4>Where Pets Can Go in Dinosaur National Monument</h4> <p>You may walk leashed pets within 100 feet of developed areas such as roads, parking lots, campgrounds, day-use areas, and river launches. Pets are allowed on the following trails along the Harpers Corner Road (Colorado side): <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/plug-hat-trail.htm\">Plug Hat Butte</a> and other trails at the Plug Hat Picnic Area, Canyon Overlook, Echo Park Overlook, and Iron Springs Bench Overlook.</p> <p>In Utah, leashed pets are allowed on the short trail to Swelter Shelter Petroglyphs and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/rivertrail.htm\">River Trail</a>.</p> <h4><strong>Where Pets Cannot Go in Dinosaur National Monument</strong></h4> <p>Pets are not allowed on the shuttle or in any buildings such as monument visitor centers or the Dinosaur Quarry Exhibit Hall. Please make your visit to these buildings brief or take turns with family members to stay outside with your pet. If visiting the Dinosaur Quarry in summer, tell a ranger you are traveling with a pet and you can drive to the Quarry in your own vehicle.<br /> <br /> Pets are not permitted on trails other than those open for pets, in the monument's backcountry, or on river trips. The responsible persons of pets running-at-large will be charged for kennel or boarding costs in addition to veterinarian, transportation, and other possible fees and fines.</p> <h4><strong>Dispose of Pet Waste</strong></h4> <p>All solid pet waste must be promptly collected and thrown away as trash. Garbage cans are located near the visitor centers, at day-use areas and in campgrounds.</p> <h4><strong>Your Pet's Safety</strong></h4> <p><strong>Never Leave Pets in an Enclosed Vehicle!</strong> Do not leave pets inside a closed vehicle for even short periods of time, especially in the summer. On even a mildly warm day, the temperature in a parked car can rise to 120°f or more in a matter of minutes - even with the car windows partially open. Pets can quickly overheat and die.</p> <p>Dinosaur National Monument weather is semi-arid with hot summers. There is little to no shade. Do any hiking with your pet in the early morning or near sunset. Remember to carry plenty of water for you and your pet.</p> <p>Dinosaur National Monument is home to a variety of wildlife that can be dangerous to you and your pet such as mountain lions and bears. Even a female deer will become aggressive to protect her young. Always keep your pet on a leash.</p> <p>Many of the wildlife in Dinosaur National Monument carry diseases or parasites such as fleas that may transmit diseases such as rabies, tularemia and plague. Do not let your pet get close to or eat dead animals. Keep your pet on a leash at all times.</p> <br />   <h4>Need a Kennel?</h4> Nearby local communities may have kennels for your pets.

Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties. Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person's disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the Americans with Disability Act (ADA).</p> <p>This definition does not affect or limit the broader definition of \"assistance animal\" under the Fair Housing Act or the broader definition of \"service animal\" under the Air Carrier Access Act.</p> <p>Some State and local laws also define service animal more broadly than the ADA does. Information about such laws can be obtained from the State attorney general's office.</p> <h4>Where Service Animals Are Allowed</h4> <p>Under the ADA, State and local governments, businesses, and nonprofit organizations that serve the public generally must allow service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of the facility where the public is normally allowed to go.</p> <h4>Service Animals Must Be Under Control</h4> <p>Under the ADA, service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal's work or the individual's disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls.</p> <h4>Inquiries, Exclusions, Charges, and Other Specific Rules Related to Service Animals</h4> <ul> <li>When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person's disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.</li> <li>Allergies and fear of dogs are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service animals. When a person who is allergic to dog dander and a person who uses a service animal must spend time in the same room or facility, for example, in a school classroom or at a homeless shelter, they both should be accommodated by assigning them, if possible, to different locations within the room or different rooms in the facility.</li> <li>A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless: (1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it or (2) the dog is not housebroken. When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animal's presence.</li> <li>People with disabilities who use service animals cannot be isolated from other patrons, treated less favorably than other patrons, or charged fees that are not charged to other patrons without animals.</li> <li>Staff are not required to provide care or food for a service animal.</li> </ul>",

    "audioDescription": "The Plug Hat Butte picnic area is located about 7 miles north of the Canyon Visitor Center on the Harpers Corner Road. The Picnic Area is located on the western side of the road. The Plug Hat Trail is on the eastern side. The parking lot is a loop, offering spaces for passenger cars as well as RVs. At the center of the loop, there is a small restroom building with vault toilets inside, and a trash receptacle outside. Across from the restroom is the picnic area, under the shade of juniper and pinyon pine trees. Picnic tables and benches are located at scenic locations along Plug Hat Picnic Area Trail, which has two access points from the parking lot. Each picnic spot provides a table and a small grill. The trail runs along the edge of a fenced-in cliff. The cliff offers overlooks of Bull Canyon from above. The canyon is mostly yellow sandstone, with rough desert plants blanketing the surface. A wayside exhibit near the fence shows a photo of the same scene under a clear blue sky. Text labels on the various cliffs denote the name of each rock formation. The exhibit reads, \"BULL CANYON OVERLOOK. You are standing on the northern edge of the Colorado Plateau, a region of dramatic landscapes shaped by geologic uplift and erosion across Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. As with most of the Colorado Plateau, this view is dominated by sedimentary rock layers that formed hundreds of millions of years ago. Some began as deposits on ocean floors, others were formed by sand dunes in vast deserts. Uplift of the plateau brought a diversity of ancient environments back up to the Earth's surface as colorful rock layers. Clues to their origins are contained within the unique patterns and fossils of each formation.\" A square of text along the bottom of the wayside describes the various rock layers, \"NUGGET SANDSTONE: 190 million years ago, this region was a vast desert with shifting sand dunes. Dinosaur footprints are occasionally found in this sandstone, as are diagonal cross-beds. CARMEL FORMATION: 180 million years ago, the ocean inundated the desert, leaving behind dark red silt and mud. ENTRADA SANDSTONE: 170 million years ago, sea level dropped and the ocean retreated to the west. Coastal currents deposited sand along the beach and winds built the sand up into dunes. MORRISON FORMATION: 150 million yeard ago, rivers deposited mud and sand over a flat landscape dotted with ponds, trees, and ferns. Dinosaurs roamed the river floodplains.\" On the right-hand side of the exhibit, there is a stratigraphic column showing the order of the rock layers with their labels. It says, \"23 different rock layers record the story of change in this area's life and landscapes through time.\" Arrows pointing towards layers in the upper third of the column let the reader know that they are standing atop a bluff of Entrada Sandstone, and that the Dinosaur Quarry Exhibit Hall is located in the Morrison Rock Formation. Gates of Lodore, which is located at the far northern end of the park, is part of the Uinta Mountain Group (the oldest layer at the bottom of the column). At the very back end of the picnic area is a gate with a hiker symbol on it. Opening the gate will lead you to the Bull Canyon Rim Trail, which is unpaved and uneven. A sign displays the logos of the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park service. There are maps showing the location of the out-and-back trail. From left to right, the text boxes read, \"Reduce your impact. This trail is open to foot traffic only. Please stay on the designated trail. You will help protect this Wilderness Study Area by reducing impacts to sensitive soils and preventing the creation of redundant user-created trails. Welcome to the 1.3 mile Bull Canyon Rim Trail. This out-and-back foot trail begins and ends at Dinosaur National Monument's Plug Hat Butte Picnic Area, but is located primarily on public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) within the 12,300 acre Bull Canyon Wilderness Study Area. This cooperative partnership between the National Park Service and the BLM provides a seamless opportunity for you to enjoy your public lands. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 directed the BLM to inventory and study roadless bureau-managed lands for wilderness characteristics. Areas found to have specific characteristics outlined in the act are managed as Wilderness Study Areas to not impair suitability for designation as wilderness until the U.S. Congress makes a final determination on the area. WARNING: This trail is located in close proximity to cliffs with extreme drop offs along the entire trail. Please ensure that children always remain a safe distance from the cliff edges and be aware of your surroundings at all times, especially at the viewpoints. You are responsible for your own safety.\"",

    "audioDescription": "From the start of the trailhead, the informative signs along the trail read as follows: \"JUST ENOUGH FOR TOUGH TREES. Juniper and pinyon trees dominate this community of plants and animals. Below 6,000 feet in elevation, winter-cold air inversions limit juniper survival. Above 7,000 feet, winter temperatures of long duration limit juniper and pinyon growth. The higher elevation traps more winter snow and summer thunder showers than in the desert shrub community. This extra moisture is just enough to allow juniper and pinyon trees to flourish.\" [A diagram shows a simple illustration of a mountain, with lines denoting the elevations and associated plant communities. It lets the reader know that they are standing in pinyon pine and juniper forest habitat between 6,000 and 8,000 feet.] \"UTAH JUNIPER (It is not a cedar). Mule deer browse juniper leaves in the winter, and the woodland provides protective winter habitat. Pinyon pine grow more successfully where pioneering junipers provide a shady and cooler micro-climate. Connections abound in the juniper and pinyon pine forest. Evergreen foliage attracts insects and wary birds who nest in junipers and eat the insects. Juniper berries are eaten by jackrabbits, birds, and coyotes. The hard seeds survive animal digestive tracts and are dispersed in their droppings. Inspect the tree's scale-like leaves. Small, wax-covered leaves prevent the loss of excessive moisture. Use your nose to smell the aroma.\" [This older metal sign has images of plants, animals, and text scattered all over it. The animals shown include: mule deer, pinyon jay, jackrabbit, western bluebird, plain titmouse (bird), common bushtit (bird), evening grosbeak (bird), and coyote.] \"PINYON BED & BREAKFAST. The pinyon pine and juniper forest supports many creatures. Can you think of predators that eat the insects, mammals, and birds dependent on this woodland? If the pinyon and juniper woodlands were lost, how could you suffer? Pinyon needles use solar energy to convert air, water, and minerals into plant material (food for some). Food and shelter is provided for more dependent creatures that are part of the web of life. Pinyon nuts are eaten by pinyon mice, cliff chipmunks, bushy-tailed woodrats, black bears, and people. Phloem (part of the bark that moves nutrients up the tree) is eaten by porcupines in winter and larvae of bark and engraver beetles. Dianthidium bees build their hive in pine pitch tucked into bark fissures or beneath rocks. Xyla sawfly larvae subsist on plant pollen until they are ready to drop to the ground where they burrow into the soil to pupate. Pinyon needles are browsed by mule deer and eaten by a resident sawfly, Neodiprion edulicolus.\" [This sign offers illustrations of all the animals mentioned in the text.] \"MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL, MUTUALLY DEPENDENT. Hidden in the aroma of the pinyon woodland is a unique natural dependence. Pinyon nuts feed the birds and the birds plant the tree. Pinyon jays nest in juniper, pinyon, and ponderosa pine. Flocks of pinyon jays and Clark's nutcrackers wheel and sweep through the woodland, harvesting the pinyon nuts. Seeds are buried at the flock's traditional nesting area. Incubating pinyon jay females subsist on cached nuts, as do nestlings. Not all the cashed nuts will be eaten; some will sprout to perpetuate the woodland. Around the end of August, seeds in the green, pitchy, and tightly closed cones ripen. The presence of green cones actually stimulates testis development in male pinyon jays at the right time for late summer breeding. Up to 20 seeds can be temporarily stored in the jay's elastic throat, and 95 seeds can be stored in a special pouch beneath the nutcracker's tongue for transport.\" [This sign displays illustrations of pinyon jays and Clark's nutcracker, along with an image of the green pinyon cones.] \"CHOICES. Nature provides commodities which support jobs. Some people believe the pinyon and juniper woodland acreage is wasted unless livestock graze and fence post are harvested. Some believe preserving the pinyon and juniper woodland has its own intrinsic values, providing silence, maintaining biological diversity, and continuing plant and animal relationships. What do you think? As a consumer of nature's commodities, you should decide!\" [This older metal sign has 3 illustrations. The top shows yellow bulldozers felling the forest. The bottom left shows a lumberjack cutting a pine with a chainsaw. The bottom right shows a lizard beside a beat up soda can, half-buried in the dirt.]",

Over the last thousand years, water flowing in the creek channel on the west side of this canyon eroded that access, leaving the petroglyphs where we see them today.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't touch!</strong> Petroglyphs and pictographs are fragile, irreplaceable records of the past that many still hold sacred. Touching them can leave skin oils behind, and tracings or rubbings can ruin the designs. Federal law protects all artifacts, including these sites. Do your part to respect and protect the past, and report any vandalism you find.<br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "In the area where you park, the Echo Park road is a rust red color. A sign that says \"Petroglyphs\" has an arrow directing visitors down a short dirt trail surrounded by trees. Be careful! At the end of this trail, there is a small creek with no fence. Beyond it, a sheer red rock face stands tall. It is stained with gray-black streaks, known as \"desert varnish.\" Approximately 35 feet (10 meters) up the rock face from where the ground is today, several clusters of organized pockmarks form images. Upon careful inspection, they appear to be human-like figures with ornate clothing. These are the Pool Creek petroglyphs. There are two waysides in this area. The one on the left is larger. The main image is a black and white drawing of two indigenous people using tools to create the petroglyphs. The person on the left stands, while the one on the right kneels on a large rock. The main text reads: \"Out of Reach. Carved into the cliff face high above are several human-like figures, each with what appear to be elaborate headdresses or necklaces. Approximately a thousand years ago, the Fremont Culture created these petroglyphs. How did they do it? Today the petroglyphs are inaccessible, but this wasn't always the case. When the Fremont made these images, the ground surface extended to the level of the petroglyphs, approximately 35 feet up the cliff face. Over the last thousand years, the water flowing in the creek channel on the west side of this canyon has eroded that access, leaving the petroglyphs high above human reach.\" On the right side of this wayside, there's closeup image of one of the petroglyphs. It's a cluster of carved dots, which branch out on either side. Beneath it are several etched squares arranged in a semi-circular pattern. A label pointing to the dots says, \"Dot-pattern design.\" A label pointing to the squares says, \"Chipped design.\" Below it, more informational text reads: \"Each of these petroglyphs includes many small holes drilled into the sandstone cliff. Within Dinosaur, this dot-pattern design is only found here at Pool Creek. Fremont Petroglyphs were often made by chipping away sections of rock to create a shape or an outline. This style can be seen in the lower part of the petroglyph above.\" In the lower right of this same wayside, a black bar issues the warning: \"These fragile designs can never be replaced. Do your part to protect them. Do not touch: the oils on our hands erode the petroglyphs. Do not trace or rub the petroglyphs: the soft sandstone rock is easily damaged.\" To the right of the larger wayside, a smaller, older one displays a map. It indicates the relative locations and shapes of the petroglyphs in the rock face 35 feet above where the sign's viewer would stand.",

    "bodyText": "What is happening beneath our feet to result in such a dramatic landscape at the surface? The noticeable curve of Split Mountain is part of an anticline - an upward fold of rock. While Split Mountain arcs up, other features seem to sag. The sags are called synclines. This underlying rollercoaster of rock formed when formerly flat sedimentary layers were compressed and wrinkled. Forces related to the building of the Rocky and Uinta Mountains 70 - 40 million years ago caused the uplifting, tilting, faulting and folding of the rock layers. While some layers erode into mounds, others stick out as ridges. <br /> <br /> Erosion reveals not only a variety of shapes, but also an array of colors. Look back across the Moenkopi Formation labyrinth you just traversed. In the distance you will see a swath of red rock known as “The Racetrack.” The “lanes” are made up of Triassic-aged Moenkopi and Chinle formations, seemingly wrapping around the corner. These rust colored rocks are rich in iron and are sometimes called the Triassic Red Beds. Iron is also responsible for many of the yellow, orange and greenish tints to the rock layers here. Obviously inspired by the colors and shapes from near this ridge, Ernest Untermann brought his paints and easel to this area in the mid-1900s. A German immigrant, he became known as “The Artist of the Uintas,” and Dinosaur’s dramatic landscapes spoke to him. The sedimentary rocks around you were originally flat, horizontal layers when they were deposited. Each layer represents its own story of a different past environment, different fauna and flora, a succession of time and life on our planet. For millions of years, these stories were buried deep underground. Thanks to uplift and erosion, they are once again free to tell colorful tales of change over time.",

It is mostly cyanobacteria (sometimes called blue-green algae), and also includes lichens, mosses, green algae, microfungi and bacteria. It takes many years for this soil to form and support life. While cyanobacteria are mobile and will regenerate if disturbed, lichens and mosses are not, and will die if trampled. Blown by wind or moved by other forces, it is estimated that lichens will recolonize an area in 45 years, while it takes mosses an estimated 250 years. These crusts control erosion and fix nitrogen, helping other plants to grow. Please stay on the trail to help preserve these unique soils.<br /> <br /> All around you is Ephedra viridis, commonly called Mormon Tea because it was used by early Native Americans and settlers to make an invigorating tea. It is an important browse crop for livestock and also deer, elk, and sheep, especially in the winter months. The large seeds are a good protein source for small mammals and birds. The drug ephedrine, an antidepressant and decongestant, can be extracted from this and other Ephedra species. This area is a great place to look for animal tracks, scat, and game trails. Can you distinguish between carnivore and herbivore scat? Look for fur and bones in the long, slender pieces of mountain lion, coyote, and bobcat scat. Deer, elk and rabbit scat will be more smooth and rounded. You may see game trails in this area, made primarily by elk and deer. See if you can distinguish these game trails from the people trail you are following!",

A massive system that makes up 2/3 of the tree’s total mass, the tap root can be 25 feet deep and lateral roots may extend out 100 feet. The juniper berry is actually a tiny pinecone, and is eaten by rabbit, fox, coyote, and many species of birds. Junipers grow slowly. Older trees, which may be 650-850 years old, have sculptural qualities. Even dead, a juniper may stand silent and strong for several hundred years. Like all of the plants at this 5,000 foot elevation, the juniper must survive on a sparse 10 inches of precipitation a year.<br /> <br /> As you hike, check out the sky and you may see a Turkey Vulture or two, flying on silent wings high above you. Lightweight for such a wide wingspan, they teeter and totter on the breeze, rarely flapping their wings. An excellent sense of smell leads Turkey Vultures to carcasses where they feed cooperatively. Think of these silent birds not as purveyors of death, but rather as elegant birds who transform death into life on the wing. Look carefully at each soaring bird and you may be lucky to see a Golden Eagle, easily confused with a vulture at first glance. The Golden Eagle, at 10 pounds, is a much heavier bird, outweighing the vulture by 6 pounds. Eagles do not teeter and totter, and they hold their wings out flat, while vultures hold their wings in a slight V-shape. Both are dark birds, the vulture is here only during the summer, the eagle a year-round bird. Perhaps a lizard has caught your attention during your hike, lending even more life to the desert. Six species of lizards are found here:<br /> sagebrush, plateau, western whiptail, shorthorned, side-blotched and tree lizard. Listen for lizards rustling about in the leaf litter, looking for spiders or insects to eat.",

Unlike most species of ash trees, which have compound leaves, this western ash has a single leaf on each stem. The red rock ridge underneath you is the Chinle Formation, formed during a time when rivers, marshes, and small lakes covered the landscape. Plants would not have included a flowering tree like the Singleleaf Ash. Instead, conifers, cycads, ferns, and horsetail plants grew here. Dinosaurs made their first appearance in this time period, about 225 million years ago. Coelophysis, a three-toed, therapod dinosaur about the size of a large dog, roamed the land. Large crocodile-type creatures called phytosaurs lurked in the waters. Imagine how different the sounds of the Triassic would be from the sounds of today!",

Can you find a layer that was accompanied by the sound of rushing water? Slower water can only carry fine sediments. Try to find a layer that would have been deposited by a quiet trickle. The surrounding cliffs, slowly eroded by wind and water, add to the diverse, sorted sediment layers. Erosion continues with each new rainstorm moving more sediment downstream. Differences in the sediment layers help natural cavities develop. Holes may be enlarged and used by squirrels and birds, as nesting sites. Listen carefully and you may hear the scratchy call of a Rock Wren or the melodic song of a Canyon Wren. Look carefully and you may see a Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel peeking out of a hole, its high pitched alarm call warning others of your presence.",

It is above your head, in the crevice between the two large rocks that form the overhang. Look for twigs, rocks and fecal pellets, all held together by shiny crystallized urine. Middens can tell us about past environments. They may exist and be added to for thousands of years. Radiocarbon dating has identified middens up to 50,000 years old. Middens may contain leaves, seeds, fruit, twigs, pollen, bone, shells and scales, leading to identification of past environments. We know from middens that Douglas Fir and Ponderosa Pine once grew in this area, during a cooler and wetter time. As the climate changed over the last 10,000 years, these species retreated to higher elevations where they are still found.<br /> <br /> You may notice some plant stumps with large root structures. Why would monument staff cut down these plants? Look around for the feathery leaves of tamarisk, also known as salt cedar. If it is blooming, it will have small, white to pink flowers. It is a non-native tree that grows in riparian areas. Brought to North America in the early 19th century for use as an ornamental wind break, and to fight erosion, it quickly spread and became an invasive weed, often outcompeting native plants. Its presence on the river banks of the Green and Yampa Rivers, and here in this intermittent stream, changes river flow and makes it difficult for deer, elk, and sheep to get to water. In 2006 and 2007, Dinosaur National Monument introduced<br /> 50,000 non-native northern tamarisk beetles to four locations in the monument. The most intensively studied biocontrol agent in North America, the beetle eats only tamarisk. While tamarisk will never be eliminated entirely, the beetles are helping to keep it under control and allow native vegetation to rebound.",

Muds and sands were deposited in thin beds on the edges and bottoms of watery areas. Reptiles and amphibians moved stealthily along shorelines and through these shallow waters, in a time before the dinosaurs. Invertebrates burrowed in the muds of the floodplains, and ammonites (a type of mollusk) swam in the seaways. Although the weathered soils of the Moenkopi Formation may look inhospitable, flowering plants like Desert Paintbrush, Pale Evening Primrose and the dramatic Prince’s Plume grow here.

One theory is that the plates contained blood vessels, to help regulate body temperature. Another idea is the plates were used for display to attract mates, like colorful feathers on a bird or antlers on a deer. The plates also could have been used for protection from predators. Since the plates were not directly attached to the bones of the skeleton, they were easily separated from the body after death. Massive spikes on the end of its tail were used in defense against predators. At Dinosaur, many isolated plates and spikes have been found throughout the Carnegie Quarry.<br /> <br /> <em>Stegosaurus</em> is one of the most easily recognized dinosaurs of the Jurassic. The plates on its back and spikes on its tail make it one of the most unique creatures of the Mesozoic (Age of Dinosaurs). The Carnegie Quarry is so rich in fossils that multiple skeletons have been mounted from early excavations at Dinosaur.<br /> <br /> In 1977 paleontologists at Dinosaur National Monument removed a juvenile <em>Stegosaurus</em> from the Carnegie Quarry face. They found limb bones, shoulder blades, most of the hips, some ribs, and skull fragments. Since plates were not found, it is unknown if juveniles had them at all.

Anon, at the word, there first came one daughter, and then came another, to second and third the request of their brother, and to hear how the water comes down at Lodore, with its rush and its roar, as many a time they had seen it before. So I told them in rhyme, for of rhymes I had store; and ‘twas in my vocation for their recreation that so I should sing; because I was laureate to them and the king. From its sources which well In the tarn on the fell; from its fountains In the mountains, its rills and its gills; through moss and through brake, it runs and it creeps for a while, till it sleeps In its own little lake. And thence at departing, awakening and starting, it runs through the reeds, and away it proceeds, through meadow and glade, in sun and in shade, and through the wood-shelter, among crags in its flurry, helter-skelter, hurry-skurry. Here it comes sparkling, and there it lies darkling; now smoking and frothing Its tumult and wrath in, till, in this rapid race on which it is bent, it reaches the place of its steep descent.”<br /> <br /> Excerpt from “ The Catarct of Lodore” by Robert Southey",

The formation originated as muds and sands laid down by a network of ancient rivers whose water nourished an abundance of plants, dinosaurs, and other animals. It is thought that during times of drought the river would dry up and there would be massive die-offs. Dinosaur carcasses collected in the river bed. When the rains returned, the river flowed again and transported bones and carcasses then buried them in sand and mud where they were preserved.",

    "bodyText": "There is a good chance that you will see cattle along the road, and may even encounter local ranchers driving their herds to better pasture. Over the last century, grazing has been a primary use of the land in and around Dinosaur National Monument. Today, grazing is still allowed at certain locations within the monument’s boundary. Many of the families permitted to pasture their animals here originally homesteaded in the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, prior to the establishment of the monument.<br /> <br /> In those days, cattle rustling was a common trade in this part of the country. Trail Draw, the small canyon before you, was part of what is now known as the Outlaw Trail. This famous backcountry route snaked through desolate, rugged terrain from Montana to New Mexico, linking well-known hideouts such as Hole in the Wall and Robber’s Roost. The most notorious outlaws that used this route were known as the Wild Bunch, led by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Legend holds that the infamous duo originally met in Browns Park, an area just north of the monument. Abundant grasslands and relatively warm winters attracted settlers to Browns Park as early as the 1870s. Outlaws frequented this isolated valley to rest and resupply.<br /> <br /> Two local residents, Ann and Josie, also known as the Bassett sisters, befriended the Wild Bunch. The Bassett family was on good terms with the outlaws, and even joined them for a Thanksgiving dinner, alongside other residents of the valley. Their friendship with the Wild Bunch may have deterred other local outlaws from rustling the Bassett’s cattle. Eventually, Josie moved to the base of Split Mountain where her homestead still stands today.",

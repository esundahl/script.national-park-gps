    "audioDescription": "Visitor Center Complex - A Mosaic Landscape - Overlook and Wayside Panel. 2 Â½ minutes.<br />Located along the bluff trail, about 90 feet (28 m) south from the \"Violent Silhouettes\" wayside panel and overlook, another angled metal wayside panel on the east side of the path offers a view of the wide, tree-covered Copper River valley to the Wrangell mountains beyond.<br />A color photograph fills the panel, showing a sea of trees with yellow and orange leaves in the foreground valley, interspersed with tall, Black and White spruce. The valley stretches across a wide expanse to a range of snow-capped mountains rising high into the clouds. Text at the top of the panel reads:<br /><br />A Mosaic Landscape<br />From a bird's eye view a mosaic of plant life covers the land. Climate conditions, soils, and past disturbances by fires and insects affect the patterns of plant growth. The greatest force influencing the boreal forest is fire. Distinct borders between stands of white spruce and aspen or paper birch indicate edges of previous fires. White spruce occupy well-drained valleys, uplands, and slopes. Black spruce colonize the poorly drained lowlands. Treeless areas-sand dunes, river bluffs, and flood plains-break the forest cover where soil development is poor or disturbance is frequent. Within the park's interior, trees begin to vanish as the elevation approaches 3,000 feet, soils thin and environmental conditions become harsher, creating a land barren of plants and covered by a perpetual blanket of ice and snow.<br /><br />At the base of the mountains in the center, on the far side of the valley, text reads:<br /><br />Alpine tundra is the plant life zone normally found at elevations above the treeline.<br />Retreating glaciers created scattered lakes by stranding blocks of ice. The ice made depressions in the landscape and melted, forming lakes.<br /><br />At the middle left, over a wide valley filled with orange and yellow trees dotted with green spruce, text reads:<br /><br />Quaking aspen and paper birch grow on ridgetops and south facing slopes. River flood plains are dominated by balsam poplar.<br /><br />At the center right, text continues:<br /><br />Fire occurs in forests every 50 to 100 years. The soil-enriched conditions following a fire favor the quick establishment of aspen and birch trees. <br /><br />Text at the center right reads:<br /><br />Black spruce grow in poorly drained and shallow or permanently frozen soils known as permafrost.<br /><br />Over a patch of green in the lower right corner, text reads:<br /><br />White spruce often occupy deep and well-drained soils.<br /><br />",

    "audioDescription": "The Ahtna Cultural Center is located about 30 feet (9 m) northwest of the Theater building along the asphalt-paved Visitor Center Complex walkway. A triangular wooden arch with wooden beams, about 20 feet (6 m) high by 20 feet (6 m) across, hangs over a concrete pad entranceway. Moving about 15 feet (4.5 m) across the concrete porch area, a set of double metal and glass doors swing outward across a metal grate. Note a couple wooden Adirondack chairs to the left of the doors. Be mindful of the threshold as you cross from the concrete porch onto a carpeted floor inside the building. About 20 feet (6 m) further along the path past the cultural center building, a full-size Alaska Native wooden fish wheel is displayed outside. The eight-foot (2.5 m) wide apparatus stands about 12 feet (3.5 m) high by 15 feet (4.5 m) long. Set into a flowing river on log floats, two large, opposing, curved, shovel-like baskets are pushed and rotated by the water like an oversized pinwheel, scooping up salmon as they swim upstream. As the basket turns, the captured fish are shunted into a six-foot (2 m) wide by four-foot (1.25 m) deep rectangular holding box attached to the side of the wheel. From a position facing the fish wheel, turn around 180-degrees, and move to the other side of the asphalt path. Directly in front of you, note another wooden structure that appears like a small, windowless log cabin on six-foot (2 m) tall stilts with a small, wood log door on the front. This is a model of a food cache for storing nuts, dried foods, and meat over the winter, protecting it from bears and other wildlife. A full-size food cache would be two- to three-times as tall as the model, with inward slanting legs to deter climbing animals. People would have to use a ladder to climb up to a narrow platform in front of the door to access the cache.",

    "audioDescription": "About 150 feet (45 m) north along the asphalt bluff path from the Violent Silhouettes wayside panel and overlook, a color photograph fills an angled, metal wayside panel. Entitled, “Walk in the Steps of Pioneers,” it shows a narrow dirt path winding through the low, mossy underbrush of a forest of spruce trees. Note that about 30 feet (9 m) south of this location, a pair of long-range binoculars, mounted atop a five-foot (1.5 m) metal pole with a concrete base, offers stunning views of the valley and mountains to the east. Note a wooden bench on the opposite side of the path across from these binoculars. Text at the bottom left of the panel provides information about some of the easy hiking trails here at the Wrangell-St. Elias Visitor Center Complex. It reads: The 1/2-mile loop trail follows even terrain, though wheelchair-users may need assistance. The trail passes along the river bluff, then cuts through the forest, connecting to a section of the historic Valdez Trail, the first all-American route into interior Alaska. A transition begins here, though it’s not obvious. But walk a short distance and you’ll see an abruptness that marks the shift from one forest successional stage to the next. Still farther, you’ll walk in the steps of pioneers who brought about great change to this wild land. Please use caution as you travel through bear country. Leave cultural sites, plants, and animals undisturbed, for future generations to enjoy. A green inset map at the lower right shows your current location with a black, “You Are Here” marker, the location of the Visitor Center with a green marker, and the paths of the trails available from this location. The Boreal Forest Trail is indicated with a solid red line, the Valdez Trail with a dotted black line, and the Copper River Bluff Trail with a solid green line. Descriptions of each of the trails at the top right of the map read: The Boreal Forest Trail is a 1/2-mile loop, partly paved, with no elevation change. The Valdez Trail is a short segment of a historic trail, gravel, and easy to walk. The Copper River Bluff Trail is a 1/2-mile loop, gravel, moderately difficult, with some elevation change and a few steep sections. Further north along the trail, a color illustration fills the face of a second, angled metal wayside panel. Entitled, “The Boreal Forest,” it shows a number of the plants, animals, and geologic features of this ecosystem. There’s the small brown and white Swainson’s Thrush, the grey and white speckled Spruce Grouse, the Yellow-rumped Warbler with blue feather and small yellow patches, and the grey, brown, and red Boreal Chickadee. A brown and grey Snowshoe Hare huddles in the underbrush, in front of a large brown moose among the trees at the back. There’s a small wolverine-like creature at the lower left, the Pine Marten, with light to dark brown fur with cream- to yellow-colored \"bib\" markings on its throat. Pink-flowered Fireweed grows beside Feather Moss, Highbush Cranberry with broad, three-lobed leaves with serrated edges, and a small shrub with clusters of small, white flowers, Labrador Tea. Text at the top left reads: The boreal forest is the northernmost and largest forest ecosystem in the world. Extreme cold and a short growing season are the main environmental factors that shape this forest. In this region, the boreal forest is composed of stands of white and black spruce, aspen, balsam poplar, birch, alder, and willow. A young forest often has more deciduous trees and shrubs. As the forest matures, spruce trees begin to dominate. Over time, the accumulation of spruce needles on the forest floor creates a thick buildup of organic matter, which decomposes slowly. This thick organic layer, in concert with canopy shade, keeps ground temperatures cool, increasing the depth of the permafrost. Permafrost causes poorly drained soils and restricts the growth of deep root systems. Dense shade, thick organic matter, and cold moist soil result in low plant diversity and an often stunted looking forest. Is the forest here young or old? Do you notice the spongy ground with organic debris and mosses? At the left, text next to a drawing of a red squirrel clinging to the side of a tree reads: The red squirrel—the sentinel of the boreal woods—sends scolding alarms throughout the forest, tipping off other animals to intruders. A mat of orange and red scales blankets the forest floor near the squirrel. Text identifies it as a: Red Squirrel Midden Spruce cones scales form middens as red squirrels discard them and eat the extracted seeds. Squirrels cache winter food deep within the middens. A cluster of rust-colored spruce branches in the center is identified as: Spruce Broom Rust Kinnikinnick host the spruce broom rust fungus. Spores released from the fungus living on kinnikinnick enter the spruce tree, causing branch clustering, which provides habitat for squirrels and birds. Text over a cluster of green spruce branches at the right reads",

    "audioDescription": "The approximately 30-foot (9 m) wide by 40-foot (12 m) deep bus shelter sits on the far southwest corner of the Visitor Center Complex parking lot. Eight-foot (2.5 m) tall logs, painted a neutral beige, support a series of triangular wooden braces and beams overhead. To the right, outside the shelter, is a line of bear-proof garbage cans. Notice a line of vertical, two-foot (60 cm) tall circular log pillars, about 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter, running north-to-south in front of the large, open-sided pavilion. These form a traffic barrier to separate the white-line painted bus unloading area from the 10-foot (2.75 m) wide asphalt pedestrian walkway in front of the shelter. Moving south into the shelter, a three-foot (1 m) tall, angled metal wayside panel in the center shows a map of Alaska. Text at the bottom of the panel reads: An Enduring Frontier Alaska boasts 24 national park units in all, protecting more than 54 million acres of Alaska’s representative natural, cultural, and historic features. Like Wrangell-St. Elias, all Alaska national parklands are preserved for present and future generations—an enduring frontier for all the world. Several areas of the map are shaded dark or light green: around Wrangell-St. Elias at the far eastern part of the state, bordering Canada; in the central part of the state around Denali; and areas further along the Cook Inlet around Lake Clark and Katmai. A key just below the map indicates anything in dark green is a National Park or Monument, while the light green signifies a National Preserve. A question in a dark green box at the lower right asks: How many Alaska national parklands will you visit? Turn around 180-degrees from this panel, and move about 10 feet (3 m) to face two, four-foot (1.25 m) wide by three-foot (1 m) tall interpretive sign panels set on an angle at the left and right. Each is mounted between two, six-foot (2 m) tall circular, beige logs. Note a wooden bench at the far left, about four feet (1.25 m) to the left of the left-hand sign, and a matching bench at the far right, to the right of the right-hand sign. Just beyond the two signs in the center, note a picnic table that stretches another eight feet (2.5 m) south toward the back of the shelter. On the front of the left-hand sign, a large black-and-white picture shows a few men leading a line of pack animals across the snow with high, dark mountains rising up in the distance. Entitled, “Intrepid Travelers,” a quote at the top right of the panel reads: The prospector... knows to an ounce what he needs for a “trip” as he calls an expedition. “Anyone that can’t ‘pack’ ninety pounds would better not come to Alaska,” they say, “for this is the least with which he can get along out ‘in the hills.’” His motto is “Never stuck.” His is the land of hope. Dora Keen, 1912 Across the bottom of the panel, note four smaller inset black-and-white photographs. At the lower left, two men carrying packs lead two horses along a narrow trail on the side of a rocky mountain. A quote above reads: In view of the fact that so little is known of the interior of the Territory of Alaska...the department commander authorizes you to proceed to that Territory. U.S. Army General Nelson A. Mile’s orders to Lieutenant Henry T. Allen, 1885 In the center, a team of four light-colored horses are harnessed to a large U.S. Mail sled in the snow with about a dozen people aboard, all wearing heavy fur coats and hats. A second quote above this photograph reads: If there was a dry thread in our clothing when we started, it didn’t remain dry long, for the whole valley was covered with rain-soaked brush, which reached to our heads or above, and so thick that with our best efforts we were three hours making the first two miles. Charles A. Morgeson, 1899 Two smaller photographs at the bottom right show a man helping another across a glacier, and a couple more pack animals hauling sleds behind them along a glaciated path. A quote above reads: Nothing to follow—just three feet of snow. Got into our snowshoes—onto the gee pole [a sled guiding pole] and gee poled the next 22 days. Lynn Smith, 1904 Moving to the panel on the front of the right-hand sign, a large black-and-white photograph shows a team of seven dogs pulling a sled across the snow. A woman sits on the sled, with a man standing at the back. Entitled, “Traversing the Wilderness,” a quote at the top right of the panel reads: The first people of interior Alaska arrived hundreds of generations ago...They moved slowly across the low-lying land known as Beringia, or the Bering Land Bridge. Jean S. Agner, Professor of Anthropology, University of Alaska, Fairbanks Along the bottom left of the panel, the first of two smaller inset black-and-white photographs show a man with a full pack on his back carrying an eight-foot (2.5 m) metal saw blade under his arm.",

The town was a stopover and service point for the trains that traveled from the copper mines at Kennecott to ships waiting for ore at the port of Cordova. A steamship passenger arriving in Cordova could travel comfortably by train to Chitina, then by stage, sleigh or horse to Fairbanks other interior destinations. Native trails were improved to provide access to resources such as gold and copper. This Copper River area supported a population of approximately 200 Athabaskan Indian people when U.S. Army explorer, Lt. Henry T. Allen, traveled up the Copper River in 1885. They found the area very sparsely populated by people who followed fish and ani-mal migrations and lived in seasonal camps. One winter village was located southeast of the current site of Chitina, where Taral Creek enters the Copper River. When mines and the railroad came to the area, some Alaska Natives found employment in those enterprises. By 1928, the Bureau of Indian Affairs had built a school near Chitina to serve the region. Population ebbed, the school closed, and Chitina faded from its earlier ambition to be the metropolitan center of the Interior. However, the town did not completely “die out” as the area residents struggled to support themselves in the decades following the Kennecott Mine closure. Though some people still came to take salmon from the Copper River, Chitina had become a “ghost town,” as evidenced by town father O.A. Nelson’s ghostly art work which adorned many Chitina buildings in the 1940’s.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chitina Chronology</strong><br /> 1885 Army explorer Henry T. Allen encounters Ahtna natives.<br /> 1908 Missouri schoolteacher, O.A.

    "audioDescription": "Chitina Ranger Station. 2 Â½ minutes.<br />Located at the end of the paved Edgerton Highway and the beginning of the gravel McCarthy Road, a six-foot (2 m) tall wooden sign with the National Park Service logo welcomes you to the one-story log cabin Chitina Ranger Station. <br />Note the station is only open during the season from Thursday through Sunday from 10:00 AM to 4:30 PM. An eight-foot tall wooden information bulletin board and kiosk stands outside at the side of the building near the front. <br />At the far end of the cabin, a set of five, five-foot (1.5 m) wide wooden stairs with wooden handrails on either side lead up to a five-foot (1.5 m) wooden platform and the front screen door of the station. The screen door opens out and the inside wooden door opens in. To the right of the door, note a narrow wooden box with a hinged lid hanging on the side of the building with brochures and other park information.<br />Inside, the log cabin station is decorated with historic photographs featuring the town of Chitina as a transportation hub, \"\"where the rails meet the trails.\"\" Trains, stagecoaches, dog sleds, and steamboats all passed through Chitina on their way to the mining and commerce centers of Alaska during Chitina's boom years, 1910-1938. You can watch the 22-minute park movie \"\"Crown of the Continent\"\", and view the many photos that depict early life in Chitina. Hikers can obtain information regarding backcountry routes, file trip plans, and obtain bear resistant food containers. Federal subsistence fishing permits and fishwheel registration is also available at this location.<br />Facing the front door, wooden platform continues about eight feet (2.5 m) to the right, then turns left down a 20-foot (6 m) long wheelchair-accessible ramp along the far side of the building. Note there is only a shallow, two-inch (5 cm) tall lip on either side of the ramp, and no handrails.<br />At the end of the ramp, note a small, two-inch (5 cm) drop down from the wood ramp onto a gently sloping gravel path, leading to the side door of the station, with a second set of wooden stairs.<br />There are a couple picnic tables on a wide grassy area across the small curved one-lane driveway in front of the station, and a couple bear-proof garbage cans at the head of the driveway.<br /><br />",

Several benches and picnic tables share the open space inside. Along one side of the wayside at the center, note a set of three general information panels about the Ahtna people and history of Chitina itself.<br />Note one, six-foot (2 m) tall boulder on the sidewalk at one end of the wayside, with three smaller boulders at the opposite side end the shelter, next to the van accessible area of the parking lot. Wheelchair ramps from the parking lot up onto the sidewalk are located at either end of the pavilion.<br />Note a small wooden red and white vault restroom building located at the far end of the parking lot, about 130 feet (40 m) along the sidewalk leading away from the shelter. The women's room is on the left, and the men's room is on the right. Both facilities are wheelchair accessible.<br /><br />",

    "audioDescription": "Visitor Center Complex - Entrance Loop. 10 minutes. As you enter the park from Richardson Highway, a 100-foot (30 m) long semi-circular pullout to the left from the main park road guides you in the Entrance Loop of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. On the grass median between the main road and entrance loop, a large, eight-foot (2.5 m) wide by six-foot (2 m) tall dark gray stone sign with the words \"Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve\" in the center in white welcomes you to the park. The silhouette of a tall copper-colored mountain range frames the letters at the top, with a wide, swirling, backwards \"S\" underneath the letters representing a flowing river at the bottom. Mounted to the face of the sign at the top right, note a two-foot (60 cm) tall brown wooden plaque in the shape of a downward pointing arrowhead: the National Park Service logo. It shows a tall evergreen tree by a river, in front of a range of snow-capped mountains, with an image of a bison at the bottom. The larger park sign is framed with large, 10-inch (25 cm) diameter beige-painted logs along the top, bottom, and sides. Words on a thin horizontal wood panel hanging at the bottom of the sign lists the Visitor Center Hours: 9AM to 6PM.Facing this sign, about 30 feet (9 m) to the left, across the entrance loop road, a series of three, three-foot (1 m) wide by four-foot (1.25 m) tall information panels present some introductory information about the park. Filling the face of the left panel, a large color photograph shows a winding glacier at the foot of tall, snow-covered mountains with blue sky overhead. Entitled, \"Now that you are here...,\" the top of the panel contains four small inset pictures of four ranger stations or visitor centers within the park, along with the addresses and services available at each one. Left-to-right, top-to-bottom, they are: Wrangell-St. Elias Visitor CenterCopper Center, AlaskaMile 106.8 Richardson Highway907-822-7250ServicesInformation desk, trip planning, backcountry information, exhibits, bookstore, ranger programs, junior ranger program, park film, nature trail, picnic tables, Ahtna Cultural Center, subsistence permits, public phone, toilets.Slana Ranger StationSlana, AlaskaMile 0.2 Nabesna Road907-822-7401ServicesInformation desk, trip planning, backcountry information, exhibits, bookstore, junior ranger program, park film, ATV permits, subsistence permits, Nabesna Road conditions, public phone, toilets.Chitina Ranger StationChitina, AlaskaMile 33 Edgerton Highway907-823-2205ServicesHistoric log cabin, information desk, trip planning, backcountry information, bookstore, junior ranger program, park film, picnic tables, subsistence permits, McCarthy Road conditions, pit toilets.The Kennecott Visitor CenterKennecott, AlaskaFive miles north of McCarthy, Alaska907-554-1105ServicesHistoric buildings, information desk, backcountry information, trip planning, exhibits, bookstore, ranger programs, junior ranger program, park film, hiking trails, pit toilets.Two maps inset at the bottom of the panel show a map of Nabesna Road at the left, and McCarthy Road at the right, along with the trails, landmarks, and facilities nearby. Text below the Nabesna Road map at the bottom left reads:Things to Know- This adventurous drive begins at Mile 60 Glenn Highway (Tok Cutoff).- Allow 1.5 hours for this scenic 42-mile drive one-way.- This is a remote area with limited services. There is no gasoline.- Gasoline is available in Chistochina (28 miles south) or Mentasta (18 miles north).- We highly recommend you carry a full-sized spare tire and an adequate jack.- Generally, this gravel road is passable by two-wheel drive vehicles.- However, following a heavy rain, stream crossings can become impassable.- A high clearance vehicle is recommended if driving beyond Mile 29 Nabesna Road.- Private land adjoins much of the road. Please respect private property.- Cell phone coverage is limited.- Drive slowly, carefully, and courteously.- Pick up a free Nabesna Road audio tour at the Visitor Center or Slana Ranger Station.Text below the McCarthy Road map at the bottom right reads:Things to Know- This spectacular drive begins at Mile 33 Edgerton Highway in Chitina, Alaska.- Allow 2 to 3 hours for this scenic 60-mile drive one-way.- This is a remote area with limited services.- There is no gasoline available in McCarthy or Kennecott.- Gasoline is available in Kenny Lake, Mile 7.1 and in Chitina, Mile 33 Edgerton Highway.- We highly recommend you carry a full-sized spare tire and an adequate jack.- Generally, this unpaved narrow and winding road is passable by two-wheel drive vehicles.- However, expect poor conditions with possible stream crossings and road damage.- Private land adjoins much of the road. Please respect private property.- Cell phone coverage is limited.- Drive slowly, carefully, and courteously.- Pick up a free McCarthy Road audio tour at the Visitor Center or Chitina Ranger Station.The center panel displays a large map of the Wrangell-St. Elias region, highlighted in several different shades of green. A key at the top right explains that the different colors are attributable to the fact that:Approximately 750,000 of the 13+ million acres of land within the boundaries of Wrangell-Wt. Elias National Park and Preserve are non-federal lands belonging to Alaska Native Corporations, other private owners, and the State of Alaska. Significant amounts of these non-federal lands are located along the McCarthy/Nabesna Roads and along the east bank of the Copper River. Please do not trespass. If you have questions, ask at visitor centers or ranger stations.A list of Alaska Native Place Names at the right compares the English place name to the Native place name, along with its language and meaning.Words at the bottom of the panel read:Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and PreserveAn area larger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined, this park is named for the two mountain ranges that form its backbone. These remnant volcanos, sculpted by glaciers, define this vast wilderness. Here you find a complex intact ecosystem with outstanding opportunities for exploration partnered with inhabited connections to the land.Only two roads enter the park-McCarthy and Nabesna. Each offers spectacular vistas and multiple recreational opportunities. Hiking trails turn into unmarked routes leading you to rewarding experiences. Come climb mountains, float rivers, explore glaciers, or fly above it all. Come, but come prepared. Stop at a park visitor center for trip planning advice.Four additional color photographs at the bottom of the panel highlight just a few of the things to experience within the park, including a backpacker cutting a new path across a field of purple wildflowers; the 14-story red concentrating mill at the Kennecott Mine; an aerial view of a glacier flowing around tall mountains; and an aerial view of a sun-speckled blue-green coastal region.An illustration at the top of the right-hand panel, entitled \"Plan Your Visit,\" shows a birds-eye view of the Visitor Center Complex. Paved walkways wind in, around, and among a central, roughly semi-circular cluster of five buildings. Left-to-right are the restrooms, Exhibit Hall, Visitor Center, Theater, and the Ahtna Cultural Center. Towards the upper left, the paths continue back to a Viewpoint and Amphitheater overlooking the bluffs behind the buildings.Text at the top right of the panel reads:Welcome to Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. Here you have anopportunity to experience a wild corner of Alaska on a grand scale. Even thoughvisitor services are limited, access is challenging, weather varies widely, and youmay encounter a variety of wildlife, the rewards are well worth the effort. Comevisit us at the park visitor center to map your adventure!At the lower left, a green inset map shows the location of several hiking trails within the Visitor Center Complex. A black \"You Are Here\" marker at the lower left of map indicates your current position. In the center of the map, a dashed red line traces a loop identified as the Boreal Forest trail. At the top of the map, a second, solid green line, identified as the Copper River Bluff Trail, traces a jagged, squashed loop to a scenic viewpoint by the river. The buildings of the Visitor Center Complex are shown in black at the bottom of the map, with a green marker labeled, \"Visitor Center.\"Text at the upper right reads:The 1/2-mile Boreal Forest-Valdez Loop Trail follows even terrain, though wheelchair-users may need assistance. The trail passes along the river bluff, then cuts through the forest, connecting to a section of the Valdez Trail, the first all-American route into Interior Alaska.The Copper River Bluff Trail is a 1/2-mile loop, gravel, moderately difficult, with some elevation change and a few steep sections.Text in the bottom center of the panel reads:The Wrangell-St. Elias Visitor Center Complex includes a visitor center, exhibit hall, theater, restrooms, picnic tables and a picnic shelter, amphitheater, the Ahtna Cultural Center, scenic overlooks, and short hiking trails. You will also find the park administration and business offices nearby.In the visitor center enjoy exhibits, shop the bookstore, pick up park and area information, plan a backcountry trip, gather Nabesna and McCarthy road updates, and view a large 3-D interactive map. During the summer, join park rangers for a guided walk or talk, and watch the park's awarding winning film. Subsistence fishing and hunting permits are also available.Call park headquarters at 907-822-5234 for hours of operation.Underneath this text, the first of three color photographs at the bottom of the panel shows people walking along a path through the spruce forest. A caption reads:Walk through the woods for stunning views of the Wrangell volcanoes.Two more color photographs at the bottom right show a ranger leading an informative program about the park, and a coup",

A set of double metal and glass doors swing outward across a metal grate. Be mindful of the threshold as you cross from the concrete porch onto a stone floor inside the building. Inside, follow along a winding, simulated riverbed path. Exhibits describe the geology and formation of the landscape, and how rivers carve their way through the rocky terrain and old lake-bed sediments, reducing it to a silty dust suspended in the water. Other exhibits discuss the different wildlife in the park, some of the history of the Kennecott Mines, information about the native Ahtna peoples, and other people in the region, including explorers, prospectors, and a back-country pilot.",

Two sets of bay windows at the right flank a recessed wood and glass door leading into the General Store. About six feet to the left of the left-hand bay window, a single wood door leads into the Post Office, flanked by two white double-hung windows.<br />Note a wooden bench along the boardwalk under the window to the left of the bay.<br />You may enter the General Store or Warehouse from four different locations. Either: 1) through the front door of the General Store, the main entrance; 2) at the far right, through a side door on the north side of the building, from a 40-foot (12 m) long by four-foot (1.25 m) wide wheelchair accessible catwalk; 3) through the Post Office door immediately to the left; or 4) at the far left, up a short flight of four stairs to an open, 10-foot (2.75 m) square wooden platform with a couple wooden benches, then right 40 feet (12 m) down a slightly inclined ramp with wooden railings through a set of double wood doors on the south side of the building. <br /><br />To enter the Post Office, move through the single door located towards the left-hand side of the storefront. Once inside, move five feet left (1.5 m) on a 45-degree angle to a narrow, open wooden doorway. Just to the right of the door is a small, chest high open counter window. Several letters and stamps are displayed on the counter under glass. <br />To the right of the counter, rows of wooden mail boxes line the wall, some with historic brass fronts with small glass windows and combination locks. The original Kennecott post office sign hangs above the boxes, a four-foot (1.5 m) wide black sign with white block letters reading, \"U.S. Post Office, Kennecott, Alaska.\" Note a reproduction hangs in the original location, directly above the door outside. <br />To the left of the door is a floor-standing information panel. Text at the top of the panel reads:<br /><br />Post Office<br />Built in 1917, restoration completed in 2006<br />Keeping in touch with home<br />The vast majority of Kennecott workers were far from home and family, so the Post Office was an important link to their loved ones. Workers sent letters and money orders-after all, they were here to make and save money. They also received news and mail-order goods. Mail traveled by train and, in later years, by air. Some long-term staff had brass mailboxes here, but most letters were sent to their recipients via general delivery.<br />To send news or to wire money home more quickly -and at greater expense-workers went to the Wells Fargo telegraph service in the Railway Depot.<br /><br />A black-and-white photograph, entitled \"Snowbird at the post office, 1937,\" fills the bottom of the panel. It shows a woman standing outside in front of the snowy and ice-covered Post Office next to a modified automobile with caterpillar tracks in the rear and skis in the front. <br />Move through the door to enter the back room of the Post Office. The open backs of the letter boxes line the wall to your right. Opposite the boxes, a mail duffel bag artifact hangs on the back wall at the left.<br />Another single wooden door at the back left of the Post Office leads into the Storeroom, though it is highly recommended you move back outside through the front door of the Post Office to continue your tour, beginning in the Store.<br /><br />Note that beacons inside each of the remaining three entrances will automatically trigger the appropriate interior audio description for your location.â€ƒ<br />\"<br />",

    "audioDescription": "Gilahina Railroad Trestle. 4 Â½ minutes.<br />About halfway between Chitina and McCarthy, a small National Park Service (NPS) gravel parking lot and pullout area sits on the Chitina side of a one-lane bridge over the small Gilahina River.<br />With concrete reinforced planks and guardrails on either side of the 35-foot (10 m) long bridge, it is safe to cross by vehicle, on foot, or using a wheelchair. <br />Be mindful of traffic as there is no separate sidewalk, and the road deck drops off immediately underneath the guardrail into the rushing river below. <br />Facing upstream from a vantage point in the middle of the bridge, an abandoned, curved timber stringer bridge stands 90 feet (28 m) high and not quite 880 feet (268 m) across, almost spanning the heavily forested valley from left to right. Tall, wooden elevation trusses lean under the fractured, crumbling, and splintered railroad bed high overhead.<br />It may be a worthy experience simply to dip your hand in the chilly water, fed from the mountains up above. <br />Back in the parking lot, note a small, one-story red and white outhouse at the right. The women's room is to the left, the men's room to the right. Both are wheelchair accessible, but note the gravel lot continues right up to the doorway of the building, with a small concrete lip threshold.<br />A set of bear-safe garbage cans are available about 15 feet (3 m) to the left of the restrooms, next to a couple picnic tables in a small grove of trees at the back of the lot, away from the road.<br />An eight-foot (2.5 m) wide by 10-foot (2.75 m) tall wooden information kiosk to the left of the picnic area displays some interpretive panels on the history of the Gilahina Trestle along with some photographs. <br />At the left, a black-and-white photograph fills the top of the first of two panels. Entitled \"Railway to Riches,\" a steam locomotive pulls a line of freight cars along a narrow railroad bed cut into a steep mountainside. Text underneath the photograph reads:<br /><br />From 1911-1938 the Copper River & Northwestern Railway was the lifeline for the Kennecott mines. Nicknamed the \"Can't Run & Never Will\" by its skeptics, the CR&NW overcame incredible challenges in its construction and operation.<br /><br />A map across the center shows the route of the railway from Kennecott, across the Kuskulana Bridge into Chitina, and ultimately to Cordova on the Gulf of Alaska. Text tells how the railway blasted and carved through the wilderness, and negotiated massive cliffs, raging rivers, frozen ground, and even icebergs to haul ore to market, and supplies to the mines. <br />A line of smaller black-and-white photographs along the bottom of the panel shows dangerous rock work, a train buried in snow drifts, laying track, steam shovel work, the Kennicott Trestle washing out and men blasting through rock at Woods Canyon.<br />A black-and-white photograph of a train crossing the Gilahina Trestle fills the top of the second information panel at the right. Entitled \"Wooden Wonder,\" this panel tells the story of the amazing and perilous construction of the 90 foot (28 m) tall and 880 foot (268 m) long wooden railroad trestle across Gilahina River. It was constructed in the dead of winter in 1911, in temperatures as low as minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 55 degrees Celsius). In spite of the terrible conditions, the Gilahina Trestle was completed in just eight days!<br />A black-and-white picture in the center shows the long, sweeping curve of the trestle above a snowy, tree-filled valley. A caption below another picture of the cross-hatched wooden trestle at the right reads in part:<br /><br />Sparks from passing trains were a serious risk to wooden trestles. Water barrels placed along the tracks were used for putting out small fires.<br /><br />A line of smaller black-and-white photographs along the bottom of this panel show makeshift wooden houses in a construction camp at Strelna, a line of pack horses hauling supplies, a railroad track cache, thousands of full ore bags in Kennecott waiting for the railroad to be finished, a view of the half-finished trestle at Gilahina and a railcar crossing the finished Gillahina Trestle. <br /><br />",

Pets must be on leash at all times in the campground.<br /> <br />  </p> <h4>Campground Dedication Ceremony</h4> <p>Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve dedicated Kendesnii Campground on July 27, 2012. Under sunny skies, the special event included a naming ceremony, a picnic, speeches and the unveiling of the cultural panel (interpretive wayside). Park Superintendent Rick Obernesser opened the event, saying “I am excited that so many of us are here today as we dedicate the park’s first official campground.” Kendesnii is the Ahtna name of Daisy Nicolai. She and her children had a spring camp in the campground area for many years. In addition to acknowledging the family’s connection to this site, using an Ahtna name for the campground recognizes the important association between Alaska Natives and Wrangell-St. Elias. Park staff worked with local tribes in identifying the campground name, and the Cheesh’na Tribal Council, on behalf of Daisy’s family, partnered with the park in organizing the dedication. Many of the more than 100 guests at the event were members of Daisy’s family. Also among the guests were Nabesna Road residents and park visitors camping at the site. Daisy’s closest surviving relatives – a sister and three daughters – shared memories of Daisy, as did several grandchildren. Speaking on behalf of the Cheesh’na Tribal Council, Tribal Administrator Wilson Justin, who is also one of Daisy’s grandchildren, said “The honor of keeping a promise made a generation ago is privilege not always understood but vital to those who stand in shadows of our Traditions. Thank You to the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park for the support in keeping that promise. Cheesh’na extends a welcome to all visitors to the Kendesnii Campground.” The campground is located at Mile 28.2 on the Nabesna Road. It has vault toilets, picnic tables, and ten sites that will accommodate tents and up to medium-sized recreational vehicles. Currently there is no charge for use of the site. A canoe launch exists at the lake dock and development of a potable water well is being planned. Funding for campground construction came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Recreational Fee Demo Program.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Kendesnii Campground. 4 Â½ minutes.<br />The Kendesnii Campground is located in the Boreal Forest at Mile 28.2 on the Nabesna Road, next to two small lakes. It has 10 sites around a circular dirt and gravel road, each of which will accommodate tents and up to medium-sized recreational vehicles. There are outhouses, picnic tables, fire rings, bear proof garbage containers, and a small boat launch for canoes and non-motorized watercraft only. <br />Note that at this time, there is no potable water source in the campground.<br />The campground is free and open year-round, but is not plowed during the winter. Reservations are not taken and not required.<br />At the end of the short entrance road, note a 10-foot (2.75 m) tall by 12-foot (3.5 m) wide wooden information station with a narrow, overhanging triangular roof. <br />At the left, the first of three information panels displays three black-and-white photographs across the top. The first photograph shows a man in a fur-lined hooded parka standing on the back of wooden sled in the snow. Text underneath this photograph describes the abundance of food and water in Wrangell St.-Elias National Park and Preserve:<br /><br />Salmon, lake trout, grayling, and burbot swim in the streams...Moose and caribou roam its boreal forest. And blueberries, cranberries, and mushrooms are found throughout its wilderness boundaries...Subsistence allows Alaska residents who live close to Wrangell St.-Elias to hunt, fish, and gather inside the park. For others, hunting is allowed only in the preserve.<br /><br />A second photograph shows a pair of Dall sheep grazing on a hillside, all white with spiral horns. Text underneath this photograph reads that one of the founding purposes of the park is to:<br /><br />...protect habitat for, and populations of, fish and wildlife.<br />Dall sheep are one of 48 mammal species who call this wilderness home. Found only in Alaska and northwest Canada, these stunning creatures keep to high, open areas., they are easily spotted on rock and tundra covered slopes during the summer...Wrangell St.-Elias protects more than 15,000 Dall sheep, one of the world's largest concentrations!<br /><br />A third photograph looks over the back of a man carrying a loaded pack, walking across the tundra towards a snow-covered peak. Text underneath reads:<br /><br />For many in Alaska, the wilderness provides recreation and renewal...The majority of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve is designated as a wilderness area. At nine million acres, it is the largest of the...designated wilderness areas...(in the) United States...(This) Wilderness Area is open to all. No permits are needed for hiking or camping.<br /><br />The second panel shows a map of the campground, while the third panel posts a full list of the Kendesnii Campground Rules and Regulations. Pets must be on a leash, you should try to bring in your own firewood, and hunting is prohibited within the campground from May 1 to September 30. If you need questions or require additional assistance, you may:<br /><br />Contact the Slana Ranger Station at 907-822-7401 (during winter call 907-822-5234)...For emergencies call 911. Cell reception is best at mileposts 1 through 18 and at MP 23 near Long Lake.<br /><br />From a position facing the information panels, turn right and move 20 feet (6 m), then turn left and move an additional 20 feet (6 m) forward to a bear-safe trash can, and an outhouse another 20 feet (6 m) beyond that on your left. <br />Note a six-foot (2 m) tall sign to the right of the toilet showing pictures of various animals and their footprints.<br />About 30 feet (9 m) to the right of this sign, a gravel path at the left leads up a gradual, winding incline to a small clearing, the campground amphitheater, with four, eight-foot (2.5 m) wooden benches and a fire pit.<br />Moving another 80 feet (24 m) along the dirt and gravel road beyond the amphitheater path, a short, dirt and gravel trail to the right leads to a small boat launch. About 40 feet (12 m) along this trail to the left, a winding, sometimes uneven interpretive trail leads up a small incline to a couple small picnic areas at the edge of the lake, with more views of the Wrangell Mountains. <br />Note there may be areas of standing water, rocks, and roots in the trail along the way.<br />â€ƒ<br /><br />",

Under sunny skies, the special event included a naming ceremony, a picnic, speeches and the unveiling of the cultural panel (interpretive wayside). Park Superintendent Rick Obernesser opened the event, saying “I am excited that so many of us are here today as we dedicate the park’s first official campground.” Kendesnii is the Ahtna name of Daisy Nicolai. She and her children had a spring camp in the campground area for many years. In addition to acknowledging the family’s connection to this site, using an Ahtna name for the campground recognizes the important association between Alaska Natives and Wrangell-St. Elias. Park staff worked with local tribes in identifying the campground name, and the Cheesh’na Tribal Council, on behalf of Daisy’s family, partnered with the park in organizing the dedication. Many of the more than 100 guests at the event were members of Daisy’s family. Also among the guests were Nabesna Road residents and park visitors camping at the site. Daisy’s closest surviving relatives – a sister and three daughters – shared memories of Daisy, as did several grandchildren. Speaking on behalf of the Cheesh’na Tribal Council, Tribal Administrator Wilson Justin, who is also one of Daisy’s grandchildren, said “The honor of keeping a promise made a generation ago is privilege not always understood but vital to those who stand in shadows of our Traditions. Thank You to the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park for the support in keeping that promise. Cheesh’na extends a welcome to all visitors to the Kendesnii Campground.” The campground is located at Mile 28.2 on the Nabesna Road. It has vault toilets, picnic tables, and ten sites that will accommodate tents and up to medium-sized recreational vehicles. Currently there is no charge for use of the site. A canoe launch exists at the lake dock and development of a potable water well is being planned. Funding for campground construction came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Recreational Fee Demo Program.<i></i></p>",

    "audioDescription": "\"Shuttle Turnaround. 14 Â½ minutes.Located at the far southern end of Kennecott, at the northern end of a 30-foot (9 m) wide, half-moon shaped shuttle bus turnaround, an eight-foot (2 m) tall by twelve-foot (2.5 m) wide rusted, sculptural metal sign announces the Kennecott Mines National Historic Landmark. Several three- to four-foot (1.25 m) tall circular metal cogs and wheels are embedded in the ground in front of the sign, with a boulder on the ground with a plaque that commemorates the National Historic Landmark.Just to the left of the sign, a wood plank boardwalk runs past a 10-foot (2.75 m) wide by six-foot (2 m) deep covered bus shelter and information kiosk with a 10-foot (2.75 m) tall triangular roof. Note a wooden bench in the center, information panels on the interior and exterior walls, and at the front right corner post, maps of the area inside a metal brochure box with a slanted, hinged lid. Behind a three and a half -foot (1.25 m) tall wooden railing, the boardwalk continues around to the left along the top of the bluff, overlooking the Kennicott Valley and Glacier below. There are two wooden benches spaced roughly evenly along the boardwalk, and three additional three-foot (1 m) wide by two-foot (60 cm) tall information panels to the south along the railing.Note that the buses do not typically use this shuttle stop, but drop passengers near private businesses in town. It is however, used for day use parking. A wheelchair-accessible ramp and boardwalk to the north links the turnaround to the Old Blackburn School, Kennecott Visitor Center and bookstore. Note there is an ADA accessible outhouse midway along the ramp just before you reach the school building, located to the east along a 12-foot (3.5 m) wide wooden deck.Note that while many of the approaches to the buildings here at Kennecott are accessible by many new wheelchairs, the town is filled with unpaved gravel surfaces and uneven terrain.An information panel on the right exterior wall of the kiosk displays a hiking trail map of the area. Text at the top left of the panel reads:Learn MoreCome visit us in the Visitor Center to learn about recreational opportunities, backcountry etiquette, bear safety, and more. For more information on these and other trails, pick up free handouts at the Visitor Center.Continuing down the left side of the panel, text next to an illustration of a black bear reads:Be Bear Aware!You are in bear country. Bears are attracted by smells, including food and other fragrant items. Unfortunately, receiving them can lead to aggressive behavior that puts both bears and humans in jeopardy. To help bears focus on foraging for their natural foods, and to keep yourself safe:Food must be in your direct control or in an approved Bear Resistant Container at all times-even in the middle of the day, even on the glacier.Bear Resistant Food Lockers are available at popular camping locations in Kennicott Valley.Portable Bear Resistant Food Containers can be borrowed from the Park's Visitor Center, free of charge.Federal law requires proper food storage at all times. Improperly stored food can result in a fine or imprisonment. At the middle left of the panel, text next to an illustration of a hand shovel reads:Pack in, pack out, dig deepThis area is managed as wilderness. Please pack out everything you pack in. Bury your solid human waste at least 6 to 8 inches deep, and 200 feet (60 m) from water, camp, and trails. Make it look like you were never there!Further down on the left, text next to an illustration of a boot with spikes sticking down from the sole reads:Hiking on GlaciersGlaciers provide unique and rewarding hiking experiences, best enjoyed with caution. A glacier's edge, glacial melt pools, and river potholes can be extremely dangerous due to rotting ice and swift, cold water. Fine glacial silt may look dry but can be very slippery, and contrary to first impressions, there is only a thin layer of rocks covering the ice. Crampons are strongly recommended. Remember, you are still in bear country when on a glacier.At the bottom left, text next to an image of a sheet of paper and a pencil reads:Backcountry ItinerariesIf you are heading into the backcountry, we encourage you to tell a third party your trip route and expected return time. Voluntary Backcountry Itinerary forms are also available. This will not result in an automatic search, but enables us to assist if you run into trouble. A map fills the right-hand side of the panel, showing the Root Glacier, a large, pale-blue area at the top, converging with the Kennicott Glacier in the middle. An orange \"You Are Here\" sign in the center shows your current position, with the town of McCarthy and the airport indicated at the bottom of the map. In the narrow green forested areas to the right of the glaciers, a dotted red line shows the paths of the five hiking trails here at Kennecott Mines. Small inset black-and-white boxes point to each trail with a brief description.",

    "audioDescription": "\"Blackburn School Visitor Center. 3 Â¾ minutes.<br />The one-story, red and white painted wood Blackburn School is the first building at the far southern end of the town at Kennecott. <br />Note a wheelchair accessible ramp to the north of a 16-foot (5 m) wide wooden deck outside the west side of the building, ringed with a three and a half-foot (1.1 m) tall wooden railing, and an ADA accessible outhouse down a short ramp to the south. Note this same ramp also continues south, linking the visitor center to the shuttle bus turnaround.<br />A three-foot (1 m) tall, cast bronze, tactile, topographical model of the town sits in the middle of the deck. Measuring about five feet (1.25 m) wide by three-feet (1 m) deep, feel the locations of all the buildings and surrounding topography of the town. <br />A visual map of the town just below the touchable exhibit show the various buildings in different shades of red, orange, yellow, white, and gray. These indicate which are National Park Service structures versus private property, and which structures are open to the public. Text at the left of the map reads:<br /><br />Explore Kennecott Mill Town<br />A remarkable lode of copper ore near this very spot was discovered by American prospectors in 1900. Workers then developed the camp, mill, mines, and railway over the next decade. Kennecott Mines went into regular production in 1911, and proved hugely profitable. The mines were tapped out and closed in 1938.<br />Today, Kennecott mill town is the best preserved example of early 20th century copper mining technology in the country. It is also a thriving community and a gateway to an immense wilderness.<br /><br />Behind and to the right of the outdoor model, a single wood door leads inside the school from the outside deck. <br />Inside at the left, a black-and-white photograph fills the bottom of a four-foot (1.25 m) tall by three-foot (1 m) wide angled metal display panel on the floor. A woman in the center, dressed in a long sleeve white, high-collar shirt and floor-length black skirt, stands behind a couple rows of boys and girls of various ages, from six years old to teenagers. Information at the top of the panel tells us that the Blackburn School was built in 1913, moved to Kennecott circa 1915, and restored between 2002 and 2005. Beside a copy of a hand-written inventory of supplies and books at the school, text continues:<br /><br />Moving with the boom and bust of mining towns<br />In 1913, the Kennecott Copper Corporation supplied materials to construct this building in the tiny community of Blackburn. Located along the railway between Kennecott and the future town of McCarthy, Blackburn had grown up as prospectors moved into the valley.<br />By 1915, however, Blackburn was mostly empty-its spring dried up and everyone moved to McCarthy, which was booming as a stop-over on the way to the Chisana gold fields. Kennecott was also booming, so the Corporation moved this building up to its present location on a flatcar. It served as a school for workers' children until the end of the 1921-1922 school year, when the student population had grown again and classes moved to the new and larger Two Room School. The Old School was converted to storage.<br /><br />Inside the School, staff and additional exhibits answer questions about the backcountry, front country trails, and the landmark, and more maps, books, and gifts are available for sale in the Alaska Geographic bookstore.<br />\"<br />",

The NPS welcomes visitors to the Kennecott area and reminds them that all the historic mill town and much of the surrounding area are within the Kennicott Subdivision, a residential community where NPS public lands are interspersed with privately owned lands. State ownership of the McCarthy Road ends at the southern boundary of the subdivision. Beyond that point, Kennicott Subdivision easements are private and reserved for the use of the present owners and their guests only. NHL visitors, as NPS guests in the subdivision, should be respectful of privately owned lands and residents of the subdivision.</p> <p>For the purposes of this section, “off-road vehicle” (ORV) refers to all-purpose vehicles such as all-terrain vehicles that have been registered and approved by the State of Alaska for general highway use. Visitor use of ORVs to access the Kennecott mill town or points beyond, such as the Bonanza mine, is permitted as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Use of ORVs and other types of all-purpose vehicles is permitted on the State-owned McCarthy Road pursuant to Title 13, Chapter 2 of the Alaska Administrative Code (13 AAC 02).</li> <li>The Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities Kennicott River bridge was designed and intended predominantly for pedestrian use. To ensure safety for all users of the bridge, NPS urges ORV users to reduce speed and yield to pedestrians when crossing the bridge.</li> <li>As a landowner in the subdivision, the NPS encourages its guests to access the historic Kennecott mill town by using a local shuttle service from McCarthy. Use of a local shuttle service or reaching Kennecott by bicycle or by foot will minimize impacts of motor vehicle use on the historic character of Kennecott, on visitors’ experience of the NHL, and on subdivision residents. Landowners in Kennicott Subdivision have requested of NPS and its guests that property rights be respected where road easements cross their private land.</li> <li>On NPS lands in the NHL, parking is allowed only at the shuttle turnaround located next to the Kennecott Visitor Center. The turnaround has limited capacity for parking, with space only for 6-7 full-size vehicles, and often is filled early each day. Once the turnaround is filled, there is nowhere to park safely without blocking the intended use of the area as a shuttle turnaround.</li> <li>Parking on NPS lands elsewhere in the NHL is prohibited except for Federally qualified rural Alaska residents engaged in permitted subsistence activities.</li> <li>Subdivision easements (which are unavoidable to motorized visitors to Kennecott) are private and reserved for the use of present owners of lots in the subdivision and their guests.</li> </ul> <p>Thank you for recreating responsibly and safely in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve and the Kennecott Mines National Historic Landmark.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Kennicott River bridge. 2 Â¾ minutes.<br />Fifty-nine miles (18 km) east from Chitina, the McCarthy Road dead ends at the Kennicott River. From an open, slightly inclined gravel staging area on the banks of the river, a quarter-mile (400 m) long steel and concrete footbridge, five feet (1.5 m) wide with five-foot (1.5 m) tall metal railings, spans the glacially-birthed torrent.<br />Three- by four-foot (1.25 m) metal, flatbed hand carts with rubber wheels by the side of the bridge may be used to help haul any belongings or luggage across the river.<br />The best place to experience the action at this location is from the bridge. As you move across, the river rises and falls along the banks. Listen for the rocks pushed along under the surface. High above, the mountain provides a stunning backdrop for the Kennicott Glacier and Stairway Icefall. Downstream from the bridge, note an old, hand-pulled, open platform cable tram. Travelers once had to haul themselves across the river on the tram.<br />Once you cross the bridge, a private shuttle takes passengers into the town of McCarthy, about one-half mile (800 m) away, or to the historic mining town of Kennecott, five miles (8 km) away. Note the shuttle does not operate in winter, and there are no Park Service-operated shuttles in McCarthy or Kennecott.<br />About 20 feet (6 m) to the right of the footbridge entrance stands an eight-foot (2.5 m) tall by four-foot (1.25 m) wide wooden information kiosk. An enlarged satellite map of the area in the middle of a posted Park Service information panel shows the Kennicott Glacier in the center flanked by Wrangell-St. Elias National Preserve on either side. The bridge is at the bottom of the map, alongside the town of McCarthy on the other side of the river. The road to Kennecott curves up and around to the right along the right-hand side of the glacier to the Kennecott Visitor Center at the top. Text above the map informs us that:<br /><br />The McCarthy-Kennecott Area is a mixture of National Preserve, private property and non-federal lands. We ask that you respect the privacy and rights of property owners as you explore the area.<br /><br />At the bottom right, underneath a color photograph of the 14-story red Kennecott mill, text urges you to, \"Protect yourself and the resource.\" It lists of a number of things you can do, including making sure all food and garbage items are stored in a Bear-Resistant Food Container, never to enter any mine openings, and practice \"Leave No Trace\" principles.<br /><br />",

    "audioDescription": "Kuskulana Bridge. 5 Â¼ minutes.<br />Located on McCarthy Road, about one-third of the way from Chitina to McCarthy, the one-lane, 525 foot (160 m) long Kuskulana River Bridge hangs a vertigo-inducing 238 feet (73 m) above the bottom of the a deep, sheer-sided, rocky gorge. <br />An original steel railroad trestle, now a modernized span, is safe to cross by vehicle, on foot, or using a wheelchair, with reinforced planks and guardrails on either side. <br />National Park Service (NPS) outhouses are located in a small gravel parking lot on the McCarthy side of the bridge. It is well worth the time to park and move back onto the bridge from this location. The view of the steep-sided, rocky, black spruce canyon and the silty, rushing Kuskulana River far below is breathtaking, if not a little scary.<br />Be mindful of traffic, however, as there is no separate sidewalk. Note also that the road deck drops off immediately underneath the guardrail. <br />Imagine making the crossing riding high in a heavily loaded ore train across two icy rails with no guardrails. <br />Pulling into the NPS parking lot from McCarthy Road, the parking area is to the right, about 30 feet (9 m) across from a small, gravelly area with two picnic tables. Note a 10-foot (2.75 m) tall by 10-foot wide wooden information kiosk to the left of the tables.<br />At the back of the lot, note the small, one-story red and white outhouse building to the right about 40 feet (12 m) beyond the picnic tables. The building houses two gender-neutral restroom facilities. Both are wheelchair accessible, but note the gravel lot continues right up to the doorway of the building, with a small concrete lip threshold.<br />A set of bear-safe garbage cans are available about 15 feet (4.5 m) back to the right beyond the restrooms.<br />On the front side of the information kiosk, a black-and-white photograph fills the top of the first of two park service information panels. Entitled \"Railway to Riches,\" a steam locomotive pulls a line of freight cars along a narrow railroad bed cut into a steep mountainside. Text underneath the photograph reads:<br /><br />From 1911-1938 the Copper River & Northwestern Railway was the lifeline for the Kennecott mines. Nicknamed the \"Can't Run & Never Will\" by its skeptics, the CR&NW overcame incredible challenges in its construction and operation.<br /><br />A map across the center shows the route of the railway from Kennecott, across the Kuskulana Bridge into Chitina, and ultimately to Cordova on the Gulf of Alaska. Text tells how the railway blasted and carved through the wilderness, and negotiated massive cliffs, raging rivers, frozen ground, and even icebergs to haul ore to market, and supplies to the mines. <br />A line of smaller black-and-white photographs along the bottom of the panel shows dangerous rock work, a train buried in snow drifts, laying track, steam shovel work, the Kennicott Trestle washing out and men blasting through rock at Woods Canyon.<br />A black-and-white photograph of a train crossing a different tall trestle fills the top of the second information panel at the right. Entitled \"Wooden Wonder,\" this panel tells the story of the amazing and perilous construction of the 90-foot (28 m) tall and 880-foot (268 m) long wooden railroad trestle across Gilahina River. It was constructed in the dead of winter in 1911, in temperatures as low as minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 55 degrees Celsius). In spite of the terrible conditions, the Gilahina Trestle was completed in just eight days!<br />A black-and-white picture in the center shows the long, sweeping curve of the trestle above a snowy, tree-filled valley. A caption below another picture of the cross-hatched wooden trestle at the right reads in part:<br /><br />Sparks from passing trains were a serious risk to wooden trestles. Water barrels placed along the tracks were used for putting out small fires.<br /><br />A line of smaller black-and-white photographs along the bottom of this panel show makeshift wooden houses in a construction camp at Strelna, a line of pack horses hauling supplies, a railroad track cache, thousands of full ore bags in Kennecott waiting for the railroad to be finished, a view of the half-finished trestle at Gilahina and a railcar crossing the finished Gillahina Trestle. <br />The first of two additional panels on the back of the kiosk at the left, entitled \"Gateway to Adventure,\" provides a map and specific site information about the spectacular scenery and vast wilderness along the 60 mile (96 km) long McCarthy Road. <br />The final panel on the right reviews the sport hunting regulations and restrictions in the McCarthy Road area. A map at the bottom shows the road crossing through a patchwork of different colored boxes, all identified by a legend key at the left showing what lands belong to whom, both public and private. A caption reads:<br /><br />Respect Private Property<br />Almost a million acres of private land lies within the boundary of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve...Always obtain permission before entering private land.<br /><br />",

Once the gateway to tremendous fortunes, it is now your gateway to spectacular scenery, vast wilderness, and adventure. For those willing to leave the pavement behind, this road provides access to many natural and historic wonders of our largest park. Today's road originated in 1909 as a railway constructed to support the Kennecott Copper Mines. When large scale mining ended in 1938, most of the rails were salvaged for scrap iron. In 1971 a new bridge was constructed over the Copper River and the rail bed was covered with gravel, creating today's surface of the McCarthy Road.</p> <p>Narrow and winding, the road still reflects its railway origins. In places, remnants of railroad ties may surface along with the occasional spike, creating unexpected hazards. Although traffic and weather often result in ruts and washboarded surfaces, under normal summer conditions most passenger vehicles can make the trip. The road ends at the Kennicott River, a half-mile short of McCarthy and five miles short of historic Kennecott.</p> <p><strong>McCarthy Road Basics:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Begins at mile 33 Edgerton Highway, in Chitina, AK.</li> <li>60 miles, allow 2 hours EACH WAY.</li> <li>Unpaved and maintained by the Alaska state DOT. Rough road conditions and potholes are common.</li> <li>McCarthy Road is a remote area with little to no services. Before starting your trip, FUEL your vehicle in Glennallen, Copper Center, Kenny Lake or in Chitina.</li> <li>Drive slowly, carefully, and courteously.</li> <li>We recommend that you carry a full-sized spare and an adequate jack.</li> <li>Private land adjoins many parts of the road and in the McCarthy/Kennecott area. Please respect private property.</li> <li>Cell phone coverage is very limited.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Look for the mile-marker posts along the McCarthy Road and follow along with this guide:</strong></p> <p><strong>The Town of Chitina </strong></p> <p><strong>Latitude: </strong>61.514862060546875 <strong>Longitude: </strong>-144.43997192382812<br /> <br /> Pronounced, \"Chit-Na,\" this railroad town sprang to life in 1910. Chitina was once bustling as the major stopover and service point for the trains that carried ore from Kennecott to ships in Cordova. The railroad is gone, but today Chitina is busy during the summer fishing season and serves as a gateway to the park. Restrooms and informational panels can be found at the downtown wayside. There are restaurants, shopping, and lodging options in Chitina. There are no gas stations here.</p> <p><strong>Chitina Ranger Station</strong><br /> During the summer months, stop by the historic Chitina Ranger Station. This log cabin, which was constructed in 1910 by the Ed S. Orr Stage Company to house its local superintendent, serves as an enduring reminder of Alaska's colorful transportation history. One of Chitina's oldest surviving buildings, it was rehabilitated by the National Park Service and now serves as a visitor contact station. Current information about road conditions, the park, hikes, fishing opportunities, and other essential topics can be obtained there.</p> <p><strong>State Wayside - The Beginning of the McCarthy Road</strong><br /> This is the start of the McCarthy Road. It is a paved pull-out with vault toilets and exhibit panels.</p> <p>Just beyond the wayside, the road goes through a deep narrow gap known locally as the \"railroad cut.\" Actually it was originally a tunnel and was later altered into an open roadcut. The rocks exposed here are schist and phyllite typical of the Chugach Range.</p> <p><strong>Mile 0.4-0.7</strong><br /> There are several small pullouts here with some great views of the confluence of the mighty Copper and Chitina Rivers. The Copper is the only waterway that cuts through the Chugach Mountains, which extend for about 200 miles in a great arc across south-central Alaska. At the confluence, the Copper River is actually smaller than the Chitina River which is considered its tributary. At this point the Copper is about 1/2 mile wide, while the width of the Chitina is over one mile! The Chitina carries more water year-round than the Copper. Even though the Chitina River drains a smaller area than the Copper, it has more runoff due to greater precipitation in its watershed.</p> <p>The Copper and its tributaries, including the Chitina, drain an area that covers approximately 24,000 square miles. Much of this drainage basin lies within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve and about 3,500 square miles, or 17% of the drainage basin, is covered by glaciers. Because of this glacier influence, high water in the Copper River typically occurs not during the snow melt of spring, but during summer hot spells that cause rapid melting of ice. Low water usually occurs in late winter when everything is frozen.</p> <p>In 1950 the U.S. Geological Survey established a stream gauging station at the head of Woods Canyon, about 3.5 miles downstream, well below this confluence. Records from that gauge show that the average discharge of the Copper River has been 37,510 cubic feet per second (CFS) or slightly over 27 million acre feet per year. The largest recorded flood since 1950 was on August 8, 1981, when the river discharged over 380,000 CFS at the gauge. The lowest flow was recorded in March of 1956 when the river carried only 2,000 CFS at the gauge.</p> <p>Rocks exposed on the west <em>(left)</em> side of the road between here and the bridge are gneiss, schist, and phyllite with some quartz veins.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Copper River, Fishwheels, and Mount Drum\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/Fishwheels_in_Chitina2.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>The Copper River, Fishwheels, and Mount Drum.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Mile 1.4</strong><br /> As you drive across the Copper River Bridge, you can see the confluence of the Copper and Chitina Rivers. Several small pull-outs provide views of the rivers. Do not stop in the middle of the bridge for photos. After the bridge, the road becomes gravel.</p> <p>The large snow covered mountain visible to the north is volcanic Mount Drum (12,010'), part of the Wrangell Mountains. Suspended sediment loads of the Copper and Chitina Rivers are high, but the dissolved sediment loads are low; these rivers are dirty...but not polluted. Millions of tons of natural sediment, mostly silt and clay are carried downstream each year.</p> <p>The muddy waters that result from all this suspended sediment create an aquatic environment that is not very favorable as a permanent home for most fish. Therefore the Copper and Chitina Rivers have rather small resident fish populations. They do, however, have fantastic populations of migrating fish during the times that mature salmon \"run\" up to clear-water spawning beds and juveniles run down to the ocean each year. The muddy waters of the Copper allow successful salmon fishing by the use of dip nets and fishwheels; neither of these methods would work in clearwater streams.</p> <p><strong>Mile 1.6</strong><br /> On the south (right) side of the road is the Copper River Campground. This is a non-Park Service primitive campground. It is located just after crossing the bridge. This area has 12 sites, picnic tables, fire pits, and vault toilets.</p> <p>On the north (left) side of the road is the Copper River and the Kotsina River delta. The National Park Service has an easement here where you can access and view the Copper River. An easement is an area of land where visitors are granted the right to cross private property. Please follow the easement markers and respect the private property that you are crossing. Visitors can use a small site along the Copper River where they may park a vehicle, load and unload rafts, and temporarily camp for up to 24 hours. This is an excellent place to view the river and to witness Alaskans catching red, silver, and king salmon with dipnets and fishwheels.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Bluffs along the Kotsina river\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/kotsinabluffs.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>Look for the brightly colored deposits of a large volcanic debris in the bluffs along the Kotsina River.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Mile 2.0-2.5</strong><br /> There are several small turnouts from which the lower Kotsina River can be seen. The Kotsina, a moderate size tributary of the Copper River, gets much of its water from Long and Kluvesna Glaciers which drain southward off Mt.Wrangell.</p> <p>Brightly colored deposits of a large volcanic debris flow are exposed on the south side of the road and can be also seen in the Kotsina River bluffs a mile to the north. Field studies show that these deposits came from great volumes of ash and clay that were originally high on Mt. Wrangell. They became liquefied when volcanic activity produced much steam and also caused melting of snow and ice. Movement probably began as a volcanic mudflow, but as the mudflow raced down steep slopes of the mountain and along the Chetaslina River it ripped out large pieces of bedrock and picked up loose blocks of rock and river cobbles to become a volcanic debris flow.</p> <p>Materials from this event are called the Chetaslina Volcanic Debris Flow and they were deposited along the Copper Valley and in the lower portions of its tributaries from the Tonsina to the Chitina. These debris flow deposits are overlain in various places by lava flows and also by stream, lake, wind, and glacial sediments. Furthermore, they have experienced considerable erosion by stream activity and by a major glacial advance that occurred after the debris flow. Radioactive potassium-argon dating of a lava flow which overlies debris flow deposits indicates that the Chetaslina Volcanic Debris Flow took place about 200,000 years ago.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 5.0-5.4</strong><br /> Rocks poorly exposed on the north (left) side of the road are basalt and greenstone of the Nicolai Greenstone rock unit. These rocks originated as flows of basaltic lava during the Triassic Period, about 220 million years ago. Later they were partially altered by heat and pressure to form the greenstone that is widely distributed in the Wrangell Mountains and is the source of copper mined near Kennecott. As you continue, you'll discover that limestone is also exposed on the north side of the road.</p> <p align=\"left\">There are several small pullouts that offer nice views of the Chitina River and Chugach Mountains to the south. The Copper River and its tributaries (including the Chitina River) drain an area of approximately 24,000 square miles. Much of this drainage basin lies within the park and almost 25% of it is covered by glaciers. Because of this glacial influence, high water in the park's large rivers typically occurs not during the snowmelt of spring, but summer hot spells that cause rapid ice melting. Low water usually occurs in late winter when everything is frozen.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"The Chitina is a classic example of a braided river\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/chitinaview_1.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>Fed by glaciers, the Chitina is a classic example of a braided river</figcaption> </figure>   <p align=\"left\">Streams throughout the world exhibit three basic patterns in their channel form: straight channels, which are uncommon in large streams; meandering channels, which consist of many curves and loop-like bends; and braided channels. The Chitina is a classic example of a braided river as are many of the other rivers in this region. Braided rivers are characterized by many dividing and re-uniting channels and by numerous islands and gravel bars. The braided channel pattern tends to develop in rivers that; a) carry a lot of sand and gravel, b) have fairly steep slopes, or gradients, and c) undergo frequent fluctuations in water level.</p> <p align=\"left\">The Chitina River meets these conditions. In the area we can see here, it drops about 13 feet per mile, which is steep for such a large stream. Glaciers provide the stream with a great deal of sediment ranging from fine clay to boulders. Weather patterns cause flow variations because the river rises during warm and/or wet weather and drops during cold and/ or dry weather. Consequently, much of the sediment being transported to the sea is temporarily stored as islands or bars of gravel, sand, and mud along the Chitina River. If you happen to be viewing the river after several days of hot weather, most of the islands and bars will be flooded.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 10.1</strong><br /> Strelna Lake. A pull-out on the north side of the road provides access to a 1/3-mile trail to Strelna Lake. The Alaska Department of Fish & Game stocks this lake with rainbow trout, although you can find other fish here as well.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 10.6</strong><br /> Silver Lake. A short trail on the south side of the road provides access to Silver Lake for fishing. The Alaska Department of Fish & Game stocks this lake with rainbow trout, and you may find other fish as well.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 12.3</strong><br /> Sculpin Lake. A pull-out on the south side of the road provides access to a 1/4-mile trail to Sculpin Lake. The Alaska Department of Fish & Game stocks this lake with rainbow trout, although you can find other fish here as well.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 14.5</strong><br /> Kotsina Trail - Backcountry Trailheads. The Kotsina Trail departs from the north side of the McCarthy Rd and provides access to backcountry hiking routes. Take this trail 2.5 miles to the Nugget Creek trailhead or 3.8 miles to the Dixie Pass trailhead. The first part of this trail is a road, but it is not maintained and may not be passable for low clearance vehicles. It may be a better option to park your car at the McCarthy Road and hike to the trailheads. Ask a park ranger for more information and route descriptions.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 15.5</strong><br /> The road starts to run southeast here in a low valley between two long ridges of gravel. These gravel ridges are good examples of lateral moraines that were deposited along the margin of a large glacier as it receded.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 15.9</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Entering Federal Land. The road is now entering land managed by Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 17</strong><br /> A few turnouts on the south side of the road offer good views of the Kuskulana River and bridge. Exposures on the other side of the road show the type of sediments that make up glacial moraines.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Kuskulana Bridge\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/kuskulana.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>The Kuskulana Bridge is perched 238 feet above the raging Kuskulana River.</figcaption> </figure>   <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 17.2</strong><br /> Kuskulana River Canyon and Bridge. A spectacular achievement, the Kuskulana Bridge was constructed during the winter of 1910. Imagine riding high in a heavily loaded ore train across the two icy rails. Perched 238 feet above the raging Kuskulana River, this single-lane railroad bridge is for many the most hair-raising part of the entire drive. It was the only railroad bridge in this area constructed of steel girders that span the canyon rather than timber pilings driven into the streambed. The bridge is supported primarily by the metamorphic bedrock of the inner gorge rather than the thick layer of glacial gravels near the surface. The Kuskulana’s muddy waters reflect its origin from the melting of several glaciers that drain off the southern and western slopes of Mt. Blackburn.</p> <p align=\"left\">This is a one-lane bridge. Watch for oncoming traffic. Please do not stop in the middle of the bridge for pictures. We encourage you to park at either end of the bridge and get out of your vehicle to enjoy the views.</p> <p align=\"left\"><strong>Mile 17.3</strong><br /> Kuskulana Bridge Wayside. This rest area has vault toilets and is a gravel pull-out.</p> <p><strong>Mile 20-21</strong><br /> Vegetation and poor drainage in this area are influenced by the presence of permafrost at relatively shallow depths. This is a good place to contemplate the problems of road construction and maintenance in areas of permafrost, muskeg and swamps.</p> <p><strong>Mile 24</strong><br /> Gilahina Butte to the south <em>(right)</em> of the road is composed of gabbro and gneiss; its sides have been smoothed by large glaciers that formally flowed down the Chitina Valley.</p> <p><strong>Mile 26.8</strong><br /> Clear waters of the Chokosna River support salmon spawning beds.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Gilahina Trestle\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/trestle.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>A classic reminder of a bygone era, this impressive trestle was constructed in eight days during the winter of 1911.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Mile 29.0</strong><br /> Gilahina River & Gilahina Trestle Wayside. This wooden structure was originally 890 feet long and 90 feet high, required one-half million board feet of timber, and was completed in eight days in the winter of 1911. Due to the rugged landscape, over 15% of the entire railway was built on trestles such as this. This rest area offers vault toilets and a gravel pull-out. There is a short 1/2 mile hiking trail that departs from this rest area. Please do not climb on the trestle.</p> <p><strong>Mile 34.8</strong><br /> The Crystalline Hills north of the road are composed mostly of gneiss and gabbro, but some of the lower slopes are made up of a light colored marble. These hills are an excellent place to see Dall Sheep. Take a moment to pull over and look up into the hills. Watch for bright white spots on the hillsides - these may look like patches of snow, but they could actually be sheep!</p> <p><strong>Mile 44.0</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Entering Non-Federal Land. The road is entering privately-managed land.</p> <p><strong>Mile 44.5</strong><br /> The Lakina River gets some of its water from melting glaciers. The bridge was originally built across a river on the Glenn Highway but later removed during a highway upgrade project. Still later it was re-assembled on the Lakina. The bridge itself has functioned well in this location, but it is obvious that a much longer structure would be preferable. There have been repeated erosion problems and washouts of the long eastern approach to the bridge.</p> <p><strong>Mile 45.5</strong><br /> Long Lake. Each year, an average of 18,000 sockeye salmon struggle up the silty Copper and Chitina Rivers to spawn in this lake. This is a unique run. Salmon begin entering the lake as late as September and spawning continues until April. Glacial till and gravels deposited by ancient glaciers and glacial streams mantle the slopes around the lake.</p> <p><strong>Mile 48.3</strong><br /> Looking across the Long Lake inlet streams, the remnants of a C.R. & N.W. Railway trestle can be seen. Marble and limestone is exposed at the trestle footings and in road cuts nearest the stream. The road cuts through sandstone and conglomerate as it ascends the east side of the stream valley.</p> <p><strong>Mile 55.2</strong><br /> State Wayside. This wayside is a gravel pull-out and has vault toilets and exhibit panels.</p> <p><strong>Mile 56.7</strong><br /> Swift Creek, a small clearwater stream drains off Fireweed Mountain. Steeply dipping mudstones of the Chititu Formation are exposed in the cutbank on the west side of the stream. Fireweed Mountain is made up of these dark-colored mudstones and light-colored, silica-rich igneous rocks.</p> <p><strong>Mile 58.0</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Entering Federal Land. The road is now entering land managed by Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve.</p> <p><strong>Mile 58.1-58.4</strong><br /> The Kennicott Glacier and River can be viewed from several small turnouts on the southeast <em>(right)</em> side of the road. Ice of the glacier is mantled by rock material, ranging from large boulders to very fine glacial flour that is still in transit. A short walk around the glacier terminus will make it obvious why glacial streams are so muddy. The Kennicott River runs from the glacier down to the Nizina River, so it is only five miles long. Bluffs along the Kennicott River apparently reflect down-cutting by stream erosion after the glacier melted back from its earlier, more extensive size. It can be seen from these viewpoints that the river valley gets progressively deeper going downstream. The Kennicott River drops over 250 feet in its five mile run between the glacier and the Nizina River. Where it empties into the Nizina, the Kennicott River is in an erosional canyon over 350 feet deep; ten miles further downstream the Nizina is entrenched over 600 feet where it joins the Chitina River.</p> <p><strong>Mile 58.6</strong><br /> McCarthy Road Information Station. This National Park Service information station contains posted information that is updated during the summer. Day-use parking is available as well as vault toilets, updated bulletin boards, and a short hiking trail. No overnight camping or parking is available. This station is generally not staffed.</p> <p><strong>Mile 59.4 - The End of the Road!</strong><br /> Kennicott River & Parking. You've made it to the end of the road, but in many ways, your adventure is just beginning. All visitors must leave their vehicles at the end of the road and walk, bike, or take a shuttle into McCarthy and Kennecott.</p> <p><strong>McCarthy - 1/2 Mile from the Footbridge</strong><br /> Homesteaded in 1906, McCarthy quickly grew into a lively community with a story all its own. McCarthy served as the supply and recreation stop for the entire Kennecott mining district. Town history is well portrayed by the local museum and guide services. Today, McCarthy retains much of its original flavor. Accommodations, dining, guide services, flightseeing, and air taxis are some of the services available here.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"Kennecott\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/historyculture/images/kennecott.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Kennecott\" /> <figcaption>Kennecott Mill</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Kennecott Mines National Historic Landmark - 5 miles from the Footbridge</strong><br /> Like a time capsule, the impressive structures and artifacts left behind when the mines were depleted represent an ambitious time of exploration, discovery, and technological innovation. Currently, the National Park Service is stabilizing and rehabilitating many of the old buildings.</p> <p><strong>Kennecott Visitor Center</strong><br /> The Kennecott Visitor Center is located within the historic landmark. Park rangers and local guide services conduct programs and town tours daily during the summer. This is where most hiking trails depart - trails lead to the Root Glacier and up the mountains to spectacular views and historic mining structures.</p> <p><strong>Jumbo Creek Camping Area - 1.4 miles from Kennecott</strong><br /> This primitive camping area has no amenities. It is reached via foot travel only. Water is available from nearby streams and there are bear boxes for storing food.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

Crystalline Hills 8. Lakina River 9. Long Lake 10.End of the Road Track 1: Chitina wayside to the Copper River area (Music starts and fades out) Welcome to Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve, America’s largest national park! We hope you’re excited to embark upon this once in a lifetime journey. The rough and challenging McCarthy Road winds through the park and into the heart of this rugged Alaskan terrain. Remoteness requires a little planning, so we hope you have all the essentials: extra food & water, a road guide & map, a park newspaper, binoculars, proper outdoor gear & clothing, a spare tire & adequate jack, and a strong sense of adventure! The McCarthy Road provides for breathtaking mountain vistas, the chance to see wildlife and an opportunity to explore the vast landscape. You can also learn the surprising tale of a railway built solely to serve the bustling Kennecott Copper Mines. The McCarthy Road stretches for 59 scenic miles from the famous Copper River to the historic towns of McCarthy and Kennecott. The roadway originated as a railway, completed in 1911, to transport copper ore from the remote Kennecott Copper Mines to a coastal port for shipping. When large scale operations ended in 1938, most of the rails were salvaged for scrap iron, but were subsequently lost to a tsunami following the 1964 Good Friday Earthquake. The remaining rails were pushed aside along the road. In 1971 a new bridge was constructed over the Copper River, the first large river you cross just one mile west of the town of Chitina. The rail bed was then covered with gravel, creating what we now call the McCarthy Road. Narrow and winding, the road still reflects its railway origins. In places, remnants of railroad ties may come to the surface along with the occasional spike, creating unexpected hazards. Although traffic and weather often result in ruts and bumpy surfaces, under normal summer conditions most passenger vehicles can make the trip. Please allow faster vehicles to pass, by pulling over and using turnouts. Due to the narrow road and limited visibility, we suggest extreme caution for large RV’s on the McCarthy Road. Remember the speed limit is 35 mph and most times you’ll need to go slower due to changing and hazardous conditions. Also, the McCarthy Road can have soft shoulders and may be slick in rainy conditions, so travel with care. In dry conditions, the road can be extremely dusty. If you’re passing on-coming traffic, slow down so that both vehicles are able to see the edge of the road as you’re passing. Increase your following distance to stay safe in these dusty conditions. This will make for a more enjoyable ride for all travelers on the road. Driving the entire length of the McCarthy Road can take about 2 to 3 hours oneway. Some other important facts to note about this road: At several points along the way, you’ll notice signs showing private land interspersed among the national park and national preserve lands, so please respect private property. Cell phone coverage varies by carrier, but is generally good with some dead zones. Other carriers may have no coverage at all. There are several waysides and rest areas located along the road, with vault toilets and picnic tables, but no running water. Last, but not least, there are no fuel stations along the McCarthy Road, but fuel may be seasonally available in McCarthy, at the end of the road. Tire repair service may be seasonally available in McCarthy and Chitina. There are no other services along the road, so please plan accordingly.",

    "bodyText": "<p>By Tlingit scholars Judith Daxootsu Ramos and Elaine Chewshaa Abraham with additions by Barbara Cellarius           <br /> <br /> Located along the Alaska coast near Icy and Yakutat Bays, Mount St. Elias is the tallest and one of the most important mountains in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. Rising to an elevation of 18,008 feet (5,489 m) above Icy Bay, it is the second tallest peak in both the United States and Canada and fourth tallest in North America. The mountain’s official English name was likely borrowed from the name that explorer Vitus Bering gave to a point of land he sighted on, July 20, the saint’s day of St. Elias, in 1741 (Orth 1971:825), but our Tlingit name for it is <i>Was'eitushaa</i>, meaning “mountain at the head of Icy Bay” or “mountain inland of <i>Was'ei</i>.” <i>Was'ei</i>, in turn, is the Tlingit name for Icy Bay (Deur et al. 2015: 34). In 1939-40, linguist and ethnologist John Peabody Harrington recorded \"Yaasśeeyyík\" for Icy Bay, meaning \"swampy or muddy ground\" (de Laguna 1972:11, 95).<br /> <br /> Our people consider this mountain a sacred site. It is part of the historical oral narratives of the <i>K’inei<u>x</u> <u>K</u>waan</i> and is <i>at.óow</i> (meaning clan property, something that is “owned and paid for” and often involves non-monetary forms of payment). (The clan is also known as <i>Kwáashk'i<u>k</u>wáan</i>, a name the clan took after they purchased fishing rights at the Humpback Salmon Creek, a creek which bears a traditional Eyak place name.) In his honor, songs and chants were composed, and today, many clan members use the mountain on their regalia. One of the clan’s “houses,” a sub-lineage of the clan, is Mountain House, named for Mount St. Elias. It continues to be one of the most important symbols of our community – our dance group is named after the mountain.<br /> <br /> Mount St. Elias has enormous cultural and spiritual significance to us and is part of our sacred homelands. We consider <i>Was’eitushaa</i> as another living being, human-like, with the spirit of a male. These beings, like the mountain and glaciers, had intelligence, demanded respect, and had strict moral values. According to Tlingit Elder Elaine Abraham, \"Mt. St. Elias is a very strong spirit and takes care of us, by telling us what the weather will be like. Also Hubbard glacier is a strong male spirit and can hear and understand what people are talking about.… He demands respect and that is why you have to be quiet in front of the glacier and offer tobacco, and request permission to enter the bay<em>.</em>\"<br /> <br /> The mountain is used to predict the weather. During her fieldwork in Yakutat, anthropologist Frederica de Laguna (1972:803) mentioned a flat cloud streaming from the top of Mount St. Elias one evening and was told: “In the old days they used to tell the weather from it. Sometimes it puts on a sou'wester [rainhat] and then it means a bad storm. Sometimes the cloud is sidewise, as it is tonight, and then it means a westerly wind, good weather.” During the 1931 Alaska Native Brotherhood Convention in Yakutat, a love song was composed to show how happy they were when Mount St. Elias showed his face, that is, when the clouds lifted, and the mountain was visible:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">Southeast Alaska sisterhood:<br /> you make us happy yes,<br /> my grandparents’ mountain [1] <br /> there for you too will also be happy<br /> just as if you were the one that opened the world.<br /> Mount Saint Elias, you too will also be happy.<br /> (de Laguna 1972: 1303, approximate translation by Judith Ramos and Elaine Abraham)  </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"> </p> <p>In addition to being an important navigational landmark for mariners, the mountain served as a guidepost for members of the <i>K’inei</i><u>x̱</u><i> <u>K</u>waan</i> clan on their migration to the coast. Harry Bremner told de Laguna (1972:231-232, see also 222-223) a version of this migration story in 1949. The history of the people who become the K’inei<u>x̱</u> <u>K</u>waan clan<a> </a>began at Chitina on the Copper River. Long ago, a Raven chief (<i>Ltakdax</i>?) died and left behind a big dish made from a giant moose antler. Following a dispute over inheritance, a son who did not get the dish set out from Chitina with other members of the community on a voyage to an unknown and hostile land. They left behind their home and crossed glaciers and mountains all the way down to the coast. Their journey tested their strength and determination, and many people died along the way.            </p> <p><br /> They got lost in the fog on the glacier. When they called to each other, “wúhú!,” the sound echoed back and forth. In the fog they became separated. Half of the group ended up at the mouth of the Copper River. The remainder of the group crossed the Bagley Ice Field and came down along the side of Mount St. Elias, eventually ending up at Icy Bay. Crossing the ice field, there was no food to eat, and they were starving. They came to “a little mountain, an island with trees on it,” [2] where they killed a wolverine to eat. Then they continued walking towards what looked like a rabbit, as Bremner described: \"Pretty soon they saw a rabbit sitting on the snow, far away. They walked towards the rabbit. After two days walking they saw it was the top of a mountain, but they kept on walking anyway. Finally they came to Mount Saint Elias. It was a compass for the people so they wouldn't get lost.\" (cited in de Laguna 1972:232).<br /> <br /> When they came out at Icy Bay on the coast, everything was new to them. They knew very little about their new environment. They built their first lineage house at the bay and named it Mountain House, after Mount St. Elias.<br /> <br /> <u>Notes:</u></p> <p>[1] The composer is referring here to clan ownership of the mountain.</p> <p>[2] Possibly a nunatak, which is an exposed peak or rock formation surrounded by a glacier or ice sheet.<br /> <br /> <i>This article was prepared in part through a cooperative agreement between Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve and the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe.</i></p> <p><br /> <b>Sources: </b><br /> de Laguna, F.

The drive is an adventure with views of the Wrangell, Mentasta, and Nutzotin Mountains. Along the way you'll find campsites, scenic vistas, hiking routes, and opportunities for wildlife viewing. But you won't find many people here. So if you like taking a road less traveled, the Nabesna Road may be right for you.<br /> Nabesna Road Basics: <ul> <li>Begins at mile 60 of the Glenn Highway (Tok Cutoff), in Slana, AK.</li> <li>42 miles, allow 1.5 hours EACH WAY.</li> <li>Unpaved and maintained by the Alaska state DOT. Washouts are common.</li> <li>This is a remote area with limited services. NO FUEL is available in Slana. Fill up either in Chistochina (28 miles south) or Mentasta (18 miles north).</li> <li>Drive slowly, carefully, and courteously.</li> <li>We recommend that you carry a full-sized spare and an adequate jack.</li> <li>Private land adjoins many parts of the road. Please respect private property.</li> <li>Cell phone coverage is very limited.</li> </ul> CAUTION! This road was built to access the Nabesna Gold Mine, which operated from 1925 - 1945. Limited, small scale mineral extraction has occurred since then. The Nabesna Mine and its structures are privately owned and situated on private property (located at the end of the road). Please respect this private property. Park visitors should avoid the Nabesna Mine area altogether. The mine tailings extend onto adjacent park lands and these tailings contain high levels of metals and are acidic. Surface waters in the area contain contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury, nickel, and lead. Environmental exposure may be hazardous.</div> </div> <div id=\"cs_spacer_917631\"> </div> <div id=\"cs_control_917631\"> <div><strong>Look for the mile-marker posts along the Nabesna Road and follow along with this guide:<br /> <br /> Slana  Latitude: </strong>62.71294403076172 <strong>Longitude: </strong>-143.98992919921875<br /> <br /> <strong>Mile 0.2 Ranger Station road</strong><br /> The Slana Ranger Station is on the south side of the road (on your right heading east). Be sure to stop by for current road conditions, maps, ORV and subsistence permits, and park information.<br /> <strong>Mile 1.0</strong><br /> The original Slana Roadhouse (private property) is visible on the south side of the road. This roadhouse was built in the 1930s, but there has been a structure here since 1912. It served travelers on the trail to Chisana, the site of Alaska's final gold rush. It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The roadhouse is privately owned and is not open to the public.<br /> <strong>Mile 1.7</strong><br /> Slana River Bridge. The Slana River drains southward off of the Mentasta Mountains. It empties into the Copper River just two miles downstream from this bridge. Looking straight down the road, the glaciated summit of Noyes Mountain can be seen 25 miles away. At an elevation of 8,235', Noyes is the highest peak in the Mentasta Mountains; its summit is on the park's northern boundary. The Mentastas run in a northwest/southeast direction from Mentasta Pass to the Nabesna River. From there the slightly higher Nutzotin Mountains continue into Canada. These two mountain ranges are the eastern edge of the Alaska Range which arches across the state. Mt. McKinley and Denali National Park are also in the Alaska Range, but a few hundred miles to the west.<br /> The first several miles of the Nabesna Road traverse relatively flat landscape underlain by accumulations of relatively young sediment. Much of this material is stream sediment, but a good deal of it, especially the beds of silt and fine sand, was deposited in huge glacial lakes which formed when glacial ice blocked off the stream valleys. Additionally, you will see many deposits of coarse gravel that were laid down by the glacial ice itself.<br /> <strong>Mile 2.7</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Entering Federal Land. On the south side of the road, the boundary of the \"National Preserve\" begins.<br /> <strong>Mile 4.0</strong><br /> Junction with \"4-Mile\" Road. This road leads into the Slana Settlement, created in 1983 when the BLM opened over 10,000 acres to homesteading. It was one of the last opportunities for homesteading on federal land. Eight hundred claims were filed, but most were soon abandoned. Alaskan winters took their toll. Many tried to live in hastily-built cabins and tents, with temperatures down to -60˚F. Jobs were scarce and the climate was not suited to farming. Today, about 50 people live in the settlement on private property.<br /> <strong>Mile 5.6</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - Preserve to Park. The north side of the road is \"National Preserve\" whereas the south side is \"National Park.\" Sport hunting is allowed in the preserve but not in the park. Subsistence hunting by local, rural residents is allowed in both the park and preserve.<br /> You may notice that many of the culverts beneath the road have small diameter pipes extending from both ends. These are installed to solve a problem that occurs in permafrost areas such as this. Each fall and winter, the culverts freeze full of ice. This is not a problem during winter, when there is no running water through the culvert. As temperatures warm each spring, however, melting snow sends water down the drainages where it is impounded behind the solidly frozen culverts. Such waters flood the road and may cause damage by erosion or ice. To avoid this, highway maintenance crews connect truck-mounted steam boilers to the small pipes to melt the ice and open the culverts.<br /> <strong>Mile 6.1</strong><br /> Rufus Creek Wayside. This is a primitive camping spot and rest area. There are no vault toilets here.<br /> <strong>Mile 11.2</strong><br /> Suslota Lake Trail. This trail is primarily an ORV trail and is generally not suitable for hiking.<br /> <strong>Mile 12.2</strong><br /> Copper Lake Trail. Only the first 2.5 miles of this 12-mile trail are generally suitable for hiking, then the trail crosses Tanada Creek and trail conditions deteriorate.<br /> <strong>Mile 15-18</strong><br /> Along this stretch of road there are several points from which prominent peaks of the Wrangell Mountains can be seen. All of these peaks are built up of the Wrangell Lavas, the general term for lava flows and volcanic rocks of this area. Ages of these rocks range from 10 million years to very recent. The conspicuous high glaciated conical summit to the southwest is Mount Sanford, the fifth highest mountain in the United States with an elevation of 16,237'. It shows the typical form of a strato-volcano (sometimes called a composite cone).<br /> Mount Wrangell is the more distant, rounded and glacial covered dome southeast of Mount Sanford, with its summit of 14,163'. It is the park's only active volcano and occasionally steam plumes can be seen rising from its summit. Mount Wrangell's broad, gentle form is an excellent example of a shield volcano, in fact, it is the largest andesite shield volcano in North America. Stratovolcanoes form from thick, sticky, viscous lava that does not flow readily. Because of its thick nature, development of the volcano is through infrequent, but violent explosive eruptions. The resulting ash, cinders, and lava form steep slopes as they pile up. Shield volcanoes develop from more fluid lava. Because the lava flows more easily, shield volcanoes have more frequent, but less violent eruptions. These eruptions produce only limited amounts of ash and cinders, but large volumes of lava that flows into gentle slopes.</div> </div> <div id=\"cs_spacer_917644\"> </div> <div id=\"cs_control_917644\"> <div> <figure><img alt=\"Mount Sanford\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/sanfrd.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>Mount Sanford (16,237') as seen from the Nabesna Road<br /> <br /> North of Mount Sanford and nearer to the road is the jagged prominence of Capital Mountain, with a summit elevation of 7,731'. The jagged dark colored ridge north and east of Mt. Wrangell is topped by 9,240' Tanada Peak. Capital Mountain and Tanada Peak are both remnants of once large shield volcanoes like Mount Wrangell, but their volcanic activity ceased and their summits have been heavily eroded and sculpted by the force of glaciers. Geologic studies and potassium-argon dating have indicated that the entire Tanada Peak shield volcano was formed between one and two million years ago and eroded to its present shape only during the last million years. On a clear day, Mount Jarvis can be seen over the right shoulder of Tanada Peak. It too is composed of lavas between one and two million years old, and its summit rises to 13,421 feet.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"cs_control_917642\"> <div>Flowing northward from the great ice fields of Mount Wrangell is the Copper Glacier. Its meltwaters give rise to the Copper River which flows northward off the mountains, and then westward along the end of the Wrangell Range. From there is turns southward and finally reaches Gulf of Alaska near Cordova. It is the only stream that cuts through the coastal barrier of the Chugach Mountains. Along much of its length, the Copper River marks the western boundary of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.<br /> <strong>Mile 16.6</strong><br /> Kettle Lake Wayside. This is a primitive camping spot and rest area. There are no vault toilets here.<br /> <strong>Mile 17.8</strong><br /> Dead Dog Hill Rest Area. This is a great site to take a break for wildlife viewing or bird watching. There are views of wetlands, a small lake, and boreal forest. Moose are seen here and caribou migrate through this area in the spring and fall. There is a vault toilet at this primitive camping site and rest area.<br /> <strong>Mile 18.9</strong><br /> Parking for the Caribou Creek Trail.<br /> <strong>Mile 19.2</strong><br /> Caribou Creek Trail & Access to Caribou Creek Cabin. Park at the gravel pit at mile 18.9. The trail is approximately 3 miles long and offers views of the Wrangell Mountains and the lakes and rivers below. The trail ends at a cabin, but you could hike further into the hills. Reservations are required for use of the Caribou Creek cabin. Contact the Wrangell-St. Elias Visitor Center to sign up for this public use cabin.<br /> <strong>Mile 21.8</strong><br /> Rock Lake Wayside & Access to Viking Lodge Cabin. This is a primitive camping spot and rest area. There is a vault toilet here. The trail is approximately 1/4 mile long to the cabin and departs from the north side ofthe road. Reservations are required for use of Viking Lodge cabin. Contact the Wrangell-St. Elias Visitor Center to sign up for this public use cabin.<br /> <strong>Mile 24.5</strong><br /> Tanada Lake Trail. This trail is primarily an ORV trail and is generally not suitable for hiking.<br /> <strong>Mile 24.7</strong><br /> Watershed Divide. This is the highest point along the Nabesna Road with an elevation of 3,320'. Waters flowing west and south from here are carried into the Copper River and ultimately the Gulf of Alaska. Waters flowing easterly from here are carried by Jack Creek into the Nabesna River and on through the Tanana River to the Yukon River which empties into the Bering Sea.<br /> <strong>Mile 27.8</strong><br /> Kendesnii Campground. Ten campsites, picnic tables, fire rings, and two vault toilets provide a nice spot for camping. Campground is first-come, first-served and is free. There are picnic sites near the shoreline of the lakes and short hiking trails. Enjoy canoeing, viewing waterfowl, and fishing for grayling.<br /> Toward the northeast in the Mentasta Range is a conspicuously multi-colored mountain. The lower slopes are made up of dark reddish-brown and greenish-gray rock unit known as the Nikolai Greenstone. On top of these dark rocks rests a light colored (gray and tan) limestone. Both rock units date to the Triassic. Stream and gravity transport of limestone rubble down valleys and gullies has produced the prominent light stripes extending down the mountain slopes.<br /> The ridges north and south of Twin Lakes are composed of gravels deposited along the margins of glaciers. Such glacial rock dumps are called glacial moraines. These moraines were formed during the Wisconsin Glaciation. This was the last great ice age; it reached its maximum advance 18,000 years ago when ice covered much of Alaska, almost all of Canada, and extended well into the northern states.<br /> <strong>Mile 28.1</strong><br /> Change in Land Status - National Preserve. Both sides of the road are now \"National Preserve.\"<br /> BEFORE YOU CONTINUE: Road conditions can deteriorate beyond this point. Trail Creek (Mile 29.8), Lost Creek (Mile 31.2), and Boyden Creek (Mile 34.3) may be flowing across the road. Generally, these creek beds are dry, but during spring run off or following prolonged rain, high-clearance and/or four-wheel drive may be necessary. Carefully evaluate all crossings before driving across.</div> </div> <div id=\"cs_spacer_917946\"> </div> <div id=\"cs_control_917946\"> <div> <figure><img alt=\"Lost Creek\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/Lost_Creek.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> <figcaption>Use caution when water is crossing the road.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"cs_spacer_917658\"> </div> <div id=\"cs_control_917658\"> <div><strong>Mile 29.8</strong><br /> Trail Creek Trail. Trailhead is located where Trail Creek crosses the road. Parking is along the road - do not park within the creek drainage. The trail is approximately 6 miles long and allows quick access to the backcountry. The trail ends within the creek drainage, but you can continue hiking another 4 miles to reach the pass.<br /> <strong>Mile 31.2</strong><br /> Lost Creek Trail. Trailhead is located just after Lost Creek crosses the road. Parking is located at the trailhead. The trail is approximately 7 miles long, but you can continue hiking another 3 miles to the pass. Trail gives you scenery, alpine tundra, flowers, and the chance to see Dall Sheep.<br /> <strong>Mile 32.5</strong><br /> The two flat topped hills south of the road are composed of the Wrangell Lavas partially mantled by rock debris and soils that contain permafrost. During summer thaws of this frozen terrain, surface materials are slowly transported downslope by creep and semi-fluid flow. The hummocky area at the base of the western hill was produced by an ancient landslide.<br /> <strong>Mile 35.3</strong><br /> Jack Creek Rest Area. Several nice campsites with picnic tables and fishing along Jack Creek. There is a vault toilet at this rest area. Look for Dall sheep in this area. These bright white, wild sheep inhabit high altitude ridges, meadows, and extremely rugged terrain. Sheep use these areas for feeding, resting, and to escape predators. Although they usually stay at higher elevations, in this area they are known to descend to springs and mineral licks. Careful observers can usually spot small flocks on the mountainsides over the next few miles.<br /> <strong>Mile 36.2</strong><br /> Skookum Volcano Trail. This trail is 2.5 miles one-way to a beautiful high pass.The trail leads through an extinct, deeply eroded volcanic system with fascinating geology. The elevation at the trailhead is 3,000' and rises to an elevation of 4,800' at the pass. Hikers can explore other routes or expand this hike into a multiple-day trip<br /> As you continue down the road, the jagged peaks south of the road are dominated by volcanic rocks ejected from the Skookum Creek Volcano. Volcanic Ash and hot gasses formed a fiery cloud which flowed down the flanks of an ancient volcano to produce the tan and light gray, conspicuously bedded rocks. Lava which issued from several nearby volcanic vents flowed downslope and solidified to produce the more massive pinkish-tan rocks. Radioactive dating of these rocks by USGS investigators shows that Skookum Creek Volcano was active between two and four million years ago. Deep canyons and steep slopes show that erosion has been very effective in wearing down the land during the last two million years.<br /> <strong>Mile 40.2</strong><br /> Reeve's Field Trail. This 4.2 mile trail leads to views of the Nabesna River. The Reeve's Field airstrip is no longer here, but this area holds important historical significance. During 1941, trucks hauled equipment from Valdez to a rustic strip along the river. Pilot Bob Reeve cut everything into pieces, loaded it into his Boeing Trimotor, flew them to Northway, about 40 miles north, and then had them re-welded. This effort was organized to build the Northway Airport, a critical stopover in ferrying lend-lease aircraft to the Soviet Union during WWII. By November, he had transported all the materials for a full-scale airport. It was good timing. One month later, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor gave Northway new relevance, and it became a critical element in the defense of Alaska.<br /> <strong>Mile 42.0</strong> - End of the Maintained Road<br /> The maintained portion of the Nabesna Road ends at the Devil's Mountain Lodge, which is private property. Please respect this property and their privacy. Stay alert, and be careful not to park on the airstrip.<br /> Parking: Approximately a 1/4 mile beyond the lodge, there is a gravel parking area that is located on public land. If you'd like to explore further by foot travel or bike, this is the best place to park your vehicle, as the road is not maintained beyond this point.<br /> <strong>Mile 42.5</strong><br /> Rambler Mine Trail. Approximately 1/4-mile past the parking area, a trail leads south towards the remains of the abandoned Rambler Mine, an area that was active after WWII. The one-mile trail is steep, but the effort rewards you with superlative views of the Nabesna River and Nutzotin Mountains.<br /> <br /> <img alt=\"View from the Rambler Mine Trail\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/learn/nature/images/Rambler.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\" title=\"\" /> Nice views from above the Rambler Mine</div> </div> </div> </div>",

Conservation and Research Efforts in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Track 1: Slana Ranger Station to Slana River Bridge Welcome to Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve, America’s largest national park! What has brought you here? Are you just passing by? Are you curious? Are you here to explore? If you’re looking for a chance to experience Alaskan wilderness, you’ve come to the right place. You’re about to embark on a trip down the Nabesna road: built for a gold mine, yet today providing access to so much more. There is much to discover here! As you drive this road, you’ll catch a glimpse into the interior of Alaska. Today, you may see moose grazing on willow twigs, a herd of caribou trotting through a meadow, or a pair of swans gliding across a lake. As you drive, you’ll see majestic mountains, shaped by glaciers and volcanoes, set within breathtaking landscapes. There is also a fascinating history of people who have made this land their home, both in the past and in the present. The Nabesna Road stretches for 42 scenic miles, and it’s much the same today as it was when it was built back in 1934. Generally, the Nabesna Road is passable by any two-wheel drive vehicle. But sometimes, especially after it has rained, the road may become rough and you may need a four wheel drive vehicle. Please be cautious and take care, as there may be uneven surfaces, potholes, and washouts present. Driving the Nabesna Road can be an adventure! Have fun and take it slow. Soak it in. Pull over, step out of your vehicle, and take a deep breath of the Alaskan air. Drink in the beauty. And take notice of the rich interplay of the wildlife, people, and landscape around you—all held within the wilderness of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. (Music fades in and ends) This concludes Track 1. At this time, go ahead and pause or stop this recording. Proceed to Track 2 during your drive between the Slana River Bridge and 4-Mile Road Junction. Track 2: Slana River Bridge to 4-Mile Road Junction (Music starts and fades out) You’ve just crossed over the Slana River, which drains off of the Mentasta Mountains, located to your left as you drive the road. This pristine river empties into the Copper River just two miles downstream from the Slana Bridge, making the Slana River part of the Copper River watershed. This watershed shapes the dramatic landscape of Wrangell-St. Elias, and it is the lifeblood of the park's varied ecosystems. With an abundance of wide open spaces and hundreds of miles of streams draining into the Copper River watershed, Wrangell-St. Elias is home to a tremendous array of fish resources. The Copper River and most of its tributaries are migration routes for sockeye, coho, and king salmon, and pink and chum salmon can be found in the park as well. Adult salmon begin this migration cycle by swimming upstream from the Gulf of Alaska to build a nest, spawn, and deposit their eggs. These fish return to the stream where they were born, bringing a gift of life.",

    "audioDescription": "\"Power Plant. 4 Â½ minutes.<br />Located at the northern end of town along the west side of the main gravel road, four towering smoke stacks rise from the three-story, 13,218 square foot (4,025 square meter) Power Plant. <br />As you move along the road toward the center of the plant, be mindful of rusted metal rails and other large metal debris lying in front of the nearly 120 foot (36 m) long structure.<br />Banks of three, eight-foot (2.5 m) tall by 10-foot (2.75 m) wide double hung white windows line the walls of the first section of the long red building.<br />A 10-foot (2.75 m) wide wood plank boardwalk near the end of this portion of the plant leads over a set of railroad tracks and over a small wooden threshold through a set of double red and white wooden doors onto a 10-foot (2.75 m) wide by five-foot (1.5 m) deep metal platform. A four-foot (1.25 m) tall metal railing surrounds the platform, with metal mesh screening between the rails.<br />The platform looks out over the power plant floor, to four enormous, two-story tall boilers at the right. A smokestack rises up from each, penetrating the roof and reaching for the sky beyond. To the left and right, additional large tanks and pipes line the periphery of the inside walls of the plant.<br />Straight ahead, on a catwalk on the other side of the plant, across the shop floor, a seven-foot (2.1 m) tall black-and-white floor-standing photograph shows a man in a long-sleeve shirt, tie, soft-billed cap and overalls standing before the turbines holding a pair of gloves. Mr. McGavoch was one of the electrician's here at the plant.<br />A three and a half-foot (1.1 m) wide angled information panel mounted flush with the top of the railing at the left tells the story of the Power Plant. Text next to an image of an early electric light bulb reads:<br /><br />Built and expanded 1911-1917, rebuilt after the 1924 fire, restoration completed in 2014<br />Power was essential for Kennecott operations<br />In the earliest years, a small wood-burning boiler powered the sawmill. The first of the boilers in front of you came up when the railway was completed in 1911. As the others were added, this became one of the largest power plants in Alaska.<br />The boilers burned oil to generate steam. The steam generated electricity in the Mill's steam turbines, heated the ammonia reaction in the leaching plant, and warmed buildings throughout the Mill camp. The diesel-electric generators (to your left) sent electricity to the camp, Mill, trams, and mines. The Pelton wheel generator hiding behind them was used in emergencies. Multiple ways to generate power meant that even if something went wrong, operations could continue.<br /><br />A black-and-white photograph at the right side of the panel shows an aerial view of the plant from the west. A quote at the bottom of the panel reads:<br /><br />\"An oil storage tank located on the hill above the power plant held enough oil to operate Kennecott all winter...At 30 degrees below zero, the steam plant was a nice place to work.\"<br />-Wesley Bloom, journeyman electrician at Kennecott, 1935-1937<br /><br />From this location, note an exterior, four-foot (1.25 m) wide wood plank boardwalk, parallel to the plant that runs about 60 feet (18 m) north to a second, wooden observation platform inside the plant at the left. Inside, the boardwalk extends left from the platform, snaking around some of the pipes and tanks inside the plant, providing additional viewing vantage points closer to the boilers and smokestacks.<br />Power played a critical role in Kennecott's self-sufficiency. Industry requires power, and generating power in the wilderness, on a sizable scale, required imagination and herculean effort. The plant provided power and steam heat to the entire town. Steam traveled to outlying buildings through underground wooden conduits. These were often built under wooden sidewalks, keeping them free of snow and ice in the winter. Water for the steam boilers was diverted from Bonanza Creek, north of the town. Power was also transmitted over a high-tension line to Bonanza and then across the hill to Jumbo.<br />\"<br />",

    "audioDescription": "\"Recreation Hall. 12 minutes.Located 50 feet (15 m) to the north from the Kennicott Glacier Lodge, a set of wooden stairs and a wheelchair accessible ramp around the building from below, leads to a one-story red and white wooden building.Using the stairs, from the main gravel road, proceed 13 steps down a set of four-foot (1.25 m) wide wooden stairs, with four-foot (1.25 m) tall railings on either side, to a small wooden landing. Proceed down nine more steps to an eight-foot (2.5 m) wide by 19 foot (5.8 m) long wooden platform in front of the Recreation Hall. The single red and white wood door entrance is located in the middle of the building.Note the wheelchair accessible ramp is located on the west side of the building, but is reachable only from the lower service road. Note also there are two, red and white, gender neutral accessible outhouses near the base of the ramp, located immediately to the south along a 10-foot (2.75 m) gravel driveway leading west back to the service road.Facing the front door, exercise caution moving over the slightly raised wooden threshold onto the hardwood floor of a small, 10-square foot (three-square meter) anteroom. At the right, two pot belly stoves sit on a single-brick raised platform. At the left, a two and a half-foot (0.75 m) tall flip book display, mounted on an angle, stands in front of a three and a half-foot (1.1 m) wide by seven-foot (2.1 m) tall wall panel at the back. The panel presents information about the activities that took place here, while the flipbook offers more vignettes about the community's social and political history up to the present day.Beyond this entrance area, the hall opens up into a 30-foot (9 m) wide by 50-foot (15 m) long open, rectangular room with 15 foot (4.5 m) ceilings. Rows of six-foot (2 m) square windows line the center of both walls, looking up to the mountains on the east and out over the Kennicott Glacier on the west. Rows of wooden benches at the base of the walls sit on opposite sides of the dark, hardwood floor. A large movie screen hangs at the back of the hall, and there's a modern, black and silver wood stove in the far back left corner.Back inside the anteroom, facing the two pot belly stoves, the stove at the left is identified as a Great Western wood burning stove. It stands six feet (2 m) tall with a nearly three-foot (1 m) wide square black base. It has a generally cylindrical body with metal castings and hardware that rises to another dark cylinder at the top, connecting to a stovepipe into the ceiling above. Feel free to explore this original artifact.Opposite the stove, a black-and-white photograph at the top of the wall panel shows the frontier buildings and town of Kennecott in the early 20th century. A hand-written musical score appears across the bottom of the panel. Next to an image in the center of a pair of brown leather boxing gloves with green lacing, text reads:Recreation HallBuilt in 1916, restoration complete in 2003A place to socialize and celebrateThe twinkle of lights and sound of music enticed managers, their families, and workers to fill the Recreation Hall for dances, symphonies, school plays, Christmas pageants, movies, the occasional church service, and indoor sports like basketball, shuffleboard, roller skating, wrestling, and boxing matches. Organizing and enjoying these activities together helped create a sense of community among employees.The Kennecott Copper Corporation provided the Recreation Hall and other comforts to attract and keep workers. In exchange, the Corporation expected them to work hard and stay out of trouble.Below this text, between the wall panel and the flip book, note a music stand on the vignette with some sheet music from the era. There is also a lady's dance card from the 1920s for use at Kennecott dances, with numbered lines and a white string loop and small tassel.Turning to the first page of the flip book, a quote at the top of the dark purple page reads:\"Such an abundance of dancing partners.\"Text continues:Dances were held in the Recreation Hall two to four times a month in the 1920s, although this dwindled to once a month by the late 1930s. In those decades, dancing required a partner of the opposite sex, but women-nurses, teachers, secretaries, and wives-were in short supply at Kennecott. To keep things orderly and to be sure that everyone had a turn, men reserved a dance by writing their name on a lady's dance card. Dance cards could fill up very quickly.A quote at the bottom reads:\"There is a recreation hall where a few of the dances-the big ones like New Years and Fourth of July, etc., are held and everybody attends... the men outnumber [us] ... and no matter how much your feet hurt or your knees weaken, you have to keep on dancing.\"- Ethel LeCount in a letter to a friend, 1938.To the right on page two, a black-and-white photograph shows a line of men in suits and women in long elegant dresses standing underneath hundreds of strands of twisted streamers.",

It is recommended to wear crampons or ice spikes on your shoes and go with an experienced guide. </strong></u><br /> <br /> <strong>Trailhead<br /> Latitude: </strong>61.487114 <strong>Longitude: </strong>-142.890863<br /> <br /> Access: Trail departs from Kennecott Mill Town. You can access Kennecott from McCarthy - walk the road between McCarthy and Kennecott (an extra 4.5 miles), take the commercial shuttle, or ride a bike. This trail does NOT access the Erie Mine.<br /> <br /> Distance: 4 miles round-trip from Kennecott to the glacier or 8 miles round-trip to the Erie Mine tram cables.<br /> <br /> Time: 2-6 hours round-trip (hiking duration).<br /> <br /> Maps: USGS Maps, McCarthy 1:250,000, McCarthy (B-6), (C-6) 1:63,360<br /> <br /> Difficulty: Easy to Moderate. Terrain is relatively level with moderate elevation gain and loss.<br /> <br /> Highlights: Glacier viewing, mining artifacts, views of Mt. Blackburn, Regal Mountain, and Donaho Peak. Route: From the Kennecott Visitor Center, walk through the Kennecott Mill Town, north towards the Root Glacier. About a half-mile beyond the visitor center, the road will split. Stay straight. (The right hand trail leads to Jumbo and Bonanza Mines.) The trail will soon cross over Bonanza Creek and Jumbo Creek and then wind its way through the lateral moraines of the Kennicott and Root Glaciers. Approximately 1.5 miles after leaving Kennecott, the trail reaches the Root Glacier access trail. (Primitive campsites, along with an outhouse and food lockers, are available in this area.) To access the glacier, turn left at the sign and follow the trail as it winds down the moraine to the toe of the glacier. This trail crosses Amazon Creek, which is a seasonal stream. Depending on recent rainfall or spring melt, you may need to cross this stream.<br /> <br /> Hazards: The Root Glacier can be very slippery and dangerous. Crampons are strongly recommended. Avoid walking along the edge of Root Glacier as rotting ice and swift, cold water are potentially dangerous. Bears are present along the entire route. For maximum safety, travel in groups, be noisy when you are walking, and never give any food to a bear.<br /> <br /> Notes: If you are camping at the Jumbo Creek Camping Area or Donaho Basin, it is required that your food is stored in the bear-resistant food boxes or your own Bear Resistant Food Container (BRFC).",

A small section of the Valdez Trail is on the Boreal Forest Trail around the Copper Center Visitor Center. <br /> <br /> <strong>Latitude: </strong>62.020196 <strong>Longitude: </strong>-145.366612</p> <h4>History of the Valdez Trail</h4> <p>by Geoffrey Bleakley, former Park Historian<br /> The Valdez Trail provided the first overland access to much of interior Alaska. Built by the U.S. Army and the Alaska Road Commission between 1898 and 1907, it followed a series of indigenous paths linked by such prominent explorers as Lt. Henry T. Allen, Capt. William R. Abercrombie, Capt. Edwin F. Glenn, and Lt. Joseph C. Castner. Although originally directed to Eagle City, the trail was diverted to Fairbanks following a nearby gold discovery in 1902. A closing thrust in a period of pioneer American trail building which began with Daniel Boone's construction of his Wilderness Road through the Allegheny Mountains in 1769, the Valdez Trail channelled people, freight, and mail into the district, promoting mining activity, aiding the development of supporting industries, and hastening the settlement of the Copper, Yukon, and Tanana river valleys.</p> <center> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Native groups traditionally controlled all of the land bordering the Valdez Trail. South of the Chugach mountains, the land belonged to the Chugach (or Prince William Sound) Eskimo. Various Athapaskan groups held the more northern territory. Each created their own transportation networks. In general, local paths were used for subsistence activities, while longer trails were used for trade and occasionally for raiding. These routes usually followed natural corridors such as river valleys and traversed the more obvious mountain passes. Trade occurred among the different Alaska Native groups long before contact with the Russians. The Ahtna, for example, often served as middlemen, bartering with the Chugach, Tlingit, and Eyak peoples, as well as their Athapaskan relatives, the Dena'ina and the Tanana. Although copper was their most important export, they also exchanged moose, caribou, lynx, and beaver pelts for marine products like seal skin boots. Both oral and documentary evidence suggests that the Ahtna regularly held intertribal trade fairs within the Valdez Trail corridor, including ones near both Thompson and Isabel passes.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>American Exploration of the Valdez Trail Corridor, 1885-1898.</strong><br /> When the United States acquired Alaska from Russia in 1867, neither party knew much about the territory's eastern interior. Russians had focused their attention on coastal areas and had only made a few abbreviated attempts to explore the region. Americans, in contrast, had never visited the area at all. Neglected for the next fifteen years, the district began attracting interest in the mid-1880s. Gold strikes in northern British Columbia's Cassiar region and near the present site of Juneau lured prospectors to the north. Many eventually entered the interior, most by way of the Yukon River, but some via Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. The American government worried about the potential for conflict between the undisciplined miners and Alaska's Native population. Consequently, the U.S. Army soon dispatched several expeditions to reconnoiter the region. One such party, led by Lt. Frederick Schwatka, charted the entire Yukon River in 1883. Another, headed by Lt. William R. Abercrombie, attempted to examine the Copper River basin the following year. Although stopped by rapids on the lower river, Abercrombie later located an alternative overland route to the interior: across the Valdez Glacier heading the Valdez Arm.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 1885, the army sent Lt. Henry T. Allen to finish Abercrombie's work. More successful than his predecessor, the lieutenant ascended the Copper River and pioneered the route across the Alaska Range and into the Tanana River valley.<br /> Five years later, a private expedition led by E. Hazard Wells added another segment. Journeying down the Yukon from its headwaters, the party traveled up the Fortymile River and traversed the Kechumstuk Hills to Mansfield Lake. From there, they crossed the Tanana River and ascended the Tok River to near Mentasta Pass. Much of this route was later incorporated into the trail's Eagle City Branch.<br /> <br /> Northern gold discoveries continued, climaxing with an especially rich find on northwestern Canada's Klondike River in 1896. This precipitated the region's greatest rush. In their haste to reach the gold fields, many stampeders prepared inadequately for the hardships they would have to endure. As a result, the U.S. Army soon received reports of widespread deprivation. Responding to the rumors, the military dispatched Capt. Patrick H. Ray and Lt. Wilds P. Richardson to proceed to Alaska and to provide necessary relief. Most stampeders reached the Klondike via a largely Canadian path over the Chilkoot Pass, located near the northern end of Alaska's Lynn Canal. Many, however, objected to the foreign control of that transportation corridor and called for an \"all-American route.\" Recognizing the logic of their demands, Ray recommended the immediate construction of a government trail into the Yukon River basin. Unscrupulous local promoters, circulating stories of an easy passage linking Prince William Sound with the interior, lured thousands of gullible stampeders to Port Valdez. Unfortunately, the arriving prospectors found only one way across the Chugach Range: Abercrombie's exceptionally difficult and dangerous path over the Valdez and Klutina glaciers. Faced with few options, most attempted that route, and many eventually died from disease, accidents, and exposure.<br /> In the spring of 1898, the army sent Capt. William R. Abercrombie back to Port Valdez, hoping to locate a safer way. The captain first inspected the Lowe River valley, where he spotted the remains of a Chugach trail leading to the north toward Keystone Canyon. Proceeding to the interior via the Valdez Glacier, Abercrombie found an Ahtna path leading up the right (or western) bank of the Copper River. Both were eventually utilized by the Valdez Trail.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Construction of the Valdez Trail, 1898-1906</strong><br /> Abercrombie returned to the region in 1899. Utilizing only hand tools, his soldiers built a 93-mile packhorse trail from the coastal community of Valdez to the Tonsina River. Weary stampeders immediately adopted this shorter path. Addison M. Powell, a civilian employee of Abercrombie's and an early explorer of the Chistochina River, reported that by the end of the summer, the route was already filled with prospectors headed for the Nizina River basin. Encouraged by such traffic, construction continued, and by 1901 the army had completed its trail all the way to Eagle City. Alaska residents soon demanded additional federal aid. In 1903, visiting members of a Senate Subcommittee on Territories heard testimony on a broad range of subjects, including the need for better transportation. Army Signal Corps Lt. William L. Mitchell, for example, related the current condition of the Valdez-Eagle City Trail. Pioneer Judge James Wickersham went even further. He requested that the government improve the route, calling such action an essential prerequisite to developing the interior's mining potential. U.S. Geological Survey geologist Alfred H. Brooks agreed. Incidental to a discussion on the future of placer mining, he recommended that a million dollars be spent in building wagon roads to the inland placer camps. Such arguments seem to have convinced the senators. Upon returning to Washington, they recommended that the government construct a system of transportation routes, beginning with a well-built wagon road connecting Valdez and Eagle City. That winter Congress appropriated $25,000 to conduct the initial survey. The following spring the War Department appointed an army engineer to supervise the work. Completing the job in August 1904, J. M. Clapp estimated that it would cost $3,500 per mile or a total of approximately $1.5 million to build the road.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">By then, however, Eagle City had already lost its priority as the trail's terminus. Mineral production on the upper Yukon River had begun to decline, and Felix Pedro had discovered gold in the Tanana River valley. Stampeders heading for this new strike left the Eagle City Trail near the Gakona River and followed that stream to its headwaters. Joining Castner's path near Paxson Lake, they crossed the Alaska Range and proceeded down the Delta River. Upon reaching the Delta's mouth, they followed the Tanana River northwest to Fairbanks. By late 1903, this Fairbanks branch had become the dominant interior route.<br /> The new trail quickly attracted its first common carrier. In December 1904, James Fish announced that his Valdez Transportation Company would soon provide passenger service to Fairbanks. \"Over such part of the trail as is practical,\" he assured travelers, \"comfortable bob sleds will be fitted up and drawn by two horses. Over the summit, and wherever it is not practicable [sic] to run two horses abreast, the single double-ended sleds will be used and the horses driven tandem.\" A month later the first of its tri-weekly stages left Valdez, promising a nine day trip for the exorbitant price of $150.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">While not a stage passenger, Wickersham traveled the trail during the same period. Conditions remained somewhat primitive. The judge recorded crashing his dog-sled on the approach to Copper Center, suffering scratches, bruises, and a twisted ankle. Reaching the Chippewa \"roadhouse\" on a cold, February night, Wickersham found only a canvas lean-to attached to a small, open-fronted cabin. Admittedly austere, even this housing was jammed with \"men and dog-teams transporting mining supplies . . . to Fairbanks.\"<br /> <br /> Although too late to be enjoyed by Wickersham, trail improvements were already under discussion. That January, President Theodore Roosevelt had established the Board of Road Commissioners for Alaska (popularly known as the Alaska Road Commission or ARC) and designated Maj. Wilds P. Richardson as its first president. Richardson was particularly concerned about the development of interior Alaska and emphasized the speedy construction of a more permanent Valdez-Fairbanks route.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The ARC's initial construction efforts met only basic demands. The trail's width was determined by its anticipated traffic. Light traffic required a 10-foot roadway, while heavy traffic demanded 16-feet. Over most level, well-drained ground, road crews merely cleared a corridor. Where it was possible to improve drainage, they sometimes removed the moss, \"grading up and crowning, with a single ditch on interior slope and frequent cross culverts to carry off seepage and rainfall and prevent cutting.\" In permafrost areas, where good drainage was impossible, crews utilized corduroy construction. Designed to prevent the frozen ground from melting and creating an impassable quagmire, this technique involved placing a layer of poles parallel to the roadbed and covering them with another layer at right angles to the first. Culvert construction varied. Where the needed water capacity was small, the Road Commission usually fabricated pipe culverts from four 12-inch planks. For larger applications, the crews built culverts entirely of log, except in treeless sections where they sometimes utilized a dry masonry technique.<br /> Under normal conditions, the Road Commission would probably have limited itself to reconnaissance and survey work that first season and not undertaken any real construction. Receiving urgent appeals from the residents of Fairbanks, however, Richardson moved to provide immediate relief. Road crews rapidly replaced 3,032 feet of worn-out corduroy and bridged about 25 small streams.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The ARC distributed and cached the materials necessary for its next construction season along the entire route during the winter of 1905-06. Besides arranging for the delivery of rations, animal forage, and tools, it also began the job of bridging the Tazlina River. Built by Lars Holland, this $19,000 structure replaced a hazardous ferry on which several passengers had been drowned.<br /> For interior Alaska, the bridge was a technological wonder. Four hundred and fifty feet long, it employed two Howe truss spans of 108 feet, two King post spans of 50 feet, and approaches. The main trusses rested on pile bents, protected by 10 x 30 foot, rock-filled crib piers. The trusses were constructed of hewn lumber, with the lower chords built from four to six pieces, bolted and keyed together. A lack of large timber near the site forced Holland to secure trees from as much as six miles away.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Improving the trail was a difficult and expensive process. Engineers had to overcome many obstacles, including a short construction season, raging glacial rivers, permafrost, and an abundance of mountainous terrain. Crews relocated many of the original segments, including the one linking Gakona with Castner's pass. Nevertheless, by the end of the 1906 season, the Alaska Road Commission had finished the route. These trail refinements substantially speeded postal service. While previous contractors had required about ten and one-half days to traverse the distance between Valdez and Fairbanks, mail carrier Ed Orr completed the journey during the winter of 1906-07 in a record time of only six days, ten hours, and ten minutes. The refurbished trail also attracted more common carriers. In 1907, at least two stage lines vied for its passenger and freight business: Orr's company and another operated by Dan T. Kennedy. Orr's enterprise was particularly successful. Equipped with nine-passenger, horse-drawn bobsleds boasting fur robes and carbon-heated foot warmers, it moved travelers from the coast to Fairbanks in just eight days.<br /> <br /> Such changes had a dramatic effect on the community. Expanding quickly, the town soon acquired most of the amenities of civilization, including electric lights, running water, and a telephone system. Something of a supply depot for the rest of the interior, Fairbanks possessed hotels, schools, churches, hospitals, and even a daily newspaper. Although the town received substantial river traffic during its short summer, the remainder of the year the Valdez Trail provided its only access.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Maintenance and Use of the Valdez Trail, 1907-1919</strong><br /> As the Road Commission grew more sophisticated, it eventually adopted fixed standards for its roads. A \"wagon road,\" for example, embraced \"only that class of road intended to meet the conditions of an all-year-round traffic of considerable tonnage, located with suitable grades, crowned, ditched, and drained, and corduroyed or planked where necessary.\" A \"winter road,\" like that between Valdez and Fairbanks, was \"designed to meet the requirements for winter travel only.\" While not crowned, ditched, or drained, such a road possessed suitable width for double teams and a proper grade for loads.<br /> <br /> In 1907, the Alaska Syndicate began developing its rich copper claims above the Kennicott Glacier. While it soon started work on an affiliated railroad, that project required over two years to complete. In the interim, the corporation moved its requisite personnel, supplies, and equipment via the southernmost section of the Valdez Trail. Acting swiftly, it erected a 400-ton mill and a 16,000 foot tramway before the railway ever reached the site. Granted substantial annual funding, the Alaska Road Commission gradually upgraded the Valdez Trail. Originally created for pack and saddle horses, it quickly evolved into a winter road and by the end of 1908, about a third was suitable for wagons. Traffic increased as well. J. H. Ingram, the superintendent of the Valdez District, estimated that contractors had moved over 83,000 pounds of mail, 2,500 tons of freight, and nearly 100 head of cattle over his section during the preceding year.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">By now, enterprising citizens had located \"roadhouses\" along the entire route. Usually owned by homesteaders, these inns provided travelers with a convenient and comfortable place to stop. As most operators cultivated gardens, many supplied fresh vegetables in season. Not surprisingly, these lodges became the local nodes: what Richardson called \"small centers of settlement and supply\" from which to explore the adjoining country.<br /> <br /> The trail itself, however, still needed a little work. In 1908, one pilgrim died when the sled in which he was riding overturned after hitting a chuckhole near the Tiekel River. Travelers experienced other setbacks, as well. Extensive flooding in 1909 severely damaged the Tazlina River Bridge. Repairs cost more than $13,000, about 70 percent of the price of the original structure, and required nearly a year to complete. During the summer of 1909, maintenance of the Valdez Trail required 19 crews. Each consisted of a foreman, cook, two teamsters, and about 20 laborers, plus a wagon and six to eight horses for moving camp and hauling timbers. \"Plows and scrapers were used wherever practicable, although the greater part of the work, being in a broken and rocky country or through brush and timber swamp, had to be done by hand with pick, mattock, and shovel.\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 1910, the trail received its first serious competition. Roughly parallelling its southernmost one-quarter, the Copper River and Northwestern Railroad immediately captured most of the freight traffic headed for the Chitina River valley. Because the train was faster, many Fairbanks-bound travelers also rode it. Disembarking in Chitina, they rejoined the Valdez-Fairbanks route via the newly constructed Chitina-Willow Creek (later Edgerton) Cutoff. Use of the Valdez to Willow Creek section subsequently declined. Ignoring the competition, the Board maintained its expenditures. In 1910, for example, it spent $248,782 on improving the trail. Eventually, its persistent efforts began to achieve results. That August, for example, Richardson made the first continuous trip over the route in a wagon, covering the entire distance in only 13 days!<br /> <br /> The following year the ARC built a new, 420-foot bridge over the Tonsina River, replacing one constructed by the military in 1900 and now considered unsafe. Except for the Gulkana, Delta, Tanana, Salcha, and Piledriver Slough, all important rivers traversed by the trail were now bridged. Of the remaining five, only the Delta lacked a ferry. Bridge work continued in 1912. The Road Commission placed a 40-foot truss over Ptarmigan Creek, two 60-foot spans across Stewart Creek, and a 270-foot pile trestle over Gunn Creek. Most impressive, however, was its 748-foot bridge, possessing a single center king-post, over an unnamed glacier stream near the Miller Roadhouse. The new bridges contributed to another innovation. In 1913, the first motorized vehicle traveled the entire length of the trail. The automobile averaged about nine miles per hour, despite having to be \"helped through soft spots on rather heavy grades.\" Others quickly followed. The Road Commission, however, largely ignored the phenomenon, declaring that it made \"no pretense of having built roads adapted for automobile travel.\" Five years later its basic position remained unchanged. While acknowledging the increasing number of such vehicles, the Board still discouraged their use. Despite the ARC's objections, mechanization had clearly arrived. In 1918, the Board purchased two tractors, one eight-foot road grader, three six-foot road graders, four three-way road drags, and four heavy trucks. Automobile stage coaches now traveled regular routes between Valdez and Fairbanks and motorized vehicles carried most of the mail. No longer a trail, in 1919 the Road Commission conceded to the inevitable and redesignated it as the Richardson Road in honor of its newly retired first president, Colonel Wilds P. Richardson.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Maintenance and Use of the Richardson Road, 1920-1945.</strong><br /> Journeying to Alaska in 1923 to dedicate the Alaska Railroad, President Warren G. Harding inspected both ends of the Richardson Road. While he only viewed about 50 miles of the corridor, he was apparently impressed. In a speech delivered upon his return to Seattle, he noted that \"our long national experience in pushing our highways ahead of the controlling wave of settlement ought to convince us that the broadest liberality towards roads in Alaska will be sure to bring manifold returns.\" In keeping with that belief, the President pledged \"to serve Alaska generously, and more, in this matter of road building.\" Nothing, however, came of his promise; Harding died only a few days later.<br /> <br /> By 1925, tour companies throughout the United States advertised the Richardson Highway as the center portion of the \"Golden Belt Line.\" Appealing to the more adventurous traveler, this circular route stretched from Cordova to Seward and incorporated the Copper River and Northwest Railroad at one end and the Alaska Railroad at the other. One major automobile carrier, aptly designated the Richardson Highway Transportation Company, carried hundreds of passengers each season, operating what it described as a fleet of passenger vehicles over the road \"without delay or inconvenience.\" Controversy erupted in 1932 when the Interior Department tried to increase the profitability of the Alaska Railroad by taxing Richardson Highway users. When most motorists ignored its license fee requirements, the Road Commission tried another tack: collecting a toll at the commission-operated ferry across the Tanana River. Commercial carriers quickly objected and, beginning in 1940, staged a general revolt. Rebellious truckers crossed the river on a home-built scow, defiantly flying a skull-and-crossbones flag. When challenged, one group even seized and disarmed the local U.S. Deputy Marshall. Despite such flagrant violations, the government was powerless to enforce its law. A Fairbanks grand jury judged the tax to be discriminatory and refused to return indictments against the accused. In 1942, Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes finally bowed to the inevitable and repealed the toll.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The threat of war brought many changes to the Richardson Highway. In 1940, Lt. Gen. John L. Dewitt, the commander of the U.S. Fourth Army, recognized that Anchorage was isolated and vulnerable to attack. To alleviate the danger, he proposed connecting the city to the road. Gen. Simon B. Buckner, the head of the Alaska Defense Command, agreed, further suggesting that the highway be widened and straightened, and that its bridges be strengthened sufficiently to withstand the anticipated increase in military traffic. Both were prudent requests. Following the outbreak of World War II, the men and supplies used to construct the Alaska section of the Alcan (now called the Alaska) Highway were all moved along the Richardson, with materials flowing southeast from Fairbanks as well as north from Valdez. Finished in November 1942, the Alcan joined the Richardson Highway to the remainder of the North American highway system at the interior Alaskan village of Delta Junction. The Anchorage connection came more slowly. It was late 1943 before the Glenn Highway, named for pioneer Alaskan explorer, Capt. Edwin F. Glenn, linked the city to the Richardson Highway at Glennallen.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Trail Today</strong><br /> Much of the Valdez Trail now lies buried beneath its major successors, the Richardson and Glenn Highways. Nevertheless, some important pieces remain. The segment between the Tanana and Fortymile Rivers, for example was largely abandoned following the Fairbanks gold discovery, and therefore exemplifies the earliest period of construction. Other sections, like the one found near the Wrangell St. Elias National Park headquarters/visitor center, were bypassed later, and represent subsequent building epochs. Today, park visitors enjoy the trail and walk through the Boreal forest around the visitor center.</p> </center>",
    "audioDescription": "A portion of the Boreal Forest trail leads west from the bus shelter through the boreal forest along the side of the road. Note the trail goes across gravel and dirt, and the ground is slightly uneven with a number of roots sticking up throughout. About 200 feet (60 m) along from the bus shelter, the path comes to a “T.” The Boreal Forest trail continues right to the north, while a section of the Valdez trail leads north and south to the right and left. At this intersection, a black-and-white photograph on a three-foot tall (1 m) angled metal wayside panel shows a wintry scene with line of men wearing fur coats and black hats trudging through hip-deep snow with several horses laboring to pull heavily-laden wagons through the drifts. Text on the panel reads: The Valdez Trail “Long on prospects and short on gold,” stampeders — anxious gold miners — hurried along this trail blazed by the U.S. Army at the turn of the 20th century. Gold strikes in Canada’s Klondike River Valley lured miners north through the Yukon Territory. Americans objected to foreign-controlled trails, so the Army cut this trail — the Valdez Trail — opening the Alaskan interior. The Valdez Trail led from Prince William Sound at Valdez to the Yukon River settlement of Eagle City. But a new gold discovery shifted attention west to Alaska’s Tanana Valley. By 1904 a different route was established, Valdez to Fairbanks, which remains a dominant Alaskan interior passageway today. A caption below the lead horse in the center reads: The Valdez Trail officially opened as a miner’s trail in 1901. By 1904 horse-drawn wagons and dog sleds carried freight and passengers along the trail; and in 1913 the first automobile traveled the trail’s length. Inset at the top right, a narrow black line on a blue map of Alaska shows the path of the trail. It leads from Valdez along the southern central coast north to Glennallen at the western edge of present-day Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve. From there, the trail splits in two, one leg continuing north to Fairbanks, while the other leg veers northeast to Eagle City near the Canadian border. At the lower right, a green inset map shows the location of the Valdez trail within the visitor center complex, indicated by a thin green line running north and south along the left edge of the map. A black “You Are Here” marker at the lower left of map indicates your current position. A green marker to the east indicates the location of the visitor center. A dotted red line traces a circle on the map, identified as the Boreal Forest trail. The two trails run together at the left. A caption under the map reads: Walk in the tracks of early Alaskan pioneers. This 1⁄2-mile loop trail follows one of the few remaining sections of the Valdez Trail, replaced today by the Richardson Highway.",

Built by the U.S. Army and the Alaska Road Commission between 1898 and 1907, it followed a series of indigenous paths linked by such prominent explorers as Lt. Henry T. Allen, Capt. William R. Abercrombie, Capt. Edwin F. Glenn, and Lt. Joseph C. Castner. Although originally directed to Eagle City, the trail was diverted to Fairbanks following a nearby gold discovery in 1902. A closing thrust in a period of pioneer American trail building which began with Daniel Boone's construction of his Wilderness Road through the Allegheny Mountains in 1769, the Valdez Trail channelled people, freight, and mail into the district, promoting mining activity, aiding the development of supporting industries, and hastening the settlement of the Copper, Yukon, and Tanana river valleys.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Native groups traditionally controlled all of the land bordering the Valdez Trail. South of the Chugach mountains, the land belonged to the Chugach (or Prince William Sound) Eskimo. Various Athapaskan groups held the more northern territory. Each created their own transportation networks. In general, local paths were used for subsistence activities, while longer trails were used for trade and occasionally for raiding. These routes usually followed natural corridors such as river valleys and traversed the more obvious mountain passes. Trade occurred among the different Alaska Native groups long before contact with the Russians. The Ahtna, for example, often served as middlemen, bartering with the Chugach, Tlingit, and Eyak peoples, as well as their Athapaskan relatives, the Dena'ina and the Tanana. Although copper was their most important export, they also exchanged moose, caribou, lynx, and beaver pelts for marine products like seal skin boots. Both oral and documentary evidence suggests that the Ahtna regularly held intertribal trade fairs within the Valdez Trail corridor, including ones near both Thompson and Isabel passes.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>American Exploration of the Valdez Trail Corridor, 1885-1898.</strong><br /> When the United States acquired Alaska from Russia in 1867, neither party knew much about the territory's eastern interior. Russians had focused their attention on coastal areas and had only made a few abbreviated attempts to explore the region. Americans, in contrast, had never visited the area at all. Neglected for the next fifteen years, the district began attracting interest in the mid-1880s. Gold strikes in northern British Columbia's Cassiar region and near the present site of Juneau lured prospectors to the north. Many eventually entered the interior, most by way of the Yukon River, but some via Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. The American government worried about the potential for conflict between the undisciplined miners and Alaska's Native population. Consequently, the U.S. Army soon dispatched several expeditions to reconnoiter the region. One such party, led by Lt. Frederick Schwatka, charted the entire Yukon River in 1883. Another, headed by Lt. William R. Abercrombie, attempted to examine the Copper River basin the following year. Although stopped by rapids on the lower river, Abercrombie later located an alternative overland route to the interior: across the Valdez Glacier heading the Valdez Arm.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 1885, the army sent Lt. Henry T. Allen to finish Abercrombie's work. More successful than his predecessor, the lieutenant ascended the Copper River and pioneered the route across the Alaska Range and into the Tanana River valley.<br /> Five years later, a private expedition led by E. Hazard Wells added another segment. Journeying down the Yukon from its headwaters, the party traveled up the Fortymile River and traversed the Kechumstuk Hills to Mansfield Lake. From there, they crossed the Tanana River and ascended the Tok River to near Mentasta Pass. Much of this route was later incorporated into the trail's Eagle City Branch.<br /> <br /> Northern gold discoveries continued, climaxing with an especially rich find on northwestern Canada's Klondike River in 1896. This precipitated the region's greatest rush. In their haste to reach the gold fields, many stampeders prepared inadequately for the hardships they would have to endure. As a result, the U.S. Army soon received reports of widespread deprivation. Responding to the rumors, the military dispatched Capt. Patrick H. Ray and Lt. Wilds P. Richardson to proceed to Alaska and to provide necessary relief. Most stampeders reached the Klondike via a largely Canadian path over the Chilkoot Pass, located near the northern end of Alaska's Lynn Canal. Many, however, objected to the foreign control of that transportation corridor and called for an \"all-American route.\" Recognizing the logic of their demands, Ray recommended the immediate construction of a government trail into the Yukon River basin. Unscrupulous local promoters, circulating stories of an easy passage linking Prince William Sound with the interior, lured thousands of gullible stampeders to Port Valdez. Unfortunately, the arriving prospectors found only one way across the Chugach Range: Abercrombie's exceptionally difficult and dangerous path over the Valdez and Klutina glaciers. Faced with few options, most attempted that route, and many eventually died from disease, accidents, and exposure.<br /> In the spring of 1898, the army sent Capt. William R. Abercrombie back to Port Valdez, hoping to locate a safer way. The captain first inspected the Lowe River valley, where he spotted the remains of a Chugach trail leading to the north toward Keystone Canyon. Proceeding to the interior via the Valdez Glacier, Abercrombie found an Ahtna path leading up the right (or western) bank of the Copper River. Both were eventually utilized by the Valdez Trail.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Construction of the Valdez Trail, 1898-1906</strong><br /> Abercrombie returned to the region in 1899. Utilizing only hand tools, his soldiers built a 93-mile packhorse trail from the coastal community of Valdez to the Tonsina River. Weary stampeders immediately adopted this shorter path. Addison M. Powell, a civilian employee of Abercrombie's and an early explorer of the Chistochina River, reported that by the end of the summer, the route was already filled with prospectors headed for the Nizina River basin. Encouraged by such traffic, construction continued, and by 1901 the army had completed its trail all the way to Eagle City. Alaska residents soon demanded additional federal aid. In 1903, visiting members of a Senate Subcommittee on Territories heard testimony on a broad range of subjects, including the need for better transportation. Army Signal Corps Lt. William L. Mitchell, for example, related the current condition of the Valdez-Eagle City Trail. Pioneer Judge James Wickersham went even further. He requested that the government improve the route, calling such action an essential prerequisite to developing the interior's mining potential. U.S. Geological Survey geologist Alfred H. Brooks agreed. Incidental to a discussion on the future of placer mining, he recommended that a million dollars be spent in building wagon roads to the inland placer camps. Such arguments seem to have convinced the senators. Upon returning to Washington, they recommended that the government construct a system of transportation routes, beginning with a well-built wagon road connecting Valdez and Eagle City. That winter Congress appropriated $25,000 to conduct the initial survey. The following spring the War Department appointed an army engineer to supervise the work. Completing the job in August 1904, J. M. Clapp estimated that it would cost $3,500 per mile or a total of approximately $1.5 million to build the road.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">By then, however, Eagle City had already lost its priority as the trail's terminus. Mineral production on the upper Yukon River had begun to decline, and Felix Pedro had discovered gold in the Tanana River valley. Stampeders heading for this new strike left the Eagle City Trail near the Gakona River and followed that stream to its headwaters. Joining Castner's path near Paxson Lake, they crossed the Alaska Range and proceeded down the Delta River. Upon reaching the Delta's mouth, they followed the Tanana River northwest to Fairbanks. By late 1903, this Fairbanks branch had become the dominant interior route.<br /> The new trail quickly attracted its first common carrier. In December 1904, James Fish announced that his Valdez Transportation Company would soon provide passenger service to Fairbanks. \"Over such part of the trail as is practical,\" he assured travelers, \"comfortable bob sleds will be fitted up and drawn by two horses. Over the summit, and wherever it is not practicable [sic] to run two horses abreast, the single double-ended sleds will be used and the horses driven tandem.\" A month later the first of its tri-weekly stages left Valdez, promising a nine day trip for the exorbitant price of $150.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">While not a stage passenger, Wickersham traveled the trail during the same period. Conditions remained somewhat primitive. The judge recorded crashing his dog-sled on the approach to Copper Center, suffering scratches, bruises, and a twisted ankle. Reaching the Chippewa \"roadhouse\" on a cold, February night, Wickersham found only a canvas lean-to attached to a small, open-fronted cabin. Admittedly austere, even this housing was jammed with \"men and dog-teams transporting mining supplies . . . to Fairbanks.\"<br /> <br /> Although too late to be enjoyed by Wickersham, trail improvements were already under discussion. That January, President Theodore Roosevelt had established the Board of Road Commissioners for Alaska (popularly known as the Alaska Road Commission or ARC) and designated Maj. Wilds P. Richardson as its first president. Richardson was particularly concerned about the development of interior Alaska and emphasized the speedy construction of a more permanent Valdez-Fairbanks route.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The ARC's initial construction efforts met only basic demands. The trail's width was determined by its anticipated traffic. Light traffic required a 10-foot roadway, while heavy traffic demanded 16-feet. Over most level, well-drained ground, road crews merely cleared a corridor. Where it was possible to improve drainage, they sometimes removed the moss, \"grading up and crowning, with a single ditch on interior slope and frequent cross culverts to carry off seepage and rainfall and prevent cutting.\" In permafrost areas, where good drainage was impossible, crews utilized corduroy construction. Designed to prevent the frozen ground from melting and creating an impassable quagmire, this technique involved placing a layer of poles parallel to the roadbed and covering them with another layer at right angles to the first. Culvert construction varied. Where the needed water capacity was small, the Road Commission usually fabricated pipe culverts from four 12-inch planks. For larger applications, the crews built culverts entirely of log, except in treeless sections where they sometimes utilized a dry masonry technique.<br /> Under normal conditions, the Road Commission would probably have limited itself to reconnaissance and survey work that first season and not undertaken any real construction. Receiving urgent appeals from the residents of Fairbanks, however, Richardson moved to provide immediate relief. Road crews rapidly replaced 3,032 feet of worn-out corduroy and bridged about 25 small streams.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The ARC distributed and cached the materials necessary for its next construction season along the entire route during the winter of 1905-06. Besides arranging for the delivery of rations, animal forage, and tools, it also began the job of bridging the Tazlina River. Built by Lars Holland, this $19,000 structure replaced a hazardous ferry on which several passengers had been drowned.<br /> For interior Alaska, the bridge was a technological wonder. Four hundred and fifty feet long, it employed two Howe truss spans of 108 feet, two King post spans of 50 feet, and approaches. The main trusses rested on pile bents, protected by 10 x 30 foot, rock-filled crib piers. The trusses were constructed of hewn lumber, with the lower chords built from four to six pieces, bolted and keyed together. A lack of large timber near the site forced Holland to secure trees from as much as six miles away.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Improving the trail was a difficult and expensive process. Engineers had to overcome many obstacles, including a short construction season, raging glacial rivers, permafrost, and an abundance of mountainous terrain. Crews relocated many of the original segments, including the one linking Gakona with Castner's pass. Nevertheless, by the end of the 1906 season, the Alaska Road Commission had finished the route. These trail refinements substantially speeded postal service. While previous contractors had required about ten and one-half days to traverse the distance between Valdez and Fairbanks, mail carrier Ed Orr completed the journey during the winter of 1906-07 in a record time of only six days, ten hours, and ten minutes. The refurbished trail also attracted more common carriers. In 1907, at least two stage lines vied for its passenger and freight business: Orr's company and another operated by Dan T. Kennedy. Orr's enterprise was particularly successful. Equipped with nine-passenger, horse-drawn bobsleds boasting fur robes and carbon-heated foot warmers, it moved travelers from the coast to Fairbanks in just eight days.<br /> <br /> Such changes had a dramatic effect on the community. Expanding quickly, the town soon acquired most of the amenities of civilization, including electric lights, running water, and a telephone system. Something of a supply depot for the rest of the interior, Fairbanks possessed hotels, schools, churches, hospitals, and even a daily newspaper. Although the town received substantial river traffic during its short summer, the remainder of the year the Valdez Trail provided its only access.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Maintenance and Use of the Valdez Trail, 1907-1919</strong><br /> As the Road Commission grew more sophisticated, it eventually adopted fixed standards for its roads. A \"wagon road,\" for example, embraced \"only that class of road intended to meet the conditions of an all-year-round traffic of considerable tonnage, located with suitable grades, crowned, ditched, and drained, and corduroyed or planked where necessary.\" A \"winter road,\" like that between Valdez and Fairbanks, was \"designed to meet the requirements for winter travel only.\" While not crowned, ditched, or drained, such a road possessed suitable width for double teams and a proper grade for loads.<br /> <br /> In 1907, the Alaska Syndicate began developing its rich copper claims above the Kennicott Glacier. While it soon started work on an affiliated railroad, that project required over two years to complete. In the interim, the corporation moved its requisite personnel, supplies, and equipment via the southernmost section of the Valdez Trail. Acting swiftly, it erected a 400-ton mill and a 16,000 foot tramway before the railway ever reached the site. Granted substantial annual funding, the Alaska Road Commission gradually upgraded the Valdez Trail. Originally created for pack and saddle horses, it quickly evolved into a winter road and by the end of 1908, about a third was suitable for wagons. Traffic increased as well. J. H. Ingram, the superintendent of the Valdez District, estimated that contractors had moved over 83,000 pounds of mail, 2,500 tons of freight, and nearly 100 head of cattle over his section during the preceding year.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">By now, enterprising citizens had located \"roadhouses\" along the entire route. Usually owned by homesteaders, these inns provided travelers with a convenient and comfortable place to stop. As most operators cultivated gardens, many supplied fresh vegetables in season. Not surprisingly, these lodges became the local nodes: what Richardson called \"small centers of settlement and supply\" from which to explore the adjoining country.<br /> <br /> The trail itself, however, still needed a little work. In 1908, one pilgrim died when the sled in which he was riding overturned after hitting a chuckhole near the Tiekel River. Travelers experienced other setbacks, as well. Extensive flooding in 1909 severely damaged the Tazlina River Bridge. Repairs cost more than $13,000, about 70 percent of the price of the original structure, and required nearly a year to complete. During the summer of 1909, maintenance of the Valdez Trail required 19 crews. Each consisted of a foreman, cook, two teamsters, and about 20 laborers, plus a wagon and six to eight horses for moving camp and hauling timbers. \"Plows and scrapers were used wherever practicable, although the greater part of the work, being in a broken and rocky country or through brush and timber swamp, had to be done by hand with pick, mattock, and shovel.\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 1910, the trail received its first serious competition. Roughly parallelling its southernmost one-quarter, the Copper River and Northwestern Railroad immediately captured most of the freight traffic headed for the Chitina River valley. Because the train was faster, many Fairbanks-bound travelers also rode it. Disembarking in Chitina, they rejoined the Valdez-Fairbanks route via the newly constructed Chitina-Willow Creek (later Edgerton) Cutoff. Use of the Valdez to Willow Creek section subsequently declined. Ignoring the competition, the Board maintained its expenditures. In 1910, for example, it spent $248,782 on improving the trail. Eventually, its persistent efforts began to achieve results. That August, for example, Richardson made the first continuous trip over the route in a wagon, covering the entire distance in only 13 days!<br /> <br /> The following year the ARC built a new, 420-foot bridge over the Tonsina River, replacing one constructed by the military in 1900 and now considered unsafe. Except for the Gulkana, Delta, Tanana, Salcha, and Piledriver Slough, all important rivers traversed by the trail were now bridged. Of the remaining five, only the Delta lacked a ferry. Bridge work continued in 1912. The Road Commission placed a 40-foot truss over Ptarmigan Creek, two 60-foot spans across Stewart Creek, and a 270-foot pile trestle over Gunn Creek. Most impressive, however, was its 748-foot bridge, possessing a single center king-post, over an unnamed glacier stream near the Miller Roadhouse. The new bridges contributed to another innovation. In 1913, the first motorized vehicle traveled the entire length of the trail. The automobile averaged about nine miles per hour, despite having to be \"helped through soft spots on rather heavy grades.\" Others quickly followed. The Road Commission, however, largely ignored the phenomenon, declaring that it made \"no pretense of having built roads adapted for automobile travel.\" Five years later its basic position remained unchanged. While acknowledging the increasing number of such vehicles, the Board still discouraged their use. Despite the ARC's objections, mechanization had clearly arrived. In 1918, the Board purchased two tractors, one eight-foot road grader, three six-foot road graders, four three-way road drags, and four heavy trucks. Automobile stage coaches now traveled regular routes between Valdez and Fairbanks and motorized vehicles carried most of the mail. No longer a trail, in 1919 the Road Commission conceded to the inevitable and redesignated it as the Richardson Road in honor of its newly retired first president, Colonel Wilds P. Richardson.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Maintenance and Use of the Richardson Road, 1920-1945.</strong><br /> Journeying to Alaska in 1923 to dedicate the Alaska Railroad, President Warren G. Harding inspected both ends of the Richardson Road. While he only viewed about 50 miles of the corridor, he was apparently impressed. In a speech delivered upon his return to Seattle, he noted that \"our long national experience in pushing our highways ahead of the controlling wave of settlement ought to convince us that the broadest liberality towards roads in Alaska will be sure to bring manifold returns.\" In keeping with that belief, the President pledged \"to serve Alaska generously, and more, in this matter of road building.\" Nothing, however, came of his promise; Harding died only a few days later.<br /> <br /> By 1925, tour companies throughout the United States advertised the Richardson Highway as the center portion of the \"Golden Belt Line.\" Appealing to the more adventurous traveler, this circular route stretched from Cordova to Seward and incorporated the Copper River and Northwest Railroad at one end and the Alaska Railroad at the other. One major automobile carrier, aptly designated the Richardson Highway Transportation Company, carried hundreds of passengers each season, operating what it described as a fleet of passenger vehicles over the road \"without delay or inconvenience.\" Controversy erupted in 1932 when the Interior Department tried to increase the profitability of the Alaska Railroad by taxing Richardson Highway users. When most motorists ignored its license fee requirements, the Road Commission tried another tack: collecting a toll at the commission-operated ferry across the Tanana River. Commercial carriers quickly objected and, beginning in 1940, staged a general revolt. Rebellious truckers crossed the river on a home-built scow, defiantly flying a skull-and-crossbones flag. When challenged, one group even seized and disarmed the local U.S. Deputy Marshall. Despite such flagrant violations, the government was powerless to enforce its law. A Fairbanks grand jury judged the tax to be discriminatory and refused to return indictments against the accused. In 1942, Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes finally bowed to the inevitable and repealed the toll.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The threat of war brought many changes to the Richardson Highway. In 1940, Lt. Gen. John L. Dewitt, the commander of the U.S. Fourth Army, recognized that Anchorage was isolated and vulnerable to attack. To alleviate the danger, he proposed connecting the city to the road. Gen. Simon B. Buckner, the head of the Alaska Defense Command, agreed, further suggesting that the highway be widened and straightened, and that its bridges be strengthened sufficiently to withstand the anticipated increase in military traffic. Both were prudent requests. Following the outbreak of World War II, the men and supplies used to construct the Alaska section of the Alcan (now called the Alaska) Highway were all moved along the Richardson, with materials flowing southeast from Fairbanks as well as north from Valdez. Finished in November 1942, the Alcan joined the Richardson Highway to the remainder of the North American highway system at the interior Alaskan village of Delta Junction. The Anchorage connection came more slowly. It was late 1943 before the Glenn Highway, named for pioneer Alaskan explorer, Capt. Edwin F. Glenn, linked the city to the Richardson Highway at Glennallen.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"> </p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Trail Today</strong><br /> Much of the Valdez Trail now lies buried beneath its major successors, the Richardson and Glenn Highways. Nevertheless, some important pieces remain. The segment between the Tanana and Fortymile Rivers, for example was largely abandoned following the Fairbanks gold discovery, and therefore exemplifies the earliest period of construction. Other sections, like the one found near the Wrangell St. Elias National Park headquarters/visitor center, were bypassed later, and represent subsequent building epochs. Today, park visitors enjoy the trail and walk through the Boreal forest around the visitor center.</p> </center> </div>",

    "audioDescription": "About 200 feet (60 m) east along an asphalt path from the “Planning Your Visit” wayside panel, past the restroom and exhibit hall buildings in the Visitor Center Complex, the path widens out to the left and right along a bluff overlooking a wide, tree-covered valley. On the far side of the path at the left, a pair of long-range binoculars, mounted atop a four-foot (1.25 m) metal pole with a wide circular metal foot stand at the base, offers stunning views of the valley and mountains beyond. The Copper River is visible through the trees at the lower left. To the right of the binoculars, a color photograph taken from this view point fills an angled metal wayside panel. Two snow-covered mountains rising above the trees on the far side of the valley are identified: at the left, Mount Drum is 12,010 feet (3,661 m) tall. At the right, Mount Wrangell is 14,163 feet (4,317 m) tall. Text on the panel, entitled “Violent Silhouettes,” reads: Visible from here are two prominent mountains: Mount Drum and Mount Wrangell. Both are volcanoes, but their silhouettes suggest a difference in their eruptive histories. The younger Mount Wrangell is a shield volcano, a broad-dome mountain built mainly of oozing lava flows. Mount Wrangell is still an active volcano and on calm days you can see steam rising from its summit. The older Mount Drum is a stratovolcano—potentially a very explosive volcano. Stratovolcanoes are steeper and more conical than shield volcanoes. Blobs of molten rock exploded skyward in successive eruptions to form Mount Drum. From this angle Mount Drum appears taller than Mount Wrangell, though it is actually 2,000 feet shorter. But as recently as 250,000 years ago Mount Drum was 2,000 feet taller—that is, before its top blew off! A caption beneath a smaller black-and-white photograph of Mount Wrangell inset at the lower right reads: Dark volcanic ash blankets Mount Wrangell, while a steam plume rises from an active crater, around 1902. Thousands of volcanic lava flows, covering more than 4,000 square miles, compose the Wrangell Mountains. South of this location, the asphalt path continues to another wayside panel and overlook, and the park amphitheater. To the north, the path leads to the start of the Boreal Forest-Valdez loop trail.",

    "audioDescription": "About 150 feet (45 m) north along the asphalt bluff path from the Violent Silhouettes wayside panel and overlook, a color photograph fills an angled, metal wayside panel. Entitled, “Walk in the Steps of Pioneers,” it shows a narrow dirt path winding through the low, mossy underbrush of a forest of spruce trees. Note that about 30 feet (9 m) south of this location, a pair of long-range binoculars, mounted atop a five-foot (1.5 m) metal pole with a concrete base, offers stunning views of the valley and mountains to the east. Note a wooden bench on the opposite side of the path across from these binoculars. Text at the bottom left of the panel provides information about some of the easy hiking trails here at the Wrangell-St. Elias Visitor Center Complex. It reads: The 1/2-mile loop trail follows even terrain, though wheelchair-users may need assistance. The trail passes along the river bluff, then cuts through the forest, connecting to a section of the historic Valdez Trail, the first all-American route into interior Alaska. A transition begins here, though it’s not obvious. But walk a short distance and you’ll see an abruptness that marks the shift from one forest successional stage to the next. Still farther, you’ll walk in the steps of pioneers who brought about great change to this wild land. Please use caution as you travel through bear country. Leave cultural sites, plants, and animals undisturbed, for future generations to enjoy.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Accessible only by plane or boat, the Yakutat area encompasses the park's coastal region, with 155 miles of coastline, where huge mountains, enormous glaciers, and temperate rainforest meet the ocean. Visitor services are only found in the town of Yakutat, which is a plane or boat ride away from the park boundary.</p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\">The small town of Yakutat is located near the southern border of the park. Here is more information about the general area around Yakutat.</span><br /> <br /> <strong>Latitude 59.5469° N, Longitude 139.7272° W</strong></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\"><strong>ACTIVITIES AND SEASONS</strong><br /> A wide variety of outdoor enthusiasts come here to hike the beaches, float or fish the rivers, surf ocean waves, explore the bays, view glaciers, climb mountains and enjoy the wilderness. Each season has its advantages and disadvantages. Numerous storms usually accompanied by high winds occur during the spring, fall and winter.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\">The spring bird migration begins in April. Thousands of gulls, geese, and seaducks can be observed, as well as hundreds of swans and sandhill cranes. The main wave of bird migrations passes through the last week of April and the first week of May. Grey and humpback whales can also be observed migrating off the coast. Spring is a time when steelhead are found in many streams, mountain goats are close to sea level, the snow is melting, and the lush coastal greenery begins to make its comeback.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\">Summer is typified by meadows of wildflowers in bloom, eighteen hours of daylight, huge concentrations of Aleutian and Arctic terns along the coast, hundreds of harbor seals on icebergs, and salmonberries, blue berries and strawberries for the picking.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\">In the fall, hundreds of thousands of salmon spawn in the many rivers and streams, drawing hundreds of foraging gulls, eagles, ravens, magpies, and brown bears. The fall bird migration begins in September, bringing sandhill cranes, Canada geese, snow geese, whistling swans and waterfowl through the Malaspina and Yakutat Forelands. Fall is also a peak time for sport fishing and hunting.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\">During the winter, it is a quiet time. Waterfowl retreat from the coast to sheltered locations. Hundreds of Steller sea lions haul out at wintering sites along the coast. Wolf, moose and other animal tracks are readily visible in the snow. The daylight hours shorten to six per day, and on clear nights the aurora sweeps across the starry skies.</span></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yakutatternfestival.org/\"><span style=\"color:null;\"><strong>Yakutat Tern Festival</strong></span></a><br /> <span style=\"color:null;\">This festival centers around one of the largest known breeding colonies of Aleutian Tern. Witness the terns and the region's rich artistic and cultural heritage at this wonderful festival. Lots of great activities planned including field trips (new kayak and charter boat based trips this year), art show, cultural events including a performance by the Mt. St. Elias Dancers, seminars, photography workshop, children's activities, live bird programs by the Alaska Raptor Center, and more.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\"><strong>FEDERAL LAND AGENCIES IN YAKUTAT</strong></span><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wrst/planyourvisit/yakutat-ranger-station.htm\"><span style=\"color:null;\">NPS Yakutat District Office:</span></a><span style=\"color:null;\"> Wrangell-St. Elias and Glacier Bay National Parks & Preserves both operate out of Yakutat.</span><br /> <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/tongass/about-forest/districts/?cid=stelprdb5403749\"><span style=\"color:null;\">USFS Yakutat Ranger District:</span></a><span style=\"color:null;\"> The U.S. Forest Service operates out of Yakutat, and maintains several hiking trails that are available to visitors.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\"><strong>TRAVELING TO YAKUTAT</strong><br /> Yakutat is a remote community and, like many cities in Southeast Alaska, can only be accessed by air or water.

With a good rain jacket, pants, and hat you will be a prepared visitor to this land of \"mountain and glacier weather\". Fishermen, locals, and park ranger staff recommend commercial-grade rain gear and rubber boots for footgear when boating, beach hiking, and fishing in the area. Cool temperatures and heavy precipitation make hypothermia a possibility at any time during of year, so always carry your rain gear and make every effort to remain dry.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\"><strong>WARM CLOTHING</strong><br /> Garments made of wool and synthetic material such as pile, polarguard, and texolite are very good since they provide warmth even when wet. Summer temperatures can drop to the low 40's and cooler in the mountains.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\"><strong>CAMPFIRES</strong><br /> Campfires are seldom possible due to precipitation. Driftwood is abundant and a good source of firewood when camping along the coast.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\"><strong>MAPS</strong><br /> Maps are strongly recommended, but not currently available for purchase in Yakutat. Topographic maps can be purchased online at </span><a href=\"https://store.usgs.gov/\"><span style=\"color:null;\">the USGS Store</span></a><span style=\"color:null;\">.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\"><strong>TIDE BOOKS</strong><br /> Tide books are an especially important item if boating, kayaking, fishing, or hiking the coast. Remember to camp above the high tide line, always secure your boat or kayak when on shore, and access the outwash streams and river channels at high slack water. If you cross a stream or walk the beach at low tide remember that conditions may be drastically different should you return by the same route a couple hours later.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:null;\"><strong>BEARS</strong><br /> There are abundant bears in the Yakutat area.

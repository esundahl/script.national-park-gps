The National Mall is the continuation of that space where congressionally authorized park icons, such as the Washington Monument, WWII and Lincoln Memorials stand. This historic expanse is the linear area between the Potomac River and Capital Reflecting Pool. In addition to the memorial core, the park includes some 156 reservations, circles, fountains and other open spaces, all of which serve as the nation’s front yard. Ford’s Theatre, The House where Lincoln died, Potomac Park, Hains Point and Pennsylvania Avenue NHS are also among the park managed areas that constitute National Mall and Memorial Parks.</p> <p>Having over 1,000 acres of National Park Service managed land at the heart of our nation’s capital, National Mall and Memorial Parks provides visitors with abundant opportunities to get in touch with our heritage. With everything from colossal monuments to commemorative gardens, from presidential inaugurals to civil rights demonstrations, National Mall and Memorial Parks hosts history in the making. Numerous First Amendment activities and special events are held in the park each year to honor the courage, sacrifice and devotion to duty of war veterans; celebrate the United States commitment to freedom, equality and democratic ideals; and enjoy symbolic architecture, historic vistas and renowned natural landscapes. </p>",

As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.

    "bodyText": "New York sculptor artist Rudolph Evans was selected by the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Commission to undertake the portrait statue of Thomas Jefferson. The 19’ tall bronze statue was installed in April of 1947, replacing the original statue which due to wartime restrictions on the use of precious metals, was made of plaster-of-Paris. What is Jefferson looking at? The statue faces north towards the White House which he lived in as our Third President. Jefferson also looks toward the monument to his fellow Virginia revolutionary, George Washington. Some point out that Jefferson may be keeping a wary eye on Alexander Hamilton, his great political foe. Hamilton's statue, by James Earle Fraser, is on the south side of the U.S. Treasury Building.<br /> <br /> If one were to walk behind the Thomas Jefferson statue, several things appear to confirm Jefferson's love of the land and agriculture. These interest are represented by a stack of books and stalks of corn.",

Many of Roosevelt’s New Deal programs provided economic opportunity for those that needed help. King’s work in the Civil Rights Movement to attain fairer social and economic opportunity sought to make the ideals contained in the Declaration of Independence a reality for all Americans. The beginning and end goal are one.  </p>",

An additional twelve columns support the north portico, and four columns stand in each of the memorials four openings to the north, south, east and west. A sculpture set in the triangular roof line of the memorial's north side depicts five men, two seated on either side of a man standing at a large document laid across a table.<br />The memorial is constructed of white marble and rests upon a series of granite and marble-stepped terraces. A flight of granite and marble stairs and platforms, flanked by granite buttresses, lead up from the Tidal Basin.<br />A nineteen-foot tall bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson in a long fur-collared coat stands atop a six-foot tall black granite pedestal in the center of the dome-roofed main chamber.

An inscription on the face of the pedestal base reads:<br />THOMAS JEFFERSON<br />1743-1826<br />The interior roof is adorned with a rectangular block design. Four quotations topped with bronze wreaths are carved into the walls of the main chamber and an inscription around the lower edge of the chamber dome interior reads:<br />I HAVE SWORN UPON THE ALTAR OF GOD ETERNAL HOSTILITY AGAINST EVERY FORM OF TYRANNY OVER THE MIND OF MAN<br />A bookstore sits on the east side of the main entrance into the memorial at the top of the stairs.

An additional twelve columns support the north portico, and four columns stand in each of the memorials four openings to the north, south, east and west. A sculpture set in the triangular roof line of the memorial's north side depicts five men, two seated on either side of a man standing at a large document laid across a table.<br />The memorial is constructed of white marble and rests upon a series of granite and marble-stepped terraces. A flight of granite and marble stairs and platforms, flanked by granite buttresses, lead up from the Tidal Basin. A silhouette of tall figure can be seen standing inside through the columns of the memorial.<br />Set in the center of the domed main chamber is a nineteen-foot tall bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson in a long fur-collared coat standing atop a six-foot tall black granite pedestal. Jefferson's left foot is set forward slightly and he holds rolled up papers in his left hand. His right hand holds a quill pen. Set behind the statue's right foot are two column capitals, partially hidden by the back of Jefferson's long coat. An inscription on the face of the pedestal base reads:<br />THOMAS JEFFERSON<br />1743-1826<br />An inscription on the left edge of the statue base reads:<br />R. EVANS<br />The interior roof is adorned with a rectangular block design. Four quotations topped with bronze wreaths are carved into the walls of the main chamber and an inscription around the lower edge of the chamber dome interior reads:<br />I HAVE SWORN UPON THE ALTAR OF GOD ETERNAL HOSTILITY AGAINST EVERY FORM OF TYRANNY OVER THE MIND OF MAN<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

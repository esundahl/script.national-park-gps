The house sits high atop a steep hill and the property encompasses the entire block. A black iron gate set atop a cement retaining wall surrounds the area. A visitor center is located at street level at the corner of W and 15th Streets. A parking lot to the north of the visitor center is accessible on W Street. Stairs to the right of the visitor center entrance lead up to a road that winds up to the house at the top of the hill. A red brick sidewalk lines the south side of W Street and stairs lead straight up to the house at the middle of the block. A road leads into the property from 14th Street at the intersection with W Street, passes by the front of the house at mid-level up the hill, and continues to rise as it winds around to the back of the house at the top of the hill. Two metal railings line the brick center stairs that rise from street level through a grass hill lawn on both sides to the front door of the house. The tan-painted, two-story home features a sweeping forty-foot long porch with four white round columns. The double-hung white front door is bracketed by two floor-to-ceiling windows on each side with dark gray shutters. Tall evergreen trees are set on both sides of the house and the view from atop the hill provides sweeping views of downtown Washington including the Capitol building. Immediately behind the house is a white, fifty-foot long, one-story cottage home with a red roof and porch on the west side, closest to the main house. Three windows line the east and west sides of the house. Two windows sit along the back with a half-moon window above. Red brick walkways lines both sides. On the wall left of the front door, under the porch, is a one by two-foot bronze plaque with a gold border. An engraving on the plaque reads: In Loving Memory of \"The Guardian Angel of Cedar Hill\" Gladys B. Parham 1906-1983 In recognition of her steadfast dedication to the preservation and maintenance of the Frederick Douglass Home Erected by Frederick Douglass Memorial And Historical Association 1987 Behind the house is an eighty-foot long stretch of grass lawn that leads back to a circular paved road loop with a tree in its center. The road from 14th Street winds up to this location. About thirty feet east of the circle is a small one-story stone building, twelve feet wide and nine feet deep with a chimney on its right side. The building is bracketed by trees and shrubs. To the south of the circle set on a hill in front of a grass field is a partially constructed brick wall, about twenty feet across, five-feet-tall and the depth of two bricks. A smaller wall about ten feet long and two feet tall sits at the southwest corner of the circle. END OF DESCRIPTION",

Douglass was born in February 1818 on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, the son of an enslaved mother and a white father. As a child, he worked in the fields, was moved from one family to another and was hired out to shipbuilders in Baltimore. Through these years he learned to read and write, met free blacks – learning that it was possible to be African American and be free – joined the Bethel A.M.E. Church in Baltimore, and began to engage in debates. After several failed attempts to escape to the North, he succeeded in 1838, settling in New Bedford, Massachusetts, with his new wife Anna. Within the next few years, Douglass championed the right of African Americans to fight in the Union Army and in May 1863, saw two of his sons leave with the Massachusetts 54</span><sup>th</sup><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> Regiments for South Carolina. After the Civil War, he worked unceasingly for full civil rights for African Americans.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Douglass purchased his estate, Cedar Hill, in 1877. He was appointed US Minister and Counsel General to Haiti by President Benjamin Harrison, resigned the post in 1893, and returned to Cedar Hill where he died February 20, 1895.The site has a visitor center with exhibits. Contact the park for tours of the home. </span></p>",

To the south of the circle set on a hill in front of a grass field is a partially constructed brick wall, about twenty feet across, five-feet-tall and the depth of two bricks. A smaller wall about ten feet long and two feet tall sits at the southwest corner of the circle. Further south is an open field that runs back about two hundred feet and is bordered by trees to the east, west and south. END OF DESCRIPTION",

    "audioDescription": "(632 words) The Frederick Douglass House is located in the southeast quadrant of Washington, D.C. bordered by W Street SE to the north, 15th Street to the east, and 14th Street to the west. The house sits high atop a steep hill and the property encompasses the entire block. A black iron gate set atop a cement retaining wall surrounds the area. A visitor center is located at street level at the corner of W and 15th Streets. A parking lot to the north of the visitor center is accessible on W Street. Stairs to the right of the visitor center entrance lead up to a road that winds up to the house at the top of the hill. A red brick sidewalk lines the south side of W Street and stairs lead straight up to the house at the middle of the block. A road leads into the property from 14th Street at the intersection with W Street, passes by the front of the house at mid-level up the hill, and continues to rise as it winds around to the back of the house at the top of the hill. Two metal railings line the brick center stairs that rise from street level through a grass hill lawn on both sides to the front door of the house. The tan-painted, two-story home features a sweeping forty-foot long porch with four white round columns. The double-hung white front door is bracketed by two floor-to-ceiling windows on each side with dark gray shutters. Tall evergreen trees are set on both sides of the house and the view from atop the hill provides sweeping views of downtown Washington including the Capitol building. Immediately behind the house is a white, fifty-foot long, one-story cottage home with a red roof and porch on the west side, closest to the main house. Behind the house is an eighty-foot long stretch of grass lawn that leads back to a circular paved road loop with a tree in its center. The road from 14th Street winds up to this location. In the southeast corner of the grass lawn, about thirty feet east of the circle, is a small one-story stone building, twelve feet wide and nine feet deep with a chimney on its right side. The building is bracketed by trees and shrubs. About fifty feet north of the building, along the right side of a red brick walkway that leads to it, sits a two by three-foot wayside. Written in black letters in the upper left corner the sign is titled: Frederick Douglass's Rustic Retreat Text below describes Frederick Douglass's retreat cabin: Where do you go when you do not want to be disturbed? Frederick Douglass came to this tiny stone cabin that he called the Growlery. Coined by Charles Dickens, the word \"Growlery\" literally means a place to growl. Douglass kept his Growlery simply furnished with a desk, stool, and couch. He retreated here to do some of his deep thinking, reading, and writing in seclusion. The structure in front of you is a reconstruction. It was rebuilt in 1981 on the Growlery's exact location using materials salvaged from the original building. The full background of the sign is a black and white photograph of the building, showing a small one-story stone structure with brick chimney, no windows and a wooden door. A bush the height of the building grows alongside the left corner. Text below reads: The Growlery around 1893. An orchard once stood behind it. To the south of the circle set on a hill in front of a grass field is a partially constructed brick wall, about twenty feet across, five-feet-tall and the depth of two bricks. A smaller wall about ten feet long and two feet tall sits at the southwest corner of the circle. END OF DESCRIPTION",

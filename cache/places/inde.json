Defined by its lovely gazebo and geometric patterns, the 18th Century Garden recalls the formal landscape designs that were en vogue during colonial times.  Lady Bird Johnson, wife of President Lyndon B. Johnson, dedicated the 18th Century Garden to the Founding Fathers in 1966.<br />   <p>The 18th Century Garden is open daily from 9 a.m. to dusk, except on all major federal holidays. It is an outdoor area, but there are locking gates at the entrance. The main garden path is wheelchair accessible.</p> <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Eighteenth Century Garden. The garden lies along the street between two sets of row houses and extends back to a brick-paved alleyway that runs along the rear of the houses. The entrance is through eight-foot-tall iron gates set in a high brick wall that stretches along the right hand third of the garden's width. The rest of the width is enclosed by an iron rail fence set on top of a two-foot-tall brick wall. From the gate a wide brick walk goes all the way to the alley, where there is another gate. On the right, between the walk and the brick side wall of the garden is a row of small ornamental trees with an ivy ground cover. As you enter the gate, a smaller brick walk leads to the left, through another ivy-covered area with a row of closely planted trees that have been trimmed underneath to form a flat surface about head-height. Past the trees the path turns to gravel and enters a section with geometrical beds laid out in four quadrants. Each bed is edged with small trimmed shrubs and has different plantings in the middle. The four corners have small trees while the others have a variety of flowering plants. A small sign near the intersection of the two main walks reads, \"Eighteenth Century Garden. The re-created garden you see here incorporates many features of formal gardens in the 1700s. Neat pathways, geometric flowerbeds, small orchards, and gazebos are characteristic of early Philadelphia gardens. Volunteers from the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society plant and maintain this area.\" Behind the geometrical garden area is a square gazebo with open sides and a peaked roof. Running along behind it is a walk covered by an arbor with vines growing on it. Between the arbor and the back wall along the alley is a grassy lawn. Near the intersection of the walk under the arbor and the main walk is a small plaque that reads, \"Here in this lovely garden the chords of memory bind us close to the wise and good men who created our nation. Dedicated by Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson, June 10, 1966.\" End of Description.",

    "bodyText": "The Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution were both signed in this room. Later, the room became a shrine to the founding of the nation, proudly displaying the Liberty Bell and original paintings of the Founding Fathers. That was the scene when President-elect Abraham Lincoln visited the Assembly Room and praised the ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence. Following his assassination, Lincoln's body lay in repose here for two days. Visitors today can ponder their own role in the on-going experiment in self-government.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Second Continental Congress</strong><br /> The Pennsylvania legislature loaned the Assembly Room of the Pennsylvania State House out to the men of the Second Continental Congress in May 1775. Meeting just a month after shots had been fired at Lexington and Concord, the men prepared for war. They approved the nomination of George Washington as Commander in Chief of the newly created army, and they approved the resolution creating the Marine Corps. They also pursued peace, drafting the Olive Branch Petition. King George III never responded to that petition and talk began to grow of seeking independence. On July 2, 1776, the men voted to approve the resolution for independence. On July 4, 1776, they voted to approve their document, the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Independence was signed in this room on August 2, 1776.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Constitutional Convention</strong><br /> The Pennsylvania legislature loaned their room out again in May 1787 to the men of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/stories.htm\">Constitutional Convention</a>. The nation's first framework of government, the Articles of Confederation, had proven unsatisfactory. In a climate of great concern, delegates arrived in Philadelphia to address the inadequacies of the Articles. In four months, they created the U.S. Constitution, a feat George Washington called \"little short of a miracle\". The debates of the Constitutional or Federal Convention were heated at times, over issues like the power balance between large states and small states as well as the slave trade. During the debates, Pennsylvania delegate and elder statesman Benjamin Franklin looked at the chair where Washington was seated as the presiding officer. Carved into that chair is a sun. As the men signed the Constitution, Franklin said that he had the great happiness to know it was a rising and not a setting sun.<br /> <br /> <strong>Transition to Shrine</strong><br /> The state capital left Philadelphia in 1799, moving on to Lancaster and then Harrisburg. In 1818, the state sold this building to the city of Philadelphia. Philadelphians welcomed the war hero Marquis de Lafayette to the Assembly Room in 1824 during his triumphant return visit to America. The committee preparing for his visit first referred to the Assembly Room as \"the hall of Independence\". It would be decades before the entire building became known by that name. The room took on the appearance of a shrine with the 1854-55 redecoration. The Nativists rose to power at that time, a political party that used Revolutionary era rhetoric and symbols in their campaign to exclude immigrants from holding public office. President-elect Abraham Lincoln stepped into this shrine-like room in 1861 as he journeyed to Washington D.C. for his inauguration. Standing in the Assembly Room, he said that he would rather be \"assassinated on the spot\" than give up the ideals of the Declaration of Independence. After his assassination in the nation's capital in 1865, his body returned to the Assembly Room for two days. Upwards of 85,000 mourners passed by the casket.",

    "audioDescription": "Carpenters' Hall. This building is reached by way of a wide walkway that leads south from Chestnut Street to Carpenters' Hall. Brick pillars support an iron gate at the entrance from the street. A bronze plaque on the left pillar Identifies Carpenters' Hall as a National Historic Landmark. The walkway is paved with brick, except for a long strip down the middle which has cobbles edged with rectangular paving stones and a low stone curb. The area directly in front of the front of the building is paved with rectangular paving stones. The two-story brick building is symmetrical and shaped like a cross with short arms. Five wide stone steps go up to the main entrance with its double wooden doors, an arched fan light above them and a triangular pediment supported by half columns on either side. Bushes are planted on either side of the steps. A sign indicates the location of the accessible entrance around the left side to the rear door. An intercom is located to the right of that door. Please push the button at lower right on the intercom for admittance. The front entrance has a multipaned window with wooden shutters on either side. Above it along the second floor are three arched windows with a set of decorative newel posts below each one. Three flag poles extend out from below the middle window. As you stand in front, each side wing has a single window visible on each floor. Each of the side wings has a chimney extending above the shingled roof. Above the peak of the roof in front, an octagonal cupola is visible sitting in the center of the building. The cupola's dome is green and a weathervane sits at the very top. On the left side of the paving in front of the building is a small planting area with two graphic panels in front. A solid wooden fence painted white runs down each side of the building, which is surrounded by the brick paving. End of Description for Carpenters' Hall. Two waysides are described next. Carpenters' Hall Wayside 1 At the upper left of the left graphic panel is a quote from the By-laws of the Carpenters' Company which reads, \"for the purpose of obtaining instruction in the science of architecture and assisting such of their members as should by accident be in need of support, or the widows and minor children of members.\" Down the left side text reads, \"Carpenters' Hall, completed in 1774, was the meeting place of a group of Philadelphia master builders known as the Carpenters' Company. The Carpenters banded together to establish architectural standards, to set prices for work, and to aid members' families in times of need. \"A visitor to Philadelphia in the 1700s would have seen many buildings designed and constructed by members of the Carpenters' Company, including the Pennsylvania State House (Independence Hall), Old City Hall, The Pennsylvania Hospital, Benjamin Franklin's mansion, and their own Carpenters' Hall. \"The Carpenters aided the leaders of the American Revolution by offering them the use of Carpenters' Hall. It was here that the First Continental Congress gathered to air their grievances against Great Britain. \"Carpenters' Hall is a part of Independence National Historical Park, but is still owned and operated by the Carpenters' Company. Visitors are welcome during scheduled hours.\" To the right of the text is an image of the floor plan of Carpenters' Hall in 1786. It shows an outline of a building in the shape of a cross with each arm being 30 feet across and extending out 10 feet. The two arms each has a fireplace along its outer wall. The arm at the bottom shows a set of stairs outside leading up to an entrance in the middle and an inside set of stairs filling the right part. Below the floorplan is an excerpt from the Rules of the Carpenters' Company which reads, \"Drawing designs, making out bills of scantling, collecting materials, and sticking up stuff are to be charged by the Carpenter in proportion to the trouble. To take the dimensions of floors of joists in brick buildings add nine inches, and in stone twelve inches, more than the clear of the walls on the side the joists bear on.\" Down the right side of the panel are examples of architectural details from the 1786 Rule Book of the Carpenters' Company which gave prices for house-carpenters' work. At top is an arched dormer window, three panes across and four tall. The arch at the top has pointed arched panes. The window is bordered by two half columns supporting a triangular pediment over the top. The middle drawing is a fan sash over a door. The semicircle is filled with panes in a decorative scalloped design. The drawing at the bottom shows a wooden gate with a wide board across the bottom and a narrower board across the top. Between the boards are narrow railings that extend above the upper board and end in points. End of Description for Wayside 1 Wayside 2 First Continental Congress. At the upper left of the right graphic panel is a quote from Patrick Henry, Carpenters' Hall, 1774, which reads, \"The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, New Englanders are no more. I am not a Virginian but an American.\" Text on the left side of the panel reads, \"In 1774 the American colonies felt threatened. Their grievances against Great Britain were being ignored. Was it finally time for resistance, or was reconciliation still possible? \"The First Continental Congress met here in Carpenters' Hall in the autumn of 1774 to choose a course of action. Led by John and Sam Adams, and inspired by the fiery speeches of Patrick Henry, representatives of the Colonies united to defend American rights. They appealed to the King and to the British people to repeal unjust laws and taxes. They condemned the closing of the port of Boston, and pledged not to trade with Britain. \"Before adjourning, the Congress resolved that another congress be held the following May if their grievances were not redressed. By the time this Second Continental Congress convened, blood had already been shed at Lexington and Concord.\" On the right side of the panel is a color illustration of several men outside a brick building. In the left foreground are three men. The one in the middle has brown hair, the other two wear white wigs. Behind them and to the right are steps leading up to the entrance. One man is descending as another waits at the bottom, leaning on a walking stick. The caption reads, \"Artist's conception of Virginia delegate Patrick Henry (center) conferring with Massachusetts delegates John Adams and Samuel Adams outside Carpenters' Hall. In a letter to his wife Abigail, John Adams wrote, \"There is in Congress a collection of the greatest men upon this continent in point of abilities, virtues, and fortunes.\"\" End of Description for Wayside 2",

Christ Church is located at 2nd and American Streets.<br /> <br /> The birthplace of the American Episcopal Church, Christ Church is one of the most striking 18th century structures in America. George Washington attended services here, as did members of Benjamin Franklin's family. Constructed in 1744, the church features many elements of classic Georgian architecture, including a Palladian window. The steeple - added in 1754 and funded through the sale of lottery tickets printed in Benjamin Franklin's printing office - was easily recognizable from all of colonial Philadelphia. The congregation continues to hold services at this partner site.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Christ Church. This brick church stretches east to west with the entrance near the southwest corner. At the west end is a square tower holding a vestibule in front of the sanctuary and topped by a hexagonal belfry and a conical spire with a brass weathervane. Along the south side are three sets of double doors, one in the side of the tower, which is the entrance, and one on either end of the sanctuary. The main body of the church is lined with two rows of large multipaned windows with arched tops. The lower row has four windows between the doors and one at the far end. The upper row has seven windows that are slightly shorter than those on the lower level. Along the top of the side wall is a cream-colored balustrade between brick pillars with finials shaped like spinning tops. The peaked roof is made of green metal. The church is surrounded by a low brick wall topped with an iron rail fence. The street along the south side of the church is made of gray stones about the same size and shape as bricks. On the other side of the street to the south is a green park. From the park a flagstone path crosses the street and brick sidewalk leading to the iron gates facing the entrance doors in the tower. From the gate three marble steps go up to the brick sidewalk which stretches about 25 feet to the doors. End of Description.",

A graphic panel reads, \"Benjamin Franklin's Burial Place.\" A few feet down from the corner on the north side there is an opening in the brick wall filled by a fence section made of copper rails, some copper color, others weathered to bluish green. Two graves lie parallel to the fence topped with white marble slabs and surrounded by brick paving. Engraved on the slab closest to the fence are the words, \"Benjamin and Deborah Franklin, 1790.\" These slabs are sometimes adorned with pennies tossed by visitors. Other names are engraved on white marbles stones surrounding the two gravestones. Large metal plaques are placed on the pillars on either end of the fenced opening. The one on the left has an embossed profile of Franklin at the top. Feel free to touch. Below the profile raised text reads, \"The last resting place of Benjamin Franklin, 1706-1790.\" Below that are three quotes. The first from Washington reads, \"Venerated for benevolence, admired for talents, esteemed for patriotism, beloved for philanthropy.\" Below that a quote from Mirabeau reads, \"The sage whom two worlds claimed as their own.\" The quote at the bottom is from Turgot and reads, \"He tore from the skies the lightning and from tyrants the sceptre.\" The plaque on the right has a chronology of Benjamin Franklin from his birth at Boston, January 17, 1706, to his death at Philadelphia, April 17, 1790.On the left side of that pillar another plaque reads, \"Benjamin Franklin, signer of the Constitution of the United States.\" A small plaque on the fence itself reads, \"Christ Church Burial Ground, 1719.

In 1784, they elected George Washington as their first president general.<br /> <br /> After 1800, the social scene in Philadelphia shifted to newer hotels, theaters, and other gathering spots.

    "audioDescription": "Declaration House. This brick house sits on the corner of the street. Three stories high, it is a narrow rectangle with the long side facing Seventh Street. The paneled door is near the right end of this side with a single window between it and the end of the house. Left of the door there are three windows. The door has a triangular pediment over it, projecting out slightly from the wall. The windows on the first two floors are multipaned with wood paneled shutters. The third-floor windows are smaller with no shutters. All the windows have a stone lintel above them with a keystone accent. Above the third floor, two more of the smaller-size windows are in the gable of the peaked roof. Under each first-floor window there is a small angled cellar access panel. Entrance is not through the main door, but through a door to the left on the back end of the house. This end of the house is only two windows deep with a dormer window sitting on the roof above. Here, there is a courtyard garden paved with brick with plantings around the perimeter. Along the street the courtyard is enclosed by a low brick wall with an iron rail fence on top. The entry to the house is through an iron gate along this low brick wall. On the concrete wall across the courtyard from the gate raised lettering reads, \"On this site stood the house where Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence.\" The right end of the house, facing Market Street, is similar -- two windows deep, but with no door. Two larger cellar access panels are below the first-floor windows on this side. To the right is a small triangular garden enclosed by an iron rail fence. On the right side of the garden large panels on a concrete wall display the well-known opening of the Declaration of Independence which reads, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. July 4, 1776.\" End of Description.",

Franklin's wife Deborah oversaw the construction of the house while Benjamin was in London. Daughter Sarah (Sally) Franklin Bache and her husband Richard raised their eight children in this house during Benjamin's mission to France. Franklin's grandchildren demolished the house in 1812 to allow for commercial development. Only the foundations of the large and elegant house remain, outlined at present by a modern steel \"ghost\" structure. The courtyard is now home to the Benjamin Franklin Museum, the Franklin Court Printing Office, the \"Fragments of Franklin Court\" exhibit and the B. Free Franklin Post Office.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Franklin Court Printing Office. The Printing Office is located at the far west end of the building at the north end of Franklin Court. A wing extends out from the building to separate it from the paved area in front of the adjoining site, Fragments of Franklin Court. A low wooden platform forms a small porch in front of the door, which is located on the right side of the narrow building. Along the left side of the porch is a wooden bench. Along the right side is a solid wooden fence. A sign above the door reads, \"Printing Office and Bindery.\" This door is used as an exit from the Printing Office. The brick pavement in front here is very uneven and can be a tripping hazard. There is a stone circle in the paving just to the left of the porch which reads, \"Benjamin Franklin Bache Privy Pit, 1787, 322 Market Street.\" To the left of the door are two multipaned windows with wooden shutters. In front of the windows a stair descends to a cellar entrance below the main door. A wood rail fence with a gate at the left end encloses the stairwell. Entrance to the Print Office is through a door in the wing to the right of the wooden fence. That door is at the left end of the wing and has a curved fanlight above the wood paneled door. In front of that door is another stone circle. This one reads, \"Henry Frogley, Water Well, circa 1702, 320 Market Street.\" To the left of the entrance along the wall beside the wooden fence is a cellar access with two wooden doors at an angle against the base of the wall. To the right of the entrance is another door. The courtyard in front of the building is paved with brick surrounding a rectangular planting area. To the left of the building is an outer brick wall enclosing Franklin Court. Several benches line the wall. End of Description.",

    "audioDescription": "Independence Hall. This plain rectangular building sits in the middle of the block on the south side of Chestnut Street. Of modest size compared to the modern skyscrapers behind it, it extends about one-quarter the length of the block and has two stories. Centered on the south side, away from the street is a large square bell tower, almost a third the width of the entire building. Topped by a cupola and spire, it is taller than the building is long. The north façade along the street has a simple entrance in the center of the building, with tall narrow double doors made of paneled wood and reached by five wraparound steps with no handrails to a small porch. At the door there is one more step up into the building. The façade features rectangular multipaned windows, four on either side of the entrance and nine across the upper floor. Each has a stone keystone accent above it. Another stone accent made of a horizontal rectangle is placed between each upper window and the window or door below it. A column of stone blocks also forms the corners of the building. A set of four tall chimneys sits at either end of the peaked roof with a white balustrade, a row of small columns topped by a rail. From this side the top of the bell tower can be seen. A clock face sits on each side of the upper square tower, which is capped by an octagonal cupola, a narrow steeple, and a brass weathervane. Extending out to each side of the building is a brick arcade with arched openings that connects to the East and West Wings. Between the door and the street is a statue of George Washington on a square stone pillar. He stands with his right hand resting on a book on a small table and his left hand on the hilt of a sword. The tour entrance for the building is on the south side, which faces Independence Square, an open park. The area surrounding Independence Hall is secure and is entered through a security checkpoint next to Old City Hall, to your left as you face the building from Chestnut Street. The south façade is dominated by the square bell tower (the top of which is also seen from the north side) which is attached to the central third of the main structure. The paneled wooden door has attached columns on either side supporting a carved lintel across the top with a small roof. There are three steps up to the door with a long ramp leading up on the right side. The open area in front of this side is covered with rectangular pavers. Above the door is a large three-part window with an arched window in the middle with a stone arch above it flanked by two tall narrow windows with straight lintels and roofs above them. The tower narrows above the roofline of the main structure with a circular window on the lower level. The level above has a bow window with a carved face in the keystone accent above it. The next level up is smaller and made of wood with a clockface on each side. The whole structure is then topped by an octagonal cupola, a narrow steeple, and a brass weathervane.

    "bodyText": "<p>Established in 1948, Independence National Historical Park covers more than 51 acres in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and beyond. As an administrative unit of the National Park Service, Independence National Historic Park also manages and operates three other legislated national park units in and around the city of Philadelphia. The site includes Independence National Historical Park, Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site, Gloria Dei Church National Historic Site, and Thaddeus Kosciusko National Memorial.<br /> <br /> Established in 1948, Independence National Historical Park was created to protect the historic places associated with the birth of the American republic, standing as icons of freedom and democratic ideals for people around the world. The park spans more than 51 acres within the City of Philadelphia, preserving and interpreting a rich collection of the United States of America’s Colonial, Revolutionary, and Federal period heritage. The park’s designers were strongly influenced by the City Beautiful Movement as well as the trend toward colonial revival in design introduced at Williamsburg, Virginia. While the urban renewal movement in Philadelphia was underway, the National Park Service was working collaboratively with local preservationists and stakeholders in developing Independence National Historical Park. Pioneering historic structure restoration in the 1950s and 1960s, with architects, engineers, archeologists, curators, and historians working on Independence Hall as well as other park structures, landscapes, and collections, led to development of a modern methodology and rigorous standards for restoration and reconstruction that are still a model for the National Park Service and private sector professionals. Most of the park’s historic structures are located in the vicinity of the four landscaped blocks between Philadelphia’s Chestnut, Walnut, 2nd, and 6th Streets. Here, along these streets, amid these venerable houses and public buildings, colonists began their quest for freedom and independence. Here too, the United States of America was born and its ideals enacted in the Constitution.<br /> <br /> The centerpiece of the park is Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution were debated and adopted in the late 18th century. Independence Hall and nearby Congress Hall were the principal meetinghouses of the Second Continental Congress from 1775 to 1783 and the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. In Independence Square, the Declaration of Independence was read publicly for the first time on July 8, 1776. The legacy of the nation’s founding documents—universal principles of freedom and democracy—has influenced lawmakers around the world and distinguished Independence Hall as a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site.<br /> <br /> Across the street from Independence Square, the Liberty Bell, an iconic symbol of independence and an international symbol of freedom, is displayed in the Liberty Bell Center. Hung in the State House in 1753, it summoned the Pennsylvania Assembly to work. In the 1830s anti-slavery groups named it the Liberty Bell. The bell cracked sometime around 1846, but its message still rings out. Surrounding the Liberty Bell Center is the park’s Independence Mall, one of Philadelphia’s great outdoor public spaces, which runs between 5th and 6th Streets, from Chestnut Street to Race Street.<br /> <br /> Independence National Historical Park is much more than Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. The park preserves and interprets many of our country’s most important resources associated with the establishment of the government of the United States of America. Carpenters’ Hall is the site of the First Continental Congress held in September 1774. The Supreme Court of the United States first met at Philadelphia’s Old City Hall. The site of the President’s House, where George Washington and John Adams and their households lived and worked during their terms as the first and second presidents of the United States, prior to Adams’ move to the White House in 1800, is interpreted by the park, especially in the paradox of the Washingtons bringing their enslaved people to work and live there. Franklin Court preserves the site of Benjamin Franklin’s house and businesses, providing a window into the life and times of this founding father. Washington Square, one of William Penn’s five original squares, is home to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the American Revolution.<br /> <br /> The park also protects the First and Second Bank buildings of the United States; the Merchants Exchange Building; and the faithfully reconstructed social, cultural, and political center of Philadelphia during the park’s period of significance, the City Tavern. These are just a few of the many historic buildings and landscapes managed and protected by Independence National Historical Park.<br /> <br /> With so many important places under its care, Independence National Historical Park works collaboratively with many partners and stakeholders in the stewardship of our national heritage. The park works closely with the city of Philadelphia and the state of Pennsylvania, and with the Independence Visitor Center Corporation jointly managing the Independence Visitor Center located on 6th and Market Streets. Some of the historic buildings in the park are still owned by private organizations such as the American Philosophical Society and the Carpenters’ Company of the City and County of Philadelphia, so the park must work closely with these groups on the protection and interpretation of these properties. The park is also involved with numerous houses of worship and congregations, whose churches and cemeteries are an integral part of the historic significance of the park. Congress created the National Constitution Center as a private nonprofit organization in the park, located in a federally owned building on the mall, to be a nonpartisan interpreter of the history of the Constitution and its current relevance. There are numerous civic organizations, nonprofit groups, corporations, and countless stakeholders locally, nationally, and internationally that the park engages with on a regular basis. The diverse interests and passion of the park’s many partners and stakeholders reflect the importance of buildings and resources protected by Independence National Historical Park.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "The Liberty Bell Center. This long narrow modern building stretches along North Sixth Street just to the south of the President's House Site. The side opposite the street is filled with a green mall or park crisscrossed by brick sidewalks. The side of the building is mostly glass, tall narrow panes framed in aluminum with thick brick pillars spaced at intervals down the wall. Steel beams sitting on top of the brick support an open metal grid roof extending out from the side of the building. Above the grid work is a stretch of windows just under the low peaked roof of the main structure. The entrance is at the north end of the building. The line to enter stretches along the sidewalk on the east side. At the south end is a two-story rectangular wing. On the east side of that wing, is a small alcove where there is a push button panel that provides recorded information on the history of the Liberty Bell. As you enter the building, you first pass through a security check point. Then the long room stretches out in front of you. The flooring is brick and slopes up slightly. The right wall is gray stone and follows a serpentine, curving out into the room then back to the right several times. Down the left side of the room is a series of large graphic panels, artifacts in cases, and a video that shows on a loop. Natural lighting is provided by the glass wall on the left. The Liberty Bell itself is at the far end of the building. The flooring changes at that point to flat stone paving. The bell is mounted in the center of a chamber surrounded by a knee-high metal and leather strap barrier. Past the bell, the back wall is floor-to-ceiling glass with a view of independence Hall.

    "audioDescription": "Library of the American Philosophical Society. This is a two-story brick building. The central entrance has double wood paneled doors with an ornate arched fanlight above and fluted columns attached to the wall on either side. A sign on the door indicates that that entrance to the library is to the right, around on the side of the building. Above the doorway is an arched niche with a statue of Benjamin Franklin. Carved text on a stone below the statue reads, \" B. Franklin. Repllica of the statue by Lazzarini. Presented to the Library Company 1792 by William Bingham.\" The doorway is above street level and is reached by curved stone steps with iron railings that sweep up on each side. Near the corners of the building on either side of the steps is a carved stone plaque. The one on the left reads, \"This building authorized by an act of Congress of 1952 is on the site occupied from 1789 to 1884 by the Hall of the Library Company of Philadelphia whose façade it reproduces. Cornerstone laid April 25, 1958.\" The plaque on the other corner reads, \"Library of the American Philosophical Society held at Philadelphia for promoting useful knowledge. Begun by Benjamin Franklin 1743. Reorganized under its present name 1769.\" The central portion of the façade is decorated with four square pilasters, attached pillars that project slightly from the wall. They support the triangular pediment at roof level which has an arched window in the middle. The door sits between the middle two pilasters. Between the outer two pilasters there is a large multipaned window on both floors. The first floor windows are arched. At either end of the building, outside the pilasters there is another set of windows top and bottom, all of these being rectangular with a single stone keystone above. Across the roof line is a balustrade made of carved columns with a horizontal rail on top. The entrance to the library is not through the door on the front facade, but on the right side in the middle of the building. The street along the right side is small and made of cobbles, large stones in the middle with smaller stones on either side. From this side the building is seen to be in the shape of an \"H\" with the center section slightly recessed from the front and rear wings. The side door has a wide set of steps up to the small covered portico supported by smooth columns with carved scrollwork at the tops. End of Description.",

    "audioDescription": "Magnolia Garden. This garden is enclosed along the street by a tall iron rail fence and by brick walls on the other sides. The entrance is through an iron gate near the left end. Through the gate the brick paving ends at a set of three stone steps which go up to a wide flagstone walk. The garden is rectangular, stretching off to the right. Four paved walks border a grassy rectangle in the center. At the right end of the lawn, the paved area opens up to surround a circular pool with a stone curb around it and a fountain in the middle. Outside the paved walks the garden is edged with plantings of small trees and ornamental shrubs with annuals planted as accents. Iron benches painted white are placed along the walks and near the pool. There is another fountain opposite the entrance at the end of the walk. It consists of a brick arch framing a stone insert set into the wall. Text carved on the stone reads, \"Magnolia Tribute Garden contributed by The Garden Club of America in honor of the Founders of our nation, 1959. National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior.\" Below the text is a small marble bowl fed by water through a hole in the stone. The water then overflows and falls into a square basin below. As you enter the garden a small sign to the right reads, \"Magnolia Garden. George Washington, who lived in Philadelphia during his Presidency, retained a lively interest in horticulture. His letters reveal that magnolias were among the trees he hoped to grow. Although the magnolias in this garden are a different variety from that mentioned by Washington, he would have enjoyed their delicate pink flowers each spring. The Garden Clubs of America furnished funds form this garden which is now maintained by the National Park Service.\" End of Description.",

    "audioDescription": "Merchants' Exchange Building. This three-story building is made of light gray stone. The first floor is slightly recessed with the upper stories supported around the perimeter by plain round columns interspersed with rectangular pillars. The first floor entrance is recessed even deeper with curved windows on either side of the glass doors. The second and third floors are also recessed across the middle half of the building with the roof there supported by fluted columns with ornately carved tops. A triangular pediment sits on top of this section. Multipaned windows of varying widths line all three floors, with those on the third floor being slightly shorter. The back wall of the building projects outward in a semicircle. Similar to the front façade, the second and third floors are recessed forming a wrap-around portico with more of the fluted columns supporting the roof. The first floor has tall narrow sets of double doors evenly spaced around the curve. The top two-thirds of the doors are filled with multi-paned windows. On either side of the semi-circular section is a set of stairs that go up to doors on the second floor. At the top of the stairs, on the side away from the building, is a large statue of a lion. The lion on one side has its head alert. The other one droops its head in rest. A round tower or cupola sits on the roof near the back of the building, with more multipaned windows circling it between ornate columns. It is topped by a small green dome and a weathervane.

Above that carved letters on a stone ledge reads, \"Museum of the American Revolution.\" An American flag hangs from an opening in the wall above the ledge. On the wing on the other side of the plaza, to the right of the smaller entrance is a stone inset with a quote from the Declaration of independence, July 4, 1776, which reads, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

On the wall of that structure metal lettering displays the preamble to the Constitution, \" We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\" The middle front of the building is glass, split by a balcony extending out over the glass entrance doors, which are set well back from the benches that sit at the edge of the lawn. On the left side of the building a wing with an angled side extends out along the brick sidewalk, reaching a point at the street corner. The triangular area between the wing and the sidewalk is terraced with sitting areas and plantings. End of Description.",

Four wide marble steps go up to the doors with one more step up into the building. There are iron shoe scrapers on either side of the broad top step. A small bronze plaque to the left of the doors reads \"Old City Hall. U.S. Supreme Court met here, 1791 - 1800.\" An accessible entrance is located on the right side of the building. Those doors, also with an arched fanlight above them, are three steps up on the left and front, but have a ramp leading up on the right. On either side of the front doors are two large multipaned windows with arched tops and a stone keystone accent at the top. Above on the second floor there are five rectangular windows across the front, each also with a stone keystone accent. This window pattern continues around the building, with each side having five windows. In front a modest triangular pediment sits over the middle three windows with a small arched window in its middle. Three tall chimneys sit on each side of the roof. An open-sided octagonal cupola topped by a brass weathervane is in the middle of the roof. End of Description.",

It was placed there in 1785. This symbol replaces an earlier one--the Coat of Arms of King George III of Great Britain. On July 8, 1776, members of the Pennsylvani Associators removed the symbol of the King from the wall and later destroyed it.",

    "audioDescription": "The President's House Site. This area sits on the corner of the street directly across Market Street from the Independence Visitor Center. The site is covered with paving stones in various shapes and sizes. The house no longer exists, but partial brick walls without a roof have been erected to show the basic outline of the house. In front, facing the street, is the entrance outlined by two white columns topped with a peaked lintel. Two white and gray marble steps go up to the doorway with plain black metal railings on either side. To the left of the door a tall window is outlined in white. Two similar windows sit on the wall to the right of the door. Inside, to the left as you enter, the partial wall is lined with graphic panels. Along the right hand wall are white and gray marble fireplaces with wide brick chimneys. Mounted above each fireplace is a large video monitor. In the middle of the space is a short, T-shaped wall with a flat top which can be used for seating. In the back right corner is a five-sided alcove that represents what would have been a bay with windows on three sides. To the left of that is a room-sized glass enclosure which covers the remains of the foundation and walls now several feet below the current street level. Along the back left wall is another fireplace with another video monitor above it. Outside the reconstructed walls to the left of the glass enclosure and continuing back towards the south, white marble outlines show where more rooms and outbuildings used to stand. Past the glass enclosure is a gray granite wall engraved with the names of the nine enslaved men and women brought to Philadelphia by George Washington. The names on the wall are Austin, Paris, Hercules, Christopher Sheels, Richmond, Giles, Oney Judge, Moll and Joe. To the left of the engraved names is another video monitor. Embedded in the sidewalk on the other side of the wall is a set of woman's footprints headed north. Past the gray wall is another set of fireplaces, set side by side, these made of plain brick.

The Rose Garden is wheelchair accessible.",
    "audioDescription": "Rose Garden. This garden is bounded on its north side along Walnut Street by a low brick wall topped by an iron rail fence. Near the right end is an iron gate between two tall brick pillars. From here the park extends all the way through the center of the block to Locust Street on the south, where there is a similar wall and gate. From the gate a ten-foot-wide brick path leads south with a grassy lawn on the left and a tree-planted border along a brick wall on the right. Some of the trees are gingkoes and, depending on the season, there may be golf-ball-size fruit under foot. As you enter the gate, a small sign on the left reads, \"Rose Garden. Thomas Jefferson wrote that of all the countries in the world, America was where \"the noblest gardens may be made without expense.\" To commemorate the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, the Daughters of the American Revolution have donated funds to plant the rose beds just ahead. The National Park Service maintains the Rose Garden and adjacent grounds.\" About halfway down the length of the block the path enters the garden proper by going up a set of five steps. Just to the left at that point is a broad section of cobblestone stretching off to the left. A small sign reads, \"Original Cobblestone. In front of you lies a remnant of a cobblestone street (also called \"pebblestone\") constructed about 1800. Although William Penn, founder of Philadelphia, carefully planned the placement of city streets as early as 1681, it was not until 1762 that the city assumed responsibility for paving.\" Once up the steps and past another small area of lawn, the brick paving opens out into a wider area with beds of roses planted to the left and at either end. A smaller walk winds through the rose bed on the left and passes a square pillar which at one point had a sun dial on it. Two areas paved with flagstone open off the brick walk in the central art of the garden. The one to the right is sunken, down three steps, with benches along the south side near another rose bed. The paved area on the left is raised three steps and also has benches around its perimeter. The brick paving winds to the left between those two areas and continues south past more lawn to the entrance on Locust Street. End of Description.",

    "bodyText": "The most recognizable part of Independence Hall today is its 168 foot (and 7 1/4\") tall bell tower and steeple. Designed by William Strickland in 1828, this steeple replaced an earlier steeple that was demolished in 1781.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Original Tower and Steeple (1750-1871)</strong><br /> As originally designed and built, Independence Hall had no tower or steeple. The first steeple was constructed between 1750-1753 under the supervision of chief carpenter and builder Edmund Woolley. Woolley may have consulted architectural pattern books like <em>The Architecture of A. Palladio</em> and James Gibbs' <em>Book of Architecture Containing Designs of Buildings and Ornaments </em>for design inspiration. <br /> <br /> This original steeple - described as 120 feet - housed the Pass and Stow bell (now known as the Liberty Bell) but no clocks. By 1774, the steeple had fallen into disrepair and in 1781, it was demolished.<br /> <br /> <strong>Strickland Steeple (1828-present)</strong><br /> In 1828, architect William Strickland designed a new steeple. Although not an exact reproduction of the original one, Strickland's design evoked the original 18th century design.<br /> <br /> Strickland's steeple differed in that it incorporated a clock with faces on four sides. To accommodate the weights for the Isaiah Lukens clockworks inside, the steeple rose to greater heights than the earlier 1750s tower. The Strickland steeple originally housed the Wilbank bell and Lukens clock. Both were replaced in 1876. Read more about the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/bells-and-clocks.htm\">bells and clocks of Independence Hall.</a>  In 1926, an electric winder was added to the Seth Thomas clock. Before that, the clocks were wound by hand.<br /> <br /> The 1828 weathervane still sits atop the steeple today.<br /> <br /> <strong>See </strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/places-independencehall-architecture-changeovertime.htm\">images</a><strong> and learn more about the architectural changes over time.  </strong><strong>Check out these </strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/tower-faqs.htm\">FAQs</a><strong> about the Independence Hall steeple. </strong>",

    "bodyText": "<p>As chairman of the Vigilance Committee of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society and an operative of the Underground Railroad, William Still (1821-1902) helped to shepherd hundreds of enslaved people through Philadelphia as they made their quest for freedom.</p> <p>Assisting nearly 1,000 freedom seekers from slavery, Still took note of everyone that crossed his path. He carefully recorded their names, age, gender, as well as family members left behind. He also detailed their lives in slavery, including their enslaver’s name, their treatment while enslaved, and their reason for running. At times, he kept his journal hidden in a nearby cemetery out of fear of being caught and charged for violating the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.</p> <p>Still lived in many locations throughout Philadelphia while living here. (1844-1902). For example, from 1850-1855 he lived on Ronaldson Court (today 625 South Delhi Street), where he met and assisted freedom seekers and their allies—including Harriet Tubman.</p> <p>This marker highlights the location of where Still lived when he published the stories that he had carefully collected and preserved. Still saw firsthand that “all over this wide and extended country thousands of mothers and children, separated by Slavery, were…living without the slightest knowledge of each other’s whereabouts, praying and weeping without ceasing…” Still knew that these collected stories could help to reunite those mercilessly separated by slavery.</p> <p>Still published <i>The Underground Railroad, A Record of Facts, Authentic Narratives, Letters, &C, </i>in 1872. The book’s 780 pages listed the names and traumatic experiences of 846 freedom seekers. Still included the accounts of famous and daring escapes by people such as Henry “Box” Brown, William and Ellen Craft, and several accounts of the most famous Underground Railroad conductor, Harriet Tubman.</p> <p>The number of broken families reunited because of the publication of Still’s accounts remains unknown. The book, however, serves as Still’s legacy and more importantly a definitive record of the secret operations of the Underground Railroad.</p> <p><i>Please note that 244 S. 12<sup>th</sup> Street and 625 S. Delhi Street are privately owned.

    "audioDescription": "The Pennsylvania Historic Marker highlighting the residence of William Still at 244 S. 12th Street sits between two buildings in the middle of a row. To the right of marker, the site of Still’s home, is a wide two-story modern stone and concrete flat-roofed building. The first floor consists of a set of double metal doors on the left end of the building with a stretch of five small rectangular windows that sit high above the sidewalk, just to the right of the metal doors. Directly above the metal doors, on the second floor is a steel and wooden balcony. A single plain metal and glass door opens on to the balcony. To the right of the balcony is another stretch of five rectangular windows that are larger than the first-floor windows. This stretch of windows butts up against a very large window that wraps around the corner of the second floor. The roof line above the wrap-around window is raised a few feet higher. To the left of the marker, are a set of 19th-century three-story brick twin houses that one might think look much like the original William Still house. The brick houses are identical to each other, each with a single dormer window on the roof. Each house has two blue shuttered windows on the third and second floors that stretch across the front of the homes. The windows on the third floor are smaller than the windows on the second floor. The blue shuttered windows on the first floor are pushed together to make room for the entry doors. The wood-paneled doors sit side by side in between the two sets of windows. The doors are both painted green, and each have an arch fan light above them. Four marble steps lead up to each door. Both sets of steps have a single iron railing on the left and right sides. On either side of the steps, under each of the first-floor windows, are small basement windows, each covered with protective iron bars. The exterior of the basement level of the house is clad in white marble. The Pennsylvania historic marker is cast in iron and painted blue and sits on top of a blue 10-foot pole. Each side of the marker has identical lettering, painted yellow, and reads, “William Still 1821-1902. While living here, he was an Underground Railroad agent who helped slaves escape and kept records so relatives could find them later. A wealthy coal merchant, Still also helped found the first Black YMCA.” Underneath the inscription are the words, “Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, 1991.” The seal of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is stamped on top of the marker.",

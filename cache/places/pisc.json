    "bodyText": "<p>The Accokeek Creek archeological site (18PR8) is located in Southern Maryland along the banks of the Potomac River. This archeological site is among the most significant sites in the nation because of the impact its excavation had on our modern understanding of Native American societies in the Eastern Middle Atlantic.</p> <p>The site is located within the boundaries of Piscataway Park, which is administered by National Capital Parks-East of the National Park Service. Situated approximately 25 miles downriver from Washington D.C., along Piscataway Creek, the Accokeek Creek site was home to the Potomac Valley’s indigenous inhabitants for thousands of years–dating as far back as 6,000 years ago and through the 1500s. Among the occupants were the Piscataway Indians of Southern Maryland whose ancestors still live nearby today.<br /> <br /> The Accokeek Creek site was excavated in the 1930’s by Alice and Henry Ferguson who purchased land for their home in present-day Piscataway Park in the 1920’s. After excavating tens of thousands of artifacts, the Ferguson’s came to believe that they had rediscovered the site of “Moyaone,” the principal town of the Piscataway chiefdom visited by Captain John Smith in 1608. While the accuracy of the Fergusons’ claim is still disputed today, the excavations yielded a large collection of diagnostic artifacts that have helped form archeologist’s understanding of Native American history and culture in the region.<br /> <br /> Based on analysis of stone projectile points found at the site, archeologists have determined that humans have intermittently called Accokeek Creek home for nearly 6,000 years. The site also contains four ossuaries that appear to have been in use between the 1300’s and European contact in the 1600s. The individuals buried in the ossuaries were interred with elaborate grave goods including copper adornments, shell beads, and clay pipes. These finds indicate that the area was occupied by politically complex chiefdoms by the 1500’s and was the home of the Piscataway chiefdom. The Accokeek Creek excavations indicate that potentially dozens of buildings stood at the site. These structures were enclosed by a series of protective palisades at the edge of the town, indicating that Accokeek Creek’s inhabitants were, at times, living in a violent world.<br /> <br /> Archeologists believe that the predecessors of the Piscataway and other related peoples came to the Chesapeake Bay from the Appalachian Mountains sometime in the 1300’s bringing with them their Algonquian language and material culture. Based on ethnohistoric documents some archeologists and historians believe that the Piscataway group migrated instead from the area that became Maryland’s Eastern Shore in the 1300’s. Whatever the case, archeologists agree that the arrival of the Piscataway and other related people resulted in the creation of complex cultural traditions in the Potomac Valley.<br /> <br /> In 1608, Captain John Smith visited Piscataway Creek on his voyage up the Potomac River and its tributaries. Smith’s 1612 map of the Chesapeake includes the town of “Moyaons” placed in the approximate location of Accokeek Creek. Map symbols indicate that the settlement was home to a werowance, a powerful Native American chieftain who controlled other groups within a geographical area. In 1634, a group of English colonists sailed up the Potomac and met with the leaders of the Piscataway nation at Moyaone. Their leader, Wannas, informed the colonists that the lands of Piscataway Creek were theirs and English settlement could not occur in the vicinity. It is unknown if the archeological site of Accokeek Creek represents this 17th century village or an earlier settlement that the Piscataway nation relocated from. What is known however, is that the territory was a fundamentally important landscape for the Piscataway people from the time of European contact to the present day.<br /> <br /> By the 1690’s, Piscataway land in Prince George’s and Charles Counties had been confiscated by the English colonists and occupied by Maryland planters. Eventually, the Piscataway nation decided to move beyond the borders of the Maryland Colony and dispersed north and west. While many Piscataway migrated outside of Maryland, others decided to stay, forming the ancestors of the current Piscataway inhabitants of the state. The diagnostic artifacts and archeological features present at the Accokeek Creek site have been used to develop and refine a cultural-history of the Mid-Atlantic region. Since its rediscovery in the 1930’s, Accokeek Creek has been one of the most important sites in the nation for understanding the Native American societies of the East Coast.<span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"> </span></span></span></p> <h3>Sources:</h3> <p><br /> Colonial Encounters<br /> 2014. Accokeek Creek (18PR8), <a href=\"http://colonialencounters.org/SiteSummaries/AccokeekCreekSummary.aspx\">http://colonialencounters.org/SiteSummaries/AccokeekCreekSummary.aspx</a><br /> <br /> Colonial Encounters<br /> 2014. Susquehannock Fort (18PR8),<br /> <a href=\"http://colonialencounters.org/SiteSummaries/SusquehannockFortSummary.aspx\">http://colonialencounters.org/SiteSummaries/SusquehannockFortSummary.aspx</a><br /> <br /> Curry, Dennis C.<br /> 1999. Feast of the Dead: Aboriginal Ossuaries in Maryland, Archaeological Society of Maryland and Maryland Historical Trust Press, Crownsville, MD.<br /> <br /> King et al.,<br /> 2019.

    "audioDescription": "Standing at the trailhead for Accokeek Creek, a wooden boardwalk extends before you before gently curving left and being lost in the foliage. An observation deck ringed with benches overlooks the view to your right, where marsh grass grows in the creek’s delta. When the tide is out, there may be some of the turtles, snakes, and other critters who call the marsh home. To your left the, Accokeek Creek spills into the Potomac river. The park is a popular spot for birders, and on your walk you may find yourself sharing the marsh with ospreys, herons, and falcons as well as the smaller songbirds flitting in the branches. Across the river is the Virginia shore where cars zip along the George Washington Memorial Parkway – another national park site. George Washington’s Mount Vernon estate stands on the opposite shoreline.",

    "bodyText": "The ruins of the Marshall Hall Mansion represent the largest house built in pre-1740 Maryland and one of only two surviving examples of 18th century one and a half story buildings. The property functioned as a steamboat landing for much of its history and from 1958 through 1980 housed an amusement park, complete with Ferris wheel, roller coasters, bumper cars, and slot machines. Today the ruins are surrounded by a 110 x 115 foot chain link fence after a fire in 1981 and a truck crash in 2003 destroyed much of the structure. ",
    "audioDescription": "After bearing right off of Route 227 you’ll continue along a roughly paved, tree lined drive for approximately a quarter of a mile before arriving at the turnaround loop that passes by the Marshall Hall ruins. Three trees grow in the grass center of the loop, and more trees dot the grassy lawns that surround the road. To the west is a short white brick building, approximately 25 by 15 feet, with a black roof and a chimney. To the north are the ruins of a red brick house. Two walls, approximately 60 feet long, with five rectangular windows face the road. They are capped on either end by shorter walls, approximately 30 feet long, and bisected by a third. Each of the short walls has a chimney in the center. The house is one and a half stories tall with no roof. The ruins are enclosed by a 100 x 115 foot chain link fence that is covered in vines and bushes. To the right of the road is an open field with picnic benches and a cemetery.",

    "audioDescription": "Mockley Point juts out into the Potomac to form the mouth of Piscataway Creek. The shore is lined with medium sized broken rocks that protect against the erosion of the Point’s sandy beaches, which are visible at low tide. There are often small rocks and driftwood dotting the beaches. A thin line of trees grows between the beaches along the Potomac and the marshes further inland. Fort Washington is situated across the mouth of Piscataway Creek and may be visible, depending on the day and season. Just over six miles to the north is the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. Across the Potomac is the George Washington Memorial Parkway nestled along the wooded shoreline of Virginia.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Believed to have been originally built in the last quarter of the 18th century, the Laurel Branch house was a simple one-story two-room dwelling of modest dimensions and appearance. Deeper than wide, room behind room, and exterior chimneys at one end the house was typical of an architectural style popular in lower Southern Maryland from the second half of the 18th century well into the first half of the 19th century. Homes of this style and construction were often owned by tradespeople or small landowners of modest means. As typical as this house is it is also in many ways atypical.</p> <p><br /> What makes this home more interesting is the way it was constructed. Much of it is far less “sophisticated” than one might think. Its sills and joists were laid without any support and riven clapboard of less than ideal dimensions were used in the construction of the roof and attic partitions. There is evidence that the ceiling rafters and joists were made from improperly dried wood and warped shortly after construction. No doubt other homes were built using these shortcuts, and no wonder only one, Laurel Branch, survived.<br /> If there is one aspect of the house that is the most interesting and helps us date it more precisely it is the two small, cater-cornered fireplaces. Laurel Branch is the only example of this room behind room plan with such fireplaces recorded in Charles County or as far as is known, in all of Southern Maryland. This design of corner fireplaces was common in the area between 1740 and 1770 and given all the other data the house is generally agreed to have been built circa 1770.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The tobacco barn which now stands at the National Colonial Farm is arguably one of the most significant known remaining pieces of agriculturally related 18th-century architecture in eastern North America. This tobacco barn was originally the property of William Hall of southern Anne Arundel County. He had two such barns, and they were the largest and most important structures on his property. Built well, these barns survived all manner of weather, but one of the barns, at last, was endangered by development plans. Efforts by the National Park Service and the Accokeek Foundation secured the relocation of this tobacco barn to the National Colonial Farm. The barn features fascinating construction techniques and was carefully reconstructed to preserve early agricultural messages. The original designers had made use of pieces from earlier barns. The basic construction technique is known as “Tidewater framing” and consists of plates, rafters and corner braces connected by pinned mortise and tenon joints. Hand adzed oak, walnut and chestnut timbers predominate. The roof is steeply pitched at about 54 degrees, and the eves rest on a false plate (where the soffit would normally fit) allowing for increased ventilation.</p> <p> </p> <p>The frame was covered with clapboard siding in approximately 4-foot lengths. The open spaces, where clapboards have been left off, serve to increase ventilation as well.  All siding and roofing were secured with completely hand-forged nails made in the 18th century. The tobacco barn is capable of housing 12,000-18,000 lbs of tobacco. At a time when most people have lost connection to land and agricultural roots, visitors are invited to enter the tobacco house, stand under the curing leaf and weathered beams and experience the rhythms of our agricultural past that continue to inform the present day.  </p>",

    "audioDescription": "The wooden fishing pier is approximately 250 feet long. The pier is constructed to meet Americans with Disabilities Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG). When entering the pier, there is a staircase on the left to access the shoreline. The end of the pier turns to the left where there is a floating dock. The floating dock and kayak launch are attached to the pier by a 4-foot by 28-foot L-shaped gangplank, which is designed to have a maximum 8.33% slope (at low tide). The floating dock is approximately two feet above the surface of the water. The water depth near the fishing pier varies between 8 feet at high tide and 6 feet at low tide. It is recommended that visitors check the water depth and tides by visiting the Maryland DNR website.",

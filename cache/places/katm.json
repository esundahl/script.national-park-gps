    "bodyText": "<p>The beauty of Amalik is the ability to see a dynamic natural and cultural landscape, more or less as it has been, for hundreds, thousands of years. Most archeological sites are impacted by time and development, but Amalik allows you to see the land as people saw it coming in on their kayaks.The archeological district is a National Historic Landmark and thus afforded the highest degree of protection for historic properties.</p> <h4><br /> Ancient Villages</h4> <p>Over 7,000 years ago, early settlers in the Gulf of Alaska built homes on tiny islands at Amalik Bay in Katmai National Park and Preserve. For thousands of years after, Amalik Bay was home to families dependent upon the natural wealth of the Katmai coast. They left behind a variety of hunting, fishing, and household artifacts. Archeologists have found over two dozen archaeological sites in Amalik Bay.</p> <p>Where these people came from, how they connected with other groups, and the lifeways of their communities are important parts of Alaska's history.</p> <h4><br /> A Gathering Place</h4> <p>Some of the artifacts found in Amalik Bay are similar to those found in the Aleutian Islands, the Kodiak Islands, and other places around the Gulf of Alaska. This could mean that people in Amalik Bay were related somehow to other groups in the region, trading information and resources with them. The Amalik Bay settlers positioned themselves at a natural gateway between the Kodiak Islands to the east and Bristol Bay on the west.</p> <p>Amalik Bay served as a gathering place where communities captured fish, migratory birds, sea mammals, and shellfish. The types of animals captured and their ranges in size and age, indicate that people usually lived in Amalik Bay during the spring and summer months.</p> <h4><br /> Enduring Environmental Change</h4> <p>As time went by, the local environment was altered by sea-level changes, volcanic eruptions, and shifting climate. Adapting to changes in the environment required changes in technology and increasing interactions with other groups in the region. This is apparent in the gradual growth in diversity of tool types, a broadening of the variety of animals hunted, and eventually the manufacture of pottery.</p> <p>Between 2800 and 1800 years ago, there seems to be a gap in human occupation in Amalik Bay. Researchers are uncertain if this is because people were, for social or environmental reasons, compelled to abandon the area. Another possibility is that archaeological remains from this period were demolished by changes in the physical environment of the bay, for instance because of sea-level rise or earthquakes.</p> <h4><br /> Stone Tools and Cultural Phases</h4> <p>There are six archaeological cultural phases found in Amalik Bay. These phases are based on the types of stone tools found in the bay and the radiocarbon dates of the deposits they're found in.</p> <p>The first phase, found throughout the region, is the Paleoarctic cultural tradition. There's evidence that the Gulf of Alaska was settled sometime around 10,000 years ago but the rarity of these Paleoarctic sites makes it hard to understand what people were doing then. From what's known so far, Paleoarctic settlers in the region were more familiar with inland resources, like caribou. The people that came after were well versed in maritime traditions, such as fishing and hunting sea mammals.</p> <p>In Amalik Bay, the Pacific Period of the Alder Phase lasted from 6000 - 4500 years ago. The Takli Period-Birch Phase followed from 4500 - 2800 years ago. Then there was the Kukak Period-Cottonwood Phase from 1800 - 1500 years ago. The Kukak Period-Beach Phase (1500 - 1000 years ago), and the Katmai Period-Mound Phase (1000 - 500 years ago) were the last settlements in Amalik Bay.</p> <h4><br /> Additional Information</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nhlalaska/index.htm\">More National Historic Landmarks in Alaska</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.adn.com/article/20150301/ancient-cod-bones-carry-modern-warning-about-mercury-climate-change\">Ancient Cod Bones Carry Modern Warning about Mercury and Climate Change, Anchorage Daily News, 2015</a></p> <p>The \"Mink Island, Amalik Bay\" chapter of <em>Archaeology in America: An Encyclopedia</em>, Vol. 4 West Coast and Arctic/Subarctic, published by Greenwood Press in 2009.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Cultural Site exhibit, a reconstructed prehistoric house with interpretive displays, is a short walk from the Brooks Camp visitor center. The current structure is built in the footprint of an actual prehistoric house excavated in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> In order to better understand what life was like for people of the past, in 1968 Dr. Dumond led a team of archaeologists tasked with reconstructing an ancient home from one of the 700-year-old housing sites near Brooks River. Their excavations revealed that dwellings from this time period had some unique characteristics: these homes were semi-subterranean, meaning they were built partially underground, and most had an entrance passage with a floor that dipped below the level of the main house, forming a “cold trap.” This allowed the house to more easily retain the warmth of a fire inside. The presence of the cold trap entrance suggests that these homes were used in the winter, as they would have flooded during spring thaws and the rain-heavy months of July and August.<br /> <br /> These semi-subterranean homes were called <i>ciqlluat </i>by the Alutiiq people, or<i> barabaras</i> by the Russians. They were likely built out of cottonwood, because spruce trees didn’t grow in the area at the time. Cottonwood logs also split straighter than spruce, and oral histories from descendants of Katmai’s first peoples report that cottonwood would have been the preferred building material among the local trees. Cottonwood logs were split in half, and then placed over a wooden frame to create the domed walls and ceiling of the home. On top of this, people used sod and sphagnum moss to insulate and protect their homes in the winter. The reconstructed home at Brooks Camp has been left partially open so the inside can be viewed more easily.</p> <h4>What happened to the people who lived here?</h4> <p>Alutiiq people lived around Brooks River until the early 1800s. By this point, Russian fur hunters had been in the Aleutian Islands for nearly 60 years, and their influence was beginning to be felt by people living in the upper Alaska Peninsula. Local Native villages began to see the signs of new trading posts, imported diseases, Russian Orthodoxy, and other effects of Russian contact. In addition, Yup’ik communities from the north were moving southward into the upper Alaska Peninsula, possibly causing some social conflict. The last villages along Brooks River were abandoned around 1300 AD, possibly from a nearby volcanic eruption. By the time Novarupta erupted in 1912, there were no more inhabited sites along Brooks River.<br /> <br /> Although few people have lived in what is now Katmai National Park over the last two centuries, the Alutiiq descendants of Katmai’s first peoples live on today in the local area outside the park and more broadly across the state. Oral histories, cultural practices, materials, and traditions help connect today’s Indigenous people to their ancestors, and help all of us better understand the human stories of this region, past and present.</p>",

Inquire at the Visitor Center for more information. As always, be bear aware.<br /> <br /> <b>Who lived here? A broad archaeological overview. </b>Human habitation in the Brooks River area began around 2400 BC and continued for the next 4,200 years. There were three distinct waves of human habitation in the region, known as “Traditions,” which are characterized by unique types of artifacts. These help us piece together the archaeological record and learn something about the cultures and people who lived here in the past.<br /> <br /> The first known people in the region were from the Paleoarctic Tradition (9,000-7,000 years ago), followed by the Northern Archaic Tradition (5,000 to 3,850 years ago), the Arctic Small Tool Tradition (3,850-3,000 years ago), the Norton Tradition (2,250-900 years ago), and finally the Thule Tradition (900 years ago to historic contact). The people of these ancient societies were the ancestors of today’s Alaska Native people whose families originate from this area, particularly the Alutiiq people. We are able to piece together the stories of the past with the help of oral traditions from Alutiiq communities, as well as evidence from artifacts and ancient housing sites, like those found along Brooks River.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Brooks Falls is perhaps the most recognized area in all of Katmai. The Falls bisects the 1.5 mile long Brooks River which connects Brooks Lake and Naknek Lake. The roughly six foot high waterfall creates a temporary obstacle for salmon migrating upstream, resulting in large concentrations of salmon and therefore bears that come for the relatively easy fishing. It’s a great place to watch bears fish, especially large, dominant males. During the peak season, it’s possible to see more than 25 bears at once from the platform.     <br /> <br /> The two-tiered Falls Platform is located next to Brooks Falls and, because of limited space, has a capacity of 40 people. When the platform is at maximum capacity, rangers maintain a waiting list and everyone on the platform is limited to one hour at a time on the Falls Platform. This system helps to provide equal access during peak days of visitation. In addition, the use of expanded tripods and rail-mounted fixtures is prohibited on the Brooks Falls Platform from June 15 to August 15. Tripods may be used in a monopod configuration if the legs are fully collapsed to the center position and the unit is not self-supporting.<br /> <br /> More people visit Brooks Camp in July than any other month. If you come at this time, expect crowded conditions especially at the Falls Platform. Wait times to access the Falls Platform commonly exceed 1.5 hours in July, especially midday. The Falls Platform, adjacent Treehouse area (which is covered, has limited seating and some interpretive displays but offers no direct views of the river), and the Riffles Platform are closed from 10pm to 7am June 15–August 15.<br /> <br /> From the Visitor Center, it is a 1.2 mile (1.9km) one way trip to the Brooks Falls and Riffles Platform. The nearest restroom is .6 miles away at the start of the Brooks Falls Trail.<br /> <br /> ***Covid-19 mitigation procedures are in place for the 2021 season which limits capacity to no more than 16 individuals or 4 household groups on the platform (whichever is less) and changes the time limit when there is a waitlist.</p>",

At the end of the trail, .6 miles one way, two raised platforms offer a bird’s eye view of bears fishing in the Brooks River. Bear viewing at the Falls is best during the July salmon run. This hike can be intimidating with frequent bear encounters along its entire length. Bears are commonly encountered walking and sleeping along the Falls Trail especially in July and September.

The river has gradually changed course. Different tree species have dominated the ecosystem at various times—for instance, spruce trees had not encroached on Brooks River by 1300 AD. But oral traditions and cultural practices passed down to the descendants of Katmai’s first peoples give us more clues to the past. Alutiiq people indigenous to this region continue to use many of the local plants for food and medicine.<br /> <br /> Food:<b> </b> Wild berries such as watermelon berry, nagoonberry, cranberries, currants, blueberries, crowberries, and salmonberries are commonly harvested as a local food source in the late summer and fall. People also harvest fiddlehead ferns, Arctic dock, fireweed, and horsetail in the springtime to eat. Many of these are traditionally preserved in oil to last through the winter.<br /> <br /> Medicine: Plants including yarrow, Labrador tea, large-leaf avens, willow, Arctic dock, cow parsnip, cranberries, birch bark, and mosses were all used to treat a variety of ailments from colds and infections, to rashes and sores, to aches and pains.<br /> <br /> Material: In addition to food and medicine, the local plants have been used historically for building materials, tools, and toys. Cottonwood was commonly harvested for building homes, making plates, and building fires for smoking fish, while birch wood was carved into bowls, tool handles, hats, and whistles.",

In addition to examining layers in the soil, archaeologists look at artifacts found here to piece together stories of the past. In fact, over 330,000 artifacts have been found in Katmai, including projectile points, harpoons, blades, oil lamps, vessels, and somewhat mysteriously incised pebbles.<br /> <br /> Thirty-eight of these marked pebbles were found during archaeological excavations, stylized with intricate anthropomorphic designs carved onto them. These decorated pebbles suggest to us is that the people who made them had leisure time—they had a comfortable enough lifestyle that they had time to create art.  Many of them are carved with lines, dots, triangles, and tree-like patterns that may represent facial features or personal adornments such as headgear, necklaces, or jewelry. Archaeologists don’t really know what these pebbles were used for: They may have been part of a counting or tallying system, or may represent mythical figures. They do not appear to be tools, so perhaps they were either used for ceremonial function or game pieces. Interestingly, the designs are very similar to artifacts found on Kodiak Island, and other similar designs found in Aniakchak National Monument.<br /> <br /> What do you think these pebbles might represent? What could the similarities mean? How do you think they were used?",

Original construction was completed in 1943 and expanded in 1957 to include the wings on either side of the main building. Designed for the Fish and Wildlife Service to study salmon and other fish in the area, it would serve as one of the major Bristol Bay-area fisheries research headquarters for over 30 years. Once no longer needed, it was acquired by the National Park Service in 1979 and is currently used for employee housing for seasonal employees.<br /> <br /> If you chose to see this building in person, please be respectful as this is now used for employee housing and is not open to the public.",

It’s a good place to see sows with cubs, sub adults, and less dominant bears. After the salmon begin to spawn and die in late summer, bear activity is concentrated in this area as bears patrol the slower moving waters in search for dead and dying salmon that collect in the slow moving currents and eddies near the river mouth and bridge.<br /> <br /> These platforms are accessible at any time, do not have a capacity limit or any tripod restrictions.</p>",

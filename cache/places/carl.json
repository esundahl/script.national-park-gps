Goats you can just put in the family car and drive off, she went with me anyway to see about the goats since her father really said no, that a cow was impossible. We had some goats near the house, and I not only went home with one goat, but I said two goats, we’ll certainly need two goats if we’re going to have our family milk supply. Those goats turned out to be way out of the ordinary goats, that’s how we got into having goats\".  </p>",

    "bodyText": "This large, exposed rock was a favorite location for Carl Sandburg to bring a chair and orange crate for an outdoors study. He enjoyed the quiet and peacefulness of this location to edit his work. Exposed rocks like this are located throughout the area and have a long history of use going back to the first peoples to settle the area we know today as Flat Rock.<br /> <br /> This area’s dynamic and ecologically abundant landscape supplied generations of Native Americans a place to develop extensive cultural traditions related to kinship, religion, trade, art, and diverse use of abundant natural resources. Over millennia, these traditions evolved, adapting to environmental and social changes.Take a moment to pause here and reflect on the legacy of this land! These mountains are clothed in a lush hardwood forest teeming with birds, wildlife and an abundance of native berries, nuts, fruit, and flowers.  <br /> <br /> Long ago, native peoples such as Cherokee, Cheraw, and Catawba thrived on this rich abundance.While villages were in outlying areas, these large “flat rocks” near the border of North and South Carolina, were noted as places for traders, pioneers, and settlers to barter goods with the native people. With increased European expansion, the Indian Removal Act of 1838 forced native people to leave their homelands and their ancestral lands were confiscated.<br /> <br /> This removal was devastating, and many thousands perished on what is tragically remembered as the Trail of Tears. Today descendants of these early Cherokee people embrace their rich ancestry and culture and call these mountains home again in Cherokee, NC.

A conductor came out of the station and waved a yellow flimsy in his hand. As the train started I ran along and jumped into a boxcar.

The free shuttle will transport visitors from the main parking lot, on Little River Road, to the Sandburg Home and goat farm. <hr /><br /> Free parking is available at the entrance to the park. The parking lot has three oversize vehicle parking spaces for RV's and buses. Vehicles with trailers will be unable to park in these spaces and should use the playhouse lot across the street subject to availability. On busy days the lot fills quickly.<br />   <p><strong>Additional Parking Options</strong></p> <ul> <li>There is a Hikers' Parking Lot located 1/2 mile down Little River Rd from the Visitor Parking Lot for visitors who are just coming to enjoy a hike in the park.</li> <li>Visitors may park behind the Flat Rock Village Offices located at 110 Village Center Drive, Flat Rock, NC. It is a short walk to the park from this lot.</li> <li>Visitors may use the Flat Rock Playhouse lot directly across the street in the morning until noon and in the afternoon when there are no performances. There will be signs posted at the playhouse to restrict parking for performances. Please be a courteous neighbor and pay attention to their signs.</li> </ul> * <strong>If you park at Flat Rock Playhouse, remember to move your car before noon or risk being blocked in for several hours on matinee days (Wednesday through Sunday).<br /> <br /> Accessibility:</strong><br /> There are 2 accessible parking spaces in the main visitor lot. The walk from the visitor parking lot to the home is 1/3 mile and gains 100 feet in elevation. This can be challenging for many visitors. If you feel this climb may be a challenge for you, please call a park ranger from your cell phone using the phone number posted at the accessible parking spaces. The ranger will either be able to provide a shuttle or will make other accommodations.",

At the lake visitors have a view of the Sandburg Home at the top of a hill and a choice of taking a wooded path to the left that will lead them around the lake, or continue on the sidewalk to the right. Following the sidewalk to the right, there is a building with accessible restrooms, a water fountain and water bottle filling station, and wall mounted exhibit panels with text and photos featuring images of the Sandburg family at Connemara, and information about Carl Sandburg's life and his contributions to American literature and poetry. There are four picnic tables behind the building for visitor use. Just past this building is a small white bridge. Proceed across the white wooden bridge with the lake to the left and a spillover dam on the right. Follow the gravel trail straight ahead. This portion of the trail is rocky and moderately sloped. It ascends 100 feet over 1/3 mile to the Sandburg Home at the top. As you walk up the rock trail there are fenced pastures, and tall Hemlock trees lining both sides with a historic rock wall between the trail and a road. This trail continues up the hill and at the top of the hill the trail splits into left and right lanes. Visitor restrooms and access to the barn follow the path to the right. The left fork in the lane delivers you to the Sandburg Home where visitor information and park store services are available on the ground floor of the three story historic white home.

They love the universal things that are free to everybody. Light and air and food and love and some work are enough. In the varying phases of these cheap and common things, the great lives have found their joy.”</p> <p>Connemara provided them all these things; mountain air, gardens and orchards full of vegetables and fruit, plenty of work, and the love of a family.</p>",

They gave me a sitdown and as they had had only two or three letters from me, they asked me where I had been and I told them the half of it. When I showed my father fifteen dollars and a few nickels, he said the money would come in handy and I should watch it. What had the trip done to me? I couldn’t say. It had changed me. I was easier about looking people in the eye. When questions came I was quicker at answering them or turning them off. I had been a young stranger meeting many odd strangers and I had practiced at having answers... Away deep in my heart now I had hope as never before. Struggles lay ahead, I was sure, but whatever they were I would not be afraid of them.",

    "bodyText": "At the age of 19 Carl Sandburg was a restless young man, anxious to find himself and to see the country. Prior to  his Hobo adventure Sandburg had only traveled as far as  Chicago. He was drawn to head west to Kansas, in time for the wheat harvest, where there would surely be work. Along the way, he would stop to find odd jobs to fund his travels and to keep food in his belly. Sandburg left his friends and family in Galesburg Ill on the last week of June in 1897, he returned to his hometown on October 15th of that same year.  In reference to his hobo travels, Sandburg wrote, I was meeting fellow traveler's and fellow Americans and  what they were doing to my heart and mind, my personality; I could not say then nor later and be certain. I was getting a deeper self-respect than I had in Galesburg, so much I knew. I was getting to be a better storyteller! Quotes used in this tour are Sandburg's own from \"Always the Young Stranger\". Maps are provided by Library of Congress. <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "<p>At Agua Canyon two prominent hoodoos command attention. On the left, is the taller of the two towers, \"The Hunter.\" To the right is a hoodoo commonly referred to as the \"Rabbit\" or alternatively the \"Backpacker.\" In the early years of Bryce Canyon National Park a great effort was made to name many of the more prominent hoodoos. Over the years many of these have fallen or partially fallen so that they look nothing like the things they were originally named for. As a result hoodoos are no longer being named and many of the more obscure names are being dropped from newer publications. The good news is that you, the park visitor, now have the liberty to exercise your own creativity. Is the rabbit a backpacker or maybe even a thumb? It's up to you to decide. Let your imagination run!</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>No trails depart from this area. The Agua Connecting Trail (currently closed due to rockslide) is found at Ponderosa Canyon, the next overlook to the north.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>Navajo Mountain still looms on the distant horizon over 80 miles (129 km) away near Page, Arizona. Called a laccolith, Navajo Mountain can be thought of as a volcano that never quite happened. As the Colorado Plateau was uplifted over the last 20 million years, a plume of molten rock moved upward from deep inside the Earth causing a swelling much like a large blister. Unlike a volcano, Navajo Mountain never blew its top and so the plume cooled slowly, creating the hard core of the mountain that still exists today. By following the eastern horizon you may be able to see the southern tip of the Kaiparowits plateau, which is separated from Navajo Mountain by the Colorado River within Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>Tall, charismatic hoodoos are visible nearly at eye level from this view. These are created from the iron-rich mudstones and limestones of the park's Claron formation through repeated freeze/thaw cycles. Note the presence of limber pines (Pinus flexilis) atop the hoodoo known as \"the Hunter\", likely cached there as seeds by a Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana).<br /> The Paria Valley and the upper steps of the Grand Staircase exposed within it present most of the view beyond. Across the valley, the Table Cliff plateau stands at 10,000 feet (3048 m) and is composed of the same Claron formation (or \"Pink Cliffs\") as Bryce Canyon's hoodoos. This difference in elevation is due to the presence of the Paunsaugunt fault--a major normal fault that runs northeast to southwest along the park's eastern boundary. Uplift of the Colorado Plateau over the last 20 million years is responsible for the nearly 2,000 feet (607 m) of elevation difference expressed by this fault. Below these Pink Cliffs, observe the shale-rich badlands of the Grey Cliffs slowly transform to the sometimes iron-rich sandstones of the upper White Cliffs. Kodachrome State Park is located in this transition zone.<br /> Almost the same distance to Navajo Mountain in the southeast, the Henry Mountains can be seen on days with good air quality, 86 miles (138 km) away beyond the eastern horizon. Like Navajo Mountain, these too are laccoliths--or plumes of molten rock that warped the rocks above them, but never broke through as a volcano would. As with the terrain of Capitol Reef National Park, which lies just in front of these peaks, millions of years of erosion have now occurred, and at the Henry Mountains it has removed the overlying rock and exposed the hard igneous cores within these mountains.</p> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>Observe the eroded edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, punctuated by bowl-shaped amphitheaters.</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The rolling ponderosa forest of the Paunsaugunt plateau is deeply incised here by water travelling north to the Tropic Reservoir. The direction of flow is decided by the plateau's upward tilt to the south and has created a rain divide between the Great Basin of Nevada and the Colorado River that follows the edge of this plateau.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Agua Canyon Overlook<br /><br />A sign at this overlook reads Agua Canyon Elevation 8800 ft.<br />There are two popular hoodoos seen from this overlook. The first, a tall stone pillar to the left known as The Hunter, seems to have the shape of a man in profile, a large bulbous head atop a smaller spire, he looks to the right at the rabbit Hoodoo, a strikingly white limestone rock shaped in the head of a rabbit with long vertical ears sits atop a narrow stone pillar, orange in color.

Descending from the rim, this trail meanders through forests and meadows, offering stunning views of pink-hued cliffs in the distance. The Under the Rim Trail follows the base of the Paunsaugant Plateau and is largely forested. The hoodoos are part of the distant vistas to the west as you hike the valley floor. To preserve this experience, backcountry camping is permitted only in designated campsites. A backcountry permit must be obtained at the Visitor Center prior to any overnight trips. This trail is not as easily followed as developed trails within the Bryce Amphitheater.</p> <h2>Backcountry Hiking and Camping</h2> <p>The Under-the-Rim Trail is approximately 22.9 miles (36.9 km) from Bryce Point to Rainbow Point. Connecting trails offer access from the park's Scenic Drive and intersect the Under-the-Rim Trail at Swamp Canyon, and Whiteman Bench. Agua Canyon Connector Trail **is closed** until further notice due to storm damage.<br /> <br /> The Riggs Spring Loop is an 8.6 mile (13.9 km) hike beginning and ending at the Rainbow and Yovimpa Point parking lot at the south end of the Scenic Drive. Either the Yovimpa or Rainbow Point trailhead may be used to access this loop.<br /> <br /> A backcountry hiking map with mileage is available at the Visitor Center. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/backcountryinfo.htm\">More information</a></p> <h3>Permits Required</h3> <p>A Backcountry Permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry. Permits may be purchased at the Visitor Center from 9 am - 12:30 pm and 1:30 pm to 6 pm. Backcountry campsites are limited to 6 people per regular site, and 15 people per group site.</p> <h3>No Fires Permitted</h3> <p>Though gas-powered cooking stoves are allowed, no open fires are allowed anywhere in the park outside of North and Sunset Campground's established fire rings.</p> <h3>Bears and Other Wildlife</h3> <p>Bryce Canyon is home to many animals including mountain lions, coyotes and black bears. Squirrels, snakes and other small animals may also be present near your campsite.<br /> Due to the presence of black bears within Bryce Canyon National Park, the use of bear-resistant food canisters on overnight backcountry hikes is highly recommended. Bear-resistant canisters are available for loan, free of charge, at the Visitor Center.</p> <h3>Transportation</h3> <p>No park-provided transportation is provided south of Bryce Point. You can arrange a private shuttle using approved providers listed on our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/commercial-tours-and-services.htm\">Commercial Tours and Services</a> page.</p>",

Over millions of years, rivers and streams gradually filled this lake with clays, silts, and sands. Calcium carbonate cemented these sediments together, forming Bryce Canyon’s colorful, sedimentary rock layers. Meanwhile, tectonic forces deep within the Earth, were moving, cracking, and lifting, transforming the surface. The next diagram illustrates the exposure of the lake sediments then uplift and separation of the region along a Faultline. Caption reads: Uplift 20mya Text continues: About 20 mya a series of plateaus were uplifted along faults—large cracks in the Earth’s crust. The Paunsaugunt Plateau, on which you are standing, rose from near sea level to an average of 8,000 feet (2,440 m). To the east, Table Cliff rose 2,000 feet (610 m) higher. Around six mya the Paria River began carving a broad valley between the Table Cliff and Paunsaugunt plateaus. The last diagram illustrates a rugged and carved out landscape caused by weathering and erosion 6mya to present day Text continues: Weathering and Erosion Both mechanical and chemical weathering shape this place. At this high elevation, temperatures fall below freezing around 180 nights a year. Water seeps into rock fractures and then expands as it freezes, wedging rocks apart bit by bit. Chemical weathering occurs as acids in the water dissolve the calcium carbonate that holds the rocks together. Melting snow and summer rains wash away the rock debris, eroding the weathered stone A prominent hoodoo named Thor’s hammer is at the center of the image with hundreds more hoodoos of varying shapes and sizes in the near and far distance. Text continues: Shaping Hoodoos Bryce Canyon’s hoodoos are rock pinnacles shaped by weathering and erosion. Often topped by an erosion-resistant caprock—such as dolomitic limestone—each hoodoo consists of rock layers that erode at different rates. This process of differential erosion creates the whimsical shapes, which will eventually collapse.",

    "audioDescription": "Architectural Artistry This panel along Lodge entrance interprets the history of the Lodge as being the last original lodge of those designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood along the Union Pacific's \"Grand Circle\" tour. A black and white photograph taken in 1938 shows the front of the original lodge with a long line of buses lined up to take visitors on park tours. Text reads: Architectural Artistry Gilbert Stanley Underwood, the master architect hired by Union Pacific Railroad, helped pioneer the National Park Service rustic style. Here at Bryce and at many other western national parks, his artistry, vision, and utilization of local timber and stone created structures that nestled harmoniously into the natural landscape. The lodge’s roof is notable. Its green color was chosen to blend in with the Ponderosa pines, and the shingle pattern creates a wave-like movement, mimicking pine boughs blowing in the wind. This is the last remaining original “Grand Circle Tour” lodge. A hand drawn map from 1930 illustrates this grand circle tour by road, bus, and train connections among Zion, Bryce, Cedar Breaks, and Pipe Spring. Caption reads: Enticing tourists to lengthen their stay, the Utah Parks Company created the \"Grand Circle Tour,” a bus trip through Cedar Breaks, Bryce Canyon, the Kaibab Plateau, Grand Canyon North Rim, and Zion national parks and monuments. Text continues: The original lodges at Zion and Grand Canyon burned down, and Cedar Breaks' was dismantled. The lodge at Bryce Canyon is the last remaining from the Grand Circle Tour era Description of the Lodge follows: This two-story building is irregularly shaped with a hipped roof structure. It is made of stone and exposed wood framing. The steeply pitched roofs are finished with wood shingles applied in a wavy pattern. Each corner of the building is anchored by sandstone pillars. Stone chimneys are located at various points and protrude above the roof line. The main entrance to the lodge features columns and log beam work along a long porch. Three centrally located staircases access the patio directly in front of the main entrance. Each step down to the road and connect with a trail that takes you to the Canyon rim. The patio is enclosed by a large diameter log railing set in stone piers that run the length of the front of the building. The patio is paved with red clay brick in a variety of patterns. The wood siding and exposed frame of the lodge are painted dark brown. The lodge and most other buildings in the area were designed in the rustic style using local stone and wood, with detailing to make the buildings look as if they had been constructed with primitive hand tools to ensure a natural look with the surrounding environment.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The park has its share of misnomers (Mossy Cave isn't a cave, the canyon isn't really a canyon...) and Black Birch Canyon would be another. Since black birch (Betula lenta) only occurs in the east, it's likely quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) were mistaken for these. Birch are famous for having bark that peels back like paper; aspen bark does not peel. Whereas aspen leaves are perfectly flat, birch leaves are slightly \"V\" shaped and more elongated than Quaking Aspen leaves.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>No trails depart from this area.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>See the hoodoos eroded from the edge of the Paunsaugunt plateau contained within a bowl-shaped amphitheater shared with Rainbow Point. A forest floor of pine and fir lies 1,000 feet (305 m) below.</p> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>Navajo Mountain looms on the distant horizon over 80 miles (129 km) away near Page, Arizona. Called a laccolith, Navajo Mountain can be thought of as a volcano that never quite happened. As the Colorado Plateau was uplifted over the last 20 million years, a plume of molten rock moved upward from deep inside the Earth causing a swelling much like a large blister. Unlike a volcano, Navajo Mountain never blew its top and so the plume cooled slowly, creating the hard core of the mountain that still exists today.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>The Paria Valley and the upper steps of the Grand Staircase exposed within it present most of the view. Across the valley, the Table Cliff plateau stands at 10,000 feet (3048 m) and is composed of the same Claron formation (or \"Pink Cliffs\") as Bryce Canyon's hoodoos. This difference in elevation is due to the presence of the Paunsaugunt fault--a major normal fault that runs northeast to southwest along the park's eastern boundary. Uplift of the Colorado Plateau over the last 20 million years is responsible for the nearly 2,000 feet (607 m) of elevation difference expressed by this fault. Below these Pink Cliffs, observe the shale-rich badlands of the Grey Cliffs slowly transform to the sometimes iron-rich sandstones of the upper White Cliffs. Kodachrome State Park is located in this transition zone.<br /> Almost the same distance to Navajo Mountain in the southeast, the Henry Mountains can be seen on days with good air quality, 86 miles (138 km) away beyond the eastern horizon. Like Navajo Mountain, these too are laccoliths--or plumes of molten rock that warped the rocks above them, but never broke through as a volcano would. As with the terrain of Capitol Reef National Park, which lies just in front of these peaks, millions of years of erosion have now occurred, and at the Henry Mountains it has removed the overlying rock and exposed the hard igneous cores within these mountains.</p> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>Observe the eroded edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, punctuated by bowl-shaped amphitheaters. Atop the Markagunt plateau to the northwest and the Paunsaugunt plateau in the north, the Tushar Mountains and Sevier plateau (or Black Mountains) can be seen. These were created through volcanic activity associated with the uplift of the Colorado Plateau.</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The rolling ponderosa forest of the Paunsaugunt plateau is deeply incised here by water travelling north to the Tropic Reservoir. The direction of flow is decided by the plateau's upward tilt to the south and has created a rain divide between the Great Basin of Nevada and the Colorado River that follows the edge of this plateau.</p>",

A path runs adjacent to the plateaus edge and is enclosed with a horizontal log railing.<br />A sign at this overlook reads Black Birch Canyon Elevation 8750 feet.<br />Rows of striking orange pillar shaped hoodoos line the edges of the plateau as trees creep up along the sides of the cliff edges. The overlook provides a view of Rainbow point to the north. In the distance is Powell Point-the southernmost extent of the Table Cliff Plateau-and to the right are the distant Henry Mountains.",

Roosevelt as a task force to work on a wide variety of conservation and public works projects, the CCC's objective was primarily unemployment relief. It provided work for a total of 3 million people--mostly young men during its existence. Crews would create parks, plant forests, and construct roads, trails, shelters, and picnic areas throughout the nation. Bryce Canyon would host camp NP-3, which worked primarily on roads, footpaths, insect control, and landscaping work. Notable projects included the Under-the-Rim Trail from Rainbow Point to Bryce Point, structures at Rainbow Point and the Bristlecone Loop Trail gazebo, and front-country campground development. Camp NP-3 operated from 1934 until the camp was disbanded in 1943. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/brca/hrs5d.htm\">Read More</a></p>",

Here you will pass by bristlecone pines up to 1,600 years old and on clear days experience vistas over 100 miles (171 km) across the Grand Staircase geologic area. The majority of the forest here is dominated by White Fir and Douglas Fir, making this good habitat for grouse, woodpeckers, owls, and a variety of squirrels and chipmunks. Many of these animals use dead and burned trees (such as those burned in the 2018 Riggs and Lonely fires) for habitat. <br /> A trail guide with map and information is available in your newspaper Visitor Guide. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/bristleconeloop.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h2>Nature</h2> <h3>Bristlecone Pines</h3> <p><strong>Note that bristlecone pines share dolomitic limestones with some of the park's most delicate plants. Stay on the trail and help us to protect them.</strong><br /> Though Bryce Canyon is well known for its geology, the park also contains a fantastic diversity of trees. Among the most impressive of these is the Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). These trees are known for thriving where few other plants can, and for far longer too. Look for bristlecone pines on exposures of dolomitic limestone. These areas of white to grey stone are found in the park's hoodoo-forming Claron formation as low as the Queen's Garden and Fairyland Loop trails and as high as this trail. Dolomitic limestone is high in calcium and magnesium, and low in phosphorus. This chemistry is difficult for other plants to tolerate, giving the bristlecone pine plenty of room to grow as slowly as it likes. You'll also typically find higher-elevation bristlecones growing at the edges of cliffs, where competition is even further reduced. Free to take its time, bristlecones pines can grow as slowly as an inch (2.5 cm) per century if conditions are challenging. This gives these trees incredibly dense heartwood, which is capable of providing structural support to the tree long after a section of limb or trunk has lost its life-protecting bark. The oldest tree at Bryce Canyon was estimated to be 1,600 years old, though trees across its range into Nevada and California have been dated at over 5,000 years old, giving Pinus longaeva the honor of being the longest living non-clonal species on Earth.<br /> You can identify a Bristlecone pine by its densely bundled needles of five (making it a white pine). Unlike many other pines that shed their needles every few years, bristlecone pines can retain needles for up to forty years. Their 1.5 in (1.2 cm) long needles remain vibrant and green for typically a full 12 inches (30 cm) along the branch. This appearance is often compared to that of a bottlebrush or pipe cleaner.<br /> Like the limber pine (another white pine found at Bryce Canyon) seeds of the bristlecone pine may be harvested and dispersed to unlikely places by Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana). The seeds of their bristle-tipped cones are often among the first to colonize recently burnt areas.</p> <h3>The Grand Staircase</h3> <p>The Grand Staircase is an immense sequence of sedimentary rock layers that stretch south from Bryce Canyon National Park through Zion National Park and into the Grand Canyon. In the 1870s, geologist Clarence Dutton first conceptualized this region as a huge stairway ascending out of the bottom of the Grand Canyon northward with the cliff edge of each layer forming giant steps. Dutton divided this layer cake of Earth history into five steps that he colorfully named Pink Cliffs, Grey Cliffs, White Cliffs, Vermilion Cliffs, and Chocolate Cliffs. Since then, modern geologists have further divided Dutton's steps into individual rock formations.<br /> What makes the Grand Staircase worldly unique is that it preserves more Earth history than any other place on Earth. Geologists often liken the study of sedimentary rock layers to reading a history book--layer by layer, detailed chapter by detailed chapter. The problem is that in most places in the world, the book has been severely damaged by the rise and fall of mountains, the scouring of glaciers, etc. Usually these chapters are completely separated from each other and often whole pages are just missing. Yet the Grand Staircase and the lower cliffs that comprise the Grand Canyon remain largely intact speaking to over 600 million years of continuous Earth history with only a few paragraphs missing here and there.<br /> Unfortunately, the Grand Staircase is such a vast region of rock that no matter where you stand on its expanse, most of it will be hidden behind the curvature of Earth. Places such as Yovimpa Point, the Bristlecone Loop trail, and the north slope of the Kaibab Plateau are the exception where even a non-geologist can discern the individual chapters of this colossal history book--these immense steps of Dutton's Grand Staircase.</p> <h3>Fire</h3> <p>Natural fire is a good and necessary part of this landscape. It promotes new growth, diversity of species, removes sick and dead plant matter, and limits insect populations and the spread of plant disease. Without fire, forests become crowded, diseased, less diverse, and ultimately create conditions for large-scale destructive wildfire. In ponderosa forests within the park, fire was once common on a 3-7 year cycle, as lightning strikes would ignite low-intensity ground fires. The Ponderosa pine's thick bark protects healthy trees from the flames, while clearing the ground for new growth. At higher elevations, mixed conifer forests would burn on 11-25 year cycles, allowing first grasses, then shrubs and trees like Quaking Aspen to thrive in newly opened space.<br /> Over the last 150 years, a history of fire suppression has deprived many western forests of the benefits of fire, creating large-scale beetle attacks, loss of biodiversity, and a build-up of dead and dry plant matter ready to ignite.<br /> Here at Bryce Canyon, fire crews are working to provide these forests with the fire they need. This often begins with mechanical thinning: cutting down dead, diseased, and overcrowded trees and building burn piles that are ignited in winter. You may see these piles throughout the park.<br /> This is often a first step before broadcast ground fires can be set--if too much plant matter is present, the fire can easily grow beyond control. Burn piles reduce vegetation to a manageable level. They also help fire crews defend areas of the park when lightning starts an unexpected fire. Previous fuels reduction work in the Rainbow Point area was crucial to wildland fire crews' ability to safely manage the August 2018 Riggs and Lonely fires, which burned over 2,200 acres across National Forest, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service land to the southeast of Rainbow Point.</p>",

The Bryce Amphitheater, before you, is constantly changing, chiseled by drainages that gather into Bryce Creek. The breathtaking views can extend nearly 100 miles (161 km) along the eastern horizon. The viewpoint at Inspiration Point consists of three overlooks that provide varied perspectives of the main amphitheater, which is an expansive bowl-like feature carved into the edge of this high plateau. The canyon is filled with thousands of irregularly eroded spires of rocks called hoodoos, each pinnacle and its surrounding cliff faces are layered with jagged striations of orange, white, gray and brown stone fading to soft rolling forested hills in the distant valley. From here, visitors look toward the north to Sunset Point with its many rows of hoodoos and Sunrise Point set against the backdrop of Boat Mesa. A panoramic photograph spans the panel with labels of the key landscape formations that can be seen from this overlook. In the far distance from left to right: Sevier Plateau (13 miles/21 km) Aquarius Plateau (25 miles/40 km) Table Cliff Plateau (15 miles/24 km) Powell Point (15 miles/24 km) Canaan Peak (20 miles/32.1 km) Kaiparowits Plateau (70 miles/112.6 km) Navajo Mountain (82 miles/131.9 km) Within the park and amphitheater from left to right: Silent City Sunset Point Sunrise Point Boat Mesa Sinking Ship Bristlecone Point Bryce Creek The Cathedral Bryce Point Wall of Windows",

    "audioDescription": "Visitor Center 223 words The park entrance station and visitor center are near the north end of the park along the main road, within a large expanse of sagebrush meadow and directly surrounded by stands of ponderosa pine. The entrance station along the road has three one room small kiosk booths with windows on all four sides. Park entrance tickets and information are available upon entrance. The visitor center is a 3 story L shaped building on a concrete foundation. Its construction although newer, is similar to the rustic style of the other buildings within the park; a combination of studs-out wood appearance emphasizing the framing as a decorative pattern on the exterior of the building and large exterior stone pillars at each of the buildings corners. The sharply pitched gable roof is covered with green corrugated metal roofing. The outside walls are painted dark brown and contrast with the lighter colored stone facing. A low stone wall runs around the base of the building. There are nearby pedestrian trails, a shuttle bus stop and available parking in the front. At the entrance of the building there is an informational tactile touch table to illustrate the topography within the canyon landscape along with interpretive panels and orientation maps. The visitor center houses a museum with exhibits, a small theater, restrooms, water station, visitor information and a bookstore.",

Visitors can also find restrooms, showers, camping supplies including firewood, and souveniers.<br /> The General Store is typically closed between January and March.</p> <h3>Camp Center and Bryce Inn</h3> <p>Constructed by the Utah Parks Company in 1932--the same year as the Old Administration Building (High Plateau Institute) to the south. Designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, who also designed the park's Lodge, this structure was designated the central unit in the Utah Parks Company’s “housekeeping camp unit\". After the deluxe cabins and Bryce Lodge, this was the last major improvement in the park designed by Underwood.  Available evidence suggests the Utah Parks Company intended to use the cafeteria building as a center of operations once the Lodge was closed for the season. It soon became evident the building was too small for this purpose.<br /> This area once contained housekeeping tents, along with simple guest cabins, sanitary facilities, and support buildings which were removed from 1974-1989. <br /> In September of 1954, its name was changed from Bryce Canyon cafeteria and camp center to Bryce Canyon Inn. Sometime after the removal of the surrounding structures the building was renamed to the General Store.<br /> In 1994 the building was submitted to the National Register of Historic Places as an example of Gilbert Stanley Underwood's Rustic architectural design.<br />  </p> <h3>The Utah Parks Company at Bryce Canyon</h3> <p>The Utah Parks Company (UPC) was a subsidiary of Union Pacific Railroad, which owned and operated restaurants, lodging, and bus tours in Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks, the north rim of Grand Canyon National Park, and Cedar Breaks National Monument from the 1920s until 1972. Before Bryce Canyon became a national park, the Union Pacific Railroad had conceived these parks and monuments as forming a \"Grand Circle\", which would ultimately be visited first by arrival at a rail depot in Lund, Utah (near present day Cedar City) and then by bus to the UPC-owned El Escalante hotel in Cedar City, and then to the parks themselves. To accomodate these visitors, the Utah Parks Company financed the construction of the Bryce Canyon Lodge, numerous cabins and other less permanent accomodations, the General Store, and later the Historic Service Station. After the establishment of Bryce Canyon National Park in 1928, UPC would serve as the park's sole concessionaire until competition from private motor vehicles and other operating costs would lead to their liquidiation and donation of all assets within the park to the National Park Service in 1972.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "General Store 123 words The General Store follows the same architecture as the lodge and cabins with an exposed frame, wood building painted dark brown, stone chimney and hip style roof where all roof sides slope downward at an angle. Green painted shingles cover the roof in a wavy pattern. The front of the building includes the camp store with a partially enclosed porch on the southeast supported by wooden posts and brackets. Stone steps, a sidewalk and brick entry welcome visitors. Framing the building is a rustic style log fence painted dark brown that wraps around to the side entrance of the building to the showers and restrooms. Within the fence grows ponderosa pine and grasses. Accessible parking is available, trash and recycling, laundry, provisions and snacks.",

    "audioDescription": "Bryce Canyon Lodge 263 words The lodge is located near the rim of the plateau between Sunrise and Sunset points set in a timbered knoll with native vegetation of Ponderosa Pines and low growing shrubs. Many smaller buildings are scattered around this main complex. All buildings in the area are an example of the rustic building design that blends well with the natural environment. The lodge: This two story building is irregularly shaped with a hipped roof structure. It is made of stone and exposed wood framing. The steeply pitched roofs are finished with wood shingles applied in a wavy pattern. Each corner of the building is anchored by sandstone pillars. Stone chimneys are located at various points and protrude above the roof line. The main entrance to the lodge features columns and log beam work along a long porch. Three centrally located staircases access the patio directly in front of the main entrance. Each step down to the road and connect with a trail that takes you to the Canyon rim. The patio is enclosed by a large diameter log railing set in stone piers that run the length of the front of the building. The patio is paved with red clay brick in a variety of patterns. The wood siding and exposed frame of the lodge are painted dark brown. The lodge and most other buildings in the area were designed in the rustic style using local stone and wood, with detailing to make the buildings look as if they had been constructed with primitive hand tools to ensure a natural look with the surrounding environment.",

With the exception of vehicles measuring 23 feet/7 meters or longer, which are restricted from the Bryce Amphitheater during shuttle hours, riding the shuttle is not mandatory. However, by riding our buses you will support our efforts to keep our parking lots from growing any larger, to keep our pure air as clean as possible, and to provide enough room in our little park for everyone to experience the magic of Bryce Canyon.<br /> <br /> The Bryce Amphitheater Shuttle runs regularly on 15 minute intervals from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. with extended hours to 8 p.m. in summer, and brings visitors to areas of interest, viewpoints, and trailheads within the Bryce Amphitheater area of the park. The shuttle is free with park admission.</p> <h4>How to use the Shuttle</h4> <p>There is no extra fee to use the shuttle system. Paying your entrance fee to Bryce Canyon entitles you and your vehicle's occupants to unlimited use of the Bryce Canyon Shuttle buses.<br /> <br /> Annual Passes waive the entrance fee to not only this park but all other National Park Service Areas and other Federal lands that may have fees, across the entire country. If you do not already have one of these annual passes they can be purchased at the entrance to the park.<br /> <br /> If you are not staying overnight inside the park at either the Bryce Canyon Lodge or North or Sunset Campground, we strongly encourage you to leave your vehicle outside the park. Please park and board the shuttle at the Shuttle Station (near Ruby's Inn, on the left side of the road before entering the park) or at Ruby's Campground. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/shuttle.htm\">Read more about the Shuttle</a></p>",

    "audioDescription": "Bryce Canyon? Three diagrams illustrate the layered stone landscape of Bryce Canyon. What begins as a smooth and featureless landscape beginning about 20 million years ago becomes, over time and weathering, the eroded and rugged Bryce Canyon of present day. Captions explain: First tectonic forces fractured, displaced, and lifted this area. This uplift created the Paunsaugunt Fault, defining the eastern edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Then greater erosion occurs to the west of the fault line six million years ago, the Paria River began flowing and eroding the valley to the east. Seasonal drainages that feed the Paria River began to shape both sides of the valley and amphitheaters began to form. The last diagram shows a now deeply eroded canyon-like landscape: Erosion by the Paria River began in the south, where it joins the Colorado River, and is still moving slowly north. Northern amphitheaters, like this one, are smaller and less deep than those further south in the park.

    "audioDescription": "A three-dimensional topographic image of the park shows our location here in the mixed conifer life zone at Rainbow Point, This is the highest elevation of 9,100 ft at the southern end of the park. To our north the Ponderosa Pine life zone at 8,000 ft and then the Pinyon Juniper Life zone at 6,600 ft are labeled. Title and introductory text reads: Bryce Life Zones Here at Bryce, the elevation ranges from 9,100 feet (2,778 m) at Rainbow Point to 6,600 feet (2,012 m) at the canyon bottoms. The accompanying wide range of temperatures and precipitation creates three distinctive climatic or life zones—Mixed Conifer (highest elevation), Ponderosa Pine (mid-elevation), and Pinyon/Juniper (lowest elevation). This diversity of habitat creates incredible opportunities; here you can find over 100 species of birds, dozens of mammals, and more than a thousand plant species. Description of the three life zones continues from left to right beginning with the Pinyon Juniper Forest at the lowest elevation. Pinyon/Juniper Forest A background photograph shows a cluster of shrubs and trees that illustrate the diversity of species found in this life zone: Juniper, Ponderosa pine, Greenleaf manzanita, gambel oak, the buff-colored cones, and nuts of the Pinyon Pine and the spikey narrowleaf yucca. Animals are featured that include a small squirrel like Uinta chipmunk, Greater short-horned lizard and a blue Pinyon Jay perched on a branch. Text continues: The pinyon/juniper community, found at lower elevations, is defined by pinyon pine and juniper. Look for short evergreen trees and a variety of desert and upland shrubs. Springs and irrigation water found here create refuges for more water-dependent plants. Experience this life zone along the Mossy Cave Trail. Next the Ponderosa Pine life zone at the middle elevation: A background photograph shows a Ponderosa Pine forest with lower growing Greenleaf manzanita shrubs in the understory. A close-up of the pine bark is emphasized with a caption that reads: The thick, plated bark of ponderosa pine is an adaptation that protects the tree from fire. A series of photographs feature other plants and animals found here to include the delicate bunching Indian rice grass, the small blue berries of the Oregon grape and the soft yellow flowers of the Antelope bitterbush. A gold-mantled ground squirrel eats a nut on a rock, a mule deer grazes in a meadow and a bird, the Pygmy nuthatch with a white underbelly, straight sharp bill and slate gray back sits on a branch. Text continues: Ponderosa pine forests define this community. These stately evergreens can grow 200 feet tall (61 m) and often live up to 500 years. Ponderosa pines have adapted to depend upon low-intensity fires, typically started by lightning. Fire maintains an open forest floor, clearing dense growth, so that grasses, wildflowers, and new trees can flourish. Fire's rejuvenating effect on this ecosystem attracts and supports diverse wildlife. Last the Mixed Conifer life zone here at our location. A background photograph shows an example of a dense mixed conifer forest of varying tree species to include the tall and erect Engelmann spruce with its short green needles and reddish elongated cones and deciduous quaking aspen in the foreground. A series of photographs feature other plants and animals found here to include a mountain lion crouched on a rock, the purple cluster of blossoms of the Lupine flower, an elk standing in a meadow and the Clark’s nutcracker; a grey bird with black wings and thick pointed bill. Text continues: Mixed Conifer This life community, found at the highest elevations of the park, contains a mixture of conifer (cone-bearing) trees, including white fir, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, bristlecone, and limber pines. Plants here provide important habitat for many species, such as woodpeckers, owls, squirrels, and elk. Text reminds us not to feed or approach wildlife, for our safety and theirs.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Perhaps the most iconic of the park's viewpoints, Bryce Point provides a soaring view of the Bryce Amphitheater from the south. Southern Paiutes call this place Unka Tumpi Wun-nux Tungwatsini Xoopakichu Anax, which means \"Red Rock Standing Like a Man in a Hole\". These hole or bowl-shaped areas--called amphitheaters--contain the world's greatest concentration of irregular rock spires called \"hoodoos\". There is a Southern Paiute word for \"scary\" or \"spirit\" pronounced \"oo'doo\", which has been associated with this place. A sacred oral tradition of the Southern Paiute states that these hoodoos are ancient “Legend People” turned into stone by the trickster god Coyote as a punishment for bad deeds.<br /> The view and the park share the same namesake, Ebenezer Bryce, who settled in the Paria Valley to the east in 1870. Bryce lived here for only five years, but in that time, the canyon that a timber road he built travelled into became known as \"Bryce's canyon\" to the people who knew him. Ebenezer Bryce was a pragmatic man, constructing roads to facilitate lumber transport and surveying the route for a 10-mile irrigation ditch from the top of the plateau to the valley that would later lead to larger, more permanent settlements.</p> <h3>Trails</h3> <p>At the north end of the parking lot, the 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Peekaboo Loop and 4.0 mile (6.4 km) Hat Shop trails descend below the rim. Both of these are strenuous hikes. Closer to the viewpoint, the 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Rim Trail has its southern beginning here--varying from easy to moderate difficulty as it connects to Inspiration, Sunset, Sunrise, and Fairyland Points. Note that the section from Bryce to Inspiration is closed in winter.</p> <h3>Landscape Features</h3> <p><strong>To the North</strong><br /> Bryce Point is famous for its view to the north, across the full length of the Bryce Amphitheater. Inspiration, Sunset, and Sunrise Points can all be seen along the forested edge of the Paunsagunt plateau. Famous geologic features visible from here include the Wall of Windows near Inspiration Point, dense rows of hoodoos (irregularly eroded spires of rock) forming Silent City beside Sunset Point, and the flat top of Boat Mesa seen north of Sunrise Point. The caprock of Boat Mesa, known as the conglomerate at Boat Mesa, is the same layer you stand on now. It comprises the large boulders that have fallen just shortly below the view. This conglomerate layer is a result of a time after the fresh water lakes that deposited the colorful rocks below retreated when this area began to be uplifted by volcanic activity and eroded by streams. Evidence of massive volcanic activity that was occurring around 20 million years ago is seen in the Black Mountains further north and the Tushar Mountains seen even further off to the Northwest.<br /> <br /> <strong>To the East</strong><br /> The town of Tropic can be seen in the Paria Valley nearly 3,000 feet (914 m) below. The horizon is graced with the grandeur of the Table Cliffs or Aquarius Plateau, whose notched southern end (known as Powell Point) stands 13 miles (21 km) distant. Tracing the horizon south, the next prominence is Canaan Peak, which is also crested with the colorful Claron Formation. From here, the Kaiparowits Plateau forms the horizon until it meets with Navajo Mountain, approximately 80 miles (129 km) distant and visible on clear days.<br /> <br /> <strong>To the South</strong><br /> Views to the south are partially obscured by the plateau's edge, which forms the southern end of the Bryce Amphitheater area here. Below the point, the Peekaboo Loop can be seen descending north through an engineered hole in the rock.<br /> <br /> <strong>To the West</strong><br /> Large cavities in the white limestone layer of the Claron formation are known as the Grottos. This white layer is formed of especially soluble limestone, and groundwater working its way from above and then laterally through this layer. Above and below the Grottos, less soluble rock limits the formation of similar features. The Wall of Windows extends as a fin from this area, essentially a continuous aspect of these features that has now been exposed on both sides and therefore erodes more quickly through frost-wedging, wind, and other weathering forces. Above the Grottos, a forest of moisture-loving Douglas Fir grows and can be enjoyed along the 1.5 mile (2.4 km) stretch of the Rim Trail connecting Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. Note this section is closed in winter due to narrow trails and snow cornices.</p>",

A path runs adjacent to the plateaus edge and is enclosed with a horizontal log railing with stone columns. From Bryce Point is one of the most scenic vistas of the main Bryce amphitheater. Visitors stand on a narrow fin of rock facing out into the amphitheater, which is an expansive bowl-like feature carved into the edge of the high plateau.

Each spire and cliff face continues layered striations of orange, white, gray and brown fading to soft rolling hills of forest in the distant valley.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Picnic tables are available for use at this forested pull-out.</p> <h2>The Civilian Conservation Corps and Bryce Canyon</h2> <p>Begun in 1933 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a task force to work on a wide variety of conservation and public works projects, the CCC's objective was primarily unemployment relief. It provided work for a total of 3 million people--mostly young men during its existence. Crews would create parks, plant forests, and construct roads, trails, shelters, and picnic areas throughout the nation. Bryce Canyon would host camp NP-3, which worked primarily on roads, footpaths, insect control, and landscaping work. Notable projects included the Under-the-Rim Trail from Rainbow Point to Bryce Point, structures at Rainbow Point and the Bristlecone Loop Trail gazebo, insect pest control--including the felling and burning of trees, and front-country campground development.</p> <h3>Camp NP-3</h3> <p>Camp NP-3 operated from 1934 until the camp was disbanded in 1943, and was located in the vicinity of this picnic area.<br /> In a report to the Chief Architect of the Park Service, dated May 10, 1934, Resident Landscape Architect Harry Langley described the selection of NP-3's campsite:<br /> \"I reviewed the campsite with the Army officers in charge and think they have chosen a good location. It is the same place where a road contractor [Union Construction Company] established camp when building section A[1-A] of the Rim Road and is approximately three miles south of headquarters area. Water is supplied from a spring used by the Utah Parks Company years ago and considerable work was necessary on the pipeline due to lack of maintenance since it was abandoned.\"<br /> Within days the campsite sported a frame messhall, recreation building, latrine, and a number of tents to quarter enrollees.</p>",

Title and text reads: Deciphering Nature’s Palette The colorful Claron Formation was formed 50 to 60 million years ago in a system of lakes that stretched across central Utah. Separated into an upper white member and lower pink member, both are composed primarily of limestone mixed with varying amounts of silt and clay. Intermittent layers of mudstone and sandstone were deposited as the lake levels rose or fell and rivers flowed across the basin.

From left to right: First The conglomerate at Bryce Point, 50–100 feet thick, is the youngest rock layer seen in the park atop Boat Mesa and Bryce and Inspiration points. Around 30 million years ago, rivers created this layer of pebbles enclosed by smaller sand grains. Then Dolomitic limestone layers, reinforced with magnesium, look like concrete, and are highly resistant to erosion. These “caprocks” are essential to hoodoo formation, as they protect the softer layers underneath them. Next in the center of the image The lower pink member, a mixture of limestone, mudstone, silt, clay, and sandstone 500-700 feet thick, was deposited as lake levels repeatedly rose and fell. Iron and manganese combine with oxygen to create the distinctive colors. Almost all of the park’s hoodoos are formed in this member. Then The Claron’s white member, around 300 feet thick here, formed when this was a deep lake. This purer limestone erodes forming sheer cliffs and grottos best seen near Bryce Point. North of Sunset Point it has completely eroded away. And last at the far right along the canyon rim The pink member’s softer rocks, like mudstones, erode more quickly and deeply than more resistant layers, creating indentations that can be traced horizontally.",

It can be begun from either the Tower Bridge Trailhead or further notice at Fairyland Point (not accessible by vehicle in winter months). Spending 2.5 miles (4 km) along quiet ponderosa forests on the Rim Trail and the rest below surrounded by hoodoos within Fairyland and Campbell Canyons, it provides an excellent experience of the diversity above and below the rim. The trail can be hiked either clockwise or counter-clockwise, though many prefer the latter for the opportunity to descend rather than climb the Tower Bridge Trail section.<br /> Generally the trail traces a large circle centered on Boat Mesa, the large flat-topped feature capped with the Conglomerate at Boat Mesa. This rock layer is one of the park's youngest, from a time after the freshwater lakes that would deposit the vibrant Claron Formation that forms the park's hoodoos had drained away, leaving large braided rivers that drained mountains to the north. <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/fairylandloop.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h3>The Rim Trail</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Varies (Easy to Moderate)<br /> Total Distance: 5.5 miles (8.9 km)<br /> Ascent/Descent (North to South): 1,825 feet (556 m) / 1,330 feet (405 m)<br /> Average time: 3-4 hours</strong><br /> <br /> The 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Rim Trail begins in the south at Bryce Point and ends in the north at Fairyland Point. The trail connects all viewpoints in the Bryce Amphitheater area and can be accessed at each of them.<br /> The section between Sunrise and Sunset Points is paved and has minor elevation changes; this portion is wheelchair accessible except in severe weather.<br /> This section between Sunrise and Sunset Points is also the only section of the Rim Trail pets are allowed on; all pets must be on leash and owners must pick up after them. The section from Bryce to Inspiration is closed in winter.<br /> During shuttle season, hikers may use stops here, at Inspiration, Sunset, and Sunrise to complete one-way hikes. Fairyland Point has no shuttle service.</p> <p> </p> <h2>Nature</h2> <h3>Bristlecone Pines</h3> <p><strong>Note that bristlecone pines share dolomitic limestones with some of the park's most delicate plants. Stay on the trail and help us to protect them.</strong><br /> Though Bryce Canyon is well known for its geology, the park also contains a fantastic diversity of trees. Among the most impressive of these is the Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). These trees are known for thriving where few other plants can, and for far longer too. Look for bristlecone pines on exposures of dolomitic limestone. These areas of white to grey stone are found in the park's hoodoo-forming Claron formation as low as the Queen's Garden and Fairyland Loop trails. Dolomitic limestone is high in calcium and magnesium, and low in phosphorus. This chemistry is difficult for other plants to tolerate, giving the bristlecone pine plenty of room to grow as slowly as it likes. You'll also typically find higher-elevation bristlecones growing at the edges of cliffs, where competition is even further reduced. Free to take its time, bristlecones pines can grow as slowly as an inch (2.5 cm) per century if conditions are challenging. This gives these trees incredibly dense heartwood, which is capable of providing structural support to the tree long after a section of limb or trunk has lost its life-protecting bark. The oldest tree at Bryce Canyon was estimated to be 1,600 years old, though trees across its range into Nevada and California have been dated at over 5,000 years old, giving Pinus longaeva the honor of being the longest living non-clonal species on Earth.<br /> You can identify a Bristlecone pine by its densely bundled needles of five (making it a white pine). Unlike many other pines that shed their needles every few years, bristlecone pines can retain needles for up to forty years. Their 1.5 in (1.2 cm) long needles remain vibrant and green for typically a full 12 inches (30 cm) along the branch. This appearance is often compared to that of a bottlebrush or pipe cleaner.<br /> Like the limber pine (another white pine found at Bryce Canyon) seeds of the bristlecone pine may be harvested and dispersed to unlikely places by Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana). The seeds of their bristle-tipped cones are often among the first to colonize recently burnt areas.</p>",

A photograph along the bottom of the panel shows a view from the Fairyland Loop trail. Two inset photographs demonstrate things to do near here: take the spur trail to the tower bridge formation and discover Boat Mesa, a large flat-topped feature topped with a creamy colored conglomerate. A bronze coin-shaped medallion on the panel signals that One “Hike the Hoodoos” medallion is found along this trail. Find it, then take a photo or rubbing. When you’ve found three different medallions or hiked 3 miles (4.8 km) on trails that have benchmarks (see Visitor Guide) take them to the visitor center for a reward.

The hoodoos (irregularly eroded rock spires) that fill Fairyland Canyon are younger than those further to the south in the main Bryce Amphitheater, and will be developed more fully as the erosional processes associated with the Paria River to the east continue to wear away the land in a north and westward direction. By contrast, immediately to the south is Campbell Canyon, where you can hike through a \"hoodoo graveyard.\" In this region, all the hoodoos have eroded away leaving multicolored clay mounds, which like tombstones, mark their passing. Campbell Canyon can be reached by hiking the Fairyland Loop or Tower Bridge Trail, or overlooked along the Rim Trail.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>The 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Rim Trail connects this view to Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration, and Bryce Points to the south. The most popular section is the 0.5 mile (0.8 km) section between Sunrise and Sunset Points; this section is paved (and therefore permits leashed pets) and has minimal elevation changes. The Fairyland Loop Trail also descends from this viewpoint area.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>Travelling down the trail into Fairyland Canyon a short way will provide views to the northern end of the park, where erosion of the Paunsagunt Plateau associated with the Paria River to the east has been occurring for less time than areas of the park to the south. The area you are looking upon is the northern end of the Paria Valley.<br /> Thrust faulting associated with the volcanic activity that also created the Black Mountains far to the north around 20 million years ago has created diagonal cracks within hoodoos here; if you look closely you may notice some hoodoos with older, Cretaceous-era rocks associated with the Grey Cliffs pushed up on top of hoodoos formed from the Eocene-era Claron Formation or Pink Cliffs. Driving along Highway 12 towards Mossy Cave provides a closer view of the smooth slickenslide surfaces created by these thrust faults.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>Below the iron-oxide colored limey mudstones of the Pink Cliffs of Bryce Canyon, the valley of the Paria river exposes marine shales of the Grey Cliffs. At the point where these two rock types meet, Sinking Ship stands at about 30 degrees, tilted up by the faultline that runs along the eastern edge of the park. This fault, known as the Paunsagunt fault, was created over the last 20 million years by forces associated first with the uplift of this Colorado Plateau region, and later with the extension of Basin and Range faulting to the west in Nevada and California. This fault is a normal fault--bringing the eastern edge of the Paunsagunt Plateau down and away from rocks to the east and to the level of the softer marine Grey Cliffs that form the valley floor in this area. This arrangement is largely responsible for the creation of the amphitheaters along the edge of the plateau, as seasonal streams that run to the Paria River have formed within the Pink Cliffs, rather than far below them. To see what that arrangement would look like, look further east to the colorful Table Cliff plateau standing at 10,000 ft (3048 m) along the opposite side of the valley. This is the same rock layer seen within the park, however it remains at a height unaffected by the movement of the Paunsagunt fault.</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The Paunsagunt Plateau begins to level off in this area, with ponderosa forests found along hills surrounded by meadows of grass and sage. Look for wildlife like pronghorn and mule deer within these meadows. Mountain lions have also been seen, though it's extremely rare.</p> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>To the south is the feature known as Boat Mesa. It capped with a resistant rock called the Conglomerate at Boat Mesa. These conglomerated pebbles and rocks formed in the period after the freshwater lakes that deposited the iron-rich Claron formation that forms the hoodoos below were replaced by large streams carrying water from volcanic mountains building to the north. Boat Mesa rises above the hoodoos of Fairyland Canyon to an elevation of 8073 feet. Beyond it is Campbell Canyon, and beyond that is the Bryce Amphitheater.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Farview Point is appropriately named. Navajo Mountain, 90 miles away on the border of Utah and Arizona, can be seen on all but the worst days. To the east, beyond the Table Cliff plateau, you may be able to see the more pointed peaks of the Henry Mountains, 84 miles away. These magnificent views result from Bryce Canyon's extremely high air quality. While many visitors are awed by the beautiful things they see here, it is what they don't see (the haze and smog produced by particulates in the air) that is one of Bryce Canyon's most valued assets.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>A very short (.15 mi / .24 km) and flat but unpaved trail leads north from the parking lot to Piracy Point.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>See the hoodoos eroded from the edge of the Paunsaugunt plateau. From this point along the plateau you can begin to see the Rainbow Point amphitheater. A forest floor of pine and fir lies 1,000 feet (305 m) below.</p> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>Navajo Mountain looms on the distant horizon over 80 miles (129 km) away near Page, Arizona. Called a laccolith, Navajo Mountain can be thought of as a volcano that never quite happened. As the Colorado Plateau was uplifted over the last 20 million years, a plume of molten rock moved upward from deep inside the Earth causing a swelling much like a large blister. Unlike a volcano, Navajo Mountain never blew its top and so the plume cooled slowly, creating the hard core of the mountain that still exists today.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>The Paria Valley and the upper steps of the Grand Staircase exposed within it present most of the view. Across the valley, the Table Cliff plateau stands at 10,000 feet (3048 m) and is composed of the same Claron formation (or \"Pink Cliffs\") as Bryce Canyon's hoodoos. This difference in elevation is due to the presence of the Paunsaugunt fault--a major normal fault that runs northeast to southwest along the park's eastern boundary. Uplift of the Colorado Plateau over the last 20 million years is responsible for the nearly 2,000 feet (607 m) of elevation difference expressed by this fault. Following the horizon line from the Table Cliff plateau's southernmost tip (known as Powell Point), Canaan Peak is the next prominence to the south. It too is capped with the Claron formation. Further along, the horizon line reveals the top of the Kaiparowits plateau, composed of transitional Cretaceous sandstones of the Grey Cliffs. Down in the valley, the shale-rich badlands of the Grey Cliffs are largely obscured by the pinyon pine and juniper forests that grow readily upon them. Lower down, the Grey Cliffs slowly transform to the sometimes iron-rich sandstones of the upper White Cliffs. Kodachrome State Park is located in this transition zone. Beyond these are deep canyons carved into the sandstones of the White Cliffs, which are also beautifully exposed at Zion National Park further west. Note the feature known as \"Molly's Nipple\", which appears like a conical mountain among the White Cliffs. This is not a dormant volcano, but instead an area capped with a more erosion-resistant form of sandstone.<br /> Almost the same distance to Navajo Mountain in the southeast, the Henry Mountains can be seen on days with good air quality, 86 miles (138 km) away beyond the eastern horizon. Like Navajo Mountain, these too are laccoliths--or plumes of molten rock that warped the rocks above them, but never broke through as a volcano would. As with the terrain of Capitol Reef National Park, which lies just in front of these peaks, millions of years of erosion have now occurred, and at the Henry Mountains it has removed the overlying rock and exposed the hard igneous cores within these mountains.</p> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>Observe the eroded edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, punctuated by bowl-shaped amphitheaters. Atop the Markagunt plateau to the northwest the Tushar Mountains, and atop the Paunsaugunt plateau in the north the Sevier plateau (or Black Mountains) can be seen. These were created through volcanic activity associated with the uplift of the Colorado Plateau.</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The rolling ponderosa forest of the Paunsaugunt plateau is deeply incised here by water travelling north to the Tropic Reservoir. The direction of flow is decided by the plateau's upward tilt to the south and has created a rain divide between the Great Basin of Nevada and the Colorado River that follows the edge of this plateau. This elevation is the transitional zone between Ponderosa Pine Forests and Mixed Conifer forest. Watch for representatives of both plant and animal communities. Here you might find flowers such as Showy Goldeneye and Shrubby Cinquefoil. Also watch for Osprey. If you are surprised to find fish eaters like Osprey living in a desert-like environment you're not the only one. Not too far from here nest a pair of Osprey that catch and carry fish from Tropic Reservoir - a distance of two air miles!</p> <h2>Nature</h2> <h4>California Condors</h4> <p>With a wingspan of 9 to 10 feet, the California condor is the largest land bird in North America. 10,000 years ago, its range was similarly broad--stretching across most of the continent. Much later, as European settlers began to arrive on this continent, you would've found them throughout the west, nesting in cliffs as far south as Baja California, as far north as British Columbia, and in cliffs like those below you. But by 1940, lead bullet poisoning of carrion they fed upon, poaching, DDT contamination, and habitat destruction all led to a collapse of their range to just the coastal mountains of southern California. By 1982 only 23 of these birds survived, and by 1987 all remaining wild condors were relocated into captive breeding programs.<br /> <br /> Captive breeding programs have been successful so far in saving this impressive bird from extinction--in Zion National Park, chick #1,000 was reared in the wild in 2019. Today there are currently almost 100 condors flying free today in northern Arizona and southern Utah thanks to the Southwest Condor Working Group and the actions of hunters voluntarily participating in lead ammunition reduction programs.<br /> <br /> In July of 1999, two condors wearing tags 82 and 93 (large numbers affixed to bird wings for identification and tracking) were spotted perched at overlooks along the southern end of this park. Since then, sightings have been exceedingly rare if they've happened at all. That said, these birds can travel well over 100 miles a day in search of food, so as populations in areas like Zion and Vermilion Cliffs National Monument continue to grow, the chances of seeing one here at Bryce get better and better.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/learn/nature/californiacondor.htm\">Read more online</a></p>",

A panel at the overlook interprets the recovery efforts of the Condor in this area, compares the size of the Condor with other well know birds and to explain that the high plateaus and cliffs of the area are good bird habitat. A close-up photograph of a California Condor perched on a rocky surface fills the scene. It’s large, black feathered body has a naked head and neck a yellowish orange while a ring of black feathers circle the base of the neck like a collar. Text reads: Giants of the Sky The California condor, with a nearly ten-foot wingspan, is the largest land bird in North America.

In July 1999, two condors were spotted in the park. Sightings are rare and impossible to predict, but perhaps one day California condors will nest on these rugged cliffs. Several images on the panel further explain recovery efforts and species comparisons. First two photos of an adult condor in a nest one with a newly laid egg and another the adult hovers over a fluffy chick. Caption reads: Female condors lay one egg every other year. Both parents incubate the egg and care for their offspring. A chick fledges (flies) by six months, but may stay with its parents for 1-2 years. Identification tags help biologists track medical histories and behavioral patterns. Then a Condor soaring in flight compared to the much smaller turkey vulture: Caption reads: Turkey vultures are often mistaken for the much larger California condor. And last silhouette wingspan comparisons of four birds from largest to smallest: California condor up to 9.8 feet (2.8 m) Golden Eagle up to 7.2 feet (2.1 m) Turkey vulture up to 5.8 feet (1.7 m) Raven up to 3.8 feet (1.1 m) Caption reads: A bird’s wingspan is the measurement from wing tip to wing tip.",

Three images from left to right illustrate the cycle of disease in a healthy Douglas fir tree caused by the parasite dwarf mistletoe. First a healthy evergreen, next a tree with visible parasite damage, caption reads: Parasite damage. Witches’ broom, a cluster of branches and twigs, can be a sign of mistletoe infestation, while clear resin flowing down tree bark can indicate the presence of beetles. And last a barren and yellowing tree that has succumbed to the parasite. Caption reads: Parasitic infestations affect the growth, wood quality, seed production, and eventually kill the host tree. Inset images show two types of disease, dwarf mistletoe; a leafless parasitic plant on a pine tree and the trails and tunnels created by bark beetles under the bark of a pine tree. Captions Read: Dwarf mistletoes—small, leafless plants—rely on trees for water, nutrients and support. These parasites weaken and eventually kill their host. Bark beetles, though native, become abundant and destructive pests in unhealthy, fire-suppressed forests. Their larvae bore through the tree’s tissue, creating tunnels which damage the tree.

As World War II ended in 1945, the nation's love of automobile travel begin to outcompete the model of railroad and bus-facilitated tourism that the UPC had been providing in the park since the early 1920s. This change in transportation methods paralleled an increase in visitation. While in 1924, visitation totalled 17,213 people, by 1948 that number had increased to 175,975. Between 1946 and 1949 only 3.28 percent of the park's annual visitation visited the park as UPC passengers. To try and meet the increased demand of these visitors and their automobiles, the Service Station was constructed to provide fuel and full service facilities--paralleling developments in other western parks.<br /> <br /> Although the building was designed by architects under contract to the UPC, the National Park Service (NPS) approved the design. In this period, some NPS architects rejected the \"exaggerated\" rustic style of the 1920s, 30s, and early 40s in favor of building that reflected simpler, contemporary design principles. For this particular building, form defines function. The station is significant as an example of \"roadside architecture\". This style is a distinctly American contribution to the built environment, indicative of a period of service station construction during which buildings were designed to accomodate a full range of services including mechanical repairs. The irregularly shaped, one-story building rests on a concrete foundation. The west elevation, curved wall is constructed of rough cut, regularly coursed stone from a local quarry. <br /> <br /> The Service Station closed in 1988, but is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Future uses for the building are currently being considered.</p> <h2>The Utah Parks Company at Bryce Canyon</h2> <p>The Utah Parks Company (UPC) was a subsidiary of Union Pacific Railroad, which owned and operated restaurants, lodging, and bus tours in Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks, the north rim of Grand Canyon National Park, and Cedar Breaks National Monument from the 1920s until 1972. Before Bryce Canyon became a national park, the Union Pacific Railroad had conceived these parks and monuments as forming a \"Grand Circle\", which would ultimately be visited first by arrival at a rail depot in Lund, Utah (near present day Cedar City) and then by bus to the UPC-owned El Escalante hotel in Cedar City, and then to the parks themselves. To accomodate these visitors, the Utah Parks Company financed the construction of the Bryce Canyon Lodge, numerous cabins and other less permanent accomodations, as well as the Historic Service Station. After the establishment of Bryce Canyon National Park in 1928, UPC would serve as the park's sole concessionaire until competition from private motor vehicles and other operating costs would lead to their liquidiation and donation of all assets within the park to the National Park Service in 1972.<br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Historic Service Station 239 words Historic Service Station The service station is located adjacent to the park road midway between Bryce Canyon Lodge and Sunrise Point. This one-story, irregularly shaped building with five interior rooms and auto repair shop and was designed in a modern style with a wide, flat rooftop that projects out from the main entrance to provide a canopy over the gas pump island. The canopy is held up by two steel posts. The entire front face of the service station has a large expanse of floor to ceiling glass windows with white trim and a sided in pine board paneling and a single overhead sliding garage door that is also entirely made of glass windows. The dominant feature is a coursed sandstone wall that curves around the back of the building. The wall, constructed of rough-cut local sandstone and concrete mortar forms the back of the building and extends out beyond the building walls and rises above the roofline to form a backdrop. Behind the stone wall is a hillslope covered in native Ponderosa pine. Between the road and the service station is an oval shaped island of grasses and a solitary Pondarosa Pine surrounded by a raised stone retaining wall. Two exhibit panels here, across the parking lot, face the service station and describe its history and the impact car travel had on park visitation. The station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995",

    "bodyText": "<p>Along with Bryce Point, Inspiration Point provides a birds-eye view of the world's largest collection of rock spires called \"hoodoos\" found within the Bryce Amphitheater. The viewpoint here consists of three levels that provide varied spectacular perspectives in all directions. The Claron Formation consists of two members, the lower Pink Member, a \"dirty\" limestone that contains sand, silt, and iron that lends the rock its reddish color, and the upper White Member, a purer freshwater limestone. This upper White Member of the Claron Formation is visible below Inspiration Point, although few hoodoos form in this softer rock.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>The 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Rim Trail begins in the south at Bryce Point. From Inspiration Point it is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to Bryce Point. Note this section is closed in Winter. To the north it is 0.7 miles (1.2 km) to Sunset Point. It is 1.2 miles (2.0 km) to Sunrise Point. The section between Sunrise and Sunset Points is paved and has minor elevation changes. The path is wheelchair accessible except in severe weather. This is the only section of the Rim Trail pets are allowed on; all pets must be on leash and owners must pick up after them. It is 3.8 miles (6.1 km) to Fairyland Point. <strong>During shuttle season, hikers may use stops here, at Bryce, Sunset, and Sunrise to complete one-way hikes. Fairyland Point has no shuttle service.</strong></p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>The view to the north looks along the eroded edge of the Paunsaugunt plateau. Dense rows of rock walls known as the Silent City are seen just south of Sunset Point. Following the plateau rim, Sunrise Point tilts upward. Beyond this the head of Campbell Canyon and the flat-topped feature of Boat Mesa. From upper views, one can see beyond the plateau's ponderosa forest and overlook its meadows. Evidence of massive volcanic activity approximately 20 million years ago is seen in the Black Mountains further north atop the plateau and the Tushar Mountains seen even further off to the Northwest.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>Inspiration Point looks down upon Bryce Creek, the main drainage of the Bryce Amphitheater. It is typically a dry wash, only flowing with water during summer rain or melting winter snow. It exits the amphitheater to the right of Bristlecone Point and the left of an unnamed promontory. Both Bristlecone Point and Sinking Ship to its left reveal a tilt associated with the presence of the Paunsaugunt fault line, which displaced this plateau 2,000 feet (610 m) lower than rocks east of these features. This brought the park's limestone layers to be even with soft marine shales seen in the Grey Cliffs that form the basin of the Paria Valley. It also explains the difference in elevation between the colorful Table Cliffs across the valley 13 miles (21 km) distant and the Bryce Amphitheater. Tracing the horizon south, the next prominence is Canaan Peak, which is also crested with the colorful Claron Formation. From here, the Kaiparowits Plateau forms the horizon until it meets with Navajo Mountain, approximately 80 miles (129 km) distant and visible on clear days.</p> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>Views to the south are best appreciated from the uppermost viewpoint. Here one looks toward Bryce Point with the Wall of Windows extending out below. Views from below are possible along the Peekaboo Loop trail, which can be seen emerging from a feature known as the Cathedral below. A forest of moisture-loving Douglas Fir grows and can be enjoyed along the 1.5 mile (2.4 km) stretch of the Rim Trail connecting Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. Note this section is closed in winter due to narrow trails and snow cornices.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A brown wooden sign at this location reads Inspiration Point Elevation 8100 feet. A path runs adjacent to the plateaus edge at the overlook and is enclosed within a horizontal log railing with stone columns. A restroom is at the south end of the parking lot, access to the shared use path is at the north end, and a shuttle stop is found along the east side.<br /><br />The viewpoint at Inspiration Point consists of three overlooks that provide varied perspectives of the main amphitheater, which is an expansive bowl-like feature carved into the edge of this high plateau. The canyon is filled with thousands of irregularly eroded spires of rocks called hoodoos, each pinnacle and its surrounding cliff faces are layered with jagged striations of orange, white, gray and brown stone fading to soft rolling hills of forest in the distant valley. From here, visitors look toward the north to Sunset Point with its many rows of hoodoos and Sunrise Point set against the backdrop of Boat Mesa. <br /><br />A wayside panel at this overlook is titled: Rain Divide.<br />Text reads:<br />Think of these cliffs as a huge storm drain funneling runoff down gullies. The color of water in Bryce creek shows the extent of erosion. <br />Photos show a creek deep within red canyon walls. The creek looks creamy white like milk, full of silt washed in from the rain. Text continues:<br />You are standing on a drainage divide. Precipitation that falls behind you flows toward the great Basin. All rain that falls over the rim in front of you washed into nearby streams including Bryce creek 500 feet below. From there runoff enters the Paria river, the Colorado and eventually the gulf of California. Bryce Creek is usually dry after a storm. Listen to water or snow melt trickle down slope from far below hear the faint roar of muddy water in Bryce Creek as it washes toward the Pacific. <br /><br />A cross section diagram showing the elevations of this plateau and a map of the western united states that highlights the location of the Great Basin desert and our location at Bryce canyon further illustrate the drainage divide. The map shows the outline of the Great Basin desert overlaid on a map of the western United States. The Great Basin desert is located to the west of the park, spanning the western edge of Utah, all of Nevada, the eastern edge of California and reaching up into southern Oregon and Idaho. <br /><br />Text reads: From the East fork of the Sevier River, atop this plateau, the runoff flows North and then West into the vast desert of the Great Basin streams there have no outlet to the sea.",

    "audioDescription": "Sunrise Point overlooks the Bryce Amphitheater, a large bowl-like feature carved into the eastern rim of the plateau by the head waters of Bryce Creek. Ponderosa pine line the rim of the canyon here. To the northeast is Boat Mesa and the Sinking Ship formation set against the stark Pink Cliffs of the Table Cliff Plateau. Below the plateau’s rim, a mass of orange hoodoos and stonewalls are capped with a thick layer of resistant white limestone. Panel title: The Life of Hoodoos Four diagrams across the panel illustrate how hoodoos form. Beginning with the past: a smooth un-weathered high plateau to the present day formation of windows through the rock caused by erosion and freezing and thawing of water. When the connecting arch above the hole or window in the rocks erodes each creates an individual rock spire called a hoodoo. The last diagram demonstrates a completely eroded series of rounded hills, what the hoodoos might look like in the future as weathering processes continue. Captions read: Rain and melting snow erode the edge of this high plateau at a rate of one to four feet every century. As the rim erodes, harder caprock layers preserve softer rocks below, forming rock walls called fins. Then Here at 8,000 feet, nightly temperatures fall below freezing half of the year. Snowmelt and rain trickle into cracks and expand as it turns to ice, fracturing the rock, and forming holes called windows. This process is called \"frost wedging.\" Chemical weathering also occurs as acids in precipitation dissolve the calcium carbonate that holds the rocks together. Next As windows expand, the caprock collapses creating irregular rock spires called hoodoos. Bryce Canyon has the greatest concentration of hoodoos on Earth. Last Once hoodoos are separated, weathering and erosion accelerate, ultimately wearing them down. The rounded hills to the east show where the high plateau rim once existed. At the far edge of the overlook stands one small, lone Limber Pine tree. It clings to the very edge of the eroding cliff, its tangled roots are exposed above ground and curve like legs as if it is standing or walking. A photo of this limber pine is featured on the panel. Caption reads: Exposed roots of trees, like those of the limber pine beside you, illustrate the rate of erosion along the plateau rim. Text continues: Currently the climate here provides a perfect balance of freezing and thawing temperatures to create hoodoos.

    "bodyText": "<p>Mossy Cave is in the northern section of the park, located on Highway 12, approximately 4 miles east of the intersection of Highways 12 and 63. Look for a small parking area on the right-hand side immediately after crossing a little bridge. The Mossy Cave itself is at the end of a short trail. Here too you can see hoodoos and windows without having to hike a steep trail.</p> <p>At first, this canyon known as Water Canyon, might look like any ordinary Bryce Canyon kind of canyon. It's not. From 1890-1892 mormon pioneers labored with picks and shovels to carve an irrigation ditch from the East Fork of the Sevier River, through the Paunsaugunt Plateau, into this canyon.</p> <p>Every year since its completion in 1892 (except during the drought of 2002), this canal known as the Tropic Ditch has supplied the communities of Tropic and Cannonville with irrigation water.</p> <h4><strong>Geology</strong></h4> <p>By definition Bryce Canyon is misnamed, it is not a real \"canyon\". Canyons are carved by flowing water. Most of the \"canyons\" of Bryce are carved by ice forming in cracks - a process known as frost wedging. Even though the Tropic Ditch has been flowing for only a century it has changed the geology of Water Canyon. As you hike up the Mossy Cave Trail, notice how the higher elevations of this \"canyon\" have the lumpy, broken, and random texture typical of Bryce Canyon and its hoodoos. You will also see how the lower section is without hoodoos, and has smooth angled sides looking like a 'V' in cross-section. Because of this little water course, it is unlikely that hoodoos will form here. The existing ones will eventually crumble and Water Canyon will have completed its metamorphosis into a \"real canyon.\"</p> <h4><strong>Nature</strong></h4> <p>The presence of water alone is what makes Water Canyon unique. Although you might not see them (animals tend to avoid busy trails - especially in daylight hours), a wide diversity of animals come here regularly to quench their thirst. The supply of water is still recent enough that nature hasn't quite caught up yet. Eventually more riparian trees like willows and cottonwoods will probably grow here. In the meantime you'll be surprised to see some plants that you might expect to find along a brook in a mountain meadow, such as Mountain Death Camas and Watson Bog Orchid.</p> <h4><strong>Trails</strong></h4> <p>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/mossy-cave-trail.htm\">Mossy Cave Trail</a> page for more information.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A panel titled Mossy Cave Trail displays a map of the trail to mossy cave and waterfall. A “you are here” marker shows our location at the trailhead parking lot right off Hwy 12. Two bridges cross over Tropic Ditch along the trail. The trail forks near the end, access to the waterfall to the right and mossy cave to the left. There are two wayside exhibits along the trail, one just after the first bridge and one at Mossy Cave. Map Caption reads: This 0.4 mile trail to mossy cave is a gradual ascent with some short, steep sections. Pace yourself; Allow for the thinner air at this elevation. Caution Avoid damage to fragile cave formations. A photograph below the map shows a small waterfall flowing into a narrow muddy stream: tropic ditch. Text reads: Follow the stream bank to the fork in the trail the left path leads to mossy cave, where ice draperies often last until summer and delicate Moss grows year-round. The right-hand spur reaches a low waterfall dramatic after a storm or spring snowmelt. Along the trail there are views of Bryce Canyon hoodoos, eroded red pinnacles period look for “windows” weather through the thin rock walls.",

A metal disk is mounted to the panel. Words have been etched into the metal: Bryce Canyon National Park mossy cave I hiked the hoodoos elevation 6941 feet above sea level. Below the benchmark medallion text reads: This project was made possible in part by a grant from the National Park foundation through the generous support of the Coca Cola foundation. Two photographs along the right side of the panel show the two types of water features found along the trail; a waterfall and a natural spring. Text reads: The trail splits here with each side leading to water that is crucial for life in a dry land. To the left, a natural spring seeps from a rocky Cliff, watering plants as it has for untold time. To the right, water Canyon is fed by the tropic ditch an irrigation canal dug by Mormon pioneers in the late 1800s. Historically, this washed flowed only during periods of melting snow or heavy rain today, irrigation water flows May to October, bringing life to Valley crops and orchards.",

    "audioDescription": "Two upright panels are here near the parking lot; the first is the orientation to Bryce Canyon with full park map. The second provides details about our location here at Mossy Cave. A “you are here” marker shows our location at the trailhead parking lot right off Hwy 12. This panel displays a map of the trail to Mossy Cave and waterfall. Trail Length: 0.8-mile (1.3 km) roundtrip. Difficulty: Easy. Two bridges cross over Tropic Ditch along the trail. The trail forks near the end, to the right access to the waterfall and to the left Mossy Cave. Two photographs to the left of the map show a family of hikers approaching Mossy Cave and a small waterfall flowing into a narrow muddy stream known as Tropic Ditch. Captions read: Look for the waterfall along Mossy Cave Trail. Follow the short trail to a small, shaded cave. Along the trail there are four wayside exhibits that describe the Pinyon/Juniper Life zone, how water was brought to the desert and how Mossy Cave was formed, along with three botanical markers that highlight the Pinyon pine, Utah Juniper and the Gambel Oak trees, A “Hike the Hoodoos” medallion can be found just after the first bridge. A photograph on the bottom half of the panel shows a woman with a child in a backpack on her back, she is holding the hand of another child as they walk toward a bridge along the trail to Mossy Cave Trees and shrubs line the trail where there are views of eroded red pinnacles of rock known as Bryce Canyon hoodoos.

Know Before You Go ● Stay on the designated trail. ● Watch for seasonally fast-moving water. ● This is challenging environment for plants. Stay on the trail and leave them for all to enjoy. An image of a bronze colored, coin-like medallion is displayed. Caption reads: One “Hike the Hoodoos” medallion is found along this trail. Find it, then take a photo or rubbing. When you’ve found three different medallions or hiked 3 miles (4.8 km) on trails that have benchmarks (see Visitor Guide) take them to the visitor center for a reward. A color photograph shows hikers walking along the switch backs on the Navajo Loop trail near Sunset Point. Massive, curving, jagged orange and red rock spires surround them. A detailed map of the park runs along the right side of the panel and illustrates overlooks, shuttle stops, picnic areas, and camping and hiking opportunities. Panel content describes backcountry rules, safety, trails and campsites in the vicinity.

Caption reads: Visit one of many beautiful views along the 18-mile scenic drive to Rainbow Point. 002 Pinyon /Juniper Life Zone The first exhibit before the bridge along the trail to Mossy Cave highlights the Pinyon /Juniper Life Zone A relief map of the park marks our location at 6000 ft elevation where this Pinyon /Juniper life zone is possible. The map also marks the next two life zones that occur at higher elevations: Ponderosa Pine life zone at 8000ft and then the Mixed Conifer life zone at 8,500ft. A background photograph shows a cluster of shrubs and trees you may find along the trail that illustrate the diversity of species found here: Juniper, Ponderosa pine, Greenleaf manzanita, gambel oak and Pinyon Pine with its buff colored cones and the spikey narrowleaf yucca. Animals are featured that include a Uinta chipmunk, Greater short-horned lizard and a Pinyon Jay with a special note not to feed the animals. Text continues: Bryce Canyon’s elevation ranges 2,500 feet (762 m) from Rainbow Point to the canyon bottoms, creating a wide range of temperatures and precipitation resulting in three climatic or life zones—Pinyon/Juniper, Ponderosa Pine, Mixed Conifer. More than a thousand plant species inhabit the park, while dozens of animals, including over 100 species of birds, move throughout these zones. The Mossy Cave Trail winds through a through a forest community defined by pinyon pine and juniper. Look for short evergreen trees and a variety of desert and upland shrubs. Springs and irrigation water found here also create refuges for more water-dependent plants.",

The panel features a photograph of a wintertime display of ice buildup in the form of icicles under this rocky overhang that creates a shaded, cave like alcove. Three diagrams show the geologic process of the formation of Mossy Cave. The first gives an idea of what this landscape might have looked like before any erosion began; a layered reddish rock of silt, mud and softer limestones is capped with a hard and porous limestone layer. The next diagram shows acidic groundwater seeping down through the surface porous layers to erode the softer layers beneath. Over time this process of erosion and freezing and thawing brings us to the last diagram which shows the current appearance of this formation at Mossy Cave: a cave-like eroded alcove or grotto, protected by a rocky overhang.

A more weathering-resistant layer of rock protects the softer rocks below from more rapid erosion, while ice, rain, and wind slowly open the arch wider and wider.<br /> As the edge of the plateau has eroded back, a small gully has formed that flows with rain and melting snow (now more than 125 feet below the arch). Undoubtedly some day the top of the arch will collapse, leaving behind new hoodoos on either side.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>No trails depart from this area.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>View the eroded and forested edge of the Paunsagunt Plateau, carved by rain and melting snow into bowl-shaped amphitheaters.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>Here the iron-oxide colored limey mudstones of the Pink Cliffs of Bryce Canyon are being weathered and eroded by rain and melting snow to form a bowl-shaped amphitheater separated from amphitheaters to the north and south. Within this amphitheater, Natural Bridge is being formed by the same process as all hoodoos: walls or fins are formed by the presence of harder, more erosion resistant cap layers as the plateau rim erodes backwards through the action of rain and melting snow. Windows then form as rain and melting snow trickle into cracks within these fins. Overnight freezing temperatures cause this water to expand as it turns to ice, breaking the rock apart from within and creating windows--of which Natural Bridge is a very large example. Eventually, the caprock will collapse, leaving behind rock spires on either side of the window known as \"hoodoos\".</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The rolling ponderosa forest of the Paunsaugunt plateau is deeply incised here by water travelling north to the Tropic Reservoir. The direction of flow is decided by the plateau's upward tilt to the south and has created a rain divide between the Great Basin of Nevada and the Colorado River that follows the edge of this plateau.</p> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>View the eroded and forested edge of the Paunsagunt Plateau, carved by rain and melting snow into bowl-shaped amphitheaters.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Here at the Natural Bridge viewing area a panel explains through a progression diagram how arches are formed. Natural Bridge, one of several arches in Bryce Canyon, is a brilliant reddish orange formation that spans more than 125 feet above a washout gully. The narrow gully descends steeply down from the rim of the plateau through the tight, horseshoe shaped arch. The reddish stone arch acts as a window, framing the deep green of the Ponderosa pine forest in the canyon below. A series of four diagrams on the panel show how a natural bridge, or arch, was created, and what it may look like in the future if the same processes continue. Text Reads: Natural Bridge This \"bridge\" is technically an arch. Natural bridges are carved by rushing streams, but here, subtler forces of frost-wedging, chemical weathering, and gravity are at work. Today, the arch spans 85 feet (26 m) and appears solid and enduring, but weather is constantly chipping away at the opening. It may last hundreds or thousands of years, or it could collapse tomorrow. The first illustration shows a narrow strip of rock wall or “fin” jutting out from the edge of the plateau. Caption Reads: The forces of freezing and thawing water (frost-wedging), combined with gravity, and slightly-acidic rain (chemical weathering) eroded the rock from within and without. The next illustration shows a small arched hole opening forming at the base of the rock wall. Caption Reads: Hollows may have developed on both sides of the wall, gradually deepening, until they eroded through. The gully below did not form the arch, but it did deepen the opening. The third illustration shows the arch widening and spanning higher up near the top of the wall, creating a bridge like appearance. Caption Reads: The rich coloring of the arch’s limestone comes from iron oxides deposited millions of years ago. The grey caprock above— a harder dolomitic limestone—erodes more slowly than the softer rocks beneath. The final illustration shows the eventual collapse of the Natural Bridge archway, the top of the arch has collapsed into the canyon, only the two hoodoo pillars on either side of the span remain standing. Caption Reads: The harder caprock will one day succumb to gravity and fall. The park will have one less arch, but a new, towering hoodoo will take its place.",

The loop has two sides, the Two Bridges side and the Wall Street side.<br /> The Two Bridges side is open year-round, however the Wall Street side is closed in months when precipitation combines with freezing overnight temperatures. <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/navajotrail.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h2>Combination Loops</h2> <p>This trail can be combined with the Queen's Garden to form the 2.9 mile (4.6 km) <strong>Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop</strong> and the Peekaboo Loop to form the 6.4 mile (10.2 km) <strong>Figure-8 Combination Loop</strong>.</p> <h3>Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Moderate<br /> Total Distance: 2.9 miles (4.6 km)<br /> Elevation change: 600 feet (138 m)<br /> Average time: 2-3 hours</strong><br /> <br /> Perhaps the park's most popular and iconic trail, the Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop can begin at either Sunrise or Sunset Point but is recommended in a clockwise direction; this is done by descending on the Queen's Garden Trail and ascending the Navajo Loop Trail (Two Bridges side recommended for year-round use and iconic views of Thor's Hammer; Wall Street side is only open in summer). Whether one begins at Sunset or Sunrise Point, these two viewpoints are connected by a flat, 0.5 mile (0.8 km) section of the Rim Trail that completes the loop. If one begins at Sunset Point, they should begin by hiking this section of the Rim Trail to Sunrise Point.<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/qgnavajocombo.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h3>Navajo / Peekaboo Combination Loop</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Strenuous<br /> Total Distance: 4.9 miles (7.8 km)<br /> Elevation change: 1581 feet (482 m)<br /> Average time: 3-4 hours</strong><br /> <br /> Like the Figure-8 Combination below, this hike combines two loops into one longer hike. This combination begins at Sunset Point with a descent of the Navajo Loop trail. It is recommended to descend along the Wall Street side of the loop (Wall Street side closes in winter, in which case one should use the Two Bridges side to descend and return). After reaching the bottom of the Navajo Loop a short connecting trail leads from here across Bryce Creek to the Peekaboo Loop Trail. Keeping left will take hikers in a clockwise direction around the strenuous Peekaboo Loop and return them to the intersection of Navajo and Queen's Garden Trails. From here hikers ascend back up to Sunset Point (Two Bridges side recommended for year-round use).</p> <h3>Figure-8 Combination Loop</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Strenuous<br /> Total Distance: 6.4 miles (10.2 km)<br /> Elevation change: 320 feet (98 m)<br /> Average time: 4-5 hours</strong><br /> <br /> The Figure-8 Combination combines the Peekaboo Loop Trail with the Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop to create a 6.4 mile (10.2 km) combination of two loops. Like the Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop, the Peekaboo Loop should be hiked in a clockwise direction. One can begin at either Sunset or Sunrise Point. From Sunset Point, one would begin by first hiking the 0.5 mile (0.8 km) section of the Rim Trail that leads north to Sunrise Point, then descend the Queen's Garden Trail to its intersection with the Navajo Loop. A short connecting trail leads from here across Bryce Creek to the Peekaboo Loop Trail. Keeping left will take hikers in a clockwise direction around the strenuous Peekaboo Loop and return them to the intersection of Navajo and Queen's Garden Trails. From here hikers ascend back up to Sunset Point (Two Bridges side recommended for year-round use; Wall Street only open in summer).</p> <h2>I Hiked the Hoodoos</h2> <p>Hiking is great exercise and Bryce Canyon's \"I Hiked the Hoodoos!\" program is not just hiking, it's also a scavenger hunt with a special reward!<br /> <br /> <strong>1. Hike a minimum of 3 mi / 4.8 km, or find at least 3 benchmarks and complete steps 2 through 4 below.<br /> <br /> 2. Each individual must have either a pencil rubbing of the benchmark (see Jr. Ranger Book) or a\"selfie\"with the benchmark.<br /> <br /> 3. Only special \"I Hiked the Hoodoos\" benchmarks qualify for the reward.<br /> <br /> 4. Rewards are available at the Visitor Center!</strong><br /> <br /> See your park newspaper or Junior Ranger book for more information. Benchmarks are located on Mossy Cave, Rim Trail, Tower Bridge, Queen's Garden, Navajo Loop, Peekaboo Loop, Sheep Creek, and the Bristlecone Loop trails.</p>",

Yellow Creek's erosion of the Grey Cliffs' softer marine layers directly below you currently undercuts the Pink Cliffs of Bryce Canyon, resulting in large slabs falling away at once. The sheer cliffs created by this undercutting characterize almost all viewpoints south of here. The southern end of the Paria Valley is easier seen here at at viewpoints further south than from the Bryce Amphitheater, and distant views of the dramatic White Cliffs and the dome of Navajo Mountain are wonderful at sunset.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>A short paved path leads to a promontory viewpoint. No other trails depart from this area.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>The headwaters of Yellow Creek have been at work for millions of years, slowly pushing back into the Paunsaugunt plateau and carving the deep amphitheater below you. Due to softer marine layers of rock below the iron-rich Claron formation's limestone cliffs, these rocks are being undercut and sheer away rather than slope in the ways seen within the Bryce Amphitheater to the north. Yellow Creek drains into the Paria River, and the Paria Valley and the upper steps of the Grand Staircase exposed within it present most of the view beyond this amphitheater. Observe the shale-rich badlands of the Grey Cliffs slowly transform to the sometimes iron-rich sandstones of the upper White Cliffs (Kodachrome State Park is located in this transition zone) which then transition into the less iron-rich white sandstones and deep canyons carved within the Navajo Formation further off. Navajo Mountain looms on the distant horizon over 80 miles (129 km) away near Page, Arizona. Called a laccolith, Navajo Mountain can be thought of as a volcano that never quite happened. As the Colorado Plateau was uplifted over the last 20 million years, a plume of molten rock moved upward from deep inside the Earth causing a swelling much like a large blister. Unlike a volcano, Navajo Mountain never blew its top and so the plume cooled slowly, creating the hard core of the mountain that still exists today.</p>",

Exhibit title: Hike the Hoodoos, Peekaboo Loop, promotes the parks Hike the Hoodoos challenge. There are nine \"Hike the Hoodoos\" benchmarks located along eight different hiking trails in the park. Each exhibit has a large round coin-like metal, medallion called a benchmark inserted into the panel. The right side of the panel illustrates a natural feature found at the location. Here a close-up photograph of a ponderosa pine tree. Its trunk and limbs twist along the orange rock of the canyon. Dark reddish-brown bark is deeply furrowed. Text reads: Why do some of the ponderosa pine trees along this trail twist like coils of rope? While the answer is not certain, the trees might be aiming to stay upright on a slumping slope, or they could be growing faster on one side to compensate for roots that have died on the other period what is your theory about the trees shape? The left side of each panel provides a trail map with current location, the benchmark and a description of the hoodoo challenge: This map shows our location in between inspiration point and sunset point on the Peekaboo loop trail. Text reads: You have found the Peekaboo Loop benchmark (metal disk below) on the “I hiked the hoodoos” challenge -- a way to stay healthy and have fun in your National Park. To meet the challenge: either find 3 benchmarks, or hike 3 miles on trails that have benchmarks see map and park newspaper or junior Ranger booklet bring rubbings of the benchmarks or photos of yourself with them to the visitor center to receive a small reward. The coin-shaped metal benchmark is mounted to the panel. Words have been etched into the metal: Bryce Canyon National Park Peek a Boo I hiked the hoodoos elevation 7682 feet above sea level.

The trail takes its name from the surprises that await around its many turns and elevation changes. In summer, these surprises may include horse and mule riders, which is why a clockwise direction of travel is recommended. This direction also provides for the best views of the Wall of Windows, one of the most iconic features along this strenuous trail.

At the turnaround point, balanced-rock hoodoos cluster along the trail's edge. These narrow, orange pinnacles wear \"hats\" of large grey boulders, giving them a distinct appearance compared to hoodoos seen in the Bryce Amphitheater to the north.

The Under the Rim Trail follows the base of the Paunsaugant Plateau and is largely forested. The hoodoos are part of the distant vistas to the west as you hike the valley floor. To preserve this experience, backcountry camping is permitted only in designated campsites. A backcountry permit must be obtained at the Visitor Center prior to any overnight trips.

    "audioDescription": "From Bryce Point is one of the most scenic vistas of the main Bryce amphitheater. Visitors stand on a narrow fin of rock facing out into the amphitheater, which is an expansive bowl-like feature carved into the edge of the high plateau. The canyon is filled with thousands of irregularly eroded spires of rocks called hoodoos. Each spire and cliff face continues layered striations of orange, white, gray, and brown fading to soft rolling hills of forest in the distant valley. Two trailhead Orientation panels and one interpretive panel are here at Bryce Point; The Rim Trail and the Peekaboo and Hat Shop Trail access are at this location, one of the most iconic of the park’s viewpoints. First, at the parking area at the entrance to the trailhead is the orientation to the Peekaboo and Hat Shop Trails. A map illustrates that we are at the Bryce Point overlook. A graphic provides details about each trail: Length: Peekaboo is 5.5 miles (8.8 km) Difficulty: Strenuous Total Ascent: 1,571 feet (479 meters) Hat Shop is 4.0 miles (6.4 km) roundtrip Difficulty: Strenuous Total Ascent: 1,075 feet (328 m) A photograph along the bottom of the panel highlights the Wall of windows; a series of lightly colored hoodoos and sandstone arches or windows in the rock spires found along Peekaboo Trail. An inset photographs shows a sampling of the Hat Shop hoodoos. This collection of hoodoos have delicately balanced caprocks on their tops which resemble hats. A bronze coin-shaped medallion on the panel signals that Two “Hike the Hoodoos” medallions are found along this trail. Find them, then take a photo or rubbing. When you’ve found three different medallions or hiked 3 miles (4.8 km) on trails that have benchmarks (see Visitor Guide) take them to the visitor center for a reward.

This point overlooks Swamp Canyon and the Sheep Creek drainage system to the north and the Willis Creek drainage system that collects run-off south from here. The broad, sloping valley to the north of you currently drains to Sheep Creek, but on the other side of the cliffs right of it, tributaries of Willis Creek are steadily encroaching. Someday soon, the Willis Creek drainage will begin to divert water through a process called \"stream piracy\". This is when a river drainage system or watershed is diverted from its own bed, and flows instead down the bed of a neighboring stream. Swamp Canyon is also one of the only places in the park where water flowing on top of the plateau is diverted over the rim to the east (rather than travelling west as part of the Sevier River).<br /> <br /> This is also the transitional zone between Ponderosa Pine Forests and the Spruce-Fir forest. Watch for representatives of both plant and animal communities. Here you might find flowers such as Showy Goldeneye and Shrubby Cinquefoil. Also watch for Osprey. If you are surprised to find fish eaters like Osprey living in a desert-like environment you're not the only one.

    "bodyText": "<p>Ponderosa Canyon is so named because of the huge Ponderosa Pines on the canyon floor. Some of these trees measure more than 5 ft. in diameter and exceed heights of 150 ft. However from high above at the viewpoint you would never know this. In fact many are confused by the name, not expecting to find themselves surrounded by a forest of Engelmann spruce and Douglas-fir. Certain types of vegetation grow in certain environments according to conditions such as moisture and temperature. These conditions are strongly controlled by elevation. Forests, therefore, are divided into zones or forest types according to elevation, because a forest's dominant tree species varies with these changes in elevation.<br /> <br /> Bryce Canyon National Park encompasses three of these forest types from the lowest elevations below the rim of the canyon to the upper elevations in the southernmost end of the park. At the bottom is the Pinyon-Juniper Woodland Belt, dominated by the Pinyon Pine and the Utah Juniper. The rim of the canyon in the northern end of the park is dominated by the Ponderosa Pine, and is thus classified as the Ponderosa Pine Forest. At the highest elevations, like here at Ponderosa Point, Engelmann Spruce, Douglas-fir and White Fir are the most common tree species, indicative of a Mixed Conifer Forest.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p><strong><span style=\"color:#e74c3c;\">Trail Closed due to Rockfall</span></strong><br /> From here, the Agua Connector Trail descends 1.6 miles (4.0 km) to its junction with the Under the Rim Trail approximately 1,000 feet (305 m) below.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>See the hoodoos eroded from the edge of the Paunsaugunt plateau contained within a bowl-shaped amphitheater shared with Rainbow Point. A forest floor of pine and fir lies 1,000 feet (305 m) below.</p> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>Navajo Mountain looms on the distant horizon over 80 miles (129 km) away near Page, Arizona. Called a laccolith, Navajo Mountain can be thought of as a volcano that never quite happened. As the Colorado Plateau was uplifted over the last 20 million years, a plume of molten rock moved upward from deep inside the Earth causing a swelling much like a large blister. Unlike a volcano, Navajo Mountain never blew its top and so the plume cooled slowly, creating the hard core of the mountain that still exists today.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>The Paria Valley and the upper steps of the Grand Staircase exposed within it present most of the view. Across the valley, the Table Cliff plateau stands at 10,000 feet (3048 m) and is composed of the same Claron formation (or \"Pink Cliffs\") as Bryce Canyon's hoodoos. This difference in elevation is due to the presence of the Paunsaugunt fault--a major normal fault that runs northeast to southwest along the park's eastern boundary. Uplift of the Colorado Plateau over the last 20 million years is responsible for the nearly 2,000 feet (607 m) of elevation difference expressed by this fault. Below these Pink Cliffs, observe the shale-rich badlands of the Grey Cliffs slowly transform to the sometimes iron-rich sandstones of the upper White Cliffs. Kodachrome State Park is located in this transition zone.<br /> Almost the same distance to Navajo Mountain in the southeast, the Henry Mountains can be seen on days with good air quality, 86 miles (138 km) away beyond the eastern horizon. Like Navajo Mountain, these too are laccoliths--or plumes of molten rock that warped the rocks above them, but never broke through as a volcano would. As with the terrain of Capitol Reef National Park, which lies just in front of these peaks, millions of years of erosion have now occurred, and at the Henry Mountains it has removed the overlying rock and exposed the hard igneous cores within these mountains.</p> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>Observe the eroded edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, punctuated by bowl-shaped amphitheaters.</p> <h4>To the West</h4> <p>The rolling ponderosa forest of the Paunsaugunt plateau is deeply incised here by water travelling north to the Tropic Reservoir. The direction of flow is decided by the plateau's upward tilt to the south and has created a rain divide between the Great Basin of Nevada and the Colorado River that follows the edge of this plateau.</p> <h2>Backcountry Hiking and Camping</h2> <p>The Under-the-Rim Trail is approximately 22.9 miles (36.9 km) from Bryce Point to Rainbow Point. Connecting trails offer access from the park's Scenic Drive and intersect the Under-the-Rim Trail at Swamp Canyon, and Whiteman Bench. Agua Canyon Connector Trail **is closed** until further notice due to storm damage.<br /> <br /> The Riggs Spring Loop is an 8.6 mile (13.9 km) hike beginning and ending at the Rainbow and Yovimpa Point parking lot at the south end of the Scenic Drive. Either the Yovimpa or Rainbow Point trailhead may be used to access this loop.<br /> <br /> A backcountry hiking map with mileage is available at the Visitor Center. <a href=\"https://nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/backcountryinfo.htm\">More information</a></p> <h4>Permits Required</h4> <p>A Backcountry Permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry. Permits may be purchased at the Visitor Center from 9 am - 12:30 pm and 1:30 pm to 6 pm. Backcountry campsites are limited to 6 people per regular site, and 15 people per group site.</p> <h4>No Fires Permitted</h4> <p>Though gas-powered cooking stoves are allowed, no open fires are allowed anywhere in the park outside of North and Sunset Campground's established fire rings.</p> <h4>Bears and Other Wildlife</h4> <p>Bryce Canyon is home to many animals including mountain lions, coyotes and black bears. Squirrels, snakes and other small animals may also be present near your campsite.<br /> Due to the presence of black bears within Bryce Canyon National Park, the use of bear-resistant food canisters on overnight backcountry hikes is highly recommended. Bear-resistant canisters are available for loan, free of charge, at the Visitor Center.</p> <h4>Transportation</h4> <p>No park-provided transportation is provided south of Bryce Point. You can arrange a private shuttle using approved providers listed on our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/commercial-tours-and-services.htm\">Commercial Tours and Services</a> page.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "The exhibit panel is along a short spur trail at the end of the Queen's Garden Trail in a flat area of natural sediment among many tall hoodoos, described as the Queen's Garden. To the north is a unique hoodoo said to resemble Queen Victoria. The exhibit: Hike the Hoodoos, Queens Garden, promotes the parks Hike the Hoodoos challenge. There are nine \"Hike the Hoodoos\" benchmarks located along eight different hiking trails in the park. Each exhibit has a large round coin-like metal, medallion called a benchmark inserted into the panel. The right side of the panel illustrates a natural feature found at the location. Here a photograph of the hoodoo that has been named Queen Victoria, after a statue in London, England. A photo of the actual statue of the queen is beside the hoodoo for comparison. The statue of the standing queen, facing left with hands crossed at her waste, in a long flowing dress is beside a photo of the queen Victoria hoodoo rock formation that bears a strong resemblance to the outline of the statue. Text reads: At Bryce Canyon, weathering can alter huge rocks within a human lifetime. Rain and Frost wedging carved these stones into curious shapes including the Queen Victoria who do, which was named for a statue in London, England. If you use your imagination, you might see the hoodoo queen riding an animal. What kind? How many years do you think it will take the Queens shape to change? The left side of each panel provides a trail map with your location, the benchmark and describes the hoodoo challenge: The map shows our location in between Sunrise and Sunset Point on the Queens garden trail. Text reads: You have found the Queens garden benchmark (metal disk below) on the “I hiked the hoodoos” challenge -- a way to stay healthy and have fun in your National Park. To meet the challenge: either find 3 benchmarks, or hike 3 miles on trails that have benchmarks see map and park newspaper or junior Ranger booklet bring rubbings of the benchmarks or photos of yourself with them to the visitor center to receive a small reward. The coin-shaped metal benchmark is mounted to the panel. Words have been etched into the metal: Bryce Canyon National Park Queen Victoria I hiked the hoodoos elevation 7635 feet above sea level. This project was made possible in part by a grant from the National Park foundation through the generous support of the Coca Cola foundation.",

    "bodyText": "<h3>Queen's Garden Trail</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Moderate<br /> Total Distance: 1.8 miles (3.0 km)<br /> Elevation change: 320 feet (98 m)<br /> Average time: 1-2 hours</strong><br /> <br /> One of the park's most popular trails, the Queen's Garden trail descends and bends 0.9 miles (1.4 km) along a ridgeline down to a unique hoodoo said to resemble Queen Victoria (be sure to travel down the spur trail at the bottom of the trail to see this hoodoo). The varied and colorful rock formations that surround this hoodoo, are described as many sculptures and other ornaments within the Queen's \"Garden\". Of the six trails that descend into the Bryce Amphitheater, the Queen's Garden Trail is considered the least strenuous; though due to the park's high elevation and steep grades in some areas, it is still categorized as a moderately strenuous hike (other Bryce Amphitheater trails include the Tower Bridge Trail, Navajo Loop Trail, Fairyland Loop Trail, Tower Bridge Trail, and Peekaboo Loop Trail). The trail also provides views of a grove of bristlecone pines near the Horse Trail junction.<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/queensgarden.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h2>Combination Loops</h2> <p>This trail can be combined with the Navajo Loop to form the 2.9 mile (4.6 km) <strong>Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop</strong> and the Peekaboo Loop to form the 6.4 mile (10.2 km) <strong>Figure-8 Combination Loop</strong>.</p> <h3>Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Moderate<br /> Total Distance: 2.9 miles (4.6 km)<br /> Elevation change: 600 feet (138 m)<br /> Average time: 2-3 hours</strong><br /> Perhaps the park's most popular and iconic trail, the Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop can begin at either Sunrise or Sunset Point but is recommended in a clockwise direction; this is done by descending on the Queen's Garden Trail and ascending the Navajo Loop Trail (Two Bridges side recommended for year-round use and iconic views of Thor's Hammer; Wall Street side is only open in summer). Whether one begins at Sunset or Sunrise Point, these two viewpoints are connected by a flat, 0.5 mile (0.8 km) section of the Rim Trail that completes the loop. If one begins at Sunset Point, they should begin by hiking this section of the Rim Trail to Sunrise Point.<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/qgnavajocombo.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h3>Figure-8 Combination Loop</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Strenuous<br /> Total Distance: 6.4 miles (10.2 km)<br /> Elevation change: 320 feet (98 m)<br /> Average time: 4-5 hours</strong><br /> The Figure-8 Combination combines the Peekaboo Loop Trail with the Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop to create a 6.4 mile (10.2 km) combination of two loops. Like the Queen's / Navajo Combination Loop, the Peekaboo Loop should be hiked in a clockwise direction. One can begin at either Sunset or Sunrise Point. From Sunset Point, one would begin by first hiking the 0.5 mile (0.8 km) section of the Rim Trail that leads north to Sunrise Point, then descend the Queen's Garden Trail to its intersection with the Navajo Loop. A short connecting trail leads from here across Bryce Creek to the Peekaboo Loop Trail. Keeping left will take hikers in a clockwise direction around the strenuous Peekaboo Loop and return them to the intersection of Navajo and Queen's Garden Trails. From here hikers ascend back up to Sunset Point (Two Bridges side recommended for year-round use; Wall Street only open in summer).</p> <h2>Nature</h2> <h3>Bristlecone Pines</h3> <p><strong>Note that bristlecone pines share dolomitic limestones with some of the park's most delicate plants. Stay on the trail and help us to protect them.</strong><br /> Though Bryce Canyon is well known for its geology, the park also contains a fantastic diversity of trees. Among the most impressive of these is the Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). These trees are known for thriving where few other plants can, and for far longer too. Look for bristlecone pines on exposures of dolomitic limestone. These areas of white to grey stone are found in the park's hoodoo-forming Claron formation as low as the Queen's Garden and Fairyland Loop trails. Dolomitic limestone is high in calcium and magnesium, and low in phosphorus. This chemistry is difficult for other plants to tolerate, giving the bristlecone pine plenty of room to grow as slowly as it likes. You'll also typically find higher-elevation bristlecones growing at the edges of cliffs, where competition is even further reduced. Free to take its time, bristlecones pines can grow as slowly as an inch (2.5 cm) per century if conditions are challenging. This gives these trees incredibly dense heartwood, which is capable of providing structural support to the tree long after a section of limb or trunk has lost its life-protecting bark. The oldest tree at Bryce Canyon was estimated to be 1,600 years old, though trees across its range into Nevada and California have been dated at over 5,000 years old, giving Pinus longaeva the honor of being the longest living non-clonal species on Earth.<br /> You can identify a Bristlecone pine by its densely bundled needles of five (making it a white pine). Unlike many other pines that shed their needles every few years, bristlecone pines can retain needles for up to forty years. Their 1.5 in (1.2 cm) long needles remain vibrant and green for typically a full 12 inches (30 cm) along the branch. This appearance is often compared to that of a bottlebrush or pipe cleaner.<br /> Like the limber pine (another white pine found at Bryce Canyon) seeds of the bristlecone pine may be harvested and dispersed to unlikely places by Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana). The seeds of their bristle-tipped cones are often among the first to colonize recently burnt areas.</p>",

Here erosion has been at work far longer than the Bryce Amphitheater, and undercut sheer cliffs compose much of the view along the edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>A short path along the plateau edge leads west to the easy 1.0 mi/1.6 km Bristlecone Loop, as well as the 8.8 mi/14.2 km backcountry Riggs Spring Loop and 23 mi/37 km Under-the-Rim Trail.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the North</h4> <p>View the eroded edge of the Paunsagunt Plateau, carved by rain and melting snow into bowl-shaped amphitheaters, which drain to the Paria River and then the Colorado River. Atop the Markagunt plateau to the northwest and the Paunsaugunt plateau in the north, the Tushar Mountains and Sevier plateau (or Black Mountains) can be seen. These were created through volcanic activity associated with the uplift of the Colorado Plateau.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>Below the iron-oxide colored limey mudstones of the Pink Cliffs of Bryce Canyon, the valley of the Paria river exposes marine shales of the Grey Cliffs and further south, sandstones of the White Cliffs. The Pink Cliffs as seen in the Table Cliff Plateau can be seen rising to 10,000 ft (3048 m) along the opposite side of the valley.</p> <h4>to the West</h4> <p>Across the Paunsagunt Plateau, peaks of the Black Mountains, and further off the Tushar mountains can be seen. Water which falls upon the forested top of this plateau drains not to the Colorado River, but west and north along the Sevier River towards Nevada. The edge of the plateau is therefore a watershed between the Colorado River and the Great Basin desert of Nevada.</p> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>Views to the south can be best appreciated across the parking lot at Yovimpa Point or along the Bristlecone Loop Trail.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Rainbow Point overlook is at the southernmost end of the 18-mile park road. The view faces north spanning the entire length of the park. The overlook is also at the highest elevation within the park. A brown sign reads Rainbow Point Elevation 9,115 feet. A sidewalk leads to the Rainbow Point shelter and exhibit panels that describe the geology, nearby hiking opportunities, and life communities of the canyon. Spruce and fir forests surround the area. A path runs adjacent to the plateau's edge and is enclosed with a horizontal log railing. Nearby, the Yovimpa Point Overlook is the contrasting south facing overlook.<br /><br />At Rainbow Point Overlook is a sweeping view of the top step of the \"Grand Staircase\"- a geologic formation that includes the youngest exposed rocks of the Grand Canyon at the bottom step (furthest away), then Zion National Park, the middle step, and the top step of the grand staircase here at Bryce Canyon with the youngest known rock formations. <br /><br />These intricately carved, horseshoe shaped rock canyons or \"amphitheaters\" each with horizontal cliffs edges are made of layers of limestone, mudstone, sandstone, silts, and clay stacked in soft pinks, whites, and orange to make up the striking color bands of each plateau, turret, cliff and ridge. <br /><br />The amphitheaters stretch on for miles. Above, the plateaus are covered in ponderosa and fir forest, ending at cliffs of pink, and hundreds of orange rock pillars called hoodoos, which poke up from the ground like jagged teeth.<br /><br />An exhibit panel here titled The High Plateaus of Utah further describes the landscape.",

Crews would create parks, plant forests, and construct roads, trails, shelters, and picnic areas throughout the nation. Bryce Canyon would host camp NP-3, which worked primarily on roads, footpaths, insect control, and landscaping work. Notable projects included the Under-the-Rim Trail from Rainbow Point to Bryce Point, structures at Rainbow Point and the Bristlecone Loop Trail gazebo, and front-country campground development.

Gain a new perspective of the Grand Staircase by descending to its next stair--the Cretaceous sandstones of the Grey Cliffs. To preserve this experience, backcountry camping is permitted only in designated campsites. A backcountry permit must be obtained at the Visitor Center prior to any overnight trips. This trail is not as easily followed as developed trails within the Bryce Amphitheater.</p> <h4>Camping (Permits Available at Visitor Center)</h4> <p>There are 4 campsites on the 8.8 mile (14.2 km) Riggs Spring Loop Trail, which also can be accessed from here. You must obtain a permit to use these sites.</p> <h4>Under-the-Rim Trail</h4> <p>Access the Under-the-Rim Trail by following signs for the Bristlecone Loop Trail east toward Rainbow Point.</p> <h2>Backcountry Hiking and Camping</h2> <p>The Under-the-Rim Trail is approximately 22.9 miles (36.9 km) from Bryce Point to Rainbow Point. Connecting trails offer access from the park's Scenic Drive and intersect the Under-the-Rim Trail at Swamp Canyon, and Whiteman Bench. Agua Canyon Connector Trail **is closed** until further notice due to storm damage.<br /> <br /> The Riggs Spring Loop is an 8.6 mile (13.9 km) hike beginning and ending at the Rainbow and Yovimpa Point parking lot at the south end of the Scenic Drive. Either the Yovimpa or Rainbow Point trailhead may be used to access this loop.<br /> <br /> A backcountry hiking map with mileage is available at the Visitor Center. <a href=\"https://nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/backcountryinfo.htm\">More information</a></p> <h3>Permits Required</h3> <p>A Backcountry Permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry. Permits may be purchased at the Visitor Center from 9 am - 12:30 pm and 1:30 pm to 6 pm. Backcountry campsites are limited to 6 people per regular site, and 15 people per group site.</p> <h3>No Fires Permitted</h3> <p>Though gas-powered cooking stoves are allowed, no open fires are allowed anywhere in the park outside of North and Sunset Campground's established fire rings.</p> <h3>Bears and Other Wildlife</h3> <p>Bryce Canyon is home to many animals including mountain lions, coyotes and black bears. Squirrels, snakes and other small animals may also be present near your campsite.<br /> Due to the presence of black bears within Bryce Canyon National Park, the use of bear-resistant food canisters on overnight backcountry hikes is highly recommended. Bear-resistant canisters are available for loan, free of charge, at the Visitor Center.</p> <h3>Transportation</h3> <p>No park-provided transportation is provided south of Bryce Point. You can arrange a private shuttle using approved providers listed on our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/commercial-tours-and-services.htm\">Commercial Tours and Services</a> page.</p>",

The viewpoint at Inspiration Point consists of three overlooks that provide varied perspectives of the main amphitheater, which is an expansive bowl-like feature carved into the edge of this high plateau. The canyon is filled with thousands of irregularly eroded spires of rocks called hoodoos, each pinnacle and its surrounding cliff faces are layered with jagged striations of orange, white, gray and brown stone fading to soft rolling hills of forest in the distant valley. From here, visitors look toward the north to Sunset Point with its many rows of hoodoos and Sunrise Point set against the backdrop of Boat Mesa.",

A railing with metal posts and chain-link fencing surrounds the overlook. The Navajo Loop Trail descends from Sunset Point. Water and restrooms are in the vicinity. Directly below the point and to the south, rising from the canyon floor, a web of spired hoodoos and fins are packed in tight formation. Vibrant red, oranges, and yellows of the lower half of the cliffs change to white toward the top of the plateau. Just below the overlook at the northern edge, a hoodoo named Thor's Hammer stands alone. Isolated from other hoodoos it stands a very tall spire with a wide base that narrows toward the top where it seems as if a large rock were placed at the tip, resembling the head of a hammer.",

They face us, posing in the island beside the gas pumps. Text continues: After World War II, automobile sales surged, and thousands of eager tourists arrived to explore the park.

Elements of this style can be seen in the building's arcing stone wall, flat roof planes, and large windows. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Caption reads: In 1972, the Union Pacific turned this station and other buildings over to the National Park Service. By 1988, the growing number of local service stations made this one obsolete and it closed. Description of the station follows: The service station is located adjacent to the park road midway between Bryce Canyon Lodge and Sunrise Point. This one-story, irregularly shaped building with five interior rooms and auto repair shop and was designed in a modern style with a wide, flat rooftop that projects out from the main entrance to provide a canopy over the gas pump island. The canopy is held up by two steel posts. The entire front face of the service station has a large expanse of floor to ceiling glass windows with white trim and a sided in pine board paneling and a single overhead sliding garage door that is also entirely made of glass windows. The dominant feature is a coursed sandstone wall that curves around the back of the building. The wall, constructed of rough-cut local sandstone and concrete mortar forms the back of the building and extends out beyond the building walls and rises above the roofline to form a backdrop. Behind the stone wall is a hillslope covered in native Ponderosa pine. Between the road and the service station is an oval shaped island of grasses and a solitary Pondarosa Pine surrounded by a raised stone retaining wall.",

The name for each set of cliffs in the grand staircase describes its color: pink cliffs, great cliffs, white cliffs, Vermilion cliffs and chocolate cliffs. In its multitude of layers the grand staircase tells the story of over 200 million years of changing landscapes.

For the Fresnel lens to concentrate sunlight and for the tiny triple-junction chips to convert it to electricity, the sun alignment has to be within 1-2 degrees. <br /> <br /> When installed in sunny locations, CPV outperforms all other kinds of solar energy, both in sunlight conversion efficiency and energy density (kilowatts / acre).  Operating at 140kW per hour and peaking at 150kW, this array generates more energy than can be easily stored in batteries, so instead, excess energy is returned to the grid.  On a sunny day, the array generates more than twice the energy the Bryce Canyon Visitor Center uses, providing us with an energy credit that can then be reclaimed at night or on cloudy days.  </p> <h3>The Photovoltaic Cell</h3> <p>Each tracker consists of 5,040 individual solar collection cells.  Sunlight enters each cell through a Fresnel lens, (commonly used in lighthouses to focus light into a beam) which concentrates sunlight through a reflecting chamber on to a tiny triple junction photovoltaic chip. <br /> <br /> Because all photovoltaics perform better at cooler temperatures, the chip itself is mounted on a large aluminum heat-sink (similar to those used to cool computer processors) with blades that extend out of the cell, on the shaded size of the unit, where air circulation aids in further </p> <h3>Maximizing Solar Energy</h3> <p>Only half of our Sun’s energy reaches Earth’s surface. The narrow range known as optical light is what the human eye-brain combination uses. Through photosynthesis, plants convert 2-4% of solar energy into sugars. The best silicon solar panels are about 18% efficient. Concentrating PhotoVoltaics (CPV) technology focuses light onto triple-stacked photocells of different alloys. Each layer in the stack collects sunlight from a different part of the spectrum, that when added together, converts 34% of our Sun’s transmitted energy into electricity.</p> <h3>Other Facts</h3> <ul> <li> <p>When wind speeds exceed 35 mph, each tracker’s anemometer instructs it to tilt back to the horizontal wind stow position where they can survive winds speeds up to 100 mph. </p> </li> <li> <p>A clock drive allows the trackers to track our Sun even when cloudy. A sun-tracker in the upper center of each tracker adds precision when our Sun is out.</p> </li> <li> <p>A pyrheliometer independently measures sunlight intensity and our Sun’s precise position in the sky to improve efficiency.</p> </li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Sunrise Point is the northernmost of the four major viewpoints that overlook the iconic Bryce Amphitheater. Though this point along with Sunset Point was named to entice early Lodge visitors to easily accessible points along the rim at both times of day, this view is equally spectacular at daybreak and day's end. At an elevation of 8,100 feet (2,469 m), Sunrise Point is just slightly higher than the Rim Trail and the ponderosa forest to the west. This provides one with a 360 degree view, making it a great choice for stargazers, and those hoping to see the sun's final light along the western horizon. The view of the rock formations (hoodoos) within the Bryce Amphitheater is exceptional as well. Here one can clearly see the full process of hoodoo formation as the plateau rim erodes back exposing walls or fins of layered rock, which are then broken by frost-wedging with windows (arches) that expand to eventually form the isolated columns of stone known as hoodoos. Further east, the eye traces to see these hoodoos' final state: colorful badlands of sediment spotted with vegetation, including bristlecone pines. The popular Queen's Garden trail provides an unforgettable journey down a ridgeline that provides views of every stage of this process.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>The 5.5 mile (8.9 km) Rim Trail connects this view to Sunrise and Fairyland Points further north and Inspiration and Bryce Points further south. The most popular section is the 0.5 mile (0.8 km) section between here and Sunrise Point. This section is paved (and therefore permits leashed pets) and has minimal elevation changes. The Queen's Garden Trail also descends from this viewpoint area.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the Northeast</h4> <p>See the flat-topped feature of Boat Mesa and the angled slope of Sinking Ship set against the stark Pink Cliffs of the Table Cliff Plateau 17.5 miles (28 km) distant. The roughly 30 degree slope of Sinking Ship is evidence of the Paunsaugunt fault line, which travels north-south roughly along the eastern edge of the park. This fault, along with large fields of volcanic rock north of the park, were created as part of the tectonic events that elevated the Colorado Plateau region to its present day elevations and later produced the Basin and Range region to the west. The fault is a normal fault, which means that it was formed by extension--the ground you're standing upon moving down and away from the opposite side of the valley. This movement accounts for the 2,000 foot (610 m) difference in elevation between the Bryce Amphitheater and the Table Cliff plateau, despite these being formed of the same rock layer. Sinking Ship is slightly caught upon this fault, explaining its tilted appearance. Though once a site of intense movement, little activity has been recorded along the fault in the last 9 million years.</p> <h4>To the East</h4> <p>The large crown-shaped feature in the middle of the Bryce Amphitheater is known as Bristlecone Point. If you have some binoculars, you may be able to see their scraggly forms upon the white layers of the Claron formation capping Bristlecone Point. You can see that between here and Bristlecone Point is a series of colorful badlands that continue to the north, but steeply drop off into more forested areas to the south. One can see this as a north/south dividing line within the Bryce Amphitheater, where areas south have been eroded more deeply and undercut cliffs to the south (a trend that increases the further south in the park you travel), while erosion has been gentler and less dramatic further north. Beyond Bristlecone Point is the broad Paria Valley, which has been formed over the last 6 million years by the Paria River. The Paria River ultimately joins the Colorado River not too far from Navajo Mountain, visible on the southeastern horizon.</p> <h4>To the South</h4> <p>To the south, one can also see Sunset, Inspiration, and Bryce Points along the forested rim of the Paunsagunt Plateau. If you have an especially good eye (and know what you're looking for) you can spot Thor's Hammer along the Two Bridges side of the Navajo Loop below Sunset Point.</p> <h2>Nature</h2> <p>The Limber Pine at Sunrise Point (known as \"Stilts\"), roots exposed by erosion of the rim, serves as a reminder of the resilience and ability of life to adapt to adverse conditions, and also of the rapidity with which the scene before us is disappearing. Geologists have calculated that the rim of the canyon is eroding at a rate of one to four feet every century and that in approximately three million years, Bryce Canyon will be gone forever. The hoodoos of Bryce Canyon's main amphitheater appear as a snapshot in the rapid process of erosion on the Paunsaugunt Plateau. This rapidly eroding land creates a harsh environment for any living thing, and like this limber pine, all creatures which live here, from people to animals to plants, must adapt to the conditions in order to survive.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Ponderosa pine line the rim of the canyon here. To the northeast is Boat Mesa and the Sinking Ship formation set against the stark Pink Cliffs of the Table Cliff Plateau. Below the plateau’s rim, a mass of orange hoodoos and stonewalls are capped with a thick layer of resistant white limestone. At the far edge of the overlook stands one small, lone Limber Pine tree. It clings to the very edge of the eroding cliff; its tangled roots are exposed above ground and curve like legs as if it is standing or walking.",

Exterior siding is painted dark brown and all log porch construction and framing is stained a natural light brown. There are stone entrances, rustic porches and balconies of large log framework and log railings. Gabled roofs provide a roofed and shaded upper balcony. The shingles are laid horizontally, without the wavy patterns of earlier days. Each hotel is set into the natural landscape and surrounded by ponderosa pine and low growing native shrubs. Concrete walkways surround the building.",

    "audioDescription": "Sunset Point and Sunset Point wayside 347 words<br /><br />Sunset Point offers vistas of some of the most famous and breathtaking of Bryce Canyon's hoodoos. A railing with metal posts and chain-link fencing surrounds the overlook. The Navajo Loop Trail descends from Sunset Point. Water and restrooms are in the vicinity.<br /><br />Directly below the point and to the south, rising from the canyon floor, a web of spired hoodoos and fins are packed in tight formation. Vibrant red, oranges, and yellows of the lower half of the cliffs change to white toward the top of the plateau. Just below the overlook at the northern edge, a hoodoo named Thor's Hammer stands alone. Isolated from other hoodoos it stands a very tall spire with a wide base that narrows toward the top where it seems as if a large rock were placed at the tip, resembling the head of a hammer. <br /><br />A panel at the overlook reads: <br />Sunset Point.<br />At the top of the panel a watercolor illustration labels points of interest in the distant landscape. From left to right: boat Mesa is 2 miles away sinking ship is 3 miles in the distance and the Aquarius plateau is 15 miles in the distance. Next the Canaan Mountain 21 miles, and far right, Kaiparewits Plateau 45 miles and Navajo Mountain 82 miles away.<br /><br />A color photograph below the illustration shows Sunset Point in winter. The hoodoo spires in the foreground are tipped with snow and the distant mesas and plateaus are snow-covered with only the greens of pine trees dotting the white landscape. Caption reads: water, ice and snow continue to carve the formations at Bryce Canyon.<br /><br />Another photograph shows clusters of icicles hanging from the underside of the red cliffs. A quote by Peter Farb from the Face of North America, 1963 is below the photograph, it reads:<br />\"...In this thirsty land, water has been the prime creator of scenery. Water formed these sedimentary rocks under ancient seas, and water sculpted them as they rose. Water carved the buttes and mesas, chiseled Bryce Canyon into every shape known.\"",

Although it might be the last place on Earth you would expect to find an alligator, compared to the rest of the park it is a virtual wetland. Here, below the rim, two tiny creeks and a spring provide enough water to sustain more lush vegetation like grasses and willows. This canyon remains wet enough year-around that it is also home to tiger salamanders and wild iris. Bird watchers enjoy hiking the Swamp Canyon Loop Trail as it traverses four distinctly different habitats offering the chance to see a wide diversity of songbirds.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>The moderately strenuous 4.0 mi/6.4 km Swamp Canyon Loop begins at the north end of the parking lot. The trail descends 647 ft/198 m to the canyon floor on a 3 - 4 hour hike. The Swamp Canyon Loop also provides access to the 23 mi/37 km Under-the-Rim Trail. See nearby Swamp Canyon Loop Trailhead for more information.</p> <h2>Landscape Features</h2> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>Mud and Noon Canyon Buttes can be seen. Buttes are halfway along the erosional continuum between plateau and pinnacle. Plateaus are large regions of uplifted land. Mesas are isolated portions of plateaus that, although much smaller than plateaus, are still wider than they are tall. As mesas erode they give birth to buttes, which are square shaped, being approximately the same width as they are tall. As buttes erode still further they spawn spires of rocks.<br /> At Bryce, our spires, known as hoodoos, are of a very special variety. The classic way a hoodoo forms begins with a narrow fin of rock that eventually develops holes or windows through the forces of frost wedging. As the windows grow they become arches. Eventually arches become too large to support their roofs. The inevitable collapse of a window leaves behind two broken legs of the arch. At Bryce we call broken arches hoodoos.</p>",

The canyon here does not have a visible swamp but does have a small creek and a spring that fill the canyon bottom with vegetation like grasses and willows while pines and juniper trees climb the banks and cliffs.",

Descending from the rim, this trail meanders through forests and meadows, offering stunning views of pink-hued cliffs in the distance. The Under the Rim Trail follows the base of the Paunsaugant Plateau and is largely forested. The hoodoos are part of the distant vistas to the west as you hike the valley floor. To preserve this experience, backcountry camping is permitted only in designated campsites. A backcountry permit must be obtained at the Visitor Center prior to any overnight trips. This trail is not as easily followed as developed trails within the Bryce Amphitheater.</p> <h2>Backcountry Hiking and Camping</h2> <p>The Under-the-Rim Trail is approximately 22.9 miles (36.9 km) from Bryce Point to Rainbow Point. Connecting trails offer access from the park's Scenic Drive and intersect the Under-the-Rim Trail at Swamp Canyon, and Whiteman Bench. Agua Canyon Connector Trail **is closed** until further notice due to storm damage.<br /> <br /> The Riggs Spring Loop is an 8.6 mile (13.9 km) hike beginning and ending at the Rainbow and Yovimpa Point parking lot at the south end of the Scenic Drive. Either the Yovimpa or Rainbow Point trailhead may be used to access this loop.<br /> <br /> A backcountry hiking map with mileage is available at the Visitor Center. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/backcountryinfo.htm\">More information</a></p> <h3>Permits Required</h3> <p>A Backcountry Permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry. Permits may be purchased at the Visitor Center from 9 am - 12:30 pm and 1:30 pm to 6 pm. Backcountry campsites are limited to 6 people per regular site, and 15 people per group site.</p> <h3>No Fires Permitted</h3> <p>Though gas-powered cooking stoves are allowed, no open fires are allowed anywhere in the park outside of North and Sunset Campground's established fire rings.</p> <h3>Bears and Other Wildlife</h3> <p>Bryce Canyon is home to many animals including mountain lions, coyotes and black bears. Squirrels, snakes and other small animals may also be present near your campsite.<br /> Due to the presence of black bears within Bryce Canyon National Park, the use of bear-resistant food canisters on overnight backcountry hikes is highly recommended. Bear-resistant canisters are available for loan, free of charge, at the Visitor Center.</p> <h3>Transportation</h3> <p>No park-provided transportation is provided south of Bryce Point. You can arrange a private shuttle using approved providers listed on our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/commercial-tours-and-services.htm\">Commercial Tours and Services</a> page.</p>",

Title reads: Swamp Canyon Trailhead A photo shows dense green forest in the foreground and a landform of red rock with vertical cliffs and a flat top in the distance, caption reads: Swamp Canyon Butte A detailed map of the park runs along the left side of the panel and illustrates all overlooks, shuttle stops, picnic areas, and camping and hiking opportunities. A You are Here arrow points to Swamp Canyon, north of Whiteman Bench and south of Inspiration Point. Panel content describes backcountry rules and campsites in the vicinity. Text reads: Bryce Canyon's Backcountry Bryce Canyon is best known for its hoodoos-bizarre pinnacles of rock left standing by the forces of erosion. Hoodoos are best experienced from the park's day hiking trails. By contrast, our backcountry trails offer forests, meadows, some interesting geologic features, lots of solitude, but few hoodoos. There are four backcountry campsites in the area of Swamp Canyon A color photograph for each of the four campgrounds shows a clearing in a forested area to set up camp. Right Fork Swamp Canyon Right fork swamped Canyon is .9 miles from the trailhead. caption reads nestled among tall Pines, Oak brush and mountain mahogany, there are nice views of cliffs and swamped Canyon Butte nearby.

There is no water at this site.

There is water at this site. this campsite is shaded by Pines junipers and Oak brush. Sheep Creek can be heard flowing just to the S the tops of the pink cliffs are visible above the trees this site is more secluded than other Backcountry sites as it sits off the under the rim trail on a dead and spur. Yellow Creek Yellow Creek campsite is 6.2 miles from the trailhead. This site is shaded by Ponderosa Pines, but has an open area just to the west where Yellow Creek provides a reliable water source. There are good views of the pink cliffs of the Claron Formation and the Yellow Cliffs of the Straight Cliffs Formation.",

    "audioDescription": "Hike the Hoodoos Tower Bridge 386 words An exhibit panel titled: Hike the Hoodoos, Tower Bridge, promotes the parks Hike the Hoodoos challenge. There are nine \"Hike the Hoodoos\" benchmarks located along eight different hiking trails in the park. Each exhibit has a large round coin-like metal, medallion called a benchmark inserted into the panel. The right side of the panel illustrates a natural feature found at the location along with two photographs of the rocky landscape. The first is of a large butte formation called the sinking ship, a massive rock tilted higher on one end as if the back of the ship is sinking down, and the other of the Tower Bridge formation, a narrow horizontal ledge or bridge of resistant limestone held between two pillars of red limey mudstone. Text reads: In Bryce Canyon you can read earth’s history in layers of stone. Near sinking ship, slabs of earth’s crust are grinding past each other along the Paunsaugunt fault, raising the distant plateau known as Table Cliff. Hiking to Tower Bridge you can see how softer limestone spires have eroded leaving harder dolomitic limestone between them writing yet another chapter in this place is journey through time. The left side of each panel provides a trail map with current location, the benchmark and a description of the hoodoo challenge: This map shows our location on the Fairyland Loop Trail between Sunrise point and Fairyland point Text reads: Walk 1.5 miles down this trail to find the Tower bridge benchmark (metal disk below). Look for the benchmark on a sign at the trail junction. This is part of the “I hiked the hoodoos” challenge -- a way to stay healthy and have fun in your National Park. To meet the challenge: either find 3 benchmarks, or hike 3 miles on trails that have benchmarks see map and park newspaper or junior Ranger booklet bring rubbings of the benchmarks or photos of yourself with them to the visitor center to receive a small reward. The coin-shaped metal benchmark is mounted to the panel. Words have been etched into the metal: Bryce Canyon National Park Tower Bridge I hiked the hoodoos elevation 7251 feet above sea level. Text continues: This project was made possible in part by a grant from the National Park foundation through the generous support of the Coca Cola foundation.",

The trail begins 0.25 miles (0.4 km) north of Sunrise Point along the Rim Trail and is part of the larger 8 mile (12.9 km) Fairyland Loop. It descends steadily 1.5 miles (2.4 miles) into Campbell Canyon, reaching a 200 yard spur trail that leads to the Tower Bridge hoodoo. Hikers should then turn around and ascend back to the rim to complete the hike. Those looking for a strenuous hike can continue on along the Fairyland Loop.<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/towerbridge.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h3>Fairyland Loop Trail</h3> <p><strong>Difficulty: Strenuous<br /> Total Distance: 8.0 miles (12.9 km)<br /> Elevation change: 1,716 feet (523 m)<br /> Average time: 4-5 hours</strong><br /> Along the the Peekaboo Loop, the Fairyland Loop provides some of the best strenuous hiking in the park. It can be begun from either the Tower Bridge Trailhead or further notice at Fairyland Point (not accessible by vehicle in winter months). Spending 2.5 miles (4 km) along quiet ponderosa forests on the Rim Trail and the rest below surrounded by hoodoos within Fairyland and Campbell Canyons, it provides an excellent experience of the diversity above and below the rim. The trail can be hiked either clockwise or counter-clockwise, though many prefer the latter for the opportunity to descend rather than climb the Tower Bridge Trail section.<br /> Generally the trail traces a large circle centered on Boat Mesa, the large flat-topped feature capped with the Conglomerate at Boat Mesa. This rock layer is one of the park's youngest, from a time after the freshwater lakes that would deposit the vibrant Claron Formation that forms the park's hoodoos had drained away, leaving large braided rivers that drained mountains to the north. <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/fairylandloop.htm\">More about the trail</a></p> <h2>Nature</h2> <h3>Bristlecone Pines</h3> <p>Though Bryce Canyon is well known for its geology, the park also contains a fantastic diversity of trees. Among the most impressive of these is the Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva). These trees are known for thriving where few other plants can, and for far longer too. Look for bristlecone pines on exposures of dolomitic limestone. These areas of white to grey stone are found in the park's hoodoo-forming Claron formation as low as the Queen's Garden and Fairyland Loop trails. Dolomitic limestone is high in calcium and magnesium, and low in phosphorus. This chemistry is difficult for other plants to tolerate, giving the bristlecone pine plenty of room to grow as slowly as it likes. You'll also typically find higher-elevation bristlecones growing at the edges of cliffs, where competition is even further reduced. Free to take its time, bristlecones pines can grow as slowly as an inch (2.5 cm) per century if conditions are challenging. This gives these trees incredibly dense heartwood, which is capable of providing structural support to the tree long after a section of limb or trunk has lost its life-protecting bark. The oldest tree at Bryce Canyon was estimated to be 1,600 years old, though trees across its range into Nevada and California have been dated at over 5,000 years old, giving Pinus longaeva the honor of being the longest living non-clonal species on Earth.<br /> You can identify a Bristlecone pine by its densely bundled needles of five (making it a white pine). Unlike many other pines that shed their needles every few years, bristlecone pines can retain needles for up to forty years. Their 1.5 in (1.2 cm) long needles remain vibrant and green for typically a full 12 inches (30 cm) along the branch. This appearance is often compared to that of a bottlebrush or pipe cleaner.<br /> Like the limber pine (another white pine found at Bryce Canyon) seeds of the bristlecone pine may be harvested and dispersed to unlikely places by Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana). The seeds of their bristle-tipped cones are often among the first to colonize recently burnt areas.<br /> Note that bristlecone pines share dolomitic limestones with some of the park's most delicate plants. Stay on the trail and help us to protect them.</p> <h2>I Hiked the Hoodoos</h2> <p>Hiking is great exercise and Bryce Canyon's \"I Hiked the Hoodoos!\" program is not just hiking, it's also a scavenger hunt with a special reward!<br /> <br /> <strong>1.

Backcountry campsites are limited to 6 people per regular site, and 15 people per group site.</p> <h3>No Fires Permitted</h3> <p>Though gas-powered cooking stoves are allowed, no open fires are allowed anywhere in the park outside of North and Sunset Campground's established fire rings.</p> <h3>Bears and Other Wildlife</h3> <p>Bryce Canyon is home to many animals including mountain lions, coyotes and black bears. Squirrels, snakes and other small animals may also be present near your campsite.<br /> Due to the presence of black bears within Bryce Canyon National Park, the use of bear-resistant food canisters on overnight backcountry hikes is highly recommended. Bear-resistant canisters are available for loan, free of charge, at the Visitor Center.</p> <h3>Transportation</h3> <p>No park-provided transportation is provided south of Bryce Point.

    "audioDescription": "Visitor Center 223 words The park entrance station and visitor center are near the north end of the park along the main road, within a large expanse of sagebrush meadow and directly surrounded by stands of ponderosa pine. The entrance station along the road has three one room small kiosk booths with windows on all four sides. Park entrance tickets and information are available upon entrance. The visitor center is a 3 story L shaped building on a concrete foundation. Its construction although newer, is similar to the rustic style of the other buildings within the park; a combination of studs-out wood appearance emphasizing the framing as a decorative pattern on the exterior of the building and large exterior stone pillars at each of the buildings corners. The sharply pitched gable roof is covered with green corrugated metal roofing. The outside walls are painted dark brown and contrast with the lighter colored stone facing. A low stone wall runs around the base of the building. There are nearby pedestrian trails, a shuttle bus stop and available parking in the front. At the entrance of the building there is an informational tactile touch table to illustrate the topography within the canyon landscape along with interpretive panels and orientation maps. The visitor center houses a museum with exhibits, a small theater, restrooms, water station, visitor information and a bookstore.",

    "audioDescription": "Wall of Windows 469 words \"Wall of Windows Hike the Hoodoos\" wayside panel is along the western side of the Peekaboo Loop facing north along a winding portion of the trail. Above is a natural feature known as the Wall of Windows: a fin of white limestone protruding from the rim of the Bryce Amphitheater where large arches or windows in the rock have been carved by ice, rain, gravity, and wind. Exhibit title: Hike the Hoodoos, Wall of Windows, promotes the parks Hike the Hoodoos challenge. There are nine \"Hike the Hoodoos\" benchmarks located along eight different hiking trails in the park. Each exhibit has a large round coin-like metal, medallion called a benchmark inserted into the panel. The right side of the exhibit panel illustrates with photographs, the three different rock formations found here, fins, pockets and windows. First, fins, long narrow rock walls, like a fish’s dorsal fin, each spine is a pillar of stone stacked tightly to the next in a row. Next, windows: a close-up photograph of rock fins that now have pockets or tunnels created by erosion that will eventually break through to create a hole or window through the rock. Last, Windows, a photograph of a rock formation with a window framing the blue sky through it, the pockets have eroded completely through to the other side, creating window through the rock. Text reads: Nature's recipe for a rock window at Bryce: begin with massive hunks of limestone, sandstone, and other rock originally laid down as Lake sediments 50 million years ago. Add Frost wedging and flowing water to erode the rock into tall fins. Using mildly acidic rain, create pockets in these fins. Erode the pockets until a hole appears. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. The left side of each panel provides a trail map with current location, the benchmark and a description of the hoodoo challenge: This map shows our location in between Bryce point to the south and inspiration point to the north along the Peekaboo loop trail. Text reads: You have found the Peekaboo Loop benchmark (metal disk below) on the “I hiked the hoodoos” challenge -- a way to stay healthy and have fun in your National Park. To meet the challenge: either find 3 benchmarks, or hike 3 miles on trails that have benchmarks see map and park newspaper or junior Ranger booklet bring rubbings of the benchmarks or photos of yourself with them to the visitor center to receive a small reward. The coin-shaped metal benchmark is mounted to the panel. Words have been etched into the metal: Bryce Canyon National Park Peek a Boo I hiked the hoodoos elevation 7640 feet above sea level. Text continues: This project was made possible in part by a grant from the National Park foundation through the generous support of the Coca Cola foundation.",

Text continues: Watching For Wildlife Ringtail Active at night, ringtails, also called ringtail cats, climb trees looking for insects, lizards, and other small meals. Bobcat The bobcat gets its name from its short “bob” tail. Sometimes seen during the day, this cat is most active at dawn and dusk. Its main prey are rabbits, like the desert cottontail. Pygmy nuthatch Usually seen in large family groups, these grey and white birds are the park’s smallest nuthatches. Listen for their squeak which sounds like a rubber ducky. Raven These large birds are found throughout the park. They are very playful fliers and are very smart. Their usual call is a low croak, but they also make sounds to imitate other birds. White-Breasted nuthatch The park’s largest nuthatch has a gray back, black striped head, and white face and belly. It can be seen moving head-first down the bark of trees looking for food. Coyote Coyotes can be seen hunting during the day. In areas with lots of people, they hunt at night. They eat small animals, insects, reptiles, birds, and grass. Near people they will eat trash and pet food. Golden-mantled ground squirrel These small rodents have a white eye ring, while chipmunks have stripes on their faces. They can be found in all areas of the park, often approaching people for food. Remember to never feed any wildlife! Steller’s jay These are bold and curious birds with a large black crest and blue feathers. Listen for their loud “shack-shack-shack” call in the trees. They are often seen swooping between trees or on the ground. Downy woodpecker The smallest woodpecker in North America, might be seen along a tree branch or trunk where it makes lots of noise drumming its small bill. The male has a red spot on his head. Mule deer Mule deer are one of the park’s most common mammals. They get their name from their big, mule-like ears. These deer can be seen throughout the day, but are usually in meadows in the morning and evening. Brown creeper These birds blend in very well with tree bark as they search for insects to eat. You might see them as they fly to land near the bottom of a tree and work their way up. Their calls are very high-pitched. Desert cottontail These small gray rabbits have white tails and are usually seen in hilly areas. They can be seen all day, but more often in the early morning or late afternoon. Their tracks are often spotted in the snow. Utah prairie dog The smallest of all prairie dogs. Usually seen near the mounded entrances of their underground homes. Listen for their chattering bark. They may be warning others about a nearby predator, maybe you!",

Within these bowl-shaped areas—amphitheaters—stands the world’s greatest concentration of irregular rock spires, called “hoodoos”. The word is a mistranslation of the Paiute word “Oodoo”, which describes fear among faces and forms in the rocks. An inset sepia toned photograph taken in 1873 during the John Wesley Powell expedition down the Colorado River illustrates two Paiutes and their dome shaped shelters made of natural materials. Caption reads: The Southern Paiute’s sacred oral tradition says the hoodoos are ancient “Legend People” turned to stone by the trickster god, Coyote, as a punishment for bad deeds.

    "bodyText": "<p>Picnic tables are available for use at this pull-out surrounded by burned forest.</p> <h3>Bridge Fire</h3> <p>The Bridge Fire began on June 14th, 2009 at Bridge Hollow on the Dixie National Forest to the west. It was closely monitored for resource benefits in this fire-dependent ecosystem, including re-establishing aspen and ponderosa pine in an area dominated by shade-tolerant white fire. Due to the nature of mixed conifer forest, with dense trees low in the understory, the stand-replacing fire behavior you see was normal and expected.<br /> Hot and dry conditions combined with strong winds contributed to very fast-moving fire behavior, and the the Bridge fire entered the park on July 14th. Ultimately around 3,500 acres (about 50% in the park and 50% on Forest Service land) would burn. The burned area stretches along Whiteman Bench between Swamp Canyon and Farview Point for about 1.5 miles, primarily to the west, and in some places reaches below the rim to the east. This was the largest natural wildfire in the park's history.<br /> 300 firefighters from Utah, Nevada, and Arkansas would cooperate to hold the fire along the main park road. Three helicopters were in use for aerial foam and water drops.<br /> There were no injuries or property damage. On July 14th at 4:30 p.m. approximately 50 vehicles were led down from Rainbow Point and escorted out of the park on the Yovimpa Pass Road--a forest service road that bypassed the fire along the main road. Another 10 RVs and motorcycles unable to travel the forest service road were escorted down the main road when it was safe.<br /> Today, the snags (dead, standing trees) provide important habitat for a variety of species, including woodpeckers, nuthatches, owls, and small mammals who will help to disperse the seeds that will regenerate this forest.<br /> What regrowth can you see from where you stand?</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Here along the main park road, two picnic tables sit at the end of a crushed stone path that briefly winds though a few ponderosa pines. The landscape was clearly burned not too long ago, with dead standing trees and many fallen ones among new shrub growth. Distant views are of a forested valley with pale orange and white rock exposures with some rock spires among the trees.",

Descending from the rim, this trail meanders through forests and meadows, offering stunning views of pink-hued cliffs in the distance. The Under the Rim Trail follows the base of the Paunsaugant Plateau and is largely forested. The hoodoos are part of the distant vistas to the west as you hike the valley floor. To preserve this experience, backcountry camping is permitted only in designated campsites. A backcountry permit must be obtained at the Visitor Center prior to any overnight trips. This trail is not as easily followed as developed trails within the Bryce Amphitheater.</p> <h2>Backcountry Hiking and Camping</h2> <p>The Under-the-Rim Trail is approximately 22.9 miles (36.9 km) from Bryce Point to Rainbow Point. Connecting trails offer access from the park's Scenic Drive and intersect the Under-the-Rim Trail at Swamp Canyon, and Whiteman Bench. Agua Canyon Connector Trail **is closed** until further notice due to storm damage.<br /> <br /> The Riggs Spring Loop is an 8.6 mile (13.9 km) hike beginning and ending at the Rainbow and Yovimpa Point parking lot at the south end of the Scenic Drive. Either the Yovimpa or Rainbow Point trailhead may be used to access this loop.<br /> <br /> A backcountry hiking map with mileage is available at the Visitor Center. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/backcountryinfo.htm\">More information</a></p> <h3>Permits Required</h3> <p>A Backcountry Permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry. Permits may be purchased at the Visitor Center from 9 am - 12:30 pm and 1:30 pm to 6 pm. Backcountry campsites are limited to 6 people per regular site, and 15 people per group site.</p> <h3>No Fires Permitted</h3> <p>Though gas-powered cooking stoves are allowed, no open fires are allowed anywhere in the park outside of North and Sunset Campground's established fire rings.</p> <h3>Bears and Other Wildlife</h3> <p>Bryce Canyon is home to many animals including mountain lions, coyotes and black bears. Squirrels, snakes and other small animals may also be present near your campsite.<br /> Due to the presence of black bears within Bryce Canyon National Park, the use of bear-resistant food canisters on overnight backcountry hikes is highly recommended. Bear-resistant canisters are available for loan, free of charge, at the Visitor Center.</p> <h3>Transportation</h3> <p>No park-provided transportation is provided south of Bryce Point. You can arrange a private shuttle using approved providers listed on our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/brca/planyourvisit/commercial-tours-and-services.htm\">Commercial Tours and Services</a> page.</p>",

Below you and to either side are beautiful exposures of Bryce Canyon's Pink Cliffs, soft limey mudstones colored by iron-oxide (rust) being shaped into beautiful forms by rain and the power frost-wedging ice. Below them, obscured in part by forest, are the soft marine shales and silts of the Grey Cliffs. Beyond these are deep canyons carved into the sandstones of the White Cliffs, which are also beautifully exposed at Zion National Park further west. Note the feature known as \"Molly's Nipple\", which appears like a conical mountain among the White Cliffs. This is not a dormant volcano, but instead an area capped with a more erosion-resistant form of sandstone. The bottom two steps--the Vermillion Cliffs as well as the Chocolate Cliffs are dificult to discern from this distance. The horizon is the Kaibab Upwarp, which forms the northern rim of Grand Canyon. The five cliffs of the Grand Staircase that extend from this point to the Kaibab Upwarp contain one of the world's most complete sedimentary records of the last 300 million years of life and environment on the planet.</p> <h4>To the Southeast</h4> <p>Navajo Mountain looms on the distant horizon over 80 miles away near Page, Arizona. Called a laccolith, Navajo Mountain can be thought of as a volcano that never quite happened. As the Colorado Plateau was uplifted by tectonic forces, a plume of molten rock moved upward from deep inside the Earth causing a swelling much like a large blister. Unlike a volcano, Navajo Mountain never blew its top and so the plume cooled slowly, creating the hard core of the mountain that still exists today.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A path runs adjacent to the plateaus edge and is enclosed with a horizontal log railing. This overlook offers a view to the south and includes a large portion of the sequence of rock layers called the Grand Staircase: step-like cliffs, each step or rock layer is made from hard, colorful sedimentary rocks beginning at the bottom with chocolate colored Mudstone, Vermilion mudstone and sandstone, White sandstone, Grey Shales and Pink Limestones. The canyon stretches on for miles and below the valleys are covered in a dense green carpet of forest with only the plateau edges and steep cliffs of pink and orange rock void of any vegetation.",

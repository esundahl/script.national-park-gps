When the larvae emerge from the eggs, they initially bore into the nutritious inner bark and eventually tunnel through the wood before developing into adult beetles. Some boreholes may be seen if you look closely at these snags.</p> <p>The longhorned beetled and the other insects found on the snags are an important food for many types of birds.

Maybe even uplifting!<br /> <br /> As a matter of fact, it took an uplifting event to create these beautiful hills. Geologists estimate that about 60 to 65 million years ago two large land masses to the west began to collide. This collision created the Rocky Mountains, but also produced a rippling effect in the earth's crust producing the dome mountains that we now call the Black Hills.<br /> <br /> The Rockies and the Black Hills greatly influence weather by creating a barrier for storms. Clouds, coming from the north ro west, are forced upward and cooled causing moisture to be released in the northern hills, or to be diverted around the hills. This accounts for the dry climate here.<br /> <br /> Take a moment to enjoy this magnificent landscape. The open spaces and colors combined with the gentle hills make it truly memorable.",

Where ecosystems meet is called an edge. This edge is exciting becasue it has characteristics of the forest, prairie and riparian areas, making it very diverse. Forest animals, such as deer and elk, feed along the edges during dawn and dusk then return to the shelter of the forest during the day. Edges provide both food and shelter, which is why you will often see more wildlife in these areas.<br /> <br /> Edges are constantly changing. As the trees drop pine cones onto the prairie, seedlings begin to grow. When fire sweeps across the land it burns the young seedlings, reclaiming land for the prairie. In years between fires, seedlings again flourish. This cycle has occurred throughout history under natural conditions. As you hike look for signs of the fire cycle. Also, think about why many animals prefer to live \"life on the edge.\"",

For instance, you might find yourself asking, \"why am I suddenly walking in a ponderosa pine forest? Why is it here?\" For an answer, you need to consider two things, moisture and soil. <br /> <br /> Moisture is necessary in every community. The movement of water through the soil and the amount of water available to vegetation is influenced by soil texture. Because ponderosa pine trees grow best on well-drained, silty soils they are usually found on the park's hilltops where this type of soil exists. These pines seldom grow in the middle of the prairie due to unfavorable soil conditions and a lack of moisture.<br /> <br /> Moisture is also important for the germination of pine seeds. Once germinated, the nourishment contained in the seed enables it to send down a fast-growing tap root. Because this root grows deeply, the seedling can better survive wind and drought. Look for seedlings as you walk. Do they grow close together or far apart? Why would this happen?",

    "bodyText": "For many years, a bear wearing a ranger's hat and dungarees has described forest fires solely in destructive terms. While Smokey has done a great job of reminding us to be careful with fire, we must be aware that fire can also be a friend. <br /> <br /> Consider these ponderosa pines. They are prolific and under the right conditions, like the ones found here, many seedlings will survive. This creates very dense stands of small trees like you see beyond the fence. Because of competition for nutrients, moisture, and sunlight, few seedlings grow into mature trees. Historically, fire has prevented the trees from becoming overcrowded by killing many of the smaller ones. This thinning also allows more sunlight to reach the ground encouraging grasses to grow on the forest floor. As you walk the path, notice how fire has thinned out the forest yet left many trees standing. <br /> <br /> Although fire is beneficial to the forest, human structures and lives must be protected. Today, the National Park Service is using prescribed fire, one started under carefully calculated conditions, to keep the soil and vegetation healthy and in a more natural state. ",

    "bodyText": "If a contest were held to select the world's greatest teacher, Mother Nature would receive many votes. Her style is unique in that she teaches from example and rarely announces an exam. As a student of nature, you will need to do lots of field work - closely observe and expect the unexpected. <br /> <br /> Because fire can be beneficial or destructive, it is a hard lesson to learn. But destruction is often greater when we interfere with its natural cycle. Since the first Euro-American settlements in the 1880s until the early 1970s, fire was immediately suppressed. As a result, many of the forests have become crowded and stagnant with large amounts of forest debris. Increases in dead material has meant more fuel is available to produce hotter, more destructive fires.<br /> <br /> At Wind Cave National Park, managers are attempting to catch up with the fire cycle, yet reduce the odds of fire spreading to buildings or neighboring lands. To reduce fuels, managers remove part of the forest's understory. The tree stumps in front of you serve as an example. However, beyond the fence no fuels were removed. In 1991, a wildfire burned this area. Comparing the forest beyond the fence with the one here, you can see how fuel removal reduced the severity of the fire in the campground. Removal of fuels may become less common as prescribed burns allow us to catch up with fire's natural cycle.",

    "bodyText": "Thank you for hiking Elk Mountain Nature Trail. You have seen and experienced a lot in a short time. As you've seen the prairie, forest and riparian ecosystems blend to create a truly spectacular landscape. However, when viewing the park over a distance it is easy to conclude that the land, with its gentle rolling hills, lacks complexity. This deception in itself is amazing. In a way the terrain is somewhat like the sea. From the shore it appears to be little more than rolling waves. Who would suspect, without close examination, that below the surface lies a complex web of life that may never be fully understood? That complexity and the forces that make it possible are important to a balanced ecology. <br /> <br /> Wind Cave National Park is working to protect this balance by allowing natural processes to continue to shape the land. This is a difficult task. There are many challenges to be met, such as the encroachment of non-native plants onto the prairie and misunderstandings of the importance of fire.<br /> <br /> As you travel across the prairie, along the riparian habitat or through the forest, think of the broad spectrum of life that each supports. Also, remember that the park's staff is eager to disucss natural resources and the challenges that lie ahead.",

An American Army engineer who died in the siege of Fort Erie, Ontario, on the Canadian front of the War of 1812. Lt. Col. Wood was born in New York City and graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1806.</p><h3>What is it made out of?</h3><p>The exterior walls of the fort are covered with a grey-blue granite from Blue Hill, Maine. The granite is bonded to the rubble masonry walls with concrete. Most of the work was completed during the summers of 1845-1847. Remember, this work couldn't be completed in the below freezing temperatures of a winter in New York Harbor. </p>",

    "audioDescription": "Statue of Liberty front and Why is the Statue Green<br /><br />527 words Length: 2:07<br /><br />The Statue of Liberty is a 151 feet tall female figure wearing a Grecian style robe pinned at her left shoulder. Her right arm is raised up at an eighty degree angle, and she holds a torch with a golden flame. Her left arm is bent at the elbow, close to her left side. In her left hand, she holds a tablet inscribed \"July IV MDCCLXXVI\". On her head she wears a circular crown with seven triangular shaped rays extending across the front. Each ray is nine feet long. The base of the crown has twenty-five windows for viewing the New York Harbor and beyond.<br /><br />The statue sits on an eighty-nine-foot tall granite pedestal. The four-sided pedestal has three viewing windows on each side. It rises above a sixty-five-foot tall granite and cement base in the shape of an eleven pointed star. The total height of the statue from the ground to the tip of the torch is 305 feet, the equivalent of a 22-story building.<br /><br />About 100 feet to the left of the statue, there is an informational wayside sign entitled \"Why is the Statue Green?\". It sits at the edge of the walkway on a concrete slab angled 45 degrees front to back. The sign is two feet tall by three feet wide. The background of the sign is an extreme close up of the folds of Lady Liberty's robe rendered in orange and red tones. It gives an impressionistic sense of light and shadow. The text reads: \"The answer is in the air. The Statue's skin is made of copper, and when copper is exposed to oxygen in the air, it undergoes a chemical reaction called oxidation. The reaction causes a fine crust or film to develop that is usually green in color. This layer protects the original metal underneath. In copper and bronze, this natural protective process is called patination. It took nearly thirty years for the Statue to turn from her original copper color to the green you see today. The patination process can also be observed on buildings where copper or bronze are used for roofing or ornamentation such as the ferry dock on Liberty Island and on the roof and domes of the Immigration Station at Ellis Island.\"<br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />To the right of the text is a vertical black and white photograph of the statue. The caption reads: \"Statue of Liberty, ca. 1900, still displaying original copper color.\"<br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />There is a square color photograph to the right of the black and white photograph that shows the Custom House with its green copper roof. The photograph is taken from a position across the street and just slightly more elevated than the roof. The caption reads: \"Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House/One Bowling Green, Manhattan/Built 1901-1907/Cass Gilbert, Architect\"<br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />On the far right is a color photograph of the Trump Building's tent-shaped copper roof. The sky behind is clear blue with white clouds. The building is surrounded by several other Lower Manhattan buildings, both old and modern. The caption reads: \"The Trump Building/40 Wall Street, Manhattan./Built 1929-1920./H. Craig Severance, Architect.\"<br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />End of Message",

The skyline of Manhattan lies ahead. Ellis Island is at eleven o'clock. The Brooklyn Bridge is at one o'clock. The water's edge is bordered by a ten-foot-wide red brick path with a three-foot tall black metal guard rail. The guard rail is just over three-feet high, with black posts spaced every four feet and rectangles of black metal mesh on the bottom two-thirds. There are four coin-operated viewfinders nearby and an informational wayside sign entitled \"Manhattan Skyline\".<br /><br />The two-feet by four-feet wayside sign sits on a triangular shaped black granite pedestal angled at forty-five degrees front to back. The pedestal is elevated on a twenty foot-long black granite rectangular base that is about two feet high. The background of the sign is a photograph of the Manhattan skyline against blue sky. The text reads: \"In 1886, the Statue of Liberty standing on her pedestal stood taller than any other structure in New York City. At 305 feet one inch, 92.9 meters, it exceeded even the Brooklyn Bridge, which had been completed three years earlier. However, the statue was soon surpassed in height by the forest of tall buildings which gave Manhattan its world famous skyline.\"<br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />The following structures are labeled: Empire State Building, 1 World Trade Center, Bank of Manhattan, U.S. Customs House, Citibank Farmer's Trust Company, Brooklyn Bridge\"<br /><br />Three are three rectangular photographs across the bottom of the sign, inserted over the waters of the harbor. They show the changing skyline through the decades.<br /><br />The first photograph is black and white. It is captioned: \"Lower Manhattan Skyline, 1908\". Two buildings are identified in the photograph: Singer Building 1908-1970 and U.S. Customs House 1907.\"<br /><br />To the right of 1908 photograph, there is a black and white photograph captioned: \"Lower Manhattan Skyline, 1934\".

They sit on a three-inch high circular granite base. Two more viewfinders are on the other side of the granite base, close to the harbor barrier. A fifth viewfinder is twenty-five feet to the right, mounted on a metal pole that extends two foot into the walkway next to the harbor barricade.<br /><br />End of Message",

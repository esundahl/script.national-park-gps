The approximate location of Fort Sackville is near where the George Rogers Clark Memorial stands today. This fort would be in the same area as the French built fur trading post that started Vincennes in 1732.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fe570d19-b1ba-45cb-a66d-35d2df84078f}{43}\" paraid=\"1179633871\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>British Occupation </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fe570d19-b1ba-45cb-a66d-35d2df84078f}{61}\" paraid=\"1021207182\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">British Lieutenant Governor Edward Abbott arrived in Vincennes on April 19, 1777, and immediately organized the villagers into three companies of militia. Shortly after his arrival, Abbott was alarmed by a number of Native Americans who freely roamed the town.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fe570d19-b1ba-45cb-a66d-35d2df84078f}{73}\" paraid=\"1832799697\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">As a result, a courier was sent to Kaskaskia with orders for Commander Philippe de Rocheblave to send four pieces of artillery from Fort Gage. Abbott then ordered a stockade built around the two-story headquarters building. By fall 1777 Vincennes militia completed the stockade. Abbott left Vincennes on February 5, 1778 due to not receiving any support from the British Government.   </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fe570d19-b1ba-45cb-a66d-35d2df84078f}{104}\" paraid=\"1212312209\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>First Capture by the Americans  </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fe570d19-b1ba-45cb-a66d-35d2df84078f}{122}\" paraid=\"1773811292\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">In August 1778, Captain Leonard Helm took several men to the abandoned fort and claimed it for the Americans. The townspeople of Vincennes welcomed the arrival of Helm and his men because they had been encouraged by local priest Father Gibualt to support the Americans rather than the English. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fe570d19-b1ba-45cb-a66d-35d2df84078f}{134}\" paraid=\"263800909\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">British Lieutenant Governor Henry Hamilton wrote in his journal upon hearing that the Americans (rebels) had taken Fort Sackville:  </p> <blockquote> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fe570d19-b1ba-45cb-a66d-35d2df84078f}{146}\" paraid=\"626292920\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">This Evening (14th) Neegik brother to Chamintawa whom I had sent to the Miamis for intelligence, arrived-- He told me he had met the gros Loup, (a Miamis Chief) who acquainted him with what had passed at St. Vincennes in a conference with the Rebels-- On their arrival at that place they pulled down the English Flag left there by Governor Abbott, wrapp'd a stone in it, and threw it into the Ouabache-- They convened the Savages, and told them they did not come with any bad design against them-- They then presented them with two belts, one red, the other green, telling them if they were disposed for war, to take the first, if for peace the latter-- </p> </blockquote> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fe570d19-b1ba-45cb-a66d-35d2df84078f}{152}\" paraid=\"1388990861\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>British Retake the Fort </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fe570d19-b1ba-45cb-a66d-35d2df84078f}{170}\" paraid=\"269903167\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">On December 17, 1778, Lieutenant Governor Henry Hamilton--Abbott’s successor-- arrived at Fort Sackville with companies of British soldiers, French militia from Detroit, and Native American allies. Captain Helm and his men would be taken prisoner by the British. Hamilton was dismayed at the condition of the fort. Work parties immediately turned out to correct the deficiencies. At first Hamilton planned to take the walls down and build a new triangular fort with a blockhouse at each corner. Major Jehu Hay, Hamilton’s second in command, offered a different idea to use what was already in place. Hay’s plan called for leaving the stockade but reducing the angles and making it more of a square and constructing two blockhouses. One blockhouse would be at the northeast angle the other at the southwest. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fe570d19-b1ba-45cb-a66d-35d2df84078f}{176}\" paraid=\"667790820\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Rebuilding a Fort </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fe570d19-b1ba-45cb-a66d-35d2df84078f}{224}\" paraid=\"1162687741\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Work on rebuilding Fort Sackville progressed rapidly. Priorities in construction were given to a powder magazine, where all the King’s gunpowder was to be stored. Between December 28 and February 22nd, construction included  additional barracks, two blockhouses complete with gunports and defenses, cannon mounts, straightening of exterior stockade walls, as well as fixing the parade ground and digging a well.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fe570d19-b1ba-45cb-a66d-35d2df84078f}{242}\" paraid=\"1748555748\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Time Runs Out </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{40405757-819d-4b35-b184-8ee0e10fd3a1}{5}\" paraid=\"1886704149\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Despite Hamilton’s continued dissatisfaction with the fort’s weaknesses, George Rogers Clark's imminent arrival would prevent him from making additional strategic improvements.  Clark would attack the fort on February 23, 1779, Hamilton’s concerns about Fort Sackville's deficiencies proved well-founded, as the fort’s flaws contributed to the British surrender. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{40405757-819d-4b35-b184-8ee0e10fd3a1}{23}\" paraid=\"1356939196\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>The Surrender and the end of a Fort </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{40405757-819d-4b35-b184-8ee0e10fd3a1}{41}\" paraid=\"910758184\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">In his journal, Hamilton states some of the reasons he considered for surrender,  </p> <blockquote> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{40405757-819d-4b35-b184-8ee0e10fd3a1}{47}\" paraid=\"548434336\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The Stockades had originally been so ill set up, that a man might pass his closed fist between them, which gave a great advantage to people armed with rifles- The Fort was nearly surrounded by houses or other buildings . . . - The N.E. Angle of the fort projected over the sandy bank of the river, & could have been undermined by the assailants under cover.</p> </blockquote> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{40405757-819d-4b35-b184-8ee0e10fd3a1}{59}\" paraid=\"314268846\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">After Hamilton surrenders, the fort is renamed Fort Patrick Henry in honor of the Virginia Governor who sent Clark out to take the forts in the west. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{40405757-819d-4b35-b184-8ee0e10fd3a1}{71}\" paraid=\"874299346\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">At the end of the American Revolution, the fort was abandoned and quickly scavenged for materials by the locals.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{a43f3b14-2b0a-4b74-bd94-90e4c60e4220}{185}\" paraid=\"973181804\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>After the Revolution </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{40405757-819d-4b35-b184-8ee0e10fd3a1}{83}\" paraid=\"2035174980\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">In 1787, due to conflict between Native Americans and American colonists, Major John Hamtramck was sent Vincennes to defend the colonists. The deteriorated condition of what remained of Fort Patrick Henry dictated the construction of a brand new fortification. This new fort was built just to the north of the Fort Sackville site and was called Fort Knox. These defenses were occupied for several years before conflicts between the locals and the soldiers required them to stay near the fort. A new fort, Fort Knox II, was built outside of town. During the War of 1812 Fort Knox II was disassembled and floated down the river to be rebuilt on the site of Fort Sackville to better protect the town. After it was abandoned materials from the fort would end up in buildings nearby.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{a43f3b14-2b0a-4b74-bd94-90e4c60e4220}{192}\" paraid=\"2146491828\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Finding Fort Sackville </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{40405757-819d-4b35-b184-8ee0e10fd3a1}{107}\" paraid=\"159090143\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">From 1969 to 1971, Indiana University conducted archeological investigations north of the George Rogers Clark Memorial. Some 18th century artifacts were discovered along with 19th century odds and ends. Portions of stockade walls were discovered however, identification of their origin was inconclusive. Due to the proximity of the 1732 French fur trading post stockade, Fort Sackville/Fort Patrick Henry, and a War of 1812 era Fort Knox III, all located on the site, it was impossible to tell which fort those stockades had been a part of.  </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>An intense interest in commemorating the great accomplishments of George Rogers Clark had developed among the citizens of Vincennes and the state of Indiana during the early 1920s as the 150th anniversary of the American Revolution neared. After various proposals had been considered, President Calvin Coolidge signed into law a resolution establishing the George Rogers Clark Sesquicentennial Commission on May 23, 1928.</p> <p>The 15-member commission was created for the purpose of \"designing and constructing at or near the site of Fort Sackville . . . a permanent memorial, commemorating the winning of the Old Northwest and the achievements of George Rogers Clark and his associates. \" President Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the memorial June 14, 1936. In 1940, the memorial became a unit of the Indiana Department of Conservation.</p> <p>In 1966, Congress made the building and grounds a part of the National Park Service. The measure was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson during a ceremony at the memorial on July 23, 1966.</p> <p>The Clark Memorial is more than 80 feet high and is 90 feet across at the base. The walls are two feet thick. The exterior is composed of granite from Vermont, Minnesota, and Alabama. Towering over the entrance is an eagle with outspread wings. Above the 16 Doric columns is an inscription which reads: \"The Conquest of the West - George Rogers Clark and The Frontiersmen of the American Revolution.\"</p> <p>Inside the rotunda are seven murals, each created on a single piece of Belgium linen 16 feet by 28 feet. They were painted by Ezra Winter during a period of approximately two and a half years. Hermon Atkins MacNeil, designer of the Standing Liberty quarter, sculptured the bronze statue of Clark. Three of Clark's quotations are inscribed in the memorial: \"Great things have been effected by a few men well conducted;\" \"Our cause is just . . . our country will be grateful;\" and \"If a country is not worth protecting it is not worth claiming.\" There are Roman numerals at three locations. Left of the steps are the numerals, 1931, the year construction of the memorial began.</p> <p>Above the memorial's entrance door are the Roman numerals for the years, 1779 and 1933. In 1779, Clark captured Fort Sackville from the British and in 1933, the memorial was completed. Clark's birth and death years of 1752 and 1818 encircle the statue's base.</p> <p>It is highly fitting that the nation honors the great individuals and deeds of the past. Certain things do not change. The virtues that Clark and his men exhibited transcend an era. A memorial such as this serves as a reminder that courage, fortitude, and valor do not go out of style. The truly great heroes of history age well and provide guidance for the future.</p> <p>To learn more about the history of the Memorial, please read the Historic Structures Report/Historical Data written by Edwin C. Bearss (1970).</p>",

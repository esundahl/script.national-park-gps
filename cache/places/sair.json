The blast furnace is where bog ore was smelted to create cast iron \"pig\" bars. To do this, three types of raw materials were brought over the charging bridge and loaded into the chimney of the furnace.</p> <ul> <li>Bog ore is an iron-rich rock that was harvested locally from bogs and similar bodies of water. It was also found in fields and meadows that used to be bogs. Bog ore is often considerably less than 50% iron. The rest of the rock was made up of impurities that the workers had to remove.</li> <li>Charcoal was needed to fuel a fire that would burn hot enough to smelt the ore. Charcoal production was very labor intensive and required the work of many woodcutters, carters, and colliers who oversaw the conversion of seasoned wood into charcoal.</li> <li>Gabbro was used as a flux; a way to purify the ore. When gabbro was melted with bog ore, the impurities in the ore latched onto elements in the gabbro. All of those impurities floated to the surface while the dense iron sunk to the bottom, creating a separation of good iron from the waste.</li> </ul>",

The bars of pig iron were first brought to the finery hearths. Here, they went through a complex process where portions of the bar were melted and allowed to cool multiple times. This helped burn off much of the excess carbon in the bars, which had made them too brittle to work with. Eventually, the red hot iron was consolidated into a mass called a bloom, which was removed from the hearth for further work.<br /> <br /> Workers used sledge hammers to break off a shell of impurities that formed during the refining process. After consolidating the bloom a bit with the sledge hammers, the workers used a 500 pound trip hammer to further solidify the iron and change it into a more easily managed shape. The iron was first shaped into a rough brick called a loop. The loop was then hammered in the center to stretch it out. The iron had to be red hot for this to work, so it was reheated in the chafery hearth in the later steps of the process. Eventually, the iron was hammered into a semi-finished product called a merchant bar.<br /> <br /> While the pig iron bars were made of cast iron, and could not be worked, these merchant bars were now made of wrought iron, and could be heated and reshaped. Merchant bars were the main product that the iron works created and sold to blacksmiths. The blacksmiths are the ones who made finished products out of them.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Iron Works House is the only structure at Saugus Iron Works that survives from the 1600s. The company agent may have lived in it while the iron works was in operation, but its date of construction is unknown. The earliest recorded occupant, Samuel Appleton Jr., bought the Saugus Iron Works in 1676 (after it closed) and lived in the house from 1681 to 1688. <br /> <br /> By the early 1800s the house had been greatly altered from its original state and was being used to house mill workers. Over the years, it was home to many occupants. Its appearance changed as style changed, but most of the structure remained original.</p> <p>Its rescue and restoration efforts are owed to a photographer named Wallace Nutting who dramatically changed the appearance of the house when he purchased it in 1915. Nutting bought the house to use as a tourist attraction, a studio for colonial-themed photography, and to showcase his collection of antique furniture. He restored the house to what he thought it would have looked like in the 1600s, giving it the appearance we see today. Nutting sold the property in 1920.<br /> <br /> Some rooms contain period and reproduction furnishings to show what life would have been like for those who lived here in the 1600s. Other rooms have exhibits about Wallace Nutting and home construction at the time.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Rolling and Slitting Mill was advanced technology for its time period. In fact, when the original Rolling and Slitting Mill was built, there were only around 12 buildings like this in the world, all of the rest in the Old World.<br /> <br /> In this building, merchant bars were further worked to create other semi-finished products that blacksmiths could use. First, the bars were heated in a reverberatory furnace to make them malleable. Next, the bars went through pairs of rollers, dense iron cylinders with a small gap between them. This reshaped the bars into flat stock. These \"flats\" could be used to make wagon tires, saw blades, and other products.<br /> <br /> Many of the flats were sold as they were, but others were reheated in the reverberatory furnace and put through the next set of machinery; the slitters. The slitters are a pair of interlocking discs that spin in opposite directions. When a heated flat is forced between them, the discs break it up into many smaller rods of iron. These products were primarily used for making nails, and were therefore called \"nail rods.\"<br /> <br /> Both flats and nail rods were semi-finished goods that helped a blacksmith save a lot of time, and therefore save money.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Saugus River flows from Lake Quannapowitt in Wakefield to the Atlantic Ocean just south of Nahant. From the vantage point of the ocean, the river feels its last influence of the tides at the site where the iron works was built. The contour of the riverbed at that location provided the opportunity to use the change in river elevation to operate the machinery. <br /> <br /> The river drops sharply down a steep slope (fall line) from a higher elevation plateau upstream of the iron works site to a lower floodplain at the site's turning basin. This sharp drop in river elevation provided the iron works builders / operators with the opportunity to bring river water to the upper level of the site where it was directed into the large waterwheels that powered the iron works machinery before being discharged back into river at a lower elevation.<br /> <br /> Water was needed to run the wheels that powered the machinery in each building. Therefore, the Saugus River was dammed upstream in the 1640s to create a large reservoir. A shallow waterway was cut from the resulting 230-acre reservoir to a smaller holding pond located just behind the iron works. Sluiceways brought water from the holding pond to each building, where it turned water wheels powering bellows, the trip hammer, and the rolling and slitting machinery. After the water provided its power, it vented back to the river through the tailraces of the iron works.<br /> <br /> In the 17th century the iron works dam was fraught with controversy. Agreements were made early on that the level of water was not to go any higher than a predetermined point on a reference rock in the pond. Despite this, under new management, the dam was built higher by the iron works. The additional stored water flooded more farmland and floated a bridge that resulted in a horse falling through it and then a lawsuit. The iron works was forced to pay the farmer for the flooded land.<br /> <br /> Also, when the initial dam was built, it immediately terminated the run of anadromous fish, especially alewives. Settlers upriver used the fish for food and manuring their fields. When the iron works ceased operation, the local community petitioned the authorities to have the dam removed with no success. They took it upon themselves to remove the dam in the dark of night with the assistance of a dog and some others to act as lookouts along with a signal musket. Over the course of two attempts they re-established the natural flow of the Saugus River.</p>",

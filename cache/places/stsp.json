If they could capture the city—the third largest in the United States and a commercial and shipbuilding hub—they could likely bring the war to an end. Military and civilians, including free and enslaved African Americans, rallied to fend off the British.<br /> <br /> On September 12-14, 1814, the British attacked by land from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/stsp/learn/historyculture/battle-of-north-point.htm\">North Point</a> and by water at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fomc/learn/historyculture/the-bombardment-of-fort-mchenry.htm\">Fort McHenry</a> on the Patapsco.

Located in Dundalk, MD, the park was dedicated in 1839 to honor the Maryland militia who fought against the British forces.<br /> <br /> The park's large “Home of the Brave” mural highlights the region’s role during the War of 1812 through five separate images. The main image is a depiction of the Battle of North Point with American militia troops engaging British soldiers en route to Baltimore City. On either side of the center image are portraits of the two military leaders for the conflict, with U.S. Brigadier General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/stsp/learn/historyculture/john-stricker.htm\">John Stricker</a> on the left and British Major General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-ross.htm\">Robert Ross </a>on the right. The final two flanking panels showcase Todd’s Inheritance, a signal house and horse courier station during the war, and the 25th anniversary commemoration event where the original Star-Spangled Banner was spread across the stage. The mural, created by artist Marshall Adams and unveiled in 2014, runs along the park's western boundary on an exterior wall of a business, across the street from the <a href=\"https://dnr.maryland.gov/publiclands/Pages/central/NorthPointBattlefield.aspx\">North Point State Battlefield.</a>",

In late summer, visitors can enjoy splashes of color provided by cardinal-flower and the threatened red turtlehead (Chelone obliqua). In the evening, one may also hear the quick trill of the arboreal gray treefrog. Visitors can enjoy several hiking trails that lead through the property.</p> <p>Battle Creek Cypress Swamp encompasses about 100 acres of cypress swamp and surrounding upland woods. It was purchased in 1977 by The Nature Conservancy and is currently leased and operated by Calvert County Parks and Recreation.

Other environmental and history programs are also offered on-site.<br /> <br /> The park itself directly links to the hiking and biking trails of the Anacostia Tributary Trail System and the Anacostia River Trail. Boat ramps as well as kayak and canoe launches are also available on-site. <h2>History</h2> <p><em>War of 1812</em></p> A wooden bridge just upriver from the present-day park became the focal point on August 24, 1814, when American and British forces clashed in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/stsp/learn/historyculture/battle-of-bladensburg.htm\">Battle of Bladensburg</a>. By the time the Americans realized that the British invasion force was heading to Washington, they had little time to prepare. <br /> <br /> The British veteran force of 4,500 had marched for four days carrying loaded packs in near 100-degree heat. This included a contingent of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/stsp/learn/historyculture/colonial-marines.htm\">Colonial Marines</a>, formerly enslaved men from the Chesapeake region who had sought their freedom with the British.  There were 6,000 Americans, including regulars, Chesapeake Flotilla crewmen, marines, and inexperienced militia.<br /> <br /> At 1:00p.m. the British stormed the bridge.<br /> <br /> The opposing troops clashed in three hours of intense fighting. Though superior in number, most of the American defensive forces were poorly trained, ill-equipped, and positioned so the lines could not support one another. They were no match for the seasoned British army. <br /> <br /> President James Madison and several cabinet members were on the field of battle that day. Seeing the start of an American rout, they beat a hasty retreat to Washington, sending word ahead to warn others to save what possessions they could and flee. After a few hours of rest, the British then moved on to Washington, D.C. <br />  ",

Located near the White House at the northwestern corner of Lafayette Square, Decatur commissioned the house as his family’s Washington residence where he entertained friends and dignitaries. After Decatur’s death in a duel in 1820, the property temporarily housed several prominent Washington statesmen including Senator Henry Clay and future-president Martin Van Buren. During the 19th century, the Decatur House served as a social center for Washington’s elite and as a residence for many prominent Washington politicians and foreign envoys.  <br /> <br /> Born in 1779 on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in a small fishing town, Stephen Decatur was the son of a merchant seaman who fought the British and French Navies during the Revolutionary War. As a teenager, Decatur joined the fledgling American Navy and distinguished himself as an able fighter and skilled seaman in the Quasi-War (1798-1800) with the French Republic. After being promoted to the rank of lieutenant, Decatur battled the Barbary Pirates in North Africa and successfully raided Tripoli Harbor in 1804. His actions in the southern Mediterranean won Decatur international fame and earned him the captaincy of the USS <em>Philadelphia</em> at the age of twenty-five. During the War of 1812, Decatur was further promoted to the rank of Commodore and won glory after the capture of the British Warship HMS<em> Macedonian</em> off the coast of the Azores.  <br /> <br /> With money acquired from his capture of the British frigate <em>Macedonian</em>, Decatur and his wife, Susan Wheeler Decatur, commissioned famed architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe to design an elegant three-story, Federal-style brick mansion at the northwest corner of Lafayette Square near the White House in Washington D.C. Latrobe, who designed nearby St. John’s Episcopal Church and the White House portico, was instructed by the Decatur’s to create a luxurious private residence “fit for entertaining.” Latrobe’s design included spacious double-drawing rooms that allowed the family to host balls and other social gatherings attended by Washington’s political elite and European dignitaries. Commodore Decatur had lived in the house for only fourteen months when he was killed in a duel with Commodore James Barron in March of 1820 after Decatur publicly criticized Barron’s capture by British forces in 1807. <br /> <br /> After her husband’s death, Sarah Decatur relocated to Georgetown and rented the house to a series of foreign diplomats. During this period, Decatur House became the unofficial residence of the U.S. Secretaries of State including Henry Clay, Martin Van Buren, and Edward Livingston who successively occupied the property between 1827 and 1833. After becoming heavily indebted, Susan Decatur sold Decatur House to John Gadsby in 1836, a prominent Washington area hotelier. Gadsby purchased the Decatur House as a retirement home for him and his family and moved ten enslaved individuals from his National Hotel to reside and work at the property. After Gadsby’s death in 1844, his wife, Providence, leased the property for twelve years during which time it was occupied by Vice President George M. Dallas and Senator Judah P. Benjamin. In 1871, the Decatur House was purchased by California statesman Edward Beale whose family owned the property until 1952 when it was donated to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Decatur House served as one of the first headquarters of the National Trust and as the Trust’s first house museum property. In 1967, the property was designated a National Historic Landmark and became a public museum. The property is currently leased to the White House Historical Association.<br /> <br /> Generations of enslaved families lived and worked at the Decatur House prior to Emancipation. The quarters where the enslaved workers lived still stands today as a rare example of an extant urban slave dwelling in the nation’s capital. Many of the prominent American politicians living at Decatur House enslaved people who resided and worked at the property. One enslaved resident, Charlotte Dupuy sued her owner, noted politician and statesman Henry Clay, for her freedom triggering a lengthy legal battle that eventually resulted in her emancipation in 1840. Throughout his ownership of the Decatur House, John Gadsby purchased and sold many slaves, often from outside of Washington D.C. with the explicit intent to sever family connections. Gadsby owned several enslaved individuals that worked at the Decatur House and were housed in the two-story structure facing H Street.<br /> <br /> The Decatur House is both an architectural landmark and a historical landmark as the first private residence in the neighborhood of the White House and as one of the few remaining residential designs of renowned Architect of the Capital Benjamin Henry Latrobe. Throughout its two-hundred years of existence, the Decatur House has been the residence of many influential American politicians and military figures of the 19th century and a site of enslavement for generations of African Americans. Through the legacy of the individuals that resided and worked there and through its architectural expression, the Decatur House remains a symbol of the United States’ growing political and cultural ambitions during the 19th century. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3a9e30b2-99e3-4ffe-800a-df461f381c0b}{248}\" paraid=\"2013037136\"><br /> <u>Sources:</u> </p> <p paraeid=\"{3a9e30b2-99e3-4ffe-800a-df461f381c0b}{254}\" paraid=\"1195789854\">Allison, Robert J.  <br /> 2005 Stephen Decatur: American Naval Hero, 1779-1820, University of Massachusetts Press, Boston, MA </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{19}\" paraid=\"558016836\">De Kay, James T.  <br /> 2004 A Rage for Glory: The Life of Commodore Stephen Decatur, Free Press Publishers, New York, NY </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{39}\" paraid=\"480689417\">Long, David F.  <br /> 1979 William Bainbridge and the Barron-Decatur Duel: Mere Participant or Active Plotter?, The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 103, No. 1 </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{59}\" paraid=\"214562037\">National Park Service, <br /> American Federation of Labor Building National Register of Historic Places Inventory- Nomination Form, National Park Service, Department of Labor  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{79}\" paraid=\"1203683834\">White House Historical Association <br /> The Historic Decatur House, White House Association Website, <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/the-historic-decatur-house\">https://www.whitehousehistory.org/the-historic-decatur-house</a></p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{116}\" paraid=\"1655579538\">White House Historical Association <br /> Commodore Stephen Decatur: An Early American Naval War Hero, White House Association Website, <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/commodore-stephen-decatur-an-early-american-naval-war-hero\">https://www.whitehousehistory.org/commodore-stephen-decatur-an-early-american-naval-war-hero</a></p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{143}\" paraid=\"1539173108\">White House Historical Association  <br /> Slavery in the President’s Neighborhood Press Collection, White House Historical Association Press Collection, <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/press-room/press-collections/slavery-in-the-presidents-neighborhood-press-collection\">https://www.whitehousehistory.org/press-room/press-collections/slavery-in-the-presidents-neighborhood-press-collection</a><br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{166}\" paraid=\"1746462312\"><a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/117691809\">NHL Nomination</a>  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f801bced-e89e-4a05-b76e-782e870e038f}{175}\" paraid=\"508302343\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nhl/index.htm\">National Historic Landmarks (NHLs)</a> are historic places that possess exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States.

They also wanted to stifle Fells Point---the home port for many of the privateers that preyed on British merchant ships.

    "bodyText": "<p>In September of 1814, after occupying Washington, D.C. and burning the public buildings, a British invasion force proceeded to Baltimore - a busy port city that specialized in outfitting privateers to prey on British shipping. <br /> <br /> Baltimore represented a more stategically important target than the largely undeveloped capital city of Washington, and was thus well protected by a masonry fort commanding the entrance to Baltimore harbor. After a 25 hour bombardment by the British fleet and determined resistance by the gunners of Fort McHenry, the invasion force was repulsed. <br /> <br /> After two and a half years of indecisive campaigning on the Canadian frontier, America was in debt, weary of war, and facing a trained and disciplined European army. There was no hope of achieving the stated goals of the war: free trade, sailors' rights, and the annexation of Canada. But a victory at Fort McHenry offered hope that the War of 1812 might end on terms agreeable to the United States and that the American republic could endure. <br /> <br /> The feeling of pride, patriotism, and hope emerging from the victory at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fomc/index.htm\">Fort McHenry</a> was recorded by Francis Scott Key, who witnessed the fort's American flag surviving the bomardment and recorded his impressions in the words that became America's national anthem -\"The Star Spangled Banner.\"</p>",

    "audioDescription": "(2016 words)Francis Scott Key Park is located in the southwest corner of the intersection of M street and 34th street, NW in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, DC. The three-fourths of an acre park is adjacent to the northeast corner of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and the park abuts the C&O Canal towpath to the south.Situated at the corner of 34th and M street, is a six-foot long, two-foot tall cement dedication sign set in a flowerbed along the sidewalk.A twelve-foot (3.5 meter) wide, thirty-five-foot (10.5 meter) long brick walkway leads into the park from left of the sign and flowerbed.Inside the park area is a fifty-foot (15 meter) wide circular brick plaza set under a pergola with fourteen limestone columns and draped in wisteria. Twisted vine branches climb the pergola columns under this shaded area. A bed of lily turf sits outside the plaza area and runs back to the sidewalk on the north end. To the right a two-foot tall brick wall rings the outer edge of the plaza. To the left in the plaza are three, three-by-four-foot wayside signs.On the opposite side of the plaza from the walkway entrance, sits a three-foot tall bronze bust statue set atop a four-foot tall oval cement pillar. The bust shows Key in a suit jacket with bow tie and high-collard coat. A one-by-four-inch bronze plaque is set on the center front top of the cement pedestal, directly in from of the bust.Facing the statue, a staircase to the left leads down to the C&O Canal towpath below. Behind the statue a brick walkway runs ninety feet (27 meters) west to the sidewalk at the Key Bridge. A flagpole sits to the left of the walkway at the exit point. Benches are set along the walkway's opposite side. A separate asphalt walkway leads from the left of this exit and runs downhill, behind the park and to the C&O Canal to the south below.Facing the three waysides, the furthest to the right is titled in the top right corner:Francis Scott Key*1779-1843*At the top left of the text below, is a one-inch black and white image of Key in suit and white bow tie. The text describes Key's time living at this location, his dealings with British troops, and the writing of a poem that would become our National Anthem:The author of our National Anthem was a lawyer, patriot, community leader and amateur poet. His home and law office stood approximately 100 yards west of here. Francis Scott Key lived there from 1803 to about 1833 with his wife, the former Mary Tayloe Lloyd of Annapolis, Maryland, and their six sons and five daughters. The house was demolished in 1947 after years of neglect by various owners.During the War of 1812, British Troops had invaded and captured Washington in August of 1814. They set fire to the Capitol, the White House and most Federal buildings. As they withdrew to their ships they took Dr. William Beanes prisoner because he had arrested some stragglers among the British troops for looting.The popular and respected 335-year-old George Town lawyer, Francis Scott Key, came to the aid of friends seeking Dr. Beanes' release. Under a flag of truce approved by President James Madison, Key set sail with Colonel John Stuart Skinner, and American agent for prisoner exchange. They located the British fleet and boarded Admiral Cochrane's Royal Naval Flagship. Key successfully argues for Dr. Beane's release.However, lest they reveal the British plans to attack Fort McHenry and Baltimore, they were detained under guard aboard their ship. Throughout the night of September 13-14, 1814 Key stood on deck watching the bombardment of Ft. McHenry. At dawn Key's anxiety was relieved. Our flag was still there! Key began to compose a poem on the back of a letter.After his release following the British defeat, Key continued work on his poem. On the next day, he showed it to a relative, Joseph Hopper Nicholson, a Fort McHenry defender. Nicholson was so moved he immediately had a broadside of the poem printed and circulated. That poem became The Star-Spangled Banner.Francis Scott Key's law practice continued to flourish. He was three times appointed to the post of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. He was active in anti-slavery causes, advocated the establishment of public schools, negotiated a treaty in 1833 between the Creek Indians and settlers in Alabama, and was a vestryman of St. John's Church as well as a founder of Christ Church in George Town. On a trip to Baltimore in 1843, Francis Scott Key died of pneumonia on January 11 at the home of his eldest daughter, Mrs. Charles Howard. He is buried at Mt. Olivet Cemetery near his birthplace in Frederick, Maryland.The high standards which guided Francis Scott Key's life continue to be an example to all Americans.The right side of the sign features an image of a man in suit, coat, and white knickers, standing atop steps on a ship's railing and looking out at the sea as another man with hat and staff in his right hand looks on from the bottom of the steps. A young boy on the left also looks",

Originally intended as a museum to house important artifacts commemorating the life of George Washington, the building of the Memorial began in 1922, but was not officially completed and opened to the public until 1970. Now one of the most grand and recognizable buildings in the Washington area skyline, the George Washington Masonic National Memorial was designated as a National Historic Monument in 2015. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9f2d9219-042f-4c9e-a32d-4f22ca3e04de}{215}\" paraid=\"1965470763\">Freemasonry is a political and social organization that traces its origins to Medieval British labor collectives of skilled craftsmen called trade guilds. In the 18th century, stone mason guild meetings became Enlightenment-era salons where middle-class tradesmen could exchange ideas on contemporary society and politics. These socially concious guilds formed the earliest Freemason groups in the British Isles and dedicated themselves to upholding the principles of personal liberty and freedom of thought. During the late 1700s, Freemasonry societies became popular among the political and military leaders of the Revolutionary forces in the American colonies, including George Washington. <br /> <br /> Washington began his life as a Freemason in 1752 at the age of twenty when he was admitted into a small Freemason Lodge in Fredericksburg, Virginia. For the rest of his military and political career, Washington was an active member of Freemason social circles and established Alexandria’s Freemason Lodge No. 22 in 1788. Upon Washington’s death, Lodge No. 22 was granted many of Washington’s personal belongings, artifacts referred to as Washingtonia, including those related to his term as the Lodge’s first Grand Master.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{17569f8d-0976-4bbf-a403-65a7c7eec024}{20}\" paraid=\"56304192\">In the mid-19th century, Washington’s personal life and career became topics of renewed public and academic interest. Locations important in Washington’s life, such as Ferry Farm in Fredericksburg and Mount Vernon in Fairfax County, became the focus of intensive preservation efforts. With increased membership during the Progressive Era, Freemason groups across the nation began highlighting their organization’s role in shaping the United States through Freemasons like Washington. In 1910, Freemason leaders from across the nation convened in Washington D.C. to discuss financing a grand monument and museum dedicated to George Washington. Out of this conference, the George Washington Masonic National Memorial Association was formed which began raising money for the construction of a Washington-dedicated monument and park on Shooter’s Hill in eastern Alexandria, Virginia. </p> <p paraeid=\"{17569f8d-0976-4bbf-a403-65a7c7eec024}{80}\" paraid=\"1810281912\">The Association hired famed New York skyscraper architect Harvey Wiley Corbett to design the Memorial and the surrounding grounds. Within weeks of being hired, Corbett drafted a design model of the Memorial as a modern-day reimagining of an ancient Mediterranean lighthouse featuring both Neoclassical and modern skyscraper architectural elements. The design plan for the Memorial called for a raised columnated portico of New Hampshire granite at the base of the structure and a four-tiered stone and steel tower rising from its center. Corbett’s final skyscraper design was enthusiastically approved by the Freemason Grandmasters of the Memorial Association and ground was officially broken on June 5, 1922 during a ceremony attended by President Calvin Coolidge. As costs for the construction mounted in the next decade, the Freemasons refused to borrow money for construction and instead adopted a slow, but fiscally responsible approach to financing based on Lodge donations. </p> <p paraeid=\"{17569f8d-0976-4bbf-a403-65a7c7eec024}{138}\" paraid=\"193119598\">While construction took place over several periods throughout the 1920’s, the exterior of the Memorial was finally completed in February of 1931. As a result of the economic pressures of the Great Depression, construction on the Memorial’s interior was slowed. Over the next four decades, various architectural firms and artists would work to complete the Memorial’s interior museum space and Freemason meeting chambers. Some of the most iconic art pieces displayed by the Memorial include a seventeen-foot-tall bronze statue of Washington designed by Bryant Baker and artist Allyn Cox’s murals depicting episodes from Washington’s life in the Memorial Hall. </p> <p paraeid=\"{17569f8d-0976-4bbf-a403-65a7c7eec024}{178}\" paraid=\"1409167378\">The George Washington Masonic National Memorial is truly a unique landmark as it represents a rare occasion of nationwide cooperation among American Freemasons to build a monumental landmark to George Washington that enshrines his role as a lifelong Freemason. Among the many memorials and monuments to the life of the nation’s first President in and around the District of Columbia, the Masonic National Memorial uniquely highlights George Washington’s moralistic principles and personal beliefs. Therefore, the Memorial serves as a visual metaphor for Freemasonry’s role in shaping the life and career of George Washington and the United States of America.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{17569f8d-0976-4bbf-a403-65a7c7eec024}{204}\" paraid=\"58303884\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{17569f8d-0976-4bbf-a403-65a7c7eec024}{208}\" paraid=\"465529199\">Sources:  </p> <p paraeid=\"{17569f8d-0976-4bbf-a403-65a7c7eec024}{214}\" paraid=\"1808569636\">Bullock, Steven C.  <br /> 1996, Revolutionary Brotherhood: Freemasonry and the Transformation of the American Social Order, 1730-1840, University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, NC </p> <p paraeid=\"{17569f8d-0976-4bbf-a403-65a7c7eec024}{234}\" paraid=\"628089171\">George Washington’s Mount Vernon <br /> The George Washington Masonic National Memorial, Mount Vernon Association, <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/freemasonry/the-george-washington-masonic-national-memorial/\">https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/freemasonry/the-george-washington-masonic-national-memorial/</a>, retrieved 5/26/2020 <br /> <br /> Elliot, Paul and Stephen Daniels<br /> 2006, The 'School of True, Useful and Universal Science'?

    "bodyText": "<p>Most people today know Hampton as a sedate Georgian mansion, elegantly furnished and settled amid gardens and shade trees. Built as a country seat just after the Revolutionary War by the prominent Ridgely family of Maryland, the house and its immediate surroundings are just a remnant of the Hampton estate of the early 1800s.<br /> <br /> In its heyday, Ridgely property equaled half the area of present-day Baltimore, land that made its owners rich through iron production, agriculture, and investments. Hampton is the story of a family business, early American industry, and commerce, the cultural tastes of the times, the deprivations of war, and the economic and moral changes that finally made this kind of life obsolete.<br /> <br /> Needing labor in abundance, the Ridgely family employed many types of workers. In just the last fifty years of the eighteenth century they bought over 300 indentured servants. They also employed free workers, British prisoners of war, and enslaved African Americans. Slavery was part of the Hampton estate for over 100 years, ending only when Maryland State law ended the institution in 1864. Its presence predated the construction of the mansion and over its history over 700 enslaved people would come through the Hampton plantation. Enslaved people were instrumental in building the mansion, and their work supported the gracious lifestyle of the Ridgelys in the mansion.<br /> <br /> Slavery at Hampton was unusual for two reasons. First, the Ridgelys main product from this labor was the harvesting and production of iron from their Northampton ironworks, unlike most of the agricultural South. Second, Hampton is very close to the free state of Pennsylvania and the city of Baltimore with its huge population of free African Americans. Refuges for freedom seekers were close by. Hampton is the site of one of the largest manumissions in history when the second owner of Hampton died with nearly 350 enslaved people on the Hampton plantation. In his will he manumitted females between the ages of 25 and 45 and males between the ages 28 and 45. This is one of the largest manumissions in the history of Maryland, but it did not end slavery at Hampton. His son, John Ridgely, purchased some sixty or so more slaves and manumitted only one.</p> <h4>War of 1812 History</h4> <p>Hampton’s Northampton Iron Furnace, approximately a mile north of the current park location, played a significant role in the War of 1812. Enslaved African Americans, the foundry's primary workforce, produced iron, cannons, shot and camp equipment for the war effort. Charles Carnan Ridgely, ironmaster and owner of the estate, also contributed funds and other supplies for Baltimore’s defense in 1814.<br /> <br /> <em>A project through the <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/sat\">Save America's Treasures Grant Program</a>, which helps preserve nationally significant historic properties and collections, funded work to restore and stabilize farm buildings at Hampton in 1999. </em></p>",
    "audioDescription": "The 64-acre property features a mansion, farmhouse, quarters for the enslaved, dairy, and ash house. The mansion is a large three-story stone mansion with two wings on either side of it, porches on the front and back, and a cupola on top. The front of the house faces down towards the farm side of the park with a large gravel driveway in front of it. The back of the house faces large decorative gardens that go down to the edge of the property. A two story white wooden house. The house has a front porch and multiple additions on it. On top of the house is a wooden bell cupola. A white wooden picket fence surrounds the yard around the house. The two standing slave quarter buildings are made of stone with wooden roofs. The buildings at two stories tall. They sit perpendicular to one another and each building has two units that families would live in. The first slave quarters building has exhibits about the enslaved people of Hampton, the second contains information on tenant farmers that worked the farms after slavery was over. The dairy is a one story white structure that is built below ground level. A set of stone stairs lead down to the base of the structure which is made of bricks. behind the structure a small opening where spring water comes from underground can be seen. Entering the structure the water runs around the edges of the building with a large elevated floor above the water line in the center. The ash house is a small stone structure located between the log house and the stone slave quarters. The structure is hollowed out and the area where a small door would be shows what the inside of the structure looks like.",

    "bodyText": "<h3>A Historic Plantation</h3> <p>Built in 1703, Sotterley Plantation grew to become one of the largest plantations in the Chesapeake Bay region. An economic hub of its own, Sotterley's wharf on the Patuxent River saw the export of tobacco, corn, and lumber produced by the enslaved population of the plantation. Ships arrived into the port carrying captive Africans alongside luxury goods from Europe. Managed by a succession of powerful owners, the plantation's income eventually collapsed with the outlawing of slavery in 1864. The buildings and garden have since been restored, and today the site operates as an educational organization with National Historic Landmark status.

A 1767 farmhouse formerly located at the park served as a lookout station during the war. In September 1814, a signal flag atop the farmhouse sent a warning to Baltimore that the British fleet was approaching, alerting American troops and local residents to prepare for an attack. During the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the park was the site of the Bay Shore Amusement Park, a small park featuring gardens, a dance hall and even a bowling alley. Today, the park features fishing piers, picnicking areas, hiking trails, a water accessible area and more.</p>",

This unique Federalist-style home was completed in 1800, and was one of the grandest townhouses in the nation at the time. Although the Madisons were offered use of several homes, the Octagon House was nearby and met their needs, becoming the temporary White House when they moved in on September 8, 1814.</p> <p>Presidential life quickly resumed a normal pace, although wartime anxieties cast a pall over social gatherings. The Madisons maintained their living quarters on the second floor, in the southeast suite, which consisted of a small vestibule, a large bedroom with a fireplace, and a smaller dressing room. The President used the adjoining circular tower room as a study and at least some of the time as a meeting place for his Cabinet. This was where the Treaty of Ghent was signed on February 17, 1815 before being sent to Congress for ratification, ending the War of 1812.</p> <p>This masterpiece of late <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/wash/dc22.htm\">Federalist architecture</a> features Coade stone decorative elements imported from England, as well as local construction materials. The Octagon House became the home of the American Institute of Architects in 1899, and has been in their care ever since.</p>",

    "bodyText": "The farmhouse, known as Mount Welby, is the oldest building on the farm, dating to around 1811. <br /> <br /> During the War of 1812, Mary DeButts and her husband Samuel lived at the home. The war was especially hard for the DeButts; unable to access English banks and markets, the British sympathizers (Samuel was from Ireland, Mary from England) struggled to keep their farm. When the British navigated up the Potomac in late summer of 1814, they sailed past Mount Welby; the DeButts later found three Congreve rockets near their home.  <br /> <br /> Today, it is used as the Park's Administrative offices.  <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The building is a two-story, brick house painted white with a shed roof, it slopes toward the north. There are porches on the north and south sides of the house, both porches are the full length of the walls. The south side porch is supported off the ground several feet, a white lattice covers the opening under the porch. A five step stair leads to the porch landing. There are six posts that support the roof of the porch, a white wood railing with vertical pickets surround the porch. The left side of the porch has remains of what used to be an accessible ramp. The wooden entrance door is in the center and above the door is a glass rectangular window.

    "bodyText": "The star fort structure was completed in 1803 and named after James McHenry, Washington's Secretary of War and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The fort was constructed to defend Baltimore's harbor that sits just about 2 miles to the north west. This structure, as well as water batteries that would have surrounded it, is what stood between the British Navy and being able to support their ground forces in the possible burning of Baltimore in 1814 during the War of 1812. The British Navy Bombarded this fort for 25 hours but was unable to remove the defenders from its wall, forcing their invading forces to withdraw and saving the City of Baltimore from destruction. This event inspired Francis Scott Key to write the Star-Spangled Banner, today's National Anthem.<br /> <br /> The fort remained active beyond its War of 1812 fame. Today the fort most resembles its Civil War era appearance with the inner buildings being built up to two stories, and an outer battery area featuring Rodman cannons dating to the 1860's. The Civil War period found the fort acting as prison for both prisoners of war, and political prisoners who threatened Maryland's possible secession. The fort's busiest time period was during the First World War where it was the centerpiece of a 3,000 bed hospital that was built up on the grounds surrounding it. Shortly after the First World War the fort was removed from active military use, although it was recalled into action during the Second World War as a Coast Guard training facility.<br /> <br /> As you enter the fort explore the various rooms in the buildings that tell the many stories of the fort's long history. Follow paths on top of the ramparts and outer battery that provide scenic and historic view sheds. And take a step back in time with interpretive programs that occur regularly. ",
    "audioDescription": "When entering the star fort historic zone there is a brick path that leads into the area. It forks and to the left it leads to the outer battery, a region with large earth and brick mounds and large historic cannons. To the right the path leads into the brick structure that is the star fort. Inside the star fort are five buildings that are open to be explored. There is also the large 90 foot tall flag pole.",

Pratt Street, the <a href=\"http://www.flaghouse.org/\">Star-Spangled Banner Flag House</a> was constructed in the late 1700s. Mary Pickersgill and her family began renting the house in the early 1800s. Mary started a flag making business and in a little over a decade, she saved enough money to buy the house, an unusual accomplishment for a woman at this time. She even added a kitchen and a boarder’s room to the house in 1820.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">In summer of 1813, Mary was commissioned to sew a garrison flag and a smaller storm flag for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fomc/index.htm\">Fort McHenry</a>. Mary’s mother, daughter, nieces, and indentured and enslaved <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fomc/learn/historyculture/grace-wisher.htm\">African American servants</a> helped complete the task in about seven weeks.<br /> <br /> On September 14, 1814, Fort McHenry withstood a 25-hour British bombardment. The 30 x 42-foot garrison flag waving over the victorious fort inspired <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fomc/learn/historyculture/francis-scott-key.htm\">Francis Scott Key</a> to pen lyrics that became the U.S. national anthem.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Mary lived in the house until her death in 1857 and the property remained in the Pickersgill family until 1864. The house exchanged hands multiple times and later functioned as a saloon and a warehouse. In 1929, the City of Baltimore purchased the property and preserved it as a historic building. A National Historic Landmark, the house is now a historic home and museum.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Return to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/travelbaltimore/index.htm\">Travel Baltimore</a> main page.</p>",

They likely came here to take advantage of the summer's rich bounty of fish and shellfish.The Pocomoke people of the Bay's Eastern Shore were among the groups that could have traveled here. They would have reached the offshore island in dugout canoes, the largest of which could reach 70 feet long. </p> <h3>Colonial Settlement</h3> <p>Among the first Europeans to observe the island, John Smith and his crew spotted Tangier and its neighboring islands during their voyage throughout the Bay in the summer of 1608. With a penchant for naming the places he visited, Smith called the islands the Russell Isles, after a member of his crew, Doctor Russell. As early as the 1670s, colonists held patents to the island, which they primarily used to graze livestock. A century later, the first permanent residents arrived on the island. At first they made their living by farming, but fishing, crabbing, and oystering soon took over as their primary occupation. </p> <h3>War of 1812</h3> <p>For nearly 1,000 slaves during the War of 1812, Tangier Island was a fortress of salvation, and the place where they took their first free steps. Fort Albion, named after the ancient name for England and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/george-cockburn.htm\">Commodore George Cockburn</a>’s flagship, was constructed on the island in 1814 to serve two major functions: as a central base to sustain continued British attacks along the Chesapeake, and as a depot for receiving runaway American slaves into citizenship and service to His Majesty, King George III of England.</p> <p>Using America’s slaves against itself was not a novel idea – the British successfully employed this war tactic during the Revolutionary War. However, in the War of 1812, American slaves were considered free British citizens as soon as they set foot on British soil (which included forts and vessels), as slavery was illegal in all British territories. The new recruits remained neither American nor enslaved in the eyes of the British. Some slaves stole boats or canoes and met British troops directly; others started fires to get the attention of British soldiers for rescue. In some cases, these slaves took up arms as part of an active offense, while in others they simply took the opportunity presented by the British to escape bondage.</p> <p>As early as 1813, British army and navy officers were instructed to “provide shelter, protection, and evacuation to refugees.” <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alexander-cochrane.htm\">Admiral Alexander Cochrane</a> formalized the policy in April 1814, with a <a href=\"http://www.novascotia.ca/nsarm/virtual/africanns/archives.asp?ID=70\">proclamation</a> offering the “choice of either entering into His Majesty’s Sea or Land Forces, or of being sent as FREE Settlers to the British Possessions in North America or the West Indies.”</p> <p>With an anticipated influx of new recruits, the Royal Navy needed a new base. Tangier Island provided an easy access point in the Chesapeake to the Upper and Lower Bays, as well as the Potomac, Washington and Baltimore, while being surrounded by slaves in the plantation country of Virginia and Maryland. Fort Albion included a barracks, a hospital, a church, family dwellings and gardens, meant to accommodate not just prospective soldiers, but the families they brought with them as well. From its earliest inception, Fort Albion was conceived not just as a place for military training, but a place which would be a temporary home for newly freed Britons.</p> <p>Tangier Island was not employed long; the War of 1812 ended less than a year after Fort Albion was built, on February 17, 1815. As the British withdrew, Cockburn ordered that “on no account [is] a Single Negro [to] be left, except by his own request,” fully embracing the status of the former slaves – whether in service or not – as free subjects of the British Empire. On March 21, 1815, the evacuation of the British from the island was completed, and Fort Albion and its barracks were burned. Former slaves were sent as soldiers and citizens to settle British colonies in the Caribbean and Canada.</p> <p>Between the fort’s intentional destruction and subsequent unintentional destruction by storms and floods common in the Chesapeake, nothing remains of Fort Albion today. Much of Tangier Island where it stood has eroded, leaving a sandy beach reminiscent of those that slaves saw as they set foot on the island, in search of freedom.</p>",

Like Smith Island in Maryland, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/tangier-island.htm\">Tangier Island</a> has been a fishing community for hundreds of years.Today, the island remains a vibrant watermen community and receives hundreds of tourists every year seeking stunning views of the Chesapeake Bay and a taste of the island's unique culture and history.</p> <h2>Small island, big history</h2> <p>Native Americans utilized the Chesapeake's islands, including Tangier, as evidenced by plentiful stone points visible along their shores. John Smith and his crew were among the first Europeans to visit the island, catching sight of it during their 1608 explorations of the region. Smith named Tangier and its neighboring islands the \"Russell Isles,\" after Doctor Russell, a member of his crew. The island's first settlers in the 1700s relied on farming for their occupation, but over the next century, harvesting seafood became the more lucrative profession. During the War of 1812, the British built Fort Albion on Tangier Island and used it as a staging area for battles further inland. Several enslaved African Americans escaped to Tangier Island and were given their freedom by the British. Some joined the Corps of Colonial Marines, an all-black unit who fought against the Americans. </p> <h2>Visiting the museum</h2> <h4>Getting there</h4> <p>Tangier Island is only accesible by private boat or ferry.

    "bodyText": "<p>One of the more unique features at Thomas Stone’s plantation of Haberdeventure is the curved five-part house. While parts of the house are original to Thomas Stone’s lifetime, fire damage, renovation, and modernization have changed the structure.</p> <p>Thomas Stone purchased the 442-acre property from his uncle, Daniel Jenifer, on December 13, 1770. Construction of the house's brick Central Block began in the spring of 1771. The following year, Thomas and his family likely took up residence even though the work was incomplete.</p> <p>The Central Block’s first floor comprises the Center Passage along with the East and West Rooms. The second floor had two large rooms that would have served as bed chambers.</p> <h4>Center Passage</h4> <p>Upon entering the Center Passage, guests could see a large and attractive stairway, expensive portraits, and decorative rooms to the left and right, which provided clues to the wealth and status of the Stones. With doors at each end, this breezeway may have been one of the house's most comfortable rooms during the spring, summer, and fall.</p> <h4>West Room</h4> <p>The West Room is believed to be the Master Bedchamber. Ornate first floor bedchambers in colonial era homes often served the dual purposes of being daytime or informal parlors. In the case of Margaret Stone, who developed a debilitating case of arthritis that often turned her into an invalid, she likely did not receive many guests but could converse with her family on her better days.</p> <p>While there is no supporting evidence, the lifestyles of slave owning gentry of the time suggests that an enslaved African American may have slept either on the floor of the West Room or in the adjacent Center Passage, to be readily available to care for the family's needs both night and day.</p> <h4>East Room</h4> <p>It is evident this room was used for entertaining. Contrary to modern and romanticized visions of colonial era homes, most were not elegant and pristine. Few colonial homes had rooms as beautiful as Thomas Stone's East Room. The expensive furnishing and window coverings and the well crafted woodwork were designed to impress guests, and even though this woodwork is a reconstruction of the original it still shows the detail that was put into the work.</p> <p>Aside from its beauty, the East Room may have served a more important function. With only one doorway, the room could provide privacy for Thomas Stone as he performed his legal and political duties along with directing county defense activities during the American Revolution. In Maryland’s heavily class-based society, the elegance of the East Room emphasized the importance, power, and success of Thomas Stone and justified his role as a leading figure in the community.</p> <h4>Second Floor</h4> <p>The purpose of the second floor was to serve as bed chambers, not just for Thomas and Margaret Stone’s three children. Upon Thomas's father's and eldest brother's deaths in 1773, Thomas permitted some of his younger brothers and sisters to live in the home. Also, as a host to law clients, political allies, several siblings and their families, distant relations, and countless friends, Stone was expected to provide places for everyone to sleep. </p> <p>Crowded homes were quite common in the colonial era. Rooms were hot and stuffy in the summer and drafty and cold in the winter. Privacy by modern standards barely existed. Even George Washington referred to his mansion of Mount Vernon as a “well-restored tavern.”</p> <h4>West Hyphen</h4> <p>The adjoining West Hyphen was built during Thomas Stone’s ownership to connect to the West Wing, which served as a kitchen for the Stones. This Hyphen may have served as a multi-use space with easily moved furnishings to allow dining, indoor chores and crafts, entertaining, and possibly to serve as a guest chamber.</p> <h4>West Wing</h4> <p>The original West Wing kitchen space is believed to have been a small and relatively unadorned structure designed for the function of cooking, cleaning, and other household chores by enslaved workers. The current West Wing, which partially rests upon the original foundations, dates from the mid-1840s. There are two rooms on the first floor and a steep stairway that leads to two more rooms above. In 1846, William Briscoe Stone remarked in a letter to his daughter Mary that the West Wing was, “…much enlarged improved & amended. I am certain you will be surprised and pleased with the change.\"<br /> <br /> During the 20th-century, the residents redesigned the West Hyphen to create a connective hallway between the second floor of the Central Block and the West Wing. This modernization was removed by the National Park Service to help return the mansion to a more historical design.</p> <h4>East Hyphen</h4> <p>The East Hyphen was a unique space. Its primary function was to serve as a protective cover for the full cellar that existed beneath the Central Block. It is not connected in the same way as the West Hyphen is connected. In order to gain access to the space, one would have to go outside the house and enter from the outside. </p> <h4>East Wing</h4> <p>Architectural historians believe that the East Wing is the oldest part of the house. It was likely a wholly separate and independent structure moved from some other location on the plantation to serve as the East Wing.

In addition to being a functioning meeting hall, it also houses important American art, and stands as an architectural symbol in its own right.</span></p> <p><span>Construction of the Capitol building began in 1793. Using ancient architectural models, the young American republic sought to connect its radical experiment in democracy with familiar, stoic building forms that projected strength and stability. The building would continue to evolve, change, and be added to in order to meet the needs of a growing Congress and an evolving American public over the course of the next two hundred years under the care of dozens of architects.</span></p> <p>Congress convened in the Capitol for the first time in 1800, despite the building not being completed. The first iteration was completed in 1811 but did not last long. On August 22, 1814, about 4,500 British troops arrived in southern Maryland, 16 miles from Washington, D.C., to avenge an attack on the Canadian capital the year prior. The troops arrived in the city on August 24<sup>th</sup>, and began following their orders to destroy public buildings. The Capitol was <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc29/pdf/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc29-6-3.pdf\">burned</a> at approximately 9:00 in the evening, but a light rain minimized the permanent damage. Still, the newly finished seat of American government <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3b51944/\">required renovation</a>, beginning in 1815 and continuing through 1819.</p> <p>The Capitol would continue to <a href=\"http://www.visitthecapitol.gov/about-the-capitol/evolution-the-capitol\">grow</a>. As the population of the nation expanded, so did its House of Representatives, requiring <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/wash/dc76.htm\">more space</a>. Today, the building is still maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.aoc.gov/\">Architect of the Capitol</a>. Centrally located in downtown Washington, D.C., it stands as a beacon and symbol of the endurance and flexibility of democracy.</p>",

Although it didn’t bear the name we know it by today – the White House – until around 1811, President John Adams and wife Abigail were the home’s first residents, and it has been the official residence of the president ever since.</p> <p>The White House was designed by Irish architect James Hoban, whose winning design was selected by President George Washington in a competition for the honor of designing the home of the American president. With heavy influence from Georgian and neoclassical designs of Hoban’s native Ireland, the President’s Palace quickly became a focal point of French engineer Pierre Charles L’Enfant’s city.<br /> <br /> The story of the White House and President’s Park cannot be told without accounting for the enslaved people who helped construct the house and grounds. The original laborers and stonecutter constructing the White House were African American slaves hired from their owners. Many other cultures were represented at the construction site; most of the crews were comprised of immigrant skilled workers and independent laborers. As an example of this cultural diversity, the stone masons were Scots and the designer of the President’s house was Irish.  The 1795 payroll for the project lists three carpenters.</p> <p>The White House has undergone constant revisions, additions, and renovations by architects and residents throughout its history. Perhaps the most notable reconstruction came in the wake of 1814 – an invading British army torched the White House, Capitol Building and Treasury on August 24, 1814 during the War of 1812 in retaliation for an American attack on the Canadian capitol York the year prior. President James Madison and First Lady Dolley fled the attack, but not before rescuing the Gilbert Stuart portrait of President Washington.</p> <p>Although the exterior walls stood following the attack, weakened by the fire, little of the original structure would remain intact. Reconstruction of the home began in 1815 supervised by architect Benjamin Latrobe, according to Hoban’s original design. The White House re-opened to the First Family in 1817, with President James Madison and First Lady Elizabeth moving back in.</p> <p>The home would continue to evolve to meet the needs of a changing presidency and a changing nation, including adding the West Wing in 1901, a second story in the 1930s, structural renovations from 1949 to 1951, and an extensive interior redecoration from 1961 to 1963.</p> <p>Today, the White House and/or White House grounds are open periodically to the public for tours.</p>",

    "bodyText": "The Lincolns moved to Knob Creek after a title dispute forced them to leave Sinking Spring Farm. Here Thomas Lincoln rented 30 acres of fertile fields, hardly enough to sustain a family in those times. Thomas and Nancy Lincoln grew corn and pumpkins, raised vegetables that could be eaten fresh in the summer and dried to last through the winter, and grew herbs for medicines and dyes. The crops you see here are similar to the ones that they planted and are still grown by farmers in this valley today.<br /> Farming on the frontier was unpredictable. A hard rain could flood fields that took backbreaking work to plow. A drought could kill an entire harvest. Young Abraham Lincoln helped his parents with farm chores. The daily struggle for survival at Knob Creek shaped the character of the boy who grew up to be president. ",

    "bodyText": "In December 1808, Thomas Lincoln, father of Abraham Lincoln, purchased the 300-acre Sinking Spring Farm. A magnificent white oak tree stood at the western edge of the farm. The tree served as a boundary marker and survey point for determining the property lines. The metes and bounds system of the period allowed for the use of large trees, boulders, and even fence lines as boundary markers between properties and was a common practice and readily accepted throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.<br /> <br /> The Boundary Oak was first identified as a specific boundary marker in the original 1805 survey of the farm. A landmark to countless early travelers, the Boundary Oak was located less than 150 yards from the cabin in which Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809. It is estimated that the tree was 25 to 30 years old at the time of Lincoln's birth.<br /> <br /> Time, weather, insects, and even disease took their toll on the mighty oak. Efforts were made, as early as the 1920s, to save the oak but all failed. Finally it was cut back to just a stump and eventually cut down completely in 1986. Before its death in 1976, the Boundary Oak grew to nearly six feet in diameter, 90 feet in height, and had a crown spread of 115 feet.<br /> <br /> The Boundary Oak Tree was approximately 195 years old at the time of its death. While this living link to Abraham Lincoln is no longer here, we continue to remember it. <br /> <br /> What is something that you believe to be worth remembering? Why?",

    "bodyText": "<p>\"My earliest recollection is of the Knob Creek place.\" So wrote Abraham Lincoln on June 4, 1860, to Samuel Haycraft of Elizabethtown, Kentucky. Haycraft had invited the future President to visit his childhood home in Kentucky. The Lincoln family lived on 30 acres of the 228 acre Knob Creek Farm from the time Abraham was two and a half until he was almost eight years old. Here he learned to talk and soon grew big enough to run errands, such as carrying water and gathering wood for the fires. Abraham recalled in later years numerous memories of his childhood here; a stone house he had passed while taking corn to Hodgen's Mill; a certain big tree that had attracted his boyish fancy; the old homestead; the clear stream where he fished, and the surrounding hills where he picked berries were all impressed on his mind. </p> <p>He could remember how he stayed by his mother's side while listening to her read the Bible. Lincoln could also remember the baby brother who was born and died on the Knob Creek Farm. </p> <p>He remembered one occasion when he and his sister, Sarah, had planted the garden; Abraham said he planted pumpkin seeds in every other hill and every other row while Sarah and others planted the corn. The following night a big rain in the hills sent water rushing into the creek, the creek flooded the fields and washed away their crops. </p> <p>It was also at Knob Creek that Abraham first saw African - Americans being taken south along the Bardstown - Green River Turnpike, part of the old Cumberland Road, to be sold as slaves. </p> <p aria-hidden=\"true\"> </p> <p>Lincoln once wrote that while living on Knob Creek he and his sister, Sarah, were sent for short periods to an A, B, C school - the first kept by Zachariah Riney, and the second by Caleb Hazel. These were subscription schools and lasted only a few months. Free schools did not come to Kentucky until the 1830s. </p> <p>Knob Creek is also where he made friends with Austin Gollaher. Austin often told the tale of saving Abraham from the flooded banks of the creek. He used a tree branch to pull him out of the swiftly moving water as neither boy knew how to swim. Lincoln, while president, once said, “I would rather see (him) than any man living.”  </p> <p>The family left Knob Creek and Kentucky in December 1816 moving to Spencer County, Indiana. </p>",

However, early records generally refer to the landmark as Sinking Spring because the water dropped into a pit and disappeared into the earth. Thus, originated the name of the farm.<br /> <br /> As a perennial source of water, the spring was probably a deciding factor in Thomas Lincoln's selection for the location of the Lincoln cabin site. The Lincolns depended on this spring for their daily water supply and travelers often paused during their journey to partake of the refreshingly cool water. Abraham Lincoln probably tasted his first drink of water from this spring. The appearance of the spring has changed considerably since the Lincoln era. The area of the spring was modified during the early years of park development. However, the natural rock formations along the back wall have been changed only by nature and continue to instill impressions of a homesteader's life.</p> <p>Typical of Kentucky's karst topography and hydrologic systems, the spring is a significant natural resource. Its water drains through the subsurface and empties into a branch of the Nolin River a short distance from the park. Sinking Spring is a part of a network of springs and subsurface streams in and near the park. Because the spring's cave supports a variety of fragile cave biota, it is particularly sensitive to pollutants and encroachment. The National Park Service monitors those threats, which effect the cave and its environment.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Rooted in the architectural forms of ancient Greece and Rome, the Memorial Building was designed by early twentieth century prominent architect John Russell Pope and constructed of Connecticut pink granite and Tennessee marble. Pope's design of the building included many symbolisms related to Abraham Lincoln, including fifty-six steps leading up to the building to represent the fifty-six years of Lincoln's life. Sixteen windows in the building and sixteen rosettes on the interior ceiling are there to remind visitors that Lincoln was the sixteenth president. The Beaux-Arts building was designed specifically to house the \"symbolic\" birth cabin of Abraham Lincoln on the site of Lincoln's birth.</p> <p>In 1906 the Lincoln Farm Association began a fund raising campaign for the project in which over 100,000 Americans donated nearly $350,000. The Norcross Brothers Construction Company of Worcester, Massachusetts won the contract for constructing the Memorial Building in 1907 with a bid of $237,101 and construction began on February 12, 1909, the centennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth, with the laying of the cornerstone by President Theodore Roosevelt. After over two years of construction President, and Lincoln Farm Association board member, William Howard Taft dedicated the Memorial Building and enshrined \"birth cabin\" on November 9, 1911, before a crowd of 3,000 people.</p> <p>Today the Memorial Building continues to fulfill its mission by housing and protecting the Symbolic Birth Cabin of Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth President of the United States. Over 200,000 people a year come to Lincoln's birthplace to view the Memorial Building and the enshrined Symbolic Birth Cabin contained within.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h4>Hours:</h4> <p>This building is open from 9:00 AM ET to 4:30 PM ET daily. </p> <h4>Information:</h4> <p>The Memorial Building at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park was constructed between 1909 and 1911 in an effort by the Lincoln Farm Association to commemorate the life and accomplishments of the sixteenth President of the United States and to protect what we now know as the Symbolic Birth Cabin.</p> <p>The construction of the pink granite and marble building catapulted small Hodgenville, Kentucky, into the national limelight. The Lincoln Farm Association took donations large and small. A funding issue delayed construction of the building and only the foundation and cornerstone were ready for the centennial celebration of Lincoln’s birth on February 12, 1909. On that day, President Theodore</p> <p>Roosevelt spoke of “this rail splitter … whose rise was by weary and painful labor, lived to lead his people through the burning flames of a struggle from which the nation emerged purified as by fire, born anew to a loftier life.” The construction continued for 2 more years and Architect John Russell Pope incorporated the architectural neoclassical style which earned him the label “Last of the Romans.” He included symbolism into the building as exhibited in the 16 rosettes on the ceiling to represent Lincoln’s place as the 16th president and 56 steps leading up to the building, one for each year of Lincoln’s life. The Memorial Building at Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park was constructed 11 years before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. Once the building was finished, the symbolic birth cabin was reconstructed inside the Memorial Building. The building was dedicated by President William H. Taft on November 9, 1911, before an audience of 3,000 people.</p> <p>Today the Memorial Building continues to fulfill its mission by housing and protecting the Symbolic Birth Cabin of Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth President of the United States. Over 200,000 people a year come to Lincoln's birthplace to view the Memorial Building and the enshrined Symbolic Birth Cabin contained within.</p>",

On May 23, 1861, the regiment was mustered into United States service as the 84th New York Volunteers, however they retained their former title for most of their service. As the regiment recruited heavily from the Brooklyn area it subsequently became known as the \"Fourteenth Brooklyn.\"  <br /> <br /> The regiment saw extensive service during the Civil War and played important roles at both the First and Second Battles of Manassas (Bull Run). At First Manassas on July 21, 1861, the regiment was actively engaged on Henry Hill while supporting the Federal artillery batteries. <br /> <br /> At the Second Battle of Manassas, the regiment first saw action on the evening of August 29, 1862. Ordered west on the Warrenton Turnpike in pursuit of what was supposedly a retreating enemy, the unit collided with Confederates under Gen. John B. Hood. After a brief but severe twilight clash, the regiment withdrew. The following day, August 30, the 14th Brooklyn saw severe fighting as part of Gen. Fitz John Porter's attack at the Deep Cut. The regiment suffered 129 men killed, wounded, and missing at Second Manassas. <br /> <br /> <b>Inscription:</b><br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; text-align: center;\"> </span> <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>14th Regiment N.Y.S.M. <br /> (84th Regiment N.Y.

The regiment, resplendent in their elaborately braided blue jackets and baggy red trousers, boasted a high number of college educated and professional men as they departed for war.<br /> <br /> On August 30, 1862, during the Second Battle of Manassas (Bull Run), the 5th New York, the regiment found itself in the path of Longstreet's massive Confederate counterattack. Together with the 10th New York, the 5th found themselves supporting a lone artillery battery (Hazlett's Battery D, 5th U.S. Artillery). Posted to the left rear of the battery, the 5th New York was struck by several thousand Confederates of Hood's Texas Brigade. Vainly trying to hold their position against overwhelming numbers, the 5th New York was virtually wiped out in a few minutes of combat.

The monument is approximately eight and a half feet wide and three feet thick at its base. The top twenty inches of the approximately ten-foot-tall monument is a Maltese Cross with a bronze numeral five in the middle of the cross. The 5th New York was a unit within the Union Army’s Fifth Corps and the Maltese Cross was the Corps badge of the Fifth Corps. The entire stone and bronze artwork is surrounded by a three foot tall wrought iron fence. It stands here to commemorate the unit’s participation in the Civil War and, in particular, their heroic stand here atop this knoll on August 30, 1862.

Prominently located on a high ridge overlooking the Warrenton Turnpike and Young's Branch, Hazel Plain stood as a silent witness to some of the heaviest fighting during both battles of Manassas. On each occasion the family took refuge with relatives. They returned to find their house stained with blood and their well fouled by amputated limbs. It was a scene familiar to many local residents whose homes stood in the crosshairs of combat.<br /> <br /> <strong>Inscription: </strong><br /> The massive Confederate counterattack appeared unstoppable. General James Longstreet's wing of the army- upwards of 28,000 troops- steadily pushed east toward Henry Hill. If the Confederates occupied that plateau, ironically the same ground on which the First Battle of Manassas had culminated the previous summer, they could cut off the Federal's line of retreat and possibly annihilate the Union army.<br /> <br /> Finally comprehending the magnitude of the crisis, General John Pope raced to save his command. Pope worked to establish a new defensive position and safeguard his avenue of escape. To gain time for his new line to take shape, the Federal commander ordered additional troops onto Chinn Ridge. Here a handful of Union brigades struggled to slow the Confederate advance and buy that time in blood.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Inscription #2:</strong> <p>A Battle For Time</p> During the late afternoon of August 30, 1862, Union defenders staged a desperate battle against overwhelming numbers of Confederates. While the battle raged along Chinn Ridge, Union Maj. Gen. John Pope organized a new defensive line on Henry Hill and along the historic Manassas-Sudley Road. The paved path retraces the course of fighting here during the Second Battle of Manassas.  <hr /> <h3><strong>While you're here...</strong></h3> <h4>Hike the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/chinn-ridge-trail.htm\">Chinn Ridge Trail</a></h4> This one-mile out and back trail traverses the ground of the heaviest sustained fighting of Second Manassas, on 30 August 1862.

    "audioDescription": "This audio descriptive text for the Chinn House Site is 193 words in total. The Chinn House Site is the stone foundation ruins of a structure termed “Hazel Plain” which stood here upon Chinn Ridge from 1809 until 1950. The rectangular foundation wall is approximately three-feet-tall; 47-feet-long on the northeast and southwest sides; and 30-feet-long on the northwest and southeast sides. The foundation ruins also include twin attached chimney bases on the northwest and southeast sides. The wall is comprised of local brownstone, or sandstone, blocks of similar size and they are predominantly brown, rust red and tan in color. The walls are not a continuous, unbroken feature; absent sections exist where basement windows of the house once existed. The site is situated in a well-manicured grassy lawn. Two semispherical projections of brick and concrete near the eastern corner of the foundation wall are the capped remnants of the cistern and well which were used by the residents of the home. The cistern dome is approximately five feet in diameter and three feet tall. The well cap is less than two feet in diameter and less than two feet tall. The site has largely unimpeded views of fields in all directions and of the Chinn Branch valley.",

The house was destroyed by fire in 1862.<br /> <br /> The house served as Confederate headquarters during the First Battle of Manassas. Following the Battle, the house served as a hospital. Among those taken care of here were Union officers Orlando Wilcox and James B. Ricketts. <br /> <br /> The grounds of Portici served as the site of the 1861-1862 winter encampment for a brigade of Alabamians and Virginians commanded by General Cadmus Wilcox.  <br /> <br /> Some of the last fighting at Second Manassas occurred on these fields on 30 August 1862 when Confederate cavalry, on a mission to cut off the Union army's line of retreat, were stopped by Union cavalry.<br /> <br /> <strong>Inscription:</strong> <p>Action Behind the Lines</p> The Lewis Plantation known as \"Portici\" saw service as a Confederate headquarters and hospital at the First Battle of Manassas in July 1861 and as the setting of a small cavalry action at the end of the Second Battle of Manassas in August 1862. Follow the mowed path to the site of the house, where a vista offers views of the surrounding area. <br /> <br /> <strong>Inscription #2: </strong><br /> On the ridge ahead of you stood \"Portici,\" an important landmark of both battles of Manassas. In 1861, Frank Lewis resided here with his wife Fannie and two small children. Their middling plantation consisted of 769 acres. The family owned eleven slaves to work the property- cultivating grain, herding livestock, and performing domestic chores.<br /> <br /> The arrival of war shattered Portici's peaceful existence. During the First Battle of Manassas, the home served as both a headquarters and a hospital. Thirteen months later, Union and Confederates cavalry clashed in the adjacent fields. Returning to utter devastation at war's end, the Lewis family began the arduous process of rebuilding their lives, a scene repeated countless times throughout the ravaged South. <br /> <br /> A short walk leads to the site of Portici.

After suffering another costly defeat at Second Manassas (August 28-30 1862) Union forces used the bridge as their primary line of retreat. In the early hours of August 31, the bridge was destroyed by the Union Army. </p> <p>By 1884, the Stone Bridge was fully rebuilt. The new bridge, very similar to the original bridge, remained open to traffic until 1926. In that year the road was realigned and a modern highway bridge constructed just downstream.

    "audioDescription": "This audio descriptive text for the Stone Bridge is 192 words in total. The Stone Bridge is a sandstone masonry structure astride Bull Run in the eastern part of Manassas National Battlefield Park. The bridge is approximately 160 feet in length and thirty feet wide and twenty-feet-tall. The surface of the road bed is about two-and-a-half feet above the crown of the arches. A parapet wall of approximately eighteen-inches thickness extends approximately three feet above the roadbed. The bridge has a higher elevation on the Fairfax County, or eastern bank, of Bull Run than it does on the Prince William County, or western bank, of the watercourse. Therefore, the transportation, or trail, surface of the bridge slopes downward from east to west. The bridge is supported by two semicircular arches which are approximately twenty-feet-wide and fifteen-feet tall and they meet at a six-foot-wide pier in the middle of Bull Run. The bridge is constructed of local red and brown sandstone blocks of various dimensions. The bridge is substantially the same structure that was reconstructed here in the 1880s; on the site of the Civil War-era Stone Bridge.",

    "bodyText": "<p>This structure served as a field hospital during both First and Second Manassas.  Built in 1848, its early years were spent as the home of farmer Henry P. Matthew and his family, who harvested the peaceful Virginia countryside surrounding the property.<br /> <br /> All that would change in 1861, though, when fighting broke out so close to the house it was peppered with shot and shell throughout the First Battle of Manassas on July 21. The two-story structure did not go unused however. With its strong stone walls, a well in the yard and close proximity to the road back to Washington, D.C., it was the ideal site for treating the wounded, of which there were many. The ten hours of heavy fighting during the first battle on July 21, 1861 resulted in more than 2,700 injured soldiers. And the second battle, lasting three days in August 1862, left many more thousands from both sides wounded. Mostly under Confederate control for both battles, it was a hub of activity for surgeons and other medical personnel as they tried to save the dying.<br /> <br /> During the Second Battle of Manassas, two wounded Union soldiers, Eugene P. Geer and Charles Brehm, both of the 5th New York Infantry, found their way into one of the upstairs rooms of the Stone House, where they carved their names into the floorboards. Brehm survived, but Geer died of his wounds. Their carved names can still be seen in the floorboards today.<br /> <br /> After the war, the Matthews family sold the house in October 1865 and it passed through several owners before being purchased by the federal government in 1949. Extensively renovated in the years since, it is today open for both tours and interpretive activities.<br />  </p> <hr /> <h3><strong>While you're here...</strong></h3> <h4>Visit the Stone House</h4> The House, open seasonally, includes exhibits of the history of the house and its use before, during, and after the Civil War. On the second floor are two carvings from soldiers from the 5th New York who were wounded on 30 August 1862.  <h4>Climb Buck Hill</h4> A short trail behind the House leads to the summit of Buck Hill. An interpretive panel at the top describes the hill's role as Union General John Pope's headquarters at Second Manassas.   <h4> </h4> <h4> </h4> <h3> </h3> <h3> </h3>",
    "audioDescription": "This audio descriptive text for the Stone House is 231 words in total. The Stone House is one of the three remaining Civil War-era buildings in Manassas National Battlefield Park. The structure is a two-and-a-half story rectangular structure approximately forty-feet-wide and 24-feet-deep that faces south towards Lee Highway. The exterior of the structure is composed of locally available sandstone blocks; some of which are the equivalent size of shoe boxes and some of which are as large as microwave ovens. The stone blocks are various shades of yellow, orange, brown and rusty red. The Stone House has symmetrical chimneys on the west and east ends of the structure. On the first floor, there are three windows and a door on the south and north sides of the house. On the second floor, there are four doors on both the south and north sides of the house. At ground level, there are two window wells on both the north and south sides of the house to provide light to the basement. There is also a small door on the west side of the house to provide exterior entrance into the basement. The Stone House has two small windows on the west and east walls to provide light for the attic. The structure has a wood shingle roof and five artillery projectiles lodged into some of the weather, or war-produced, cavities in the exterior walls to serve as curiosities for postwar visitors to the historic property.",

    "bodyText": "The head of General Irvin McDowell's flanking column reached Matthews Hill shortly after 10 a.m. Progress had been slow. The rookie soldiers frequently broke ranks to rest. Some stopped to pick blackberries. More than 13,000 Union troops lagged behind schedule and strung out for nearly six miles. As the head of the column reached Matthews Hill, the rear of the column was still on the Warrenton Turnpike east of the Stone Bridge.<br /> <br /> Upon emerging out of the woods, the Union vanguard collided with Confederate skirmishers atop Matthews Hill ahead. Both sides exchanged brief volleys of musket fire. Soldiers of the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry deployed and started across the field toward the crest of the hill. For General McDowell, his chance at surprise was gone. Battle had just begun.<br /> <br /> Colonel Ambrose Burnside's brigade, leading the Union flanking column, soon collided with Confederates. Six James Rifles of the 2nd Rhode Island Battery established an advantageous position on the crest while Union infantry pressed forward into a cornfield beyond. With each few minutes that passed, more Federals reached the front.<br /> <br /> Yet Union forces encountered stiff resistance. Confederate troops made headlong charges in a bold show of force that disguised their true weakness in numbers. It took over ninety minutes to dislodge the stubborn Confederates. Despite the unexpected delays, the Union commander emerged confident of success. General McDowell triumphantly announced \"Victory! Victory! The day is ours!\" The proclamation proved premature. <hr /> <h3>While you're here...</h3> <h4>Hike the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/matthews-hill-loop-trail.htm\">Matthews Hill Loop Trail </a></h4> This one-mile long loop trail traverses the fields where the opening phase of First Manassas took place. From the summit, scenic vistas looking south and west give an excellent view of major portions of the battlefield.<br /> <br /> Inscription:  <h3>False Hopes for Success</h3> <p>At the first Battle of Manassas, Union forces here on Matthews Hill seemed on the verge of victory when Confederate lines collapsed late in the morning of July 21, 1861. Thirteen months later at the Second Battle of Manassas, overconfident Union commander Maj. Gen. John Pope used the fields on nearby Dogan Ridge as a staging ground for attacks on Confederates along the Unfinished Railroad. <br /> <br /> Follow the mowed path to the crest on your right to the site of the morning action at First Manassas. An interpretive loop trail follows the opposing battle positions. <br /> <br /> Union artillery held the dominant ground near the crest of Matthews Hill. In the background rises Henry Hill, scene of the decisive afternoon fighting at First Manassas. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Manassas National Battlefield Park. In two fierce battles fought thirteen months apart, Union and Confederate armies clashed here over the same ground. <br /> <br /> Many of the key features of the battlefields survive today, including the Stone House, the Unfinished Railroad, and the historic road network.<br /> <br /> Begin your tour at the Henry Hill Visitor Center, which provides orientation to the battlefields and their many points of interest.</p> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "Before being defined as a battlefield, this landscape existed as the crossroads hamlet of Sudley Springs. Although it consisted of fewer than a dozen households in 1860, three features distinguished Sudley Springs from neighboring communities - a prosperous mill, a prominent church, and a popular mineral spring.<br /> <br /> As early as the 1770s, wealthy planters constructed a mill on Catharpin Run to grind wheat into flour. The mill complex attracted auxiliary craftsmen - blacksmiths, wheelrights, and carpenters. A Methodist congregation erected the first of three church buildings here around 1822. The area also boasted a hotel for those attracted to the mineral waters of a nearby spring. Although Sudley Springs recovered from the scars of war, its economy faltered after the mill closed and the hotel burned in the early 1900s. Only Sudley Church remains as a vestige of times past.<br /> <br /> During the Second Battle of Manassas, on August 29, 1862, Federal tropos repeatedly attacked Stonewall Jackson's left flank - Gen. Maxcy Gregg's South Carolina brigade - in this vicinity. Exhausted, their ammunition depleted, Gregg's troops were driven back by the late afternoon assault of Gen. Philip Kearney's Union division. Only darkness prevented a fatal collapse of the Confederates. <hr /> <h3>While you're here...</h3> <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/sudley-loop-trail.htm\">Sudley Loop Trail</a></h4> While on this .6 mile loop trail, you will pass the Thornberry House (one of three war-time structures still standing in the park) as well as visiting the site of Sudley Springs Ford, where, on 21 July 1861, nearly 13,000 Union soldiers crossed Catharpin Creek on their way to the battlefied. This trail also provides an opportunity for seeing bluebells (seasonally). <br /> <br />  ",

In order to sustain the momentum and exploit the breakthrough, the Federals required immediate help. General Grover waited impatiently for the promised support as his regiments rapidly lost organization. However, no Federal reinforcements were forthcoming. Additional troops were not in position to provide direct support, and those that could offer some aid approached the Confederates cautiously with little sense of urgency. The absence of Yankee reinforcements, in turn, gave the Confederates the necessary time to plug the break in their line. <br /> <br /> General A.P. Hill's division struck back with a ferocity that soon put the Yankees on their heels. \"The effect was terrible,\" remembered a Massachusetts soldier, \"men dropped in scores, writhing and trying to crawl back or lying immovable and stone-dead where they fell.\" After barely a half-hour of combat, the Federal line collapsed with men bolting for the woods in the rear. Grover had no choice but to order a retreat. His small brigade had fought in solitude and his success had come at a high cost. More than 500 Federals had fallen- in excess of 30% causalities. </p>",

    "bodyText": "On the afternoon of 30 August, 1862, Union General John Pope ordered an attack on \"Stonewall\" Jackson's position here at the Deep Cut. Some 8,000 soldiers moved out of the woods along Featherbed Lane, in dense formations, towards the Confederate position at the top of the hill. <br /> <br /> Exposed to raking Confederate artillery fire from the Brawner Farm less than one-half mile to the west, and then to sheets of musket fire from Jackson's infantry, the Union assault was shattered a bloodily repulsed. <br /> <br /> Inscription: <h3>Second Battle of Manassas, Day Three, August 30, 1862, 3 p.m.</h3> <br /> Full throated cheers greeted the order to attack. More than 6,000 Union soldiers under General Fitz John Porter poured across the road into the fields of Lucinda Dogan's farm. As the blue-clad lines traversed the open ground, a massive concentration of Confederate artillery, posted on the neighboring Brawner Farm, unleashed a torrent of shot and shell. The bombardment shattered their formation and thinned the ranks. Still, the Federals pressed on and ascended the far ridge. <br /> <br /> The attack culminated near the \"Deep Cut\"- the deepest portion of the unfinished railroad bed. Opposing troops, separated only by the width of the protective embankment, held their muskets horizontally above their heads and fired blindly. Many soldiers resorted to throwing rocks. Unable to endure the barrage from front and flank, and with dwindling hope of reinforcement, the decimated Union regiments retreated. In less than an hour, the largest Federal attack of Second Manassas had failed. <br /> <br /> The whole field was covered with a confused mass of struggling, running, routed Yankees. - Colonel Bradley T. Johnson, CSA.",

    "audioDescription": "The audio descriptive text for the Groveton Confederate Cemetery is 437 words in total. The Groveton Confederate Cemetery contains the remains of an estimated five hundred Confederate soldiers who perished in the First and Second Battles of Manassas. An ornamental black iron fence, approximately four feet tall, forms a rectangular enclosure of the roughly two-acre cemetery. The soldiers’ remains were congregated here in the late 1860s and early 1870s from their earlier, hastily improvised burial spots throughout the battlefield area. A white granite and white marble obelisk monument approximately thirteen-feet-tall was unveiled in the center of the cemetery in 1904. The south, or front, face of the monument contains the following inscription: “Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori. Erected to the Confederate dead. We care not whence they came, dear in their lifeless clay! Whether unknown or known to fame, their cause and country still the same. They died and wore the gray.” On the north face of the monument is an inscription stating: “They gave their lives in defense of their country on the fields of the First and Second Battles of Manassas”. On the east face of the monument is an inscription stating: “They sleep well in their unknown graves on the faraway battlefield”. On the west face is an inscription stating: “But for them the counting of time is not: for they dwell in the city of God”. The obelisk is encircled by a five-foot-wide paved walkway and fourteen small white marble stones approximately one-foot-wide, six-inches-long and one-foot-tall, bearing the names of former Confederate and border states which had sent soldiers into the Confederate armies that fought in the two battles of Manassas. When facing the south, or front, face of the obelisk, you are positioned at six o’clock. Encountering the stones in a clockwise pattern from there reveals the following order: “Virginia. North Carolina. South Carolina. Georgia. Florida. Alabama. Mississippi. Louisiana. Texas. Arkansas. Missouri. Tennessee. Kentucky. Maryland.”. There are only two known burials in the cemetery; James Jermain Palmer and William Goodwyn Ridley. Palmer’s gravestone is a white granite tablet approximately three-feet-tall located approximately ten yards west of the central obelisk. Palmer’s inscription includes a Palmetto tree and states: “In memory of James Jermain Palmer. Son of Dr. John S. and Ester Simmons Palmer. Born in Charleston County, South Carolina, May 28, 1840. Was killed in the Second Manassas battle August 30, 1862. He was a private of the Spartan Rifles and Regiment of Palmetto Sharpshooters”. Ridley’s gravestone is a white granite tablet approximately two-feet-tall located approximately five yards north of the southeast fence corner of the cemetery. Ridley’s inscription states: “William Goodwyn Ridley. Company G. 6th Virginia Regiment. Southampton County. Second Manassas. Aged 20 years”.",

The Federal artillery was too close to the Confederate line to be effective, and they lacked the necessary infantry support to protect their guns and achieve a victory on the battlefield. Griffin took two 12-pound smoothbore howitzer guns north of the Henry House and positioned them on a knoll on the left flank of the Confederate line.</p> <p paraeid=\"{8aea05b8-200b-4a11-a373-984478eb15a4}{221}\" paraid=\"588915365\">  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8aea05b8-200b-4a11-a373-984478eb15a4}{227}\" paraid=\"369612303\">This position gave Griffin multiple advantages. A small knoll provided some cover for Griffin’s men. His smoothbore cannons, which have a shorter range than a rifled gun, could more effectively reach the confederate left flank. Despite the riskiness of this decision, Griffin realized keeping his guns on Henry Hill would eventually result in their capture or retreat. However, before Griffin could execute his new plan, he noticed infantrymen clad in blue uniforms and civilian clothing in the woods to his right, only 200 yards away. <br />  </p>",

However, McDowell refused to revise his orders, and placed Griffin and Ricketts’ guns to the north and south of the Henry House on the hill. Ricketts stated after the battle, “I knew at a glance I was going into great peril for my horses and men.” No words would ring truer for James Ricketts and his troops. </p> <p paraeid=\"{d8ec8baa-faa9-4b55-a550-224641b29546}{239}\" paraid=\"1537065842\">  </p> <p paraeid=\"{d8ec8baa-faa9-4b55-a550-224641b29546}{245}\" paraid=\"265551554\">As Ricketts’ men rumbled into position, they were immediately struck by Confederate cannon and small arms fire. Men clambered to the ground, horses screamed in fright, but Ricketts ordered his artillerymen to stand their ground and return fire. The intensity of the rebel fire was frightful. Ricketts commented after the battle, “It was the hottest place I [saw] in my life; and I had seen some fighting before.”</p> <p paraeid=\"{d8ec8baa-faa9-4b55-a550-224641b29546}{251}\" paraid=\"1376777407\">  </p>",

Family members salvaged rock from the original foundation and nearby outbuildings to delineate the cemetery. In a letter to her cousin, Sarah Carter wrote in 1885: “Edwin [Carter] and Arthur Lee [Henry] have been hard at work hauling rock to enclose the dear old grave yard. It is done with a good strong wall around the gate and lock. I am so thankful we have lived to see it done.” The last interment in the cemetery occurred in 1903.",

    "bodyText": "On August 28, 1862, Federal and Confederate soldiers clashed on the fields around the Brawner Farm. In the immediate vicinity of the house, Union troops of the \"Black Hat\" Brigade clashed with the \"Stonewall Brigade. More troops were fed into the struggle by both sides, and the lines exchanged volleys for nearly two hours, in places only 80 yards apart. Nearly one-third of the 7,000 troops engaged became casualties during this stubborn combat. The fighting around the Farmhouse marked the opening shots of Second Manassas.  <hr /> <h2><strong>While you're here...</strong></h2> <h4>Visit the Brawner Farm Interpretive Center</h4> The Brawner Farm Interpretive Center, open seasonally, provides an overview to the Second Battle of Manassas. A 9-minute long electronic map tells the story of Second Manassas and traces the troop movements and attacks during the three-day long battle. Two rooms with exhibits share the stories of civilians that lived on the battlefield as well as placing the battle<br /> in the broader context of the war in 1862.  <h4> </h4> <h4>Hike the Brawner Farm battlefield</h4> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/brawner-farm-loop-trail.htm\">Brawner Farm Loop Trail</a> traces the opposing lines of battle during the 28 August clash.  The trail, which begins and ends in the parking lot, includes interpretive signage along the way that relates the story of the opening fighting at Second Manassas.  <h4> </h4> <h4>Attend a Ranger Program </h4> When the Interpretive Center is open, join a park ranger for a walking tour of the fighting at the Brawner Farm. <br /> <br />   <h4>Archeology at Brawner Farm</h4> Once the scene of bloody combat, Brawner Farm sits today in a quiet corner of Manassas Battlefield. Archeologists have conducted multiple investigations of the property, which have uncovered the site of several structures and unearthed thousands of artifacts. This rich assemblage of domestic and military objects provides valuable information about those that lived and fought here. <br /> <br /> Excavations revealed the foundations of an earlier house partly underneath the current structure, and this earlier house was the one that stood during the Second Battle of Manassas. The chimney pile before you is all that remains of a large outbuilding believed to have served as a combined kitchen and slave quarter. Surveys of the yard produced evidence of former inhabitants- both free and enslaved - including pottery, dishes, tools, jewelry, and children's toys. Mixed in among these household items were heavy concentrations of military artifacts, which have contributed to our understanding of the positions and movements of units during the battle. Together these discoveries shed light on the rich history of Brawner Farm, but also serve as a poignant reminder of the war's impact on local residents. ",

The monument was built by Union soldiers in the spring of 1865 to commemorate the Union soldiers who had died in the Second Battle of Manassas, also commonly referred to at that time as the Battle of Groveton. Like the fraternal twin First Bull Run monument, this obelisk was once embellished with artillery projectiles at the top and around the base of the monument, but unlike the First Bull Run monument, the original iron projectiles on the Second Bull Run (Groveton) monument have disappeared in the hands of vandals and have not been replaced with facsimiles. An approximately two-foot-square marble plaque on the northwest, or front, face of the monument contains the following inscription: “In memory of the patriots who fell at Groveton. August 28, 29 and 30, 1862”.

    "bodyText": "Spring Hill Farm - now simply known as Henry Hill - lay fallow and overgrown in the summer of 1861. A small vegetable garden and orchard surrounded the frame house. Inside the home, 84-year old Judith Henry remained bedridden, too old to work the land that had been in her family for more than a century. She shared the home with her daughter Ellen. A hired teenage slave, Lucy Griffith, assisted with domestic chores.<br /> <br /> The Battle of Bull Run culminated on the Henry property. Unaware of civilians inside the home, Federal artillery fired on the dwelling to drive away Confederate sharpshooters. The cannon fire crashed through the house, mortally wounding the widow Henry, the battle's only known civilian fatality. By day's end the family matriarch was dead, the house in ruin, and the surrounding landscape forever redefined by the events of July 21, 1861.<br /> <br /> Following the war, the Henry family constrcted a new home near the site of the original war-time structure. Built in 1870, with an 1884 addition, the current structure remained in the Henry family until the early 1920s. The house subsequently served as the first musuem and visitor center at Manassas Battlefield. Today, the house contains exhibits and is open daily each summer.",
    "audioDescription": "This audio descriptive text for the Henry House is 247 words in total. The Henry House is a rectangular two-story unpainted wood farmhouse standing atop the northwestern edge of Henry Hill approximately two hundred yards north of the Henry Hill Visitor Center. The east and west faces of house are approximately twenty-four-feet wide. The north and south faces of the house are approximately sixteen-feet-wide. The west, or front, face of the house has a six-foot by six-foot roofed-porch entryway to the door on the southwest corner of the structure. A large stepping-stone allows access to the porch.

John Imboden's Staunton Artillery were positioned on the north-west corner of Henry Hill. Imboden later described the action: “the enemy’s battery—six long-rifle 10-pounder Parrott guns, [which] opened on us with elongated cylindrical shells. They passed a few feet over our heads, and very near the General and his staff in our rear and exploded near the top of the hill. We instantly returned the compliment…they at first over-shot us and burst their shells to our rear, but at every round improved their aim and shortened their fuse.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{51eb2e5e-cbe1-42a1-b264-c08bed3f5e75}{214}\" paraid=\"719395264\">  Over the next two hours, Imboden’s battery suffered heavily from the Federal artillery fire on the hills to the north and northwest. With the retreat of the Confederate infantry from Matthews Hill, renewed pressure from Federal infantry and artillery, and running low on ammunition, Imboden determined the time had come to leave this exposed position.</p>",

Outnumbered and exposed, the Union line held its ground, returning fire with discipline and great effect.

Gibbon was pleased with his largely untested Midwestern troops who stood firm under fire. <br /> <br /> John Gibbon's \"Black Hat\" Brigade- named for their distinctive black Hardee hats- first proved their tenacity at Second Manassas. Here they held their ground against an overwhelming force of Stonewall Jackson's battle-hardened veterans. <br /> <br /> Losses on both sides were frightful. Gibbon's brigade lost 725 out of 1,937 men. The 56th Pennsylvania and 76th New York of Abner Doubleday's brigade lost 236 of about 550 men. The Stonewall Brigade lost 340 of 850 men.

The crackling of underbrush could be heard long before the enemy could be seen, and the Yankees closed to within 100 yards of the railroad embankment before the Rebels realized the enemy was upon them. Colonel Edward Thomas, commanding a brigade of Georgians here, ordered his men to rise up and fire. The opening salvo \"seemed to create a breeze that made the leaves upon the trees rustle,\" according to one Federal, \"and a shower of small boughs and twigs fell upon the ground.\" At that moment, General Grover spurred his horse to the front and yelled for his men to \"Charge!\"</p>",

Again, he divided his army and sent Stonewall Jackson's troops on an encircling march to cut off the enemy's escape route to Washington. On September 1, 1862, a confused and indecisive class occurred at Chantilly (Ox Hill) in the midst of a torrential thunderstorm, thwarting this effort. This proved to be the final action of the Second Manassas campaign. <br /> <br /> General Robert E. Lee came closer to destroying a Union army at Second Manassas than he ever would again. The Confederate commander emerged from the summer campaign of 1862 as the South's greatest hope for independence- a responsibility he shouldered for the remainder of the conflict. Brimming with confidence and buoyed by his recent success, Lee turned the Army of Northern Virginia toward the Potomac River, resolved to win a crowning victory on Northern soil. <br /> <br /> For General John Pope, the defeat at Second Manassas led to humiliation and disgrace, forever tainting his reputation and military career. President Lincoln relieved Pope of command less than a week later and reassigned him to fight the Sioux in Minnesota. Shortly after the battered Army of Virginia limped into to defenses of Washington, its troops were absorbed into General George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac. McClellan took over the pursuit of Lee as the armies maneuvered into Maryland. <br /> <br /> In the wake of Second Manassas, more than 23,000 soldiers had been killed, wounded, captured, or reported missing- a legacy of destruction far worse than the First Battle of Bull Run thirteen months earlier.</p>",

The open ground afforded a perfect line of fire into the flank and rear of the advancing Union troops.

The Union commander directed General Fitz John Porter's Fifth Corps to march toward Gainesville, anticipating a move against the enemy's flank. With this in his mind, Pope order a series of diversionary attacks on the Unfinished Railroad to distract the Confederates. <br /> <br /> About mid-afternoon, Pope ordered General Joseph Hooker's division to advance into the woods adjoining the railroad grade and attack. Hesitant to make a direct frontal assault, Hooker sought the support of other Federal troops near Sudley Church to increase the prospect of success. With reassurances of forthcoming assistance, Hooker selected the five-regiment brigade of General Cuvier Grover to spearhead the assault.<br /> <br /> The thirty-four-year-old Grover, a West Point graduate, formed his 1,500 soldiers into line and ordered them to fix bayonets. This classic bayonet charge- uncommon during the Civil War due to advances in rifled weaponry- initially caught the Confederates by surprise and achieved stunning success. But the lack if promised support allowed time for the Rebels to rally and doomed the attack to failure. <br /> <br /> The Unfinished Railroad Loop Trail (1.2 miles) explores the ground over which Grover's bayonet charge took place. Interpretive exhibits discuss the attack in detail and tell the stories of several participants. Hiking time is approximately 45 minutes. ",

Winfield Scott to guard the Washington Navy Yard. Over the coming weeks, the militiamen joined several expeditions down the Potomac River and saw action against Confederate shore batteries near Aquia Creek. In recognition of their service, Capt. John Dahlgren, U.S.N., presented the regiment with a pair of 12-pounder boat howitzers.<br /> <br /> The commander of the 71st NYSM assigned the guns to Company I, led by Capt. Augustus V.H. Ellis, who drilled the men incessantly in their use. The boat howitzers, designed by Dahlgren in 1849, offered versatility for amphibious operations. The smoothbore guns could be mounted in the bow of a landing craft and quickly transferred to a field carriage for service ashore.<br /> <br /> As the Union army marched toward Manassas Junction, Company I wheeled the howitzers by hand approximately 30 miles from the Navy Yard. Each soldier of the company carried two rounds of ammunition- an extra 24 lbs. per man! The guns rendered effective service here on Matthews Hill alongside the Rhode Island battery. In the frenzied retreat that afternoon, the howitzers were abandoned and captured near Cub Run. In addition to the loss of their boat howitzers, the 71st NYSM suffered 62 causalities during the battle. <br /> <br /> These two howitzers were donated to Manassas National Battlefield Park by Fairfax County, and their restoration was supported by the Manassas Battlefield Trust. </p>",

The Southern soldier survived the war and honored the request. <br /> <br /> \"If a fight comes off, it will be today or tomorrow & will be a most dreadful & decisive one. This may be my last letter, dear love, for I shall not spare myself...\" - Col. Fletcher Webster in a letter to his wife, written on the morning of his death.",

    "bodyText": "In 1860, Benjamin Chinn and his family lived here in a two-and-a-half story frame farmhouse. Known as \"Hazel Plain,\" the modest plantation comprised several hundred acres. The property was typical of those in Prince William County, yielding wheat, corn, oats, and potatoes for cash and subsistence. Like roughly one-third of their immediate neighbors, the Chinn family owned slaves. <br /> <br /> War engulfed the Chinn homestead twice in thirteen months. Prominently located on a high ridge overlooking the Warrenton Turnpike and Young's Branch, Hazel Plain stood as a silent witness to some of the heaviest fighting during both battles of Manassas. On each occasion the family took refuge with relatives. They returned to find their house stained with blood and their well fouled by amputated limbs. It was a scene familiar to many local residents whose homes stood in the crosshairs of combat.",

    "bodyText": "In 1997 the National Park Service and the Smithsonian Institution began to develop a proposal at Manassas National Battlefield Park to mitigate the loss of wetlands resulting from construction of the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, a National Air and Space Museum facility at Washington Dulles International Airport. The two agencies selected a heavily disturbed area here near Stuart's Hill, the site of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's headquarters during the Second Battle of Manassas in August 1862. A development company had graded nearly 125 acres for a proposed mixed-use project, but public outcry led the U. S. Congress to pass legislation in the fall of 1988, seizing the property and saving it from further development.<br /> <br /> A 1993 study by the University of Georgia School of Environmental Design proposed restoring the land and its vegetative cover to 1860s conditions. Without funding for implementation, however, the study remained shelved for nearly a decade. Consultants for the Smithsonian used these earlier findings to refine plans for restoring the landscape and its wetlands. With funding from the Commonwealth of Virginia, restoration work began in 2003. Environmental Quality Resources, LLC, re-contoured more than 100 acres and restored drainage patterns, forming about 30 acres of emergent wetlands, 15 acres of forested wetlands, and native warm season grass meadows.The resulting project, completed in November 2003, represented a unique fusion of history and science meeting the resource management needs of both the Smithsonian and the park.<br /> <br /> As Union forces prepared to attack General Jackson's Confederate line along the unfinished railroad to the north, Union General John F. Reynolds made a personal reconnaissance of the field beyond his skirmishers posted along the Groveton Road (Lewis' Lane). He immediately drew fire from a Confederate skirmish line deployed in this open ground, providing covering fire as General James Longstreet massed his five infantry divisions for an attack on the Union left flank. <br /> <br /> Narrowly escaping injury, Reynolds reported his findings and received permission to shift his three brigades of Pennsylvania Reserves to the vicinity of the Chinn Farm (about a mile to the east) where theoretically they could better guard the Union left and rear. This movement created a dangerous gap in the Union lines south of the Warrenton Turnpike. To support Lt. Charles Hazlett's Battery D, 5th U.S. Artillery at Groveton, Colonel G.K. Warren moved his small brigade of New York Zouaves into the position previously occupied by Reynolds' entire division. <br /> <br /> Longstreet's Confederates advanced at 4:00 p.m. smashing through Warren's two regiments east of the Groveton Road and gaining Chinn Ridge before meeting significant resistance. The attack on the Union left was not checked until Longstreet's lead brigades reached the Sudley Road 1-1/2 miles to the east where Union General John Pope had hastily formed a strong defensive position on Henry Hill. After dark, the Union army retreated across Bull Run, ending the battle. <br /> <br /> Regiments, Brigades, and Divisions<br /> The regiment was the basic organizational unit of Civil War armies. Soldiers identified with and took pride in their regiments. Volunteer regiments were designated by a number and by the state which raised it. A regiment was composed of a headquarters staff and ten companies identified by letters A-K (J not used to avoid confusion with I) initial muster each company would have 100 men with officers, but frequently effective strength was severely diminished by battle losses, disease, and desertions. To facilitate command and control, up to five regiments could be grouped together to form a brigade. Two to four brigades formed a division. <br />  ",

Evans stood watch over the Stone Bridge, prepared to contest Union efforts to cross Bull Run. His brigade of 1,100 Confederates anchored the left flank of a seven mile defensive line guarding Manassas Junction. At first light on July 21, Federals east of the bridge sent artillery shells screaming overhead. Skirmishers from both sides opened a sporadic musket fire. <br /> <br /> After two hours Evans became suspicious; no Federal attack had developed. Soon he received a timely message via signal flag: \"Look out for your left! You are turned!\" Leaving a detachment here to guard the bridge, Evans shifted the balance of his brigade toward Matthews Hill, one mile to the west. There he hoped to intercept the Union advance and buy time for Confederate reinforcements to reach the field. <br /> <br /> Union commander Irvin McDowell's plan was to out-flank the Confederate left with a swift, coordinated attack via Sudley Ford, while maintaining a diversion at Stone Bridge.<br /> <br /> The Confederate army established three signal stations to communicate over its defensive line. Soldiers sent coded messages by signal flag, a system known as \"wig-wagging.\" Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence that Confederates erected signal towers at these locations. </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The foundation stones in front of you are all that remain of a once grand estate known as Pittsylvania. Landon Carter, Jr., grandson of Robert \"King\" Carter, built Pittsylvania around 1765. The Georgian-style frame house stood on a prominent knoll, surrounded by gardens, outbuildings, and slave quarters. It enjoyed a commanding view of the entire countryside. <br /> <br /> By the outbreak of the Civil War, however, Pittsylvania was in serious decline. Financial troubles and division of the estate had reduced the plantation to 283 acres. Many of its structures stood in ruin. The main house, like many neighboring buildings, served as a field hospital after the battles of Manassas. <br /> <br /> One eyewitness recalled: \"A large part of the old mansion had been unoccupied for some years and was out of repair. There in huge old rooms with that English wall paper hanging in strips and fallen plaster swept into corners, the wounded were lying- some in great carven four-poster beds, some on pallets and on the floor...\" One of the Carter's seven children, daughter Judith, was killed on Henry Hill as a bedridden widow during the First Battle of Manassas. Although Pittsylvania survived both battles, the house burned in the autumn of 1862. </p>",

By 7 p.m., the Confederate attack had lost all momentum. <br /> <br /> Despite the clear success the Confederates had achieved at Second Manassas, Lee had been unable to deliver a crushing blow to the enemy. The Union army survived battered but intact, retaining possession of Henry Hill, and keeping their avenue of retreat open. That night, under cover of darkness, General Pope ordered his Army of Virginia to withdraw across Bull Run, effectively ending the Second Battle of Manassas. A grim destiny had befallen the Federals twice in a thirteen-month period at Manassas.</p>",

Eight hours later many of these men retraced their route in retreat from the battlefield. <br /> <br /> On August 29, 1862, Confederate forces under Maj. Gen.

They marched in search of the elusive \"Stonewall\" Jackson, who was operating behind Union lines with half the Confederate army. As the head of the column passed the village of Groveton, Confederate artillery emerged from the woods and fired upon the unsuspecting Federals. Union troops turned to fight a fierce twilight battle near the Brawner farm that began the three day battle of Second Manassas. <br /> <br /> Begin your tour at the Brawner Farm Interpretive Center. The facility, open seasonally, contains interpretive exhibits and audio-visual programs about the campaign.

With each few minutes that passed, more Federals reached the front. <br /> <br /> Yet Union forces encountered stiff resistance. Confederate troops made headlong charges in a bold show of force that disguised their true weakness in numbers. It took over ninety minutes to dislodge the stubborn Confederates.

Behind them, artillery occupied the crest of Henry Hill, in position to fire safely over the infantry. \"I saw this would be a splendid covert for my men,\" the general later remembered. \"They could be entirely protected while loading and only expose their heads while firing over the bank.\" Soon the rattle of musketry and the thunder of cannon fire reverberated from one end of the Union line to the other.<br /> <br /> Repeatedly the Georgians charged only to be repulsed, falling back to Chinn Branch behind you to regroup. But the Rebels edged closer with each successive assault, eventually causing Milroy's men to abandon the roadbed and scramble up the slopes of Henry Hill. Milroy galloped frantically to the summit in search of reinforcements, as the Union position appeared in dire jeopardy.

Facing repeated Confederate harassment, Abraham and Jemima returned to New Jersey, while their daughter remained behind to manage the farm.<br /> <br /> Following the war, Elizabeth Van Pelt filed a claim for damages to the estate of her father, who died in 1866.

Most of the fighting raged one mile to the north near Deep Cut. Around 4 p.m. an ominous silence took hold. Much of the distant firing had stopped. Suddenly a violent burst of musketry pierced the stillness. Terrified Union skirmishers came running out of the woods, followed by a tremendous crashing of brush and leaves- the sound of a large army approaching. <br /> <br /> The 5th New York hurried to form a battle line along the crest of this slope. By then, thousands of Confederates were at the edge of the trees firing volley after volley. The New Yorkers were overrun in less than ten minutes. The unit sustained 123 men killed or mortally wounded- the greatest loss of life in any Union infantry regiment in any single action of war. Remembering the one-sided slaughter, a veteran compared it to \"the very vortex of Hell.\" <br /> <br /> The grassy slope behind you, covered with the colorful red and blue uniforms of fallen Zouaves, reminded one Southerner of a field of Texas wildflowers. ",

With evening drawing on, General James Longstreet proposed an alternative- a reconnaissance in force to secure a foothold near the enemy from which to launch a major attack the next morning. <br /> <br /> About the same time, General John Pope erroneously concluded the Confederate army was retreating. The Federal commander quickly chose to mount a pursuit and ordered a Union division westward on the turnpike toward the small hamlet of Groveton. As the head of the Union column ascended this hill near sundown, it collided with Longstreet's troops making their reconnaissance. <br /> <br /> Though darkness prevented any decisive action, the engagement temporarily altered battle plans and instilled caution on both sides. The action revealed the Confederate army was not in retreat, but the clash also denied the Rebels the foothold they sought near the Federal army. Before dawn the Confederates quietly pulled back to their original positions west of Groveton. </p>",

In order to reach commercial markets near Washington, the Manassas Gap Railroad signed an agreement with its rival to use its tracks from the junction to the port of Alexandria. The annual cost of track rental cut into profits, however, and officials sought an alternate route.<br /> <br /> The Manassas Gap decided to lay its own track from Gainesville to Alexandria. Work on the \"Independent Line\" commenced in 1854 as engineers surveyed the proposed route. Local slaves and Irish immigrants provided much of the labor- felling trees, leveling the roadbed, and quarrying stone for bridge abutments. By the time grading operations neared completion in 1858, the company halted the project for lack of funds. No track was ever laid. The abandoned railbed became a ready-made defensive position for Confederate troops at Second Manassas.",

Both sides recognized its strategic importance. <br /> <br /> At daybreak, Union artillery fired from opening shots of First Manassas from a ridge one-half mile to the east (behind you). The attack was a ruse. The main Union column circled upstream instead, intending to surprise and outflank the Confederates by crossing at the unguarded Sudley Ford. <br /> <br /> Prior to abandoning the Manassas area, Confederate troops blew up the original bridge in March 1862. The current structure dates to 1884.</p> <h3>Second Battle of Manassas, Day Three, August 30, 1862, 9 p.m.</h3> <p>Under cover of darkness, the defeated Union army withdrew toward Centreville, four miles to the east. The troops crossed Bull Run on a makeshift wooden span, constructed several months earlier by Union engineers using the remaining bridge abutments. After the last soldiers filed across the stream, the replacement bridge was destroyed by the Union rear guard. </p>",

Widow Lucinda Dogan and her five young children moved here shortly after their residence, “Peach Grove,” burned in 1860. The family joined to smaller outbuildings to create the present dwelling.<br /> <br /> The house was repeatedly caught in the crossfire of opposing Union and Confederate armies during the Second Battle of Manassas. Numerous bullets and shell fragments scarred the structure. Years later, the family sought compensation for property damage during the war. The government denied the claim.<br /> <br /> Today, the house is one of only three remaining Civil War era buildings in the park.",
    "audioDescription": "This audio descriptive text for the L. Dogan House is 189 words in total. The Lucinda Dogan House is one of the three remaining Civil War-era buildings in Manassas National Battlefield Park. The structure is a small one-and-a-half story, whitewashed building with two rooms on the first floor and two cramped, peaked-roof rooms on the second floor. The structure is a combination of two antebellum outbuildings, or cabins, on the Lucinda Dogan farm of “Peach Grove” which served as the primary dwelling for Lucinda and her children when the main house burned in 1860. The L. Dogan House has one central chimney, three doorway entrances and three windows on the first floor and has a single window on both the south and north faces to provide light for the second-floor rooms. The structure is approximately thirty-seven feet long on its west and east walls and is approximately sixteen-feet wide on its south and north walls. The structure is approximately twenty feet tall from ground level to the peak of the roof. Four wooden steps provide entry into the front door on the east side of the house while the door on the west side of the house is accessed via a stone step.",

Union troops stationed at nearby Fairfax Court House, many of whom had recently served on burial duty at the battlefield, recognized the need for a fitting memorial to the Federal dead of First Manassas. With the approval of their officers and the authorization of the government, and in one of their final acts before discharge, the soldiers erected the Bull Run monument. Construction took nearly three weeks and was completed in June 1865. It remains one of the oldest extant monuments on any Civil War battlefield.<br /> <br /> <strong>Inscription:</strong> <div style=\"text-align: center;\">In Memory of the Patriots Who Fell at Bull Run<br /> July 21, 1861<br /> Erected June 10th 1865</div>",

The Bull Run Monument is an approximately sixteen-foot-tall native brownstone, or sandstone, square-shafted obelisk situated upon a pyramidal earthen pedestal of approximately five feet in height. The obelisk is embellished with five cylindroconical two hundred pounder Parrott rifle artillery projectiles; one at the top of the obelisk and one at each of the four corners where the stone obelisk rests upon the earthen pedestal. The monument sits in the east, or rear, yard of the postwar Henry House, approximately thirty feet behind the house, and was built by Union soldiers in the spring of 1865 to commemorate the Union soldiers who died in the First Battle of Manassas, or Bull Run in July of 1861. A white marble plaque, approximately two-foot square, on the western, or front, face of the obelisk is inscribed: “In memory of the patriots who fell at Bull Run. July 21, 1861”. An identically sized white marble plaque on the eastern, or rear face of the obelisk is inscribed: “Erected June 10th 1865”.",

    "bodyText": "Foundation stones are all that remain of a once grand estate known as Pittsylvania. Landon Carter, Jr., grandson of Robert “King” Carter, built Pittsylvania around 1765. The Georgian-style frame house stood on a prominent knoll, surrounded by gardens, outbuildings, and slave quarters. It enjoyed a commanding view of the entire countryside.<br /> <br /> By the outbreak of the Civil War, however, Pittsylvania was in serious decline. Financial troubles and division of the estate had reduced the plantation to 283 acres. Many of its structures stood in ruin. The main house, like many neighboring buildings, served as a field hospital after the battles of Manassas.<br /> <br /> One eyewitness recalled: “A large part of the old mansion had been unoccupied for some years and was out of repair. There in huge old rooms with that English wall paper hanging in strips and fallen plaster swept into corners, the wounded were lying – some in great carven four-poster beds, some on pallets and on the floor…” One of Carter’s seven children, daughter Judith, was killed on Henry Hill as a bedridden widow during the First Battle <br /> of Manassas. Although Pittsylvania survived both battles, the house burned in the autumn of 1862.",

Family oral history suggests that James' father was possibly a member of the Carter family of Pittsylvania plantation. In 1840, James purchased 170 acres of land on Henry Hill. Within a decade, he had built a modest one-and-one-half story log dwelling and assorted outbuildings. Robinson was the third wealthiest free black man living in Prince William County prior to the war.<br /> <br /> Nine family members, spanning three generations, resided here in 1860. During the First Battle of Manassas, the family took refuge in a neighbor's cellar, and James reportedly hid under the turnpike bridge over Young's Branch. Despite its location amidst the fighting, the house escaped major damage. The farm remained safely behind Union lines through most of the Second Battle of Manassas, although General Franz Sigel established his headquarters on the property.<br /> <br /> The family dismantled the original structure in the 1920s to expand their post-war dwelling. The post-war house burned in 1993.  ",

The Robinson House Site is the location a Civil War-era structure owned by an African-American freedman named Jim Robinson. The house survived the First and Second Battles of Manassas and stood here until the family dismantled the original structure in the 1920s to expand their post-war dwelling. The postwar structure later burned in an arson fire in 1993. A stone foundation outlines the dimensions of the postwar house and is approximately thirty-seven-feet-long in the east-to-west dimension and approximately sixteen-feet-long in the north-to-south dimension. The postwar structure was one room deep and three rooms wide. The width of the foundation varies in places due to the fact that it is only one stone wide in most places and the stones are of various sizes. The site is located in a well-manicured grassy area atop Henry Hill approximately four-hundred-yards northeast of the Henry House. A gravel driveway extends north approximately one-hundred yards from the Robinson House site to U.S. Highway 29.",

    "bodyText": "The large bronze equestrian statue of Brigadier General Thomas Jonathon Jackson commemorates his role in the Confederate victory at First Manassas (Bull Run) on July 21, 1861. It was here on the plateau of Henry Hill where Jackson received his famous sobriquet \"Stonewall\" as his brigade of Virginians made a determined stand against the Union advance which proved critical to the Confederate victory later in the day.  <br /> <br /> The idea for the monument came out of preparations for the 75th anniversary of the battle in 1936, and the General Assembly of Virginia appropriated $25,000 in two equal installments for the purpose of erecting a monument to Jackson. The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts was commissioned to conduct a national sculpture competition for the design of the statue. The Jackson monument was unveiled and dedicated on August 31, 1940.  ",
    "audioDescription": "This audio descriptive text for the Thomas J. Jackson Monument is 245 words in total. The Thomas J. Jackson Monument is a larger-than-life-size bronze equestrian statue of Confederate General Thomas Jonathan “Stonewall” Jackson atop a polished black granite pedestal. The monument stands on the highest piece of ground on Henry Hill in the middle of a field approximately 125 yards east of the Visitor Center. Jackson and his horse face northwest towards the Union Army artillery positioned on the western edge of the hilltop. The pedestal is approximately six-feet-tall, four-feet-wide and ten-feet-long and has short inscriptions on all four sides. On the northwest, or front, face is the inscription: “Thomas Jonathan Jackson. 1824-1863”. On the northeast face is the inscription: “First Battle of Manassas. July 21, 1861”. On the southwest face is the inscription: “There stands Jackson like a stone wall”. On the southeast, or rear, face is the inscription: “Erected by the State of Virginia under Act of 1938. Governors. George C. Perry. James H. Price. Sponsors. John W. Rust. Henry T. Wickham. Aubrey G. Weaver”. The bronze statue is approximately ten-feet-tall from the horses’ hooves to the top of Jackson’s hat. His horse is standing on all four legs with ears cocked and with head bowed and facing the Union foe. Jackson is portrayed wearing knee-high boots; a kepi on his head; and his coat is billowing behind him. An officer’s sword in its scabbard adorns his left hip and extends downward towards the pedestal. Jackson has a spade-shaped beard and his facial expression is determined and resolute.",

Built in the 1840s it was home to John and Martha Thornberry and their five children. John Thornberry operated a wheelright shop nearby, servicing the wagon traffic that frequented Sudley Mill. He supplemented the family’s income as a carpenter and part-time undertaker.</p> <p>With John away serving in the Confederate Army, Martha took the children to her sister’s farm on Stony Ridge during First Manassas. Although the house escaped the combat, it was overrun with wounded Union Soldiers following the fighting. Driven away again the ensuing year during Second Manassas, the family returned to discover more than 150 bodies strewn about the property.</p> <p>Laura Thornberry, seven-years-old at the time of First Manassas, recalled the damage nearly 75 years later: \"There was not an article of anything left in it. Ten men had bled to death in mother’s bedroom the night before. Carpets and all furniture were out and gone…The old farm well in the back yard was full of everything that would go in it. Such as China ware, cooking utensils, flat irons, and everything you can imagine used by a family was thrown in it. How we all cried over it; and no prospects of replacing any of it.\"<br /> <br /> The Thornberry House is open to the public only during special events.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Thornberry House is one of the three remaining Civil War-era buildings in Manassas National Battlefield Park. The structure is a two-story, whitewashed frame house with an attached lean-to on its south side. The northern half of the house is, most likely, a postwar addition to the wartime house. The house has one large central chimney and four symmetrical second-floor windows protruding above the roof. There are two doors on both the west and the east sides of the structure. Seven windows are found on the first floor. The Thornberry House is, in many ways, representative of the numerous middle-class residences occupying the area at the time of the Civil War.",

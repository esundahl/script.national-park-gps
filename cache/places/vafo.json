    "bodyText": "<p>The Maurice Stephens House, located on the Grand Parade at Valley Forge, is a 2-story, 5-bay farmhouse with 1 1/2 story 2-bay addition to the east. The original section has a full attic and cellar. The original main entrance to the home faces south with the rear entrance facing Rt. 23. The main section of the house was built around 1816 by Maurice Stephens, and additions were built around 1841 by William Henry. The home was remodeled by the Valley Forge State Park in the 1950s and in 1975. The size of the house is 40 by 30 1/2 feet with the addition of 18 by 21 feet.</p> <p>The land on the Grand Parade where the Maurice Stephens House sits today was owned by the Stephens family beginning in 1742, when Maurice’s grandmother Elinor Evans bought the land from William Penn. Elinor Evans willed the 150-acre property to Maurice in 1758 when he was still a minor, and a 1761 codicil to Elinor’s will stipulates that the dwelling on the property would be rented until Maurice came of age, with the rental proceeds going to his mother until that time. The main block of the home was built by Maurice Stephens in 1816, as proclaimed by the structure’s date stone, \"M.S. 1816,\" located in the east gable.</p> <p>As late as 1976, it was thought that at least part of the house served as Brigadier General Jedediah Huntington’s quarters during the encampment of the Continental Army in the winter of 1777- 78. However, historic documentation strongly suggests that General Huntington’s quarters were in a log house formerly on the property, and not in the existing masonry house.</p> <p>At the time of the Valley Forge encampment, French Engineer Officer Duportail indicates a structure at this location on his map of the camp, but he does not label it, and General Huntington's copious correspondence does not describe the details of his Valley Forge accommodations.</p> <p>In 1798, the Direct Tax List for Upper Merion Township shows the Stephens farm to include a log dwelling and stone milk house. The log house was 16 by 25 feet in dimension and the stone milk house 15 by 20 feet, the latter of which corresponds roughly to the extant spring house on the property. It is most likely that General Huntington stayed in the log dwelling in 1777-78.</p> <p>Want to learn more about the Maurice Stephens House?

The monument commemorates the arrival and the sacrifices of General George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge during that winter of the American Revolutionary War.</p> <p>The monument was designed by Paul Philippe Cret, being a simplified version of the Arch of Titus in Rome (81 CE) which marked the capture of Jerusalem by Emperor Titus in 70 CE. In the classical tradition, a triumphal arch of one or three openings was erected to honor generals or emperors. This memorial arch with its single opening is classically proper as a national tribute to General Washington and the army he led.</p> <p>In 1907 the Valley Forge Park Commission developed a plan for the construction of two arches, a Washington Arch at the Valley Creek entrance to the park, and a von Steuben Arch at the park entrance at the opposite end on Port Kennedy Road (North Gulph Road and Route 23). These were to serve as entrance gates (the park was enclosed with an iron fence at this time) as well as monuments honoring the two generals and the troops. The bill for the two arches at $50,000 each was approved by the House of Representatives in March 1910, but failed in the Senate. A bill for one arch was approved in October 1910 for $100,000. Funds were appropriated in 1911, construction began in 1914 and dedication ceremonies were conducted on June 19, 1917.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "The Patriots of African Descent Monument is a granite block with carved text and a bronze bas-relief. The bronze relief depicts three soldiers of African descent, one facing left, one facing right, and one in the middle facing straight ahead. The men all wear military uniforms, each holding a musket. The three soldiers depicted in the bronze relief look well-disciplined and proud. On the back of the monument another reaffirms why the monument is there with the words: “In Honor of the PATRIOTS OF AFRICAN DESCENT who served, suffered, and sacrificed during the Valley Forge Encampment 1777-1778.” There is also a quote by Charles L. Blockson, the founder of the Blockson Collection of African American historical documents at Temple University: “Throughout these historic and hallowed campsites were courageous Black Patriots who participated in our nation’s bitter fight for independence.”",

A small section of the house may have stood during the encampment.</p> <p>From 1774 to 1854 the property belonged to John Brown and his heirs. In 1854 it was purchased by a local industrialist, who needed to control the water flow of nearby Valley Creek for his mill. By 1893 the property had changed hands at least six times before Edward and Amanda Mathews made it their home. The Mathews, who had become millionaires from the California gold rush, remodeled the 18th century home into a Queen Ann-style estate, complete with swimming pool, bath house, and tennis courts.</p> <p>Two years after Edward Mathew's death in 1901, the property was sold to then U.S. Attorney General Philander Chase Knox. P.C. Knox served as Attorney General under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. He also served as Secretary of State under President William Howard Taft. As Attorney General, he was noted for his \"trust busting\" suit of Northern Securities Company. As Secretary of State from 1909 to 1913, he promoted policies aimed at increasing US trade abroad.</p> <p>P.C. Knox purchased the property to provide a weekend retreat from Washington D.C. and give his eldest son, Reed, a place to breed horses. When his daughter, Rebekah, married James Tindle, President Theodore Roosevelt was a guest for the ceremonies and spent the night at the house.</p> <p>After Knox retired in 1913, he began to change the house from a Queen Ann-style to the Colonial Revival you see today. In 1965 the house was sold to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and became a part of Valley Forge State Park. In 1976 Valley Forge State Park became Valley Forge National Historical Park.</p> <p>Today, the P.C. Knox estate is leased by the National Park Service to a for-profit partner, and currently functions as an event venue.

    "bodyText": "A veteran of the Prussian Army, Frederick Wilhelm Von Steuben was in France in 1777. There he was introduced to Benjamin Franklin and he volunteered his services to advise the ill-trained American army. Starting at Valley Forge, he converted the ragged, starving army into an effective fighting force and developed the logistical system that allowed the army to survive in the field. His program greatly increased morale and strengthened the army. He authored the \"Regulations for the order and discipline of the troops of the United States\", sometimes referred to as the \"Blue Book,\" which still remains a basic reference for military training and organization.<br /> <br /> As gratitude for his wartime contributions, New York State deeded him a large parcel of land in 1786 and congress granted von Steuben a life annuity in 1790. He spent his summers at his two room log house on the site until his large manor house could be built. Steuben also planned on large scale development of his lands. His large house remained unbuilt and only minimal land development had been accomplished when Steuben died in his cabin in November of 1794. Per his request he was laid in an unmarked grave, but road development exposed his grave in 1804. One of his former aids, Benjamin Walker, took charge of his remains and donated part of the land Steuben had bequeathed him as a final resting place for the Baron’s remains. The site today is known as the \"Sacred Grove.\" <br /> <br /> In addition to the “Sacred Grove”, the site also contains a replica of Steuben’s cabin. <br /> <br /> <strong>NOTE: </strong>Steuben Memorial is managed in partnership with the National Park Service at Fort Stanwix National Monument.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "<p>The bronze statue of Friedrich Wilhelm August Heinrich Ferdinand von Steuben, more commonly known as Baron von Steuben, overlooks the Grand Parade at Valley Forge. This monument's imposing presence is due in part to its height, with an 8 ½ foot tall statue mounted on top of a 6 foot 8 inches tall granite pedestal. Despite its larger-than-life appearance, the statue is realistic, simple, elegant, and detailed without being ornate. In the biography of J. Otto Schweizer, the statue's sculptor, the monument is described as depicting a:</p> <blockquote> <p>sturdy figure clad in the uniform of a Continental General covered with a heavy coat. The general strikes a watchful posture, his right foot resting on a slight elevation of the ground. The thumb of his left hand rests nonchalantly on the hilt while the other fingers hold the sheath. The well formed right hand reaches over the chest and grasps the left facing of his coat in a Napoleon-like gesture. The powerful head with its turned up hat reveals a grim determination albeit softened by human kindness.</p> </blockquote> <p>The von Steuben monument at Valley Forge is an exact replica of a statue in Utica, New York, except for the addition of a bronze plaque mounted on the pedestal, which depicts General von Steuben drilling the soldiery. In the plaque, von Steuben stands in the center. To the left, he drills the troops. To the right Schweizer depicted a camp scene complete with soldier huts, cannon, a headquarters building, and more soldiers.</p> <p>The statue was originally located on Outer Line Drive beyond the Anthony Wayne Statue. Photographs of the monument in its original location show it surrounded by trees - supposedly linden trees - which began life as seedlings from Germany. The monument was moved to its current location along Route 23 on September 10, 1979.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>This statue of George Washington, located near Washington's Headquarters at Valley Forge, is a cast bronze copy of a marble statue by French sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon. The original statue was commissioned by the state of Virginia in 1784, completed sometime between 1788 and 1792, and to this day sits in the rotunda of the Virginia State Capital building in Richmond.</p> <p>There were multiple cast bronze copies made using molds struck from the marble original, and the statue at Valley Forge was created in 1932 to celebrate the bicentennial of George Washington's birth. The statue was first acquired by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/washington-memorial-chapel.htm\">Washington Memorial Chapel</a> and later transferred to Valley Forge National Historical Park.</p> <p>Sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon visited George Washington at his home at Mount Vernon in 1785. During the visit, Houdon sculpted a terracotta bust and made a plaster life mask of the retired general. Armed with the measurements he had taken, the face mask he had created, and the insight he had gained into Washington during his stay at Mount Vernon, Houdon returned to France to begin work on the final statue.</p> <p>During the planning phase, Houdon created two different models. In the first model, Washington wears a military uniform and holds a walking stick while his sword hangs nearby. In the second model, Washington wears classical Roman garments and holds a bundle of fasces (an ancient Roman symbol that represents civil authority and strength through unity). A plow is also behind Washington.</p> <p>These last two details symbolically link Washington to Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, a Roman leader who was given dictatorial powers to deal with a military emergency, but who relinquished power and went back to his farm after the threat was mitigated. Washington had been compared to Cincinnatus since he resigned his military commission at the end of the war, and Americans would have recognized this symbolism at the time.</p> <p>Ultimately, Houdon created a piece that blended the ideas of both models. A life-sized Washington is wearing military garb and standing in front of a plow. He holds a cane instead of his sword, which hangs from a bundle of fasces containing 13 rods. This version of the statue keeps Washington true to life by using contemporary clothing, but retains the symbolism evoked by the fasces, plow, and placement of the sword.</p>",

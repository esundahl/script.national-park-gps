    "bodyText": "In 1890, brothers Edward and Edwin Baltzley created the Glen Echo on the Potomac real estate development hoping to lure Washingtonians to live in the beauty and serenity of this new suburban community. Glen Echo became the site of the 53rd Chautauqua Assembly, offering summer courses in the liberal and practical arts. The crown jewel of the Chautauqua was an 8,000-seat amphitheater that sat atop Minnehaha Creek and used the water flow to power the speaker system. During the amusement park era, the amphitheater became the Midway, home to many rides and entertainments.<br /> <br /> The trestle that supported the Glen Echo trolley - the primary mode of public transportation that carried visitors to the park during the Chautauqua and early amusement park years - is visible from the bridge as you look toward MacArthur Boulevard.Â <br /> <br /> The Baltzley brothers donated a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/clara-barton-national-historic-site.htm\">house and land to Clara Barton</a>, the founder of the American Red Cross, in an effort to bring prestige to their Glen Echo community. Built in 1891, it was first used as a warehouse for disaster relief suppolies. In 1897, Miss Barton made it her home and the headquarters for the American Red Cross. Thinking the house looked too somber, Miss Barton changed the Original granite facade of the residence to an elegant Victorian wooden facade, retaining only the granite corners.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Over the course of her lifetime, Clara Barton was a dedicated Civil War nurse, an active womenâs rights suffragette, and the founder and first president of the American Red Cross.Â She lived in the house on theÂ property for a brief time in 1891, and then again from 1897 until her death in 1912.Â </p> <p>From 1891-97, the house served as an American Red Cross warehouse, and it was the organizationâs national headquarters from 1897-1904. The Red Cross continued to use the house as a warehouse for relief supplies, stationery, and Red Cross publications.Â </p> <p>Inside, the first floor includes a parlor room, dining room, offices, and a kitchen. The second floor was for bedrooms, including Ms. Barton's room at the rear of the house. Look up to the third floor and note the windows with red crosses in them. Some of the interior walls and ceilings are covered with muslin, the same material used in bandages.</p> <p>During her residence here, Barton developed the landscape into a miniature farm that was primarilyÂ self-sustaining, including crops, stables, and a chicken coop. ThisÂ agricultural use of the landscape is no longer evident; development at the Glen Echo amusement park including roller coasters and the modern parking lot built over most of the farming operation. Many of the trees and plants that grow today are not consistent with the historic function of the grounds. However, theÂ Clara Barton House isÂ the most significant building associated with her time at Glen Echo, and it remains intact.</p> <p>In the years following Ms. Barton's death in 1912, her colleague, Dr. Julian Hubbell, replaced the porch with a columned, one-story porch. His twin nieces inherited the house in 1929 and converted the interior to rent-producing apartments, added baths and kitchens, and a garage with screened porches above at the western rear corner.Â </p> <p>Congress declared the Clara Barton House a National Historic Landmark on January 12, 1965, and in 1974 passed legislation establishing the house and grounds as the Clara Barton National Historic Site. This property was acquired by NPS in April 1975 through a donation from the Friends of Clara Barton.Â </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Installed at Glen Echo Park in 1921, the carousel was made by the Dentzel Carousel Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The carousel features a menagerie of animals who gallop to the music of a Wurlitzer band organ. More than 1,000 lights sparkle from the carousel and are reflected in the mirrors on the rounding board and on the inner drum. The carousel turns at about 5 revolutions per minute.</p> <p>In 1960, the carousel was the focal point of a civil rights sit-in demonstration against segregation at the park. Because the amusement park was segregated - whites only - many were left out. To highlight the unfairness of the practice, on the evening of June 30, 1960, Laurence Henry, a 26-year-old Howard University student, led approximately two dozen âNon-violent Action Groupâ (NAG) members, both black and white, and two high school students on a protest of Glen Echo Amusement Park. After the high school students were turned away at the park's entrance, Henry and others rushed to the carousel, with ride tickets that were purchased on their behalf by white protesters. Once seated, they were confronted by state-deputized security guard Frank Collins. Five of the protesters were arrested. Protestors picketed at the gates of the park for 11 weeks that summer. Yielding to local pressure, the park's private owners opened its gates to all races in 1961.</p> <p>In 1970, the carousel was slated to be moved to California. The local community, however, raised the funds to purchase the carousel and donated it to the National Park Service, thereby saving it for the present and future generations. The Glen Echo Park Partnership currently operates and maintains the carousel.Â </p> <p>A 20-year effort to restore the carousel was completed in 2003. An additional round of restoration was completed in 2019-2020, restoring the organ, roof, and murals in the structure. The carousel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p> <h2>Dentzel Carousels</h2> <p>The Glen Echo Park carousel was manufactured by one of the country's foremost carousel builders, the Dentzel Carousel Company. In 1860, young Gustav Dentzel, son of a carousel maker in Germany, came to the United States and founded his company in Philadelphia. His son William Dentzel carried on the family business until 1929.</p> <p>Dentzel Carousels were known for their realistic, graceful animals and elaborate carvings. Artisans created the Glen Echo carousel using production line methods. They shaped the various parts of the animals' head, legs, and tail and fastened them with glue and dowels to a hollow wooden body. A master carver finished the carvings, making sure that all the parts blended together gracefully. Artisans applied a base coat of white paint and finished the animals with brilliant colors and sometimes even gold leaf. Finally they added a protective coat of varnish.</p> <p>The Glen Echo carousel is called a \"menagerie carousel\" because it is made up of many different kinds of animals. The animals stand in three concentric rings with the \"romance\" side, the more highly-carved and decorated side facing out, and the \"plain\" side facing in. The carousel also has two circus chariots. Although there seems to be no beginning or end to the circle of animals, there actually is a lead or \"king\" horse. Look for the most intricately-carved animal.</p> <p>The Glen Echo carousel is an electric-powered platform model, so the animals ride on a suspended floor. The 48-foot platform tilts slightly inward, like a curve on a highway. When in motion it turns counterclockwise and makes about five revolutions a minute.</p> <h2>The Wurlitzer Organ</h2> <p>The carousel moves to the music of a Wurlitzer band organ, which was installed in 1926 and is a rare attraction in itself. it operates much like a player piano with perforated paper rolls. From the 256 wooden pipes flow the sounds of an orchestra with viola, bass, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, violin, flute, flageolet, and piccolo. The organ also has a glockenspiel, castanets, a cymbal, and snare and bass drums. Only twelve Wurlitzer organs of this style are known to exist.</p> <h2>Carousels: an endangered species</h2> <p>When the popularity of urban amusement parks declined in the 1960s, many carousels were dismantled and sold piece by piece to collectors. Rescued from this fate by a group of local citizens in 1970, the Dentzel carousel at Glen Echo Park is one of about 155 functioning antique carousels in the country and one of the few that is in its original location.<br /> <br /> Protecting this rare treasure from wear and tear while still operating it for the public's enjoyment takes special care. Craftspeople and park staff constantly repair and maintain the complex machinery, the band organ, and the canopy building that houses the carousel. In the mid-1980s, restoration workers began the time-consuming process of returning the carousel and its animals to their original, brilliant appearance. The restoration work was completely funded by donations from carousel riders and other private citizens.</p> <h2>Saving a local treasure</h2> <p>Visitors to Glen Echo can enjoy the park and the Dentzel carousel today because of a remarkable public effort. At the end of the 1968 season, Glen Echo Amusement Park's owners announced that the park would close. To prevent further development of the area along the scenic Potomac River palisades, the federal government acquired the site in 1970 and later placed it under the care of the National Park Service. The community rallied to support the acquisition. In just one month during the same year, local residents mounted an aggressive campaign that raised $80,000 in private funds to buy the carousel from a collector who had purchased it after the amusement park closed. An additional $10,000 ensured the return of the Wurlitzer organ. The carousel and organ were donated to the National Park Service with the understanding that they would remain at Glen Echo Park and be operated for the public's enjoyment.</p> <h2>Restoring the carousel</h2> <p>As carousels began to be made of metals and fiberglass, workmen qualified to maintain hand-carved and painted carousels became hard to find. For financial reasons, amusement parks began to repaint and repair their own carousel figures, often using just two or three colors and adding bolts, nails, and screws to make hasty repairs. The carousel animals at Glen Echo had up to 10 layers of paint over the original, vibrant, factory layer.</p> <p>Restoring and refurbishing the carousel and its animals after years of alterations was a slow, painstaking process. Just one animal took 150 to 200 hours of intensive effort to restore. Rosa Ragan of Raleigh, North Carolina, a specialist in carousel and carousel animal restoration, has worked on the animals and other sections of the carousel since 1983.Â </p> Ragan began with meticulous detective work, cleaning away small 2\"x4\" portions of the surface until she found the original paint layer. She would create 40-50 of tehse sample areas over each animal, first softening the paint with a hair dryer or a heat gun, then using a small scalpel to scrape away the layers. As she progressed, she carefully documented what she saw with notes, drawings, and photographs. From these \"windows\" she could plot the colors and design and reconstruct the animals's initial appearance. Ragan next removed the paint from the entire animal until she reached the first stable layer. She then prepared the surface by coating, filling, sanding, and smoothing until it was ready to accept a new finish. Then she applied the paint, matched to the original brilliant hues, and added up to five coats of varnish to protect the animal from the wear and tear of use. Today, all of the carousel's 52 animals and other features have been restored. <p>Â </p> <p>The same public spirit of stewardship that kept the carousel at Glen Echo Park helped restore it to its original beauty. The costly process of maintaining the carousel continues through the support of park visitors and through a partnership with Montgomery County called Glen Echo Park Partnership for Arts and Culture. Tax deductible donations and a portion of ticket revenues go into a special Carousel Restoration fund. The Dentzel Carousel is an irreplaceable example of a vanished craft, an enjoyable experience for people of all ages, and a cherished community landmark.<br /> <br /> An additional round of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/glec/learn/management/dentzel-carousel-rehabilitation.htm\">restoration in 2019-2020</a> included rehabilitating the roof of the structure and repairing murals on the ceilings, as well as a refurbishment of the Wurlitzer organ.</p>",

She built a career of humanitarian service in a society that did not grant her full rights because of her gender.<br /> <br /> When Clara Barton moved into this house in 1897, she was 75 years old and had gained international fame for her work in the Civil War. After the war, Clara Barton traveled to Europe where she learned about the International Red Cross. She served with the German Red Cross in the Franco-Prussian War and earned several honors. When she returned to America, she spent five years lobbying Congress to ratify the Treaty of Geneva in order to establish the American Red Cross. In Glen Echo, Miss Barton continued her work in foreign aid, dipomacy, and equal rights while leading the American Red Cross. Along the way, Clara Barton developed ways of thinking that are part of our lives today. She gave us the first aid kit, emergency preparedness, and was a pioneer of natural disaster relief.</p>",

The stream flows under the building which together with one acre of grotto work under the stone floor...lighted by electricity will constitute one of the pleasing features of this vast structure.\"</em><br /> <br /> The arrival of the Glen Echo Chautauqua changed Minnehaha Creek: a large amphitheater was constructed in the creekbed in 1891. Here students gathered for lectures until a malaria scare closed the Chautauqua in 1892. Later, in 1899, a Glen Echo company developed the site into an amusement park. A remodeled amphitheater opened as the \"Midway\" in 1911.<br /> <br /> Glen Echo Park's popularity again changed Minnehaha Creek. In 1956 park owners extended the parking lot by removing the \"Midway\" and installing a large metal pipe or culvert. For 33 years Minnehaha Creek flowed silently underground until record breaking rains collapsed the parking lot and culvert in 1989. Following the flood, the National Park Service restored the creek's natural stream bed.

    "bodyText": "In 1972, six cupcake-shaped sod-roofed yurts (an experimental housing design based on traditional Mongolian dwelling huts) were erected in the park on the site of the demolished roller coaster to offer resident artists much-needed studio space. In 1975, the park's fledgling pottery classes moved out of the old amusement park cafeteria and into the yurts, establishing a permanent home for Glen Echo Pottery. The yurts also provide space for other resident studio artists.",

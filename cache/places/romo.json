It weathers to a rich red color that matches the trunks of the ponderosa trees nearby.<br /> <br /> The architect of this building, E. Thomas Casey, chose Cor-ten \"so that the structure of the building itself becomes its primary architectural expression.\" Cor-ten was a new material in 1967, when Beaver Meadows Visitor Center was constructed. In addition to exposing the structural steel, Mr. Casey designed the horizontally-oriented building to fit into its surroundings and wanted people to connect with the park through architecture.<br /> <br /> Mr. Casey told us \"this is the way [that] architecture ought to be. You know, that what you see is what you get.\" If this kind of passionate talk about architecture sounds familiar, it is because Mr. Casey was a fellow of Frank Lloyd Wright.<br /> <br /> Through the visible stone, steel and glass construction, the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center is an example of the continued influence of Wrightean design principles and mid-20th century modern architecture in national parks. This building is also a National Historic Landmark!",

The Fall River Entrance is one of two major entrance stations on the east side of the park and is located on U.S. Highway 34, just inside the park boundary.</p> <h2>What to Expect?</h2> <p><br /> During this major construction project, only one lane at Fall River Entrance will be operational to enter the park and one lane to exit. Park visitors are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to avoid the Fall River Entrance and use the Beaver Meadows Entrance.<br /> <br /> During this major project, park visitors should expect wait times at both major east side entrance stations. Weather and resources depending, the project should be completed by late June 2023.</p> <h2>Fall River Visitor Center Remains Open</h2> <p>Fall River Visitor Center and the Rocky Mountain Conservancy Nature Store are open during this construction project.<br /> <br /> The visitor center is open 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily 7-days a week. The visitor center is located along U.S. Highway 34 at 3450 Fall River Road, Estes Park, CO, 80517.</p> <h2>Why is this Project Important?</h2> <p>Originally designed only for summer operations, the existing Fall River Entrance Station was constructed in the 1960s. These existing facilities no longer meet the safety or operational needs of the park today.<br /> <br /> When the entrance station was designed, the park had approximately one and a half million annual visitors. By 2019, annual visitation almost tripled, to over 4.6 million annual visitors. Critical infrastructure improvements are needed to improve visitor access and convenience, reduce traffic congestion, and provide a safe and efficient space for park employees.</p> <h2>What will be Improved?</h2> <ul> <li> <p>A new office and three new entrance station kiosks, with proper ventilation, will be constructed</p> </li> <li>A new park entrance sign will be installed, which will include a small formal parking area.</li> <li>A fast pass lane will be added and the road will be widened, which should improve visitor wait times and the visitor experience while entering through the Fall River Entrance.</li> </ul> <p>This project will also rehabilitate and replace failing water and wastewater infrastructure that serves Fall River Entrance and the Bighorn Ranger Station. The on-site wastewater treatment system will be replaced, and other upgrades will occur. A culvert crossing Fall River Road is severely deteriorated and does not meet 100-year flood standards, it will be upgraded and replaced during this project.</p>",

The 137- acre district includes two distinct developed areas: the visitor service area at Fall River Pass proper and the Fall River Pumphouse and Catchment Basin, which sits in the valley below. This district includes 131 acres of alpine tundra, a significant character-defining feature. The Alpine Visitor Center, at 11,795 feet above sea level, is the highest elevation visitor center in the National Park System.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{7920fc2d-6217-418d-8931-0601c3e3a21e}{178}\" paraid=\"393032947\">The Fall River Pass Historic District is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places at the state level with a Period of Significance from 1920 to 1966. This span reflects the evolution of this visitor destination from the arrival of the Old Fall River Road through the first full year of operation for the Alpine Visitor Center during the Mission 66 program. This complex has developed from a basic stop for visitors into a comprehensive visitor experience focused on the alpine tundra ecosystem. The Alpine Visitor Center (1965) is the architectural and functional highlight of the district. The district is significant for design, embodying the principles of both NPS Rustic and Park Service Modern styles.   </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{7920fc2d-6217-418d-8931-0601c3e3a21e}{178}\" paraid=\"393032947\">Additional Information</h2> <p>The Fall River Pass Historic District tells the story of how the Rocky Mountain National Park visitor experience has evolved over time. The National Park Service started developing the pass during the 1920s. The scale and design of the Old Fall River Road and the Ranger Station reflect a period of limited financial resources. There were few formal trails and visitors could wander the alpine tundra to take in views, winds, and occasional summer snow storms. After World War II, visitation at Rocky Mountain National Park increased dramatically. Scientists began to study visitor impacts to the alpine tundra and, with an influx of funding for the Mission 66 campaign, development focused on expansion of visitor services and facilities. The Alpine Visitor Center illustrates the tenets of the Mission 66 program that sought to modernize the national parks by providing “one stop” to meet a ranger, visit a museum, buy a souvenir, and experience the natural environment. Along with buildings, the landscape became “hardened” to contain visitors and preserve the alpine tundra. Change has continued in this district, though with less intensity, with seasonal maintenance and improvements focused on providing for ever-increasing visitation and responding to the weather-related challenges of keeping high elevation facilities in visitor-ready condition.<br /> <br /> The two distinct periods that shaped the district’s development also resulted in two different yet compatible architectural expressions. The earliest resources are good to excellent examples of the NPS Rustic style, simple buildings with local stone exteriors that blend in well with the relatively undeveloped (no formalized trails and the unpaved Fall River Road) surrounding landscapes. NPS Rustic architecture buildings reflect their 1920 to 1944 dates of construction. Key construction materials, employed both for roadside features and Rustic-style buildings, included native stone and logs. These buildings also employed handcrafted workmanship and featured elements such as overhanging eaves, small paned windows, and stone chimneys. This architectural expression, particularly popular in the national parks, represented an extension of a prevalent domestic style for recreational cabins and lodges. This same style, suited to local material requirements associated with New Deal programs, experienced a revival during the 1930s and remained popular at the park during the entire 1920 to 1944 period. Rustic style resources within the Fall River Pass Historic District include the Ranger Station that temporarily housed a small museum; the Fall River Rest House, an early shop with numerous Native American curios and a small area for museum displays (later expanded into the Trail Ridge Store); and infrastructure improvements such as the Pumphouse and Catchment Basin and roadside fencing. The landscape of this period was less hardened and constrained, allowing visitors extensive access to the adjacent alpine tundra.</p> <p paraeid=\"{7920fc2d-6217-418d-8931-0601c3e3a21e}{223}\" paraid=\"2005795293\">Just as Mission 66 changed interpretation and visitor services, it also shaped architecture and landscapes in the park. A new architectural style, Park Service Modern, continued to emphasize harmony with the natural environment while introducing the concepts of functionality and technological advances associated with the International style or the A-frame form. Key construction materials included reinforced concrete, steel frames, and large expanses of glass. To make sure these resources did not distract from the natural landscape that visitors came to see, many designers chose natural stone or log, the same materials also popular for Rustic style architecture, as veneers or decorative elements.    </p> <p paraeid=\"{7920fc2d-6217-418d-8931-0601c3e3a21e}{233}\" paraid=\"1220050189\">The Alpine Visitor Center within the Fall River Pass Historic District exemplifies all of these architectural trends. Well-known Denver architect William C. Muchow’s design used a stone veneer on the exterior and incorporated large window walls on two sides. The cross-gabled roof is covered in wood shakes with a distinctive gridwork of peeled logs that offers extra weight and protection in harsh winds. This center combines Modern architectural elements with some natural materials, allowing the building to complement not only the existing buildings and structures but also the natural environment. Muchow also employed technology and engineering techniques for the building, designing the new facility to survive the realities of the harsh environmental conditions. Principles of Modern design also impacted the Fall River Pass landscape during this period. The park built a paved parking lot, a concrete plaza and sidewalks, and stone-veneered retaining walls to keep visitors from wandering freely across the alpine tundra. Still, visitors created their own trails to get directly to the top of the highest point in the area.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Beneath you runs the headwaters of the Colorado River! Similar to how it provides water to over 4 million people today, it provided water to the homesteaders who called this valley home over a century ago.</p> <h2>What was the Homestead Act?</h2> <p>With the goal of promoting development in the American West, President Lincoln, passed a law in 1862 that promised any family or individual 160 free acres on the frontier given they inhabit the land for five years and “improve it”. Improvement being defined as clearing, building structures, cultivating plants and livestock, etc.</p> <h3>How did the Homestead Act Impact the Kawuneeche Valley?</h3> <p paraeid=\"{7f45e983-5459-427c-a3ae-8e2e0972647b}{30}\" paraid=\"1224067661\">A total of 270 million acres were claimed under the Act, here in the Kawuneeche Valley only a little over two dozen claims were successfully staked between 1880 and 1927, impacting roughly a quarter of the total area. </p> <p paraeid=\"{7f45e983-5459-427c-a3ae-8e2e0972647b}{62}\" paraid=\"76821844\">Farmers and ranchers saw very little success converting the area to cropland due to the poor, swampy soil conditions and long winters. These factors also made livestock ranching difficult due to lack of accessible pastureland alongside natural competition between domestic livestock and native wildlife.<br /> <br /> Not only that, but day to day activities could also face increased obstacles: Imagine having to walk through three feet of snow to use the outhouse! </p> <p paraeid=\"{7f45e983-5459-427c-a3ae-8e2e0972647b}{98}\" paraid=\"1230808678\"><br /> Despite the harsh landscape surrounding them, the homesteaders were keen to adapt the landscape around them to suit their needs, even though it was at the expense of the natural character of the ecosystem. If you stood in this very place a hundred years ago you would see willow dominated wetlands mixed with riparian forest. However, the removal of native vegetation was encouraged under the Homestead Act to make create an environment that was more habitable by humans and livestock.<br /> <br /> Another example of this changed the course of the Colorado headwaters itself- as it was channelized and rerouted by inhabitants to distribute water to pastureland over a century ago.<br /> <br /> When the Holzwarth family arrived in 1917, they sought this same goal of creating their own habitable oasis in the Rockies. But what was their background to qualify them as ranchers? And how did the family settle on the Kawuneeche Valley?  </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The story of this place begins long before the Holzwarth family’s arrival to the Kawuneeche Valley. For centuries, humans have been utilizing the valley’s resources in search of both sustenance and economic prosperity. <br /> <br /> Today, we as park visitors are still using this land for adventure, mountain views, wildlife, or solitude within the wilderness. Thankfully, those who have come before us have preserved a portion of the Kawuneeche valley for us to walk back in time to acknowledge their struggles and triumphs. Keep in mind the environment in which you hail from and how it impacts your own livelihood as you make your way across this landscape.</p> <h2>Before Holzwarth: </h2> <p paraeid=\"{4f7b45cb-5ef5-4e97-9356-8b2b22f669e4}{166}\" paraid=\"566563413\">Beginning 12,000-10,000 years ago after the end of the last Ice Age, the west side of the Rocky Mountain NP was seasonally inhabited by Paleo-Indigenous Peoples who would spend summers following big game herds into the mountains and valleys of the Front Range. Part of our mission as a national park is to preserve the historic footpaths, artifacts, campsites, and game paths that provide evidence of their activity. Eventually formal bands- predominantly hailing from the Northern Ute Tribe- replaced them following similar patterns of seasonal inhabitance. The Ute were present in current day Rocky Mountain National Park and Northern Colorado until 1881, when the US Calvery led them onto reservations in the Southern part of the state, and into parts of Wyoming. The removal was motivated by the desire for European settlement and economic interests.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e192cc2-8536-4c83-81ff-df16f6770fe1}{31}\" paraid=\"1651370673\">In the Grand Lake region, said economic interests began with fur trapping and a short, unsuccessful mining boom in the 1880s which resulted in the now ghost towns of Gaskill (Bowen Gulch Trailhead) and Lulu City (CO River Trailhead). Additional interest came from a small wave of wealthy big game hunters seeking trophies such as Bighorn Sheep and Elk. Essentially, until the early 1900’s Grand Lake, CO remained a sleepy little town.   </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{8e192cc2-8536-4c83-81ff-df16f6770fe1}{31}\" paraid=\"1651370673\">Joe Fleshuts:</h2> <p paraeid=\"{8e192cc2-8536-4c83-81ff-df16f6770fe1}{31}\" paraid=\"1651370673\">Before you stands Fleshuts Cabin - initially owned by Joe Fleshuts, a miner who built the cabin in 1902 to claim the land under the Homestead Act of 1862.<br /> <br /> Records indicate that Fleshuts was unsuccessful at mining and had accrued significant debt leading up his disappearance in 1911, which ultimately resulted in the forfeiture of the property and resale to Henry Lehman- who thereafter sold the property to John Holzwarth Sr on July 22, 1918. As early as 1922, the Fleshuts homestead cabin was used for the accommodation of guests. We can guess that Joe Fleshuts was of Dutch descent due to the design of the home itself. Notice the dovetail corners of the building. <br /> <br /> Alongside the miners and hunting guides who worked out of the mountains, the Kawuneeche Valley saw a trickle of European settlers on the valley floor attempting to not just extract the ecosystems resources, but transform them altogether.   </p>",

The cabin started as a very primitive structure with one room and a sod roof for John Sr. and Johnnie to brave their first year here. It was gradually transformed to be the working headquarters for Mama Holzwarth and the Trout Lodge.</p> <h2>Beginnings: </h2> <p>The property you see today was John Sr.’s second attempt at homesteading. He and two friends travelled over this parcel of land in 1917 and alongside teenaged Johnnie. They spent that summer building the Mama Cabin, tent house, woodshed, and cleared land for corrals. That winter, they used kerosene lamps and a kitchen wood stove to stay warm.<br /> <br /> Mama and the daughters stayed in Denver during the winter and continued to do so for the duration of the time that the family owned the land due to their respective families and professions being based in the city.</p> <h2>The Trout Lodge:</h2> <p paraeid=\"{0d95eb78-3522-4476-8b04-d1a444d1558e}{166}\" paraid=\"1081235238\">After a wagon accident in 1919, John Sr. crushed his hip leaving him to use canes for the rest of his life.

    "bodyText": "<h2>What Comforts Make Your House Feel Like You Were at Home?</h2> <p>The décor? The people? Maybe the food? All of these factors were draws of Mama Holzwarth’s hospitality for her guests at the trout lodge and Never Summer Ranch.<br /> <br /> As much as the major events in people’s lives tell the story of a place, so do their daily practices. We see the intersection of skill and hard work through the daily practices of Mama Holzwarth, who used this space in its later years as the primary kitchen and dining room. These areas provided not only nourishment and hominess for guests, but also acted as an extension of her German heritage.<br /> <br /> The meals that Mama prepared for guests were geared towards the American diet but were sourced from what was available in the surrounding landscape. She used plants and animals found in the nearby environment, since the transport of food and goods was difficult. For example, meals would consist of freshly caught trout, soup was made with dandelion greens, and meat roasts were made with deer. Meals were served three times a day at the dining hall. On the other hand, food prepared for Mama’s family and staff were traditionally German, with specialties such as liver dumplings, pig ear sandwiches, and spaetzle.<br /> <br /> A niece of Sophia’s once described ranch life as: “Whatever Mama did, she did well. Ambitious, proud, clean. She would give anything to you. But at the same time she expected you to work...” It was reported that after a one-night stay at the lodge, her housekeepers would have to tear the cabins apart to clean them from top to bottom.<br /> <br /> Her family credits her as the one who initially had the dream to open a lodge in the mountains before they moved away from Denver. <br /> <br /> Hard work was a key factor to the Holzwarth's success as businessowners, but adaptability was also an equally important characteristic that helped the family persevere in the untamed Rocky Mountains.  </p>",

Many of his original tools are located inside the shop, including clamps, pliers, files, hack saw, draw knife, and hammers.<br /> <br /> After John Sr.’s death in 1932, the building was used as a rental cabin until the NPS purchased the homestead. During the summer, this cabin is open for visitors.<br /> <br /> Similar to how the abundance of game fueled John Sr.’s taxidermy, the availability of Rocky’s natural resources was also an essential part of the family’s livelihood.  ",

    "bodyText": "<h2>The Twin Cabins</h2> <p>The Twin Cabins (Twin 1 and Twin 2) were constructed to be the first permanent guest accommodations for the original Holzwarth Trout Lodge. Twin 1 was built by John Sr. and Johnnie in 1921 and Twin 2 was built by Johnnie alone in 1923. The Rose Cabin, which is adjoined to Twin 1, was constructed in 1945 as an addition. The park opens Twin 1 during the summer to visitors, to showcase some of the original furnishings. <br /> <br /> The hospitality industry was not new to the Kawuneeche Valley at the time of the Holzwarth's arrival. The first was a mountain trekking outpost run by “Squeaky” Bob Wheeler, famous for hosting president Theodore Roosevelt in 1905 on a bighorn sheep hunt. Rearing livestock and growing crops ultimately proved to be an unsuccessful livelihood for homesteaders in the valley, so many relied on the natural appeal of the Rocky Mountains to create a thriving tourist industry. Which is similar to today.  <br /> <br /> Along with the Holzwarth Trout Lodge and Guest Ranch, there were other enterprises such as the Green Mountain (Schooners) Ranch, the Kawuneeche Ranch, and the Pontiac Lodge/ Montane Ranch, scattered across the valley from Grand Lake to the Little Yellowstone Canyon.<br /> <br /> Over the years, the Holzwarth family had to adapt to tourists visiting the area, with interest gradually moving away from hunting and fishing to the “cowboy experience” provided by dude ranches. The Never Summer Ranch was a dude ranch that was established, built, and run by Johnnie from 1929 to the 1970s. The site had 14 buildings including barns and corrals, the Never Summer Lodge, guest cabins, and Johnnie’s home. Activities offered included campfires, trail rides, hikes, rodeo presentations, and more. After the overwhelming success of the dude ranch, the cabins of the original homestead were used as housekeeping cabins and spillover lodging from the 1950s onward. <br /> <br /> Alongside the responsibilities of running the Lodge and the Ranch, the Holzwarth's also mastered a variety of skills required for successful living in the Rocky Mountains, using the flora and fauna of the surrounding environment. </p>",

Their business proved to be profitable, allowing the Holzwarths relative affluence during this time. At one point, they took a trip to Germany to reconnect with family and allow their children to experience their mother culture, a rarity for working-class, immigrants at the time.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{86a0d389-8bc6-42c1-ae8f-69c6904d9cc7}{73}\" paraid=\"503578736\">When Colorado’s state prohibition laws went into effect in 1916, it forced them to convert the saloon to a grocery- which proved less successful. On top of that, anti-German sentiment as a result of WWI made Denver an even more hostile place for the family to reside. The combination of these factors made retreating into the mountains an appealing option for the Holzwarths.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{86a0d389-8bc6-42c1-ae8f-69c6904d9cc7}{73}\" paraid=\"503578736\">John Gottlieb Holzwarth “Papa” (1865-1932) </h2> <p paraeid=\"{86a0d389-8bc6-42c1-ae8f-69c6904d9cc7}{133}\" paraid=\"952261586\">Patriarch of the Holzwarth clan, he arrived in the United States 1879, at the age of 14 as an indentured apprentice to a baker in St Louis. After a few months he ran away to Texas- barely speaking English- where he found himself travelling and performing odd ranch jobs such as horse wrangler, cook, etc.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{86a0d389-8bc6-42c1-ae8f-69c6904d9cc7}{199}\" paraid=\"1617961092\">Shortly thereafter in 1881 he found himself in the Middle Park area- modern Kremmling- with his brother who drove a mail stagecoach between Hot Sulpher Springs and Georgetown. He had initially tried to homestead 80 acres that now lie under Lake Granby but left the valley in 1893 to move to Denver and work for Tivoli Brewing. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{86a0d389-8bc6-42c1-ae8f-69c6904d9cc7}{199}\" paraid=\"1617961092\">Sophia (Lebfromm) Holzwarth “Mama” (1870-1954) </h2> <p paraeid=\"{86a0d389-8bc6-42c1-ae8f-69c6904d9cc7}{253}\" paraid=\"24414843\">Sophia immigrated to the United States in 1890 at the age of 20 from the German state of Baden. She worked as a housekeeper in Denver for affluent families- contracted to14 hour days at a rate of $20 per month. She was introduced to John Holzwarth by her younger brother who was his coworker at Tivoli Brewing. The two were married in 1894 at the St. Elizabeth Church in Denver. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3f503493-a9e3-49ba-b5c6-79cd4e14e7ba}{74}\" paraid=\"1720893038\">John Sr. and Maria had five children: Christina (1895-1895; died in infancy) Julia (1896-1967), Maria (1898-1919), Sophia (1900-1971), and Johnnie (John Holzwarth Jr.) (1902-1983).<br /> <br /> John Sr. and Sophia both demonstrated a substantial amount of courage and determination in their lifetimes, establishing a stable life for themselves in the United States. This determination and courage was tested again when they began their homesteading journey in 1917.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{86a0d389-8bc6-42c1-ae8f-69c6904d9cc7}{73}\" paraid=\"503578736\"> </p>",

These include:</p> <ul> <li>The pilot timed entry permit system will be extended through October 22, 2023.</li> <li>The park is reducing the time period and number of hours daily that reservations are in effect for most areas of RMNP. <strong>Park Access Timed Entry Permits will be in effect between the hours of 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. MDT.</strong></li> <li>Visitors with <strong>Park Access+ Timed Entry Permits</strong> who enter the Bear Lake Road corridor and who want to exit and return later in the day, <strong>may re-enter the Bear Lake Road Corridor anytime after 2 p.m.</strong></li> <li>40 percent of all reservations will be released via Recreation.gov on the day prior to a desired arrival date at 5 p.m. MDT.</li> <li><strong>Campers at Aspenglen, Glacier Basin, and Timber Creek Campgrounds will be able to initially enter the park beginning at 1 p.m. on the first day of their camping reservation,</strong> which is also the check-in time for all park campgrounds. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Moraine Park Campground will be closed summer 2023.</span> <ul> <li>Campers who plan to enter the park earlier in the day will have to enter the park outside of the times when timed entry permits are in effect (for example, before 9 a.m. for most areas of the park) or reserve a timed entry permit.</li> <li>Campers with reservations to camp at <strong>Glacier Basin and Aspenglen Campgrounds</strong> will have access to the Bear Lake Road Corridor as well as all other areas of the park.</li> <li>Campers with reservations to camp at <strong>Timber Creek Campground</strong> will have access to areas of the park, excluding the Bear Lake Road Corridor.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Timed entry permit reservations will be released through <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086910\">www.recreation.gov</a> <strong>beginning at 8 a.m. MDT on Monday, May 1. </strong> <ul> <li>On May 1, timed entry permits will be released for the dates of May 26 through June 30.</li> <li>The next release will occur on June 1, for the month of July and any remaining days that have not been booked for June.</li> <li>On July 1, reservations will be available for the month of August and any remaining days that have not been booked for July.</li> <li> <p>On August 1, reservations will be available for the month of September and any remaining days in August that have not been booked.</p> </li> <li> <p>On September 1, reservations will be available for October and any remaining days in September that have not been booked.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Which Reservation Option is Best for You?</h2> <p><strong>Park Access Timed Entry Permits:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong><span style=\"color:null;\">Include access to most areas of the park, including outlying areas</span></strong>, <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">excluding the Bear Lake Road Corridor.</span></li> <li>Reservations are required between the hours of 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.</li> <li>Re-entry to the park is allowed with a valid Park Access Timed Entry Permit anytime between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Park Access+ Timed Entry Permits:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Include access to the Bear Lake Road Corridor, as well as the rest of the park.</strong></li> <li>Reservations are required to enter the Bear Lake Road Corridor between the hours of 5 a.m. and 6 p.m.</li> <li>Re-entry to the Bear Lake Road Corridor is allowed for Park Access+ Timed Entry permit holders after 2 p.m.  </li> </ul> <h2>To reserve a timed entry permit, visit Recreation.gov.</h2> <p>Park Access and Park Access+ Timed Entry Permits are only available through Recreation.gov. They are not available in person at the park's entrance stations or visitor centers. <strong>To make a reservation for a timed entry permit, click on the following website link <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086910\">www.recreation.gov</a> or use the Recreation.gov mobile App.<br /> <br /> A valid park entrance pass is also requried to enter Rocky Mountain National Park.

    "bodyText": "<h2>Frequently Asked Questions for Rocky's Timed Entry Permit Reservation System</h2> <h4>Why is Rocky Implementing a Timed Entry Permit Reservation System?</h4> <p>Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the busiest national parks, third in the country in 2019 with over 4.6 million visitors. This represents a 42 percent increase in visitation in seven years.</p> <p>Visitor crowding and congestion at RMNP have led to increased negative impacts to visitor and staff safety, resource protection, visitor experience and operational capacity. The park has piloted various visitor use management strategies over the last six years, including managing vehicle access to first-come, first served (2016-2019) in highly congested areas. These first-come, first-served restrictions had some limited success initially, but over time began to lose effectiveness: length of time they were necessary kept expanding and impacts were pushed elsewhere.</p> <p>The park piloted different park wide timed entry permit reservation systems (2020-2021) and will be piloting a system again in 2022.</p> <p>The park is learning from these different actions since 2016, to help inform long range day use visitor access strategies.</p> <h4>What Types of Reservations Are Required to Access the Park?</h4> <p>There are two different options available for Timed Entry Permit Reservations. Choose one of these options, based on where you would like to visit inside RMNP.  </p> <ul> <li>Option 1: Park Access + Bear Lake Road. This Timed Entry Permit Reservation provides access to all areas of Rocky Mountain National Park, including destinations along the Bear Lake Road Corridor (from the Trail Ridge Road junction to the Bear Lake Trailhead). For Bear Lake Road, Timed Entry Permit Reservations are required from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m.</li> <li>Option 2: Park Access, Does Not Include Bear Lake Road provides access to all areas of RMNP, not including destinatons along the Bear Lake Road Corridor. This Timed Entry Permit Reservation window is from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.</li> </ul> <p>When in effect, Timed Entry Permit Reservations are available in 2-hour blocks of time. Permit holders must enter the park during their reserved time window. If your Timed Entry Permit is from 7 am to 9 am, you cannot enter before 7 am or after 9 am. <br /> <br /> When in effect, Timed Entry Permit Reservations apply to all areas of the park, including Wild Basin, Lily Lake, Lumpy Ridge, and Longs Peak.</p> <h4>When Will Reservations Go On Sale?</h4> <p>Timed Entry Permit Reservations will go on sale through www.recreation.gov beginning at 10 am MT on Monday, May 2, 2022. On this date, reservations will be available to enter the park for dates from May 27 through June 30, 2022. </p> <ul> <li>The next release will occur at 10 am on June 1, which will release Timed Entry Permit Reservations for the month of July and any remaining days that have not been booked for June.</li> <li>On July 1, reservations will be available for the month of August and any remaining days that have not been booked for July.</li> <li>On August 1, reservations will be available for the month of September and any remaining days in August that have not already been booked.</li> <li>On September 1, reservations will be available for October and any remaining days in September that have not been booked. </li> </ul> <h4>How Do I Book a Timed Entry Permit Reservation?</h4> <p>Visit <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/timed-entry/10086910\">www.recreation.gov</a> and begin by creating an account if you don't already have one. <br /> <br /> Follow the steps on Recreation.gov to select and book your desired Timed Entry Permit Reservation. Choose one Timed Entry Permit Reservation for each day of your visit. You must pick either Option 1: Park Access + Bear Lake Road or Option 2: Park Access, Does Not Include Bear Lake Road.<br /> <br /> If you want to drive over Trail Ridge Road or visit destinations outside of the Bear Lake Road corridor, select Option 2: Park Access, Does Not Include Bear Lake Road.</p> <ul> <li>This option is best if you are visiting the Alpine Visitor Center, Wild Basin, Sheep Lakes, Kawuneeche Valley, and Old Fall River Road.    </li> </ul>",

The growing season is only 6-12 weeks long, allowing the tiny but mighty plant life to thrive. Despite severe conditions more than 100 species of flowering plants live on the rich alpine tundra. Common species include alpine avens and american bistorts.</p> <p>The fence near the parking area protects an ecological research plot established in 1958 by alpine botanist Beatrice Willard (1925-2003). For 40 years she monitored tundra plants and the rate of how trampled alpine habitat could recover. The plot was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 as the first ecological plot in the country to be so recognized. Due to her research, Rock Cut is a Tundra Closure Area which limits all hiking to paved asphalt trails to protect the fragile tundra plants. Thank you for enjoying the rare flowers and not picking them. Most alpine plants take several years to produce a single flower, and many are food to pikas and marmots. These small creatures can usually be seen bouncing up and around rocks throughout the area. </p> <p><strong>Note: </strong>Trail Ridge Road closes mid-October to Memorial Day.

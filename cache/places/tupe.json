They marched four miles and crossed to the north side of Old Town Creek and camped in the late afternoon. At 5 p.m., from a commanding ridge south of Old Town Creek, Confederate forces surprised Smith’s troops with artillery and infantry fire. The Federals scrambled and formed a line that pushed the Confederates off the ridge and forced them to retreat to Harrisburg. The fight at Old Town Creek ended the Battle of Tupelo.

These attacks were beaten back with heavy losses to the Confederates. Failing to break the Federal center, the Confederates attacked the Federal right again without success. After dark, the Confederates made another attack from the south without significant effect. Although his troops had repulsed several Confederate attacks, Federal General Andrew Jackson Smith ordered his men back towards Memphis. His army would engage the Confederate forces several miles outside of town on July 15, 1864 at what is called the Battle of Old Town Creek.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/tupe/index.htm\">Battle of Tupelo National Battlefield</a> for additional Information.<br /> <br />  ",

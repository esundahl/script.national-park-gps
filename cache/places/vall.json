    "bodyText": "Four miles from the main entrance is the park's Cabin District. This cluster of historic log cabins facilitated spring, summer, and fall ranching operations on this land for nearly a century. The location offered the shelter of towering, old-growth conifers, ample spring water, and a vista of Valle Grande—qualities that have attracted human use and occupation here for several thousand years.<br /> <br /> Beginning as a land grant in 1860, private ownership was held by a series of four families: the Cabeza de Bacas (1860-1899), the Oteros (1899-1917), the Bonds (1917-1962), and the Dunigans (1962-2000). Throughout this succession of owners, the land was used for sheep grazing, sulfur mining, cattle ranching, logging, geothermal exploration, and tourism. By 1963, logging operations had cut over 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares) of timber from the property, and a century of livestock grazing had trampled and compacted the soils beside streams, causing erosion, sedimentation, and unnatural channelization of waterways. <br /> <br /> The Cabin District consists of the Historic Ranch Headquarters buildings and includes: the Ranger Station, where you can find a passport stamp, park-related gift items for sale; the Greer Cabin (1951); the Otero Cabin (1915); the Commissary (1941); the Bond Cabin (1918); the Ranch Foreman's Cabin (1918); and the Caretaker's Cabin (1951). Visitors are welcome to take photos, but we ask you to please stay off of the porches and other parts of these structures. The cabins are not available for rent.<br /> <br /> Parking and portable toilets can be found behind the Otero Cabin and Commissary. This is also the designated parking area for the Ranger Station and South Mountain Trail. ",
    "audioDescription": "A total of nine log-construction buildings ranging from cabins to barns along a dirt road. In front of the cabins you can see the Valle Grande, and behind the cabins there are aspen trees, ponderosa pine, and Douglas fir. A small stream runs by the Commissary and feeds into a small pond on the side of the road in front of the cabins.",

    "bodyText": "There are several pullouts along NM 4 to stop and view wildlife, take photos, and enjoy expansive views of Valle Grande. These pullouts are open 24/7, so they may also be used for stargazing.<br /> <br /> Elk can often be seen grazing in Valle Grande, especially around dawn and dusk, but you might not notice them at first. Although they are large animals, the immensity of the Valle Grande dwarfs them. For perspective, look for the “Horse Barn” on the far north side of Valle Grande; it is three miles away. The Entrance Station, next to pint-sized Cerro La Jara, is two miles away, and the Ranger Station in the tree line with the other cabins is almost four miles away. As vast as it appears, Valle Grande only makes up about 15% of Valles Caldera, which, in its entirety, measures approximately 13 miles across. The ridgeline just south of NM 4 (behind you) is the southern rim of the caldera, and the northern rim can occasionally be spotted in the distance far beyond Valle Grande and surrounding lava domes.",

It contains volcanic features like sulfuric-acid springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud-pots, and supports a range of “extremophile” algae and bacteria living in the high-temperature acidic pool and stream environments. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the western United States. Originally patented in 1898 as a mining claim by New Mexico businessman and politician, Maríano Otero, who mined sulfur at the site from 1902 to 1904. The Otero family then developed the site as a health resort spa, which operated through much of the twentieth century until it burned down in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, Los Alamos National Laboratory established an experimental geothermal well on the site. Access from NM-4, Mile Marker 27, FS 105 to metal gate and parking area. We ask that you please do not bathe in the hot springs due to the water's acidity. </p>",

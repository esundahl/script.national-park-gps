The final leg of the march down Dexter Avenue passed the bus stop where Rosa Parks stepped into American history, but also passed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s former church - Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b59d7bce-6f58-4ffe-8a30-45280f325153}{163}\" paraid=\"1174460062\">The marchers were not allowed on the steps at the capitol, so a large flatbed truck was used as a stage in front of the steps. Alabama's Governor George Wallace, a renowned segregationist, did not receive the march or their petitions but was seen peeking out from behind his office windows. On the flatbed truck, several speeches were given by Reverend Ralph Abernathy, John Lewis, Fred Shuttlesworth, Rosa Parks, and other leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. also gave his well-received \"Our God is Marching On\" speech, alternately known by the name of \"How Long? Not Long!\". </p> <p paraeid=\"{b59d7bce-6f58-4ffe-8a30-45280f325153}{173}\" paraid=\"558526336\">With the rally completed, the Selma to Montgomery March concluded. The eyes of the nation turned from Alabama to Washington, D.C.. On March 17th, 1965 the Voting Rights Act was introduced to the Senate. The Bill would be modified slightly but would pass the Senate and House of Representatives and sent to President Lyndon B. Johnson. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b59d7bce-6f58-4ffe-8a30-45280f325153}{183}\" paraid=\"1284294055\">President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law on August 6th, 1965, while surrounded by many Civil Rights leaders and supporters, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 expressly prohibits racial discrimination in voting, and outlawed many tactics used in the South including poll taxes, literacy tests, moral character tests, and more. It prohibited selected regions in the South from creating laws, policies, or procedures to disenfranchise or impede minority voters from their right to vote, enabling any American to vote. </p>",

Another nearby local church, </span>First Baptist<span>, acted as the headquarters for the organizers of the Selma Campaign--the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Brown Chapel AME Church, with its imposing twin towers and Romanesque Revival styling, was built in 1908 by a black builder--of whom little is known -- Mr. A.J. Farley. On Sunday morning (known as Bloody Sunday) March 7, 1965, despite a ban on protest marches by Governor George Wallace, about 600 black protestors gathered outside Brown Chapel to march from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery.</span></p> <p><span><span>Leading the march were the SCLC's Hosea Williams and SNCC's John Lewis. At the Edmund Pettus Bridge, six blocks from Brown Chapel, mounted troopers confronted the marchers and ordered them to disperse. The marchers stood their ground and the troopers advanced, billy clubs raised. Lewis fell, his skull fractured. Others fell, screaming, as white onlookers cheered. Then Sheriff Jim Clark's deputized posse charged the marchers, firing tear gas and swinging bullwhips and rubber tubing wrapped in barbed wire. That night, ABC interrupted its showing of the movie </span><em>Judgement at Nuremberg</em><span> to air footage of \"Bloody Sunday.\" By morning, news of the event had spread to nearly every American household, and thousands of march supporters began to flock to Selma.

The boycott proved how members of a black community could unite in resistance to segregation, and it heralded a new era of \"direct action.\" The event also propelled Martin Luther King, Jr., into the national spotlight.</p> <p>Years before the boycott, Dexter Avenue minister Vernon Johns sat down in the \"whites-only\" section of a city bus. When the driver ordered him off the bus, Johns urged other passengers to join him. On March 2, 1955, a black teenager named Claudette Colvin dared to defy bus segregation laws and was forcibly removed from another Montgomery bus. Nine months later, on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks--a 42-year-old seamstress and NAACP member--refused to give up her seat on a crowded city bus to make room for white passengers. She was arrested and jailed.</p> <p>Montgomery's black citizens reacted decisively to the incident. By December 2, schoolteacher Jo Ann Robinson had mimeographed and delivered 50,000 protest leaflets around town. E.D. Nixon, a local labor leader, organized a December 4 meeting at Dexter Avenue, where local black leaders formed the Montgomery Improvement Association to spearhead a boycott and negotiate with the bus company. They named Dexter's new minister, Martin Luther King, Jr., president.</p> <p>For nearly a year, buses were virtually empty in Montgomery. Boycott supporters walked to work--as many as eight miles a day--or they used a sophisticated system of carpools with volunteer drivers and dispatchers. Some took station-wagon \"rolling taxis\" donated by local churches.</p> <p>Montgomery City Lines lost between 30,000 and 40,000 bus fares each day during the boycott, but the company reluctantly desegregated its buses only after November 13, 1956, when the Supreme Court ruled Alabama's bus segregation laws unconstitutional.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong><em>Visit the National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects//travelweshallovercome/index.htm\">We Shall Overcome</a> travel itinerary to learn more about </em><em>the civil rights movement themes and histories.

The marchers stood their ground and the troopers advanced, billy clubs raised. Lewis fell, his skull fractured. Others fell, screaming, as white onlookers cheered. Then Sheriff Jim Clark's deputized posse charged the marchers, firing tear gas and swinging bullwhips and rubber tubing wrapped in barbed wire. That night, ABC interrupted its showing of the movie, </span><em>Judgement at Nuremberg,</em><span> to air footage of \"Bloody Sunday.\" By morning, news of the event had spread to nearly every American household, and thousands of march supporters began to flock to Selma. On March 9, Martin Luther King, Jr., led a \"symbolic\" march to the bridge, and on March 21, after Governor Wallace's ban was overruled by </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/alabama-u-s-post-office-and-courthouse-montgomery.htm\">Federal Judge Frank M.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail was established by Congress in 1996 to commemorate the events, people and route of the 1965 Voting Rights March in Alabama. The route is also designated as a National Scenic Byway/All-American Road. Visitors are encouraged to drive the historic route from Selma to Montgomery Alabama, view the significant sites along the 54 miles trail, and take part in the trails’ year-round special events.<br /> <br /> The 54-mile-long national historic trail begins at the Brown Chapel African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Church in Selma and then follows the 1965 historic routes of the Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches through the city and eastward along US Highway 80 through Dallas County and Lowndes County. Crossing into Montgomery County, the Trail continues into the city of Montgomery and ends at the Alabama State Capitol. Interpretive centers are located in Selma and White Hall (midway along the route in Lowndes County) and a third center is scheduled for development in Montgomery to provide visitor services and interpretation of the national historic trail and the story of the Selma voting rights movement.</p> <p>The Selma Interpretive Center opened its doors to the public in March 2011 and serves as the welcome center to the trail, located at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The center offers a video, exhibits, and a small bookstore. In addition, the center provides a breathtaking view of the Edmund Pettus Bridge which is famously known as the scene of Bloody Sunday and serves as the focus for Selma’s annual Bridge Crossing Jubilee.</p> <p>At the trail’s midpoint in White Hall, Alabama, visitors to the Lowndes County Interpretive Center can learn the history of the Selma to Montgomery March by watching a 25 minute film inside the theater, and connect the stories and events through eh museum exhibits, photographs, and outdoor walking trail. The center was the first of three planned National Park Service visitor centers along the trail route and has been open since August of 2006. <br /> <br /> Several surviving historic buildings, structures, and sites are also intimately associated with the national historic trail including the Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church in Selma (the starting point for the voting rights marches and designated a national historic landmark in 1982); the First Baptist Church (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee headquarters during the Selma voting rights movement); the Edmund Pettus Bridge which includes the “Bloody Sunday” confrontation site (designated a national historic landmark in 2013); the Dallas County Court House (the destination for the majority of the marches during the Selma voting rights movement); “Tent City” in White Hall; four camp sites along the march route (notably the City of Saint Jude, a Catholic social services complex that was the site of the last encampment and the “Stars for Freedom” rally); the Alabama State Capitol; and the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church in Montgomery (staging area for the concluding rally).<br /> <br /> Today, the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail stands as an enduring testament to the long struggle and sacrifices made by many individuals to preserve the right to vote as a fundamental cornerstone of American democracy. The Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail was selected for inclusion in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> in October 2019.<br /> <br /> <em>The <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> recognizes the African American Civil Rights Movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation. Created by the African American Civil Rights Act of 2017, and coordinated by the National Park Service, the Network tells the stories of the people, places, and events of the U.S. African American Civil Rights Movement through a collection of public and private resources to include <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">properties, facilities, and programs</a>.</em></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><span>Thanks to a courageous and insightful federal judge--Frank M. Johnson, Jr.--this Montgomery, Alabama, courthouse became one of few official buildings in the South where civil rights claims could receive an impartial hearing and be won. In 1955, President Eisenhower appointed the 37-year-old Johnson to the U.S. District Court. The next year, following the Montgomery bus boycott, he ruled against segregated city buses. In later actions, he was the first judge to order names of qualified African Americans added to county voting rolls, and he wrote the first statewide school desegregation decree. He outlawed discrimination in Alabama's libraries, transportation centers, and agricultural extension service. He placed numerous state agencies under judicial review. After brutal beatings of Freedom Riders at Montgomery's Greyhound Terminal, he temporarily restrained the city and the Klan from future wrongs against the protestors. </span></p> <p><span>He helped strike down literacy tests and other unfair practices when he ordered voting registrars to apply consistent standards. One of Johnson's major accomplishments was his opening of U.S. Route 80 for the </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/alabama-the-selmatomontgomery-march.htm\">Selma-to-Montgomery March</a>.<span> After watching the CBS footage of \"Bloody Sunday,\" he ruled that the right of assembly--in this case, the right to march--far outweighed the right to unobstructed sidewalks and highways. The enormity of the wrongs being protested should be the deciding factor, he said. Johnson's decisions put him at great risk. His mother's home was bombed and a cross burned in his yard. Often he and his family needed overnight protection. His actions also won the ire of law school classmate Governor George Wallace, who branded Johnson an \"integrating, scalawagging, carpetbagging liar.\" In 1977, President Carter asked Johnson to head the FBI, but the judge refused for medical reasons. Instead, he accepted a 1979 appointment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Johnson's decisions then and earlier not only affected civil rights, they also influenced most of the public policy in the state. In 1993, Judge Johnson was the second recipient (after Thurgood Marshall) of the American Bar Association's Thurgood Marshall Award for his work for civil rights. In 1995, President Clinton awarded Judge Johnson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian award. President Clinton remarked that, \"during 40 years on the bench, Judge Johnson made it his mission to see to it justice was done within the framework of law. </span></p> <p><span><span>In the face of unremitting social and political pressure to uphold the traditions of oppression and neglect in his native South, never once did he yield. His landmark decisions in the areas of desegregation, voting rights and civil liberties transformed our understanding of the Constitution.\"</span></span></p> <p><span><span> </span></span></p> <p><strong><em>Visit the National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects//travelweshallovercome/index.htm\">We Shall Overcome</a> travel itinerary to learn more about </em><em>the civil rights movement themes and histories.

In the 1950s, St. Jude's Church hosted an integrated prayer group, and in 1965, Martin Luther King, Jr., and 2,000 participants of the Selma-to-Montgomery March found shelter there. The night before the final march to the Capitol, City of St. Jude offered its 36 acres to the marchers, who slept on the athletic field and held a \"Stars of Freedom Rally\" featuring such celebrities as Odetta, Harry Belafonte, Pete Seeger, Leonard Bernstein, and Joan Baez.</span></p> <p><span><span>St. Jude's Catholic Hospital, which opened in 1951 as the first integrated hospital in the Southeast, offered help again when tragedy struck at the end of the march. Hospital staff tried to save the life of Viola Liuzzo, the Detroit homemaker who was fatally shot by Klansmen while driving marchers back to Selma. The hospital closed in 1985. In March 1990, City of St. Jude was the site of the 25th anniversary of the Selma-to-Montgomery March. Former Governor George Wallace appeared in the doorway of the St. Jude Educational Institute as he had done years before at the University of Alabama, this time not to prevent students from entering the building but to greet civil rights supporters.</span></span></p> <p><span><span> </span></span></p> <p><strong><em>Visit the National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects//travelweshallovercome/index.htm\">We Shall Overcome</a> travel itinerary to learn more about </em><em>the civil rights movement themes and histories.

    "bodyText": "The First Unitarian Society of Denver is also known as the Plymouth Congregational Church.<br /> <br /> The First Unitarian Society of Denver (FUST) church building is a large, stone edifice of rough-cut rhyolite in the Richardsonian Romanesque stlye located at the northeast corner of Lafayette Street and 14th Avenue within the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Denver, Colorado. Begun in 1893 by the architects Balcomb & Rice and completed in 1899 following the design of the prominent Denver architectural firm of Varian & Sterner, the church was first home to the Plymouth Congregational Church. Since 1958, the building has been home to FUSD.<br /> <br /> The church is locally significant for its architecture as a fine example of the Romanesque Revival. The period of significance for Architecture is 1893 to 1899.<br /> <br /> The First Unitarian Society of Denver is significant at the state level for social history as the location of the first religious ceremony for a same-sex wedding in Colorado, held in 1975. The wedding between Richard Adams and Tony Sullivan took place with a marriage license issued by Clela Rorex, a Boulder county clerk, under the rationale that nothing in the law specifically forbade same-sex marriages. When asked later, Rorex said, \"I don't profess to be knowledgeable about homosexuality or even understand it... But it's not my business why people get married. No minority should be discriminated against.\" Metropolitan Community Church of the Rockies was a gay and lesbian congregation that shared office space with First Unitarian and worshiped in the chapen from September 1973 until it purchased its own building in 1979. The church was also the site of meetings for Denver's Gay Coalition, founded in 1972.<br /> <br /> The church is further significant more broadly for its central role in civil rights issues pertaining to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer, African American, immigrant, and numerous other communities, seeking to engage as a congregation since 1958 in causes related to social and racial justice. During the 1960s, the First Unitarian Society of Denver church became the local home for the non-violent civil rights organization, Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). In 1962, the Denver Chapter of CORE conducted its first strike campaign at the Denver Dry Goods Store on 16th Street. The General Manager at the time reportedly said he would \"spend $1 million before he hired a black sales person,\" but reversed course and began integrating the sales staff after the non-violent protest.<br /> <br /> In collaboration with Zion Baptist Church, a historic African American congregation in Denver, CORE implemented \"housing testing\" and \"employment testing,\" uncovering the practice of redlining -- refusing loans or house insurance to non-white people or communities in Denver. The church raised funds and paid the fines of protestors involved in these activities. In the 1966, a Fair Housing Center was created at First Unitarian with volunteer staffing by the congregation.<br /> <br /> In March 1965, members of the church traveled to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama as part of the historic three-week Selma-to-Montgomery March for voting rights. Later that year, church members held a rally on the steps of the Colorado State Capitol for James Reed, a Unitarian Universalist minister killed in Selma.<br /> <br /> In October 1971, Rev. Richard Henry of the First Unitarian Society, his wife, and another congregant were among 40 arrested for protesting the Vietnam War with the group, Vietnam Vets Against the War. Standing in the street, the protestors held their hands behind their heads singing America the Beautiful as they were arrested. The Rev. Henry called out other clergy for not risking jail or fines to protest the war.<br /> <br /> The period of significance for social history is from 1958 to 1979, beginning with the first year First Unitarian occupied the church and carried on its social justice programs from this location to the year the Metropolitcan Community Church of the Rockies, a gay and lesbian congregation that was hosted by First Unitarian in the building, purchased its own dedicated building.<br /> <br /> The First Unitarian Church of Denver was added to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/index.htm\">National Register of Historic Places</a> on July 14, 2017.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "<p>Tabernacle Baptist Church is the site of the first mass meeting of the Selma Voting Rights Movement.<br /> <br /> On May 14, 1963, upon the death of veteran civil rights organizer, Sam Boynton, a memorial service and mass meeting was held to galvanize the Black community in segregated Selma. Mr. Boynton's widow, Mrs. Amelia Boynton, along with fellow civil rights activist, Rev. Bernard Lafayette became the guiding force for the memorial and mass meeting. Mr. and Mrs. Boynton had been organizing in Selma since the 1930s to prepare the Black community academically and emotionally to register to vote.<br /> <br /> Selma had an emerging Black middle class that consisted primarily of medical doctors, teachers, college professors, pharmacists, business people, and dentists. Many of them were Tabernacle members. Tabernacle's pastor, Rev. Louis Lloyd Anderson, who came to Selma from Chicago in 1954 had not always been subjected to Jim Crow laws. So when Rev. Lafayette and Mrs. Boynton sent out an invitation to Selma's Black churches to host the memorial service for Mr. Boynton, Rev. Anderson daringly accepted on behalf of Tabernacle. The deacons who were primarily professors and descendants of the people who had built the magnificent Classical Revival edifice in 1922, objected as they did not want their church bombed like those in Birmingham, AL. Rev. Anderson’s response was:</p> <blockquote> <p>“If you will not permit it to be held on the inside, we will hold it on the sidewalk and I will tell everyone why.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The first mass meeting was held with 300 in attendance. These included Sheriff Jim Clark, and many recently deputized gun-carrying white men, many only 18 years old. They lined the walls of the church as mass meeting attendees sang, prayed, and memorialized Mr. Boynton. Mr. James Foreman, SNCC Chairman was the main speaker. The \"High Cost of Freedom\" was the title of his address.<br /> <br /> Tabernacle members and their friends had used the Tabernacle basement for secret underground voter registration sessions since the 1930s. Tabernacle member, Mrs. Marie Foster was one of the trainers. She and Rev. John D. Hunter, former President of the Selma Chapter of the NAACP before it was banned, worked secretly for voting rights despite an injunction that prohibited \"gatherings of no more than 3 Negroes.\"<br /> <br /> They joined with six other people who defied the court order by inviting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Selma in 1964 to help with voter registration. Mrs. Amelia Boynton, Mr. Ulysses Blackman, Mr. Ernest Doyle, Mrs. Marie Foster, Mr. William Gildersleeve, Rev. John D. Hunter, Rev. F. D. Reese, and Rev. Henry Shannon became known as the “Courageous Eight.” Mrs. Foster’s brother, Dr. Sullivan Jackson, DDS, was a Tabernacle Trustee. The Sullivan Jackson home was the headquarters for Dr. King and staff in segregated Selma where colored people could not use public accommodations such as lodging, rest rooms, water fountains, restaurants, etc.</p>",

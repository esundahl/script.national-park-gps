Though short in length, the trail has many ups and downs at steep grades. It traverses through a beautiful old-growth forest, and has a brief section along the edge of the bluff overlooking the river.<br /> <br /> From the parking area, the trail runs beside the road at a level grade for 100 feet before dropping into the woods to the right. The trail continues for 170 feet of fluctuating steep downhill, with 10-18% grades, to a level boardwalk followed by gentle grades for the next 130 feet. Running along a gentle hill for 50 feet at grades under 7%, the trail meets an intersection and leads to the right towards the river. The next 170 feet is uphill at varying grades from 9-13%. This is followed by a moderate downhill for 265 feet. The trail crosses a short bridge before dropping down a steep 45-foot hill to reach the section above the river.<br /> <br /> The trail continues uphill along the river for 220 feet with some steep sections, particularly when climbing back up to turn left away from the river. The next 370 feet are a gentle rolling downhill through the forest. A steep section of trail climbs at 12% before a second bridge crossing at 1,585 feet, approximately half-way along the trail.<br /> <br /> From 1,585 feet to 1,840 feet the trail rolls up and down through the forest. At 1,625 feet, there is an intersection with a second access point to the trail that originates from another road pullout past the recommended starting point. Continuing to the left, at 1,840 feet there is a 185 foot stretch of steep downhill with grades ranging from 10 to 20%. Crossing another section of boardwalk, the trail fluctuates grades for 110 feet with brief steep sections up to 20%. From here, 430 feet of rolling downhill trail with some steep sections leads back at the intersection. At the intersection, the trail to the right retraces back to the parking area.<br />  ",

The 2-foot-wide, compacted gravel path starts downhill almost immediately, running at steep grades of 12-30% for the first 240 feet. After 3 stairs, the steepness continues at similar grades to 464 feet before reaching a longer staircase with 20 stairs. Beyond the second staircase, the trail is not as steep but still ranges in grade from 7-12% until 575 feet. There are two cross drains in this stretch.<br /> <br /> At 575 feet, the trail reaches a 35-step staircase with a landing after the 11th step. From the bottom of this staircase at 650 feet, the trail narrows slightly, and it is 50 feet farther to the beach. A couple of large roots cross the trail in the final stretch. Expect that some navigation through beach logs will be necessary to reach the water.",

To reach the overlook, head west from the trailhead for fifty feet to an intersection. Continue forward for 170 feet to reach the overlook. From the intersection, the trail slopes downhill at 7% with a few brief stretches 9-10% before reaching the overlook. The view at sitting height may be obstructed by vegetation at times.<br /> <br /> To reach the beach, turn left at the intersection. The trail remains at 5-feet wide for another 165 feet but crosses a 20-foot heavily-crowned section with a severe drop-off on the right-hand side at 110 feet. At 215 feet, the trail narrows to 3 feet and descends 113 stairs with 12-inch-deep treads to 510 feet. There is a bench on the right at the 24th step. There are three cross drains in this set of stairs.<br /> <br /> At the bottom of the staircase, the trail continues downhill obstacle free at 9% grade, dropping to under 5% grade before the start of another staircase at 585 feet. The second staircase consists of 29 stairs with tread 3-4 feet deep. The stairs end at a bridge that crosses over to the bedrock above the beach. To reach the beach, it is a Class 3 scramble (use of hands may be required by some to navigate down the rock to the beach) down the beach where one can enjoy views of rock outcroppings and Deception Island.<br />  ",

    "audioDescription": "Canyon Creek Shelter. Overview. 2 minutes Along the trail to Sol Duc Falls, a wooden bridge with low side bumpers on the right and left, and no handrails, crosses a stream. The trail then continues to the shelter which is up a side trail on the left. Be advised: the trail to the shelter is uneven with exposed tree roots and rocks. A wooden handrail is on the right side of the trail. Once at the building the surface continues to be uneven. The shelter is a rectangular log cabin with wooden shingles. The logs are laid horizontally. In the center of the cabin is a wide-open entrance way with no door. An A-framed roof juts out at a ninety-degree angle to the main roof covering the entryway. This roof is supported at the front by a thick log atop a concrete base on the right and left. At the doorway, there are remnants of a concrete walkway that protrude out of the ground. Please use caution. You may enter the building which has an uneven dirt floor. A laminated, white paper sign posted to the front of the cabin provides the history of the building. Continue listening for the full text. 4 minutes. Welcome to the Canyon Creek Shelter. National Register of Historic Places. Please treat this important structure with respect. The shelter before you was built by Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC, enrollees during the summer and fall of 1939, one year following the establishment of Olympic National Park. Replacing a US Forest Service shelter constructed earlier, the Canyon Creek shelter was built to enhance the safety of park visitors. As an early Olympic National Park hiker, imagine how happy you would have been to find the shelter after walking in the heavy rain wearing heavy cotton and wool clothing, and perhaps carrying a cumbersome wood, leather and canvas backpack. Since 1905, the lands comprising what is now Olympic National Park have been managed by two government agencies. Until the late 1930s, the United States Forest Service administered the area and developed a unified system of communications, ranger stations, shelters, fire lookouts and trails, primarily to facilitate fire suppression. By the time Olympic National Park was designated in 1938, a growing number of recreational hikers, hunters, and fishermen were traveling into the interior mountainous sections of the Olympic Peninsula. New structures were planned by the National Park Service not only to serve management needs, but also to enhance the visitors experience of the park. Olympic National Park managers looked to the Civilian Conservation Corps for assistance to fill in for the fledgling park’s limited personnel and funds. The Civilian Conservation Corps was born out of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s personal belief in the spiritual and physical values inherent in working in nature and his conviction that the conservation of natural resources was ultimately important for the continued health and prosperity of the nation. The CCC aimed at putting a huge army of unemployed men to work on conservation projects on forest and park lands throughout the country. A main CCC camp, established on the Elwha in 1933 under the US Forest Service, was transferred to the National Park Service in 1938. In 1939, a CCC side camp was set up at Eagle Guard Station on the Soleduck River. Workers from this camp developed a campground facility, constructed a parking area at the end of the road, and build the Canyon Creek shelter at Soleduck Falls. The canyon creek shelter is a significant example of the “Rustic Style” of architecture employed by the CCC under the direction of the National Park Service. A careful observer can identify this architectural type by noticing the use of local, natural materials applied in a manner that is sensitive to the surrounding environment. Following the design tenets and philosophy of Rustic Style, the shelter was carefully sited in the forest to have as little visual impact as possible. The intent was to have the new building appear to fit and harmonize with the landscape. The style and method of construction reveals an emphasis on aesthetics and enhancing a visitor’s experience in the wilderness. Alterations to the building over the years include new concrete foundation and replacement in-kind as materials have deteriorated. In 2003 a tree fell on the shelter and damaged the roof at the north wall. Preservation maintenance was completed in 2005 to repair the damage. Revegetation work, adjacent to the shelter, took place in the fall of 2007 to restore the native plant community and increase harmonization of the shelter with the natural environment. The historic Canyon Creek shelter continues to exhibit the qualities of its original Rustic design and method of construction as built by the Civilian Conservation Corps crews under the guidance of the National Park Service. We hope you will enjoy your visit and be a thoughtful steward of the area. Thank you for protecting the Canyon Creek shelter by sharing the structure with all who visit here. Not carving, writing or otherwise leaving a mark on any part of the structure. Not climbing on the structure. Returning to the trailhead to use the latrine. Not leaving any food or trash in the area. Staying on established trails within the designated day use area to ensure the success of the revegetation efforts. And please, no fires or overnight camping in or near the shelter. Campsites are located across and upper river of the Sol Duc Falls Bridge.",

    "audioDescription": "Cape Flattery Trailhead. Overview. 2 minutes On the right side of the gravel parking lot is a square, gray cinderblock restroom with two brown doors that face the lot. The women’s room is on the left. The men’s room is on the right. At the far end of the lot the trail enters a dense forest of tall trees. Across the trail stand two log posts to prevent access by vehicles. Up trail about 15 feet is a covered bulletin board, its frame constructed of logs. Posted material includes in-depth information about the Cape Flattery Trail, the National Marine Sanctuary, and Cape Flattery Lighthouse on Tatoosh Island. Continue listening for full text of the posted information. 7 minutes. On the bulletin board are four posters. From left to right they read, Welcome to the Makah Tribe’s Shi Shi Beach Trail. This trail is 2 miles long and requires moderate exertion. Beach access in Olympic National Park is by steep trail. For your safety and enjoyment, please respect our few rules. This area is Makah Wilderness, don’t remove any flowers or foliage and don’t harass wildlife or take any shells or shellfish. Stay on designated trails and walkways. The sea cliffs and unmarked trails are dangerous. Supervise children closely. Don’t build fires or camp overnight anywhere on the trail. Overnight campers must obtain a backcountry permit through Olympic National Park. Pack out what you pack in. Consult tide charts for the area to guard against high tide accidents. Areas beyond Shi Shi Beach are impassable at high tide. Report vandalism to Makah Tribal law enforcement. Generations of Makah people have used this area. If you are patient and respectful, its enduring beauty will enrich and teach you too. A graphic in the right bottom corner shows a red and black bird with outstretched wings standing on the back of a black whale. The next poster reads, Welcome to Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. In July 1991, the Japanese fishing vessel, Tenyo Maru and the Chinese freighter, Tuo Hai collided in heavy fog northwest of Cape Flattery, Washington. The Tenyo Maru sank immediately, releasing 475,000 gallons of oil and fuel that killed thousands of seabirds. This education panel was funded by the Tenyo Maru Natural Resource Trustees as one of a number of restoration projects designed to educate the public and to restore natural resources injured by the oil spill. The Trustees include the US Department of the Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Makah Indian Tribe, and the State of Washington. An underwater photograph shows sunlight penetrating through green-hued water with long ribbons of kelp. Text reads, The Kelp Forests. Swaying fronds of kelp for a critical new sure habitat. Each plant may reach 70 feet in length their leaf light blades fan out across the water, providing shade in hiding places for fish and invertebrates. Look closely for sea otters eating or resting among the dense canopy of kelp just offshore in Olympic coast national Marine sanctuary. A photograph shows many birds with black heads and backs and white chests standing on the top of a rock ledge. Text reads, Murres at Risk. Common murres, the black and white seabirds seen along the coast, are signs of a healthy marine ecosystem. Murres use their wings to fly underwater in pursuit of small fish. They breed on remote islands or inaccessible cliffs, where they are protected from most predators. The young leave the nest before they can actually fly, leaping recklessly into the ocean to be raised at sea by their fathers. Because they spend so much time at sea, common murres are especially vulnerable to oil spills. Changing ocean conditions, entanglement in fishing nets, and low flying aircraft have also harmed the Washington breeding population, which has declined significantly over the last few decades. A final photograph is an aerial view of a large ship on the ocean. Text reads, Safer Maritime Shipping. The Makah Tribe and Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary sit at the entrance to one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. Over 13,000 vessels pass here each year, carrying large amounts of fuel oil. Collisions or groundings threaten wildlife, fish and shellfish, their habitats, historic and cultural sites and the scenic beauty of this area. Federal, tribal and state agencies and the shipping industry work together to prevent oil spills. Larger vessels observe and Area-To-Be-Avoided, a buffer zone designed to keep ships away from especially sensitive and dangerous areas near Cape Flattery. The third poster has a topographic map of the west coast of Washington State along the right edge. At the top is the Strait of Juan de Fuca and labels along the coast from north to south mark specific management areas. Text reads, nearby coastal waters are part of Olympic National Marine Sanctuary, a 3300 square mile protected area administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This area was designated in 1994 in recognition of its rugged character, rich marine life and vulnerable nature. Together with this landowner and other state, federal and tribal organizations, Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary protects marine resource supports, important scientific research and promotes compatible use and enjoyment of these resources. To enjoy your visit fully, remember the following. Don’t get trapped by the tide. Coastal headlands, stream crossings and sandy beaches can be treacherous. The water is cold and currents are strong. Hypothermia can kill within minutes. Beach logs are unstable. Don’t build fires among driftlogs. Avoid beached marine mammals. Dead or sick animals can past disease to humans. Injured animals can bight. Solitary seal pups are not orphans. Report beached marine mammals to the nearest ranger station or call 360-457-6622. Do not harass wildlife. Feeding or disturbing wild animals is illegal. Leave historical and cultural objects alone. Historic shipwreck remains and Indian artifacts and petroglyphs are protected by state and federal laws. Fish and gather shellfish only in accordance with regulations. Enjoy your visit to Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. The final poster includes a photograph of the Cape Flattery Lighthouse on Tatoosh Island as viewed from the ocean. The tall rocky face of the island is punctuated by dark cave-like voids. Short trees grow on top. The tall white lighthouse tower is topped by a glass domed room housing the lens. Below, a railed balcony encircles the tower. The lighthouse rises out of a white building with a red roof. Text reads, At the end of the Cape Flattery Trail, be sure to look out toward Tatoosh Island and find the Cape Flattery Lighthouse. Constructed in 1857 by the US federal government during a period of occupation that would last more than 100 years, the lighthouse was automated in 1976 and new possibilities now exist for this historic resource. Today, the Makah Tribe is working with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, who name the Lighthouse to their National Treasures Program to ensure it is restored as a beacon of maritime heritage. To learn more about the Lighthouse or Tatoosh Island, please visit the Makah Cultural and Research Center, located on the east side of Neah Bay, or visit Savingplaces.org/Cape Flattery.",

    "audioDescription": "Cirque Rim Overlook. 3 minutes Along the curved two-foot-high stone wall are two three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panels about 15-feet apart. Beginning with the wayside on the left, a color photograph of the tree filled valley and distant mountain landscape before you fills the panel. On the right side of the photo, a mountain ridge is on fire, whitish-gray smoke rising cloudlike into the sky. Inset on the left, a color photograph taken deep inside a mountain forest shows standing and downed trees fully engulfed in red and yellow flames. Text across the top reads: Fire and Rain. Fire in the Olympics. Even in a park drenched by over 12 feet of rain each year, summers are dry. When lightning strikes, small fires can spread. This creates a natural patchwork of burned and unburned meadows, forests and silver snags like those at Hurricane Ridge. In September 2003 lightening ignited a fire near Griff Peak, two-mile northwest of here. It was too dangerous for the firefighters to dig a fire line on the steep slopes, amid falling trees and rocks. Instead, crews used sprinklers, helicopter water drops and bare ridges to limit the fire’s spread. October rains had the final word, extinguishing embers that lingered in the 820-acre Griff Fire. As woodpeckers probe the drying trees, and nutrients released by the flames return to the soil, researchers will be watching. How many sun-loving tree seedlings sprout in new openings? Which wildflowers colonize the slopes? What changes can you observe from this fiery renewal? The wayside panel on the right has a color panoramic illustration of the valley, mountain, and water landscape before you with 16 features labeled. Text under the photograph reads: International Views. When weather permits, you can see the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Canada’s Vancouver Island, Victoria, and British Columbia Coast Range. The Strait and other waterways isolate the Olympic Peninsula. When clouds cover the lowlands, imagine the white layer as thick ice sheets that also isolated these mountains thousands of years ago. As a result, island-like Olympic National Park protects plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. The labeled features along mountain ridges from left to right are Hurricane Hill Trailhead; Hurricane Hill Trail; Hurricane Hill, 5,759 feet with Little River in the valley below; Unicorn Peak; Unicorn Horn; and Griff Peak. Then, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Vancouver Island, Salt Spring Island, Port Angeles, Victoria, Haro Strait, San Juan Island (US), and British Columbia Coast Range in the background fill the right side of the photo.",

Here wildlife find food, a place to rest, and protection from winds and pounding surf. Recognizing the area's importance to wildlife, President Woodrow Wilson declared Dungeness Spit and its surrounding waters a National Wildlife Refuge in 1915. Dungeness is one of over 500 refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System. A network of lands set aside specifically for wildlife, the System is our living heritage, conserving wildlife and habitat for generations to come. Dungeness NWR is open to the public year-round. Hiking, wildlife watching, and photography are popular activities on the Refuge. There is also an adjacent campground, Dungeness Recreation Area, which is managed by Clallam County <a href=\"http://www.clallam.net/Parks/Dungeness.html\">(click here for campground information)</a>. <br /> <br /> \"Some areas are closed seasonally or permanently to protect sensitive species. Pets, bicycles, kite flying, frisbees, ball-playing, camping, and fires are not permitted on the Refuge as they are a disturbance for the many migrating birds and other wildlife taking solitude on the Refuge. West of Sequim on Highway 101, turn north on Kitchen-Dick Road. Continue 3 miles (4.8 km) to Dungeness County Recreation Area. Pass through the recreation area to reach the Refuge parking lot.\"<br /> <br /> The refuge is open from 7 a.m. to half an hour before sunset, and closing times are posted daily at the trailhead.

    "audioDescription": "Elwha Klallam Heritage Center. 3 minutes The tan concrete building has a tall, central section with an asymmetrical curved roof and two lower curved wings to each side, a bank of windows across the left wing and no windows across the right wing. The front door is in the center section and is flanked on each side by large windows. Above the door and windows, four evenly spaced thick logs jut straight out from the front wall each coming to rest atop a tall, square wooden vertical column anchored to the concrete patio in front of the building. The front cut of each log is adorned with a round, orange, metal face design, each having a different facial expression. Laid horizontally across the top of the logs are three horizontal timbers upon which sits a carved, wooden canoe painted in traditional black artistic designs. Attached to the front of the two center columns are tan colored animal designs carved from wood. On the right side of the patio is a red square wooden structure with a wide peaked roof that frames the Heritage Center sign attached in the center. The front edge of the roof is adorned with black half-moons. On the top horizonal framing board are the words, Strong People. The Heritage Center sign has a black background edged with two red lines. At the top, words in yellow read, Elwha Klallam. At the bottom, Heritage Center. In the center is a white, circular tribal seal outlined in black and red with three thick horizontal red lines on each side. The top lines have three half-moon designs, the second line, two half-moons, and the bottom line, one half-moon. Curving along the inside top of the seal are the words, Elwha Klallam Tribe, in black. In the center, a red, black, and white thunderbird design shows a bird with open wings, it’s head and large beak facing left, and yellow lightning bolts crisscrossed behind it. Below the bird on the left and the right facing each other are killer whales, designed in red, black and yellow. Along the bottom horizontal framing board is black text in the Elwha Klallam language.",

    "audioDescription": "Explore Hurricane Ridge Trailhead Loop. 2 minutes A map of three trails on Hurricane Ridge fills the left side of this three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panel. Trails are marked in individual colors as dashed or dotted lines. Dashes indicate a paved trail and dots indicate a dirt trail. The text, “You Are Here,” places your location at a trailhead for the Cirque Rim Trail. Text at the right reads: Explore Hurricane Ridge. Short nature trails invite you to explore the high, subalpine world. The paved Big Meadow and Cirque Rim trails have gentle grades with short steeper sections and are accessible with assistance. Please stay on designated trails to help preserve meadows. Text continues with an overview of each trail: Big Meadow Trail, blue dashes. This paved quarter mile trail crosses open meadows with views of the Olympic Mountains. Cirque Rim Trail, red dashes. This paved three-quarter mile trail winds along the ridge. An overlook offers views of Port Angeles, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Canada. High Ridge Trail, green dashes then green dots. This mostly unpaved, steep one-half mile loop climbs to an alpine setting. On clear days you can view both the Olympic and Cascade Mountains. A short spur trail to Sunrise Point adds views of Canada. On the left side of the trail is a five-foot-tall upright wooden frame with two informational panels. The panel on the left has an illustration of a person feeding a deer. Text reads: Keep Wildlife Wild. Human food spoils wild animals. They lose their desire for natural foods by becoming beggars and easy prey for car wheels and predators. No matter how appealing, all park animals are potentially dangerous. They may bite or scratch and can spread disease. Please don’t feed the animals. The panel on the right has an illustration of a hiking boot with deeps treads about to step on grass, wildflowers, a hidden mouse nest, and an adult mouse. Text reads: Meadow Damage. Your feet are a threat to meadows. Without realizing, people crush fragile plants and flatten nests and small creatures hidden in the grass. Help preserve the meadows. Please stay on maintained trails. Shortcuts leave lasting scars.",

Head towards the information boards that are visible from the accessible parking spaces. A trail intersection, 310 feet from the boards, leads to a sign indicating where the Hall of Mosses trail starts. At this intersection, follow to the left for another 450 feet and then turn right at the next trail intersection. The next 10 feet of trail cover a 5-10%-grade increase to the 30-foot bridge over Taft Creek. There is an 8-inch step off the far end of the bridge onto sloping ground for 10 more feet.<br /> <br /> At 650 feet, the trail narrows to 4 feet wide and climbs at a steep 9-14% grade. There is an exterior handrail along the trail starting at 650 feet and ending at 900 feet. The trail turns to the left and continues uphill at steeper grades from 17-22% for 70 feet, before reaching the start of a loop that circles through a forest of bigleaf maple trees. Turn left at the intersection and continue uphill. From 970 feet to 1,020 feet is the steepest part of the trail at 24% for 30 feet, followed by 20 feet at 12%.<br /> <br /> From 1,020 to 1,050 feet, the trail goes downhill at a 15% grade, followed by another 40 feet downhill at 9%. Following a small step down at 1,110 feet, the grade drops to under 5% for the next 700 feet. At 1,805 feet there is a 200-foot spur trail to the left. The spur, under 5% grade, is fenced on either side and ends at a fenced area with views of a group of moss-covered bigleaf maples. Continuing back along the main trail from the spur, the trail remains under 5% grade to 2,210 feet. Those seeking the least-strenuous version of this hike may wish to go back along the same route at this point, as the east side of loop is more rugged than the portion already traveled. The trail begins to climb uphill at 10-14% grade from 2,210 feet to 2,990 feet. From 2,990 feet to 2,390 feet, the trail continues uphill, fluctuating from 7-14% before reaching a 30-foot stretch dense with large roots. There is a brief, level spot at 2,440 feet before a 16% uphill increase that includes 6 steps interspersed with roots and rocks.</p> <p>The trail remains rocky and begins sloping back downhill at 9-12%, interspersed with a few gentler areas to 2,645 feet. From 2,645 to 2,735 feet the grade sharply increases to 20%, then reduces to 8% from 2,735 to 2,810 feet. Continue down 7 stairs at a 10% grade to 2,850 feet. This concludes the most difficult section of the east side of the loop. There are many amazing sights along the remainder of the loop, including examples of mature trees grown from nurse logs and fallen giants on the trail side. The trail tread again becomes wide, smooth and under 5% grade from 2,850 feet to 3,355 feet. At 3,355 feet there is a 30-foot downhill at 15-20% with numerous roots and rocks. From 3,385 to 3,900 feet, grades remain under 5% until reaching five stairs climbing a 15% grade increase for 45 feet. From 3,945 feet the trail is again smooth and level until a 25-foot uphill increase of 10-12% at 4,380 feet. The final gentle stretch extends from 4,405 feet to 4,500 feet. At 4,500 feet, continue down a steep hill at 20-25% grade to reach the beginning of the loop. Retrace the initial approach to return to the parking area at 5,515 feet.</p>",

The dirt trail surface is mostly flat. Up trail, a wooden plank bridge with short side bumpers and no hand railings crosses a creek. On the other side of the bridge the trail becomes rough. In places rocks and tree roots protrude through the surface and wooden timbers lay across the trail creating uneven steps. Overhead, downed trees may cross the trail creating places where head room is reduced.

Entire Trail: 645 feet<br /> <strong>Accessible Parking:</strong> Van-accessible parking immediately across from the trailhead<br /> <strong>Description: </strong>The Hurricane Hill trailhead is at the end of the Hurricane Hill Road, 2 miles past the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center. The trail starts at the northwest corner of the parking area and contours to the south side of the hill offering spectacular views of the Olympic Mountains. At the top, there are also views to the north of Griff Peak, Vancouver Island and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.<br /> <br /> Initially the trail goes downhill for 400 feet at a gentle grade under 6%. From 400 to 750 feet, the trail proceeds uphill. This stretch is at 7% with a steeper 150-foot stretch in the middle at 8-9%. The trail levels out at the top and is under 2% grade for the next 650 feet. At 1,400 feet, the trail heads downhill around a curve at less than 5% grade for the next 300 feet. The trail is on a steeply-cut bank through this section with exposure to a considerable drop on the outside edge. Those affected by heights may wish to remain on the inside edge of the trail.<br /> <br /> The trail continues through gradual ups and downs under 5% until 2,450 feet. From 2,450 to 2,700 feet the trail again goes downhill at about 6%. This is a good location to consider turning back. It is a strenuous hike past this point. From 2,700 to 3,700 feet, the trail is extremely steep with grades ranging from 10 to 18%. The trail continues uphill to its terminus at the top of Hurricane Hill, alternating between moderately steep and extremely steep grades as follows:<br /> From 3,700 to 3,900 feet, grades range from 4-6%<br /> From 3,900 to 4,300 feet, grades range from 8-11%<br /> From 4,300 to 5,700 feet, grades range less than 8%<br /> From 5,700 to 8,200 feet, grades range from 10-18%",
    "audioDescription": "Hurricane Hill Trailhead. 2 minutes Parking at the trailhead is along the right side of the road. The trail is across the road on the left. At the trailhead on the right is a wooden bulletin board where park information is posted. An interpretive panel is attached to the board on the left. Filling the top of the panel is a map of the trail with the text, You Are Here, noted toward the bottom. Text below the map reads, Hurricane Hill Trail. The 1.6-mile trail to Hurricane Hill ascends gradually at first, then climbs more steeply through subalpine meadows. From the top there are views of the Olympic Mountains to the south and Vancouver Island, British Columbia to the north. Average hiking time to top is one and one-half hours. Elevation gain is 650 feet. Text continues: Window on the Wilderness. On this hike you can get a taste of Wilderness without packing deep into backcountry. No roads slice the interior. Except for the trail, there are few signs of human impact. To the left of the text is a black and white illustration of a robust black bear in profile facing right. Trees grow in the background. On the right side of the bulletin board are posted park notices and regulations. About 20 feet up trail, a two-foot-tall log post stands in the center of the trail. To its right is a sign on a taller post that reads: No pets, weapons, or vehicles.",

There is a handicap parking space directly in front of the trail. The loop trail leaves from the center of the parking area, with a 2-inch lip at the curb ramp. There is a 25-foot uphill slope at 10% grade before the trail starts downhill to the picnic area. The first 40 feet of the descent are steep, with 10-13% grade. The descent becomes gradually gentler for the next 120 feet before reaching the picnic area. There are two picnic sites to the right at the bottom of the hill. The trail continues to the left at a very gentle grade, and at 225 feet a bridge crosses over July Creek.<br /> <br /> The trail is fairly level for the next 200 feet, then begins to climb back towards North Shore Road. At 420 feet, there is a brief section at 10-12%, then the grade drops under 7% until the last 50 feet up to the road which is again at 10-13%. At 650 feet, the trail meets the road and then runs along the road for 220 feet to return to the parking lot. Once back at the parking lot, follow the sidewalk back to the starting point.",

The trailhead is at the end of a .2-mile gravel road. The parking area is gravel with no defined parking spaces. The Big Cedar itself is just 110 feet from the trailhead. The trail circles the tree to the left and continues east into the lush coastal forest. Please resist the urge to climb on this ancient giant. The trail is wide and stable, but the edges slope off steeply where the trail goes around the tree.<br /> <br /> After the tree split in 2014, a trail was constructed that continues 690 feet into the forest and has a loop, or lollipop, ending that runs adjacent to another impressive cedar. The “lollipop” ending narrows to 3-foot width, is crowned, and has steep slopes on both sides where substantial gravel fill was added to even the grade. The trail is typically under 5% grade, with one brief section at 6.5% grade in the center. The lollipop portion of the trail narrows to 3 feet and the gravel slopes off steeply on either side. Wheelchair users should exercise caution if navigating the loop. The loop is 285 feet in circumference. The north side has a 6% grade for 105 feet. Upon completing the loop, return on the same trail to the parking area.",

    "audioDescription": "Kalaloch Campground Loop A Beach Access. 4 minutes On the right side of the campground loop road overlooking the ocean is a pull off with parking. An eight-inch-high concrete edge separates the parking lot and a small grass and gravel area where a picnic table is located. To the right of the table, a brown sign with white text reads, Day Use Only, and below, another sign reads, Pets must be on leash at all times. About 4 feet to the right on a slight downward sloping hill is a three-foot-tall, angled wayside panel with blue and white illustrations of whales. Text on the right reads: Whale Watching. Twice a year California gray whales swim past, sometimes between Destruction Island and this beach. In the fall they are migrating south to calve and nurse in the warm lagoons of Baja California. The gray whales return in early spring on their way to arctic feeding grounds where they comb clouds of shrimp-like creatures from the water. Somehow, across 4000 miles of ocean, the huge mammals navigate precisely, on a predictable timetable. Watch for signs. Fifteen-foot spouts of warm condensing breath punctuate the rhythm of diving and breathing. Occasionally gray whales breach, burst from the water, turn and fall back with a tremendous splash, just playing, or maybe checking their bearings. Filling the left side of the panel is a long, blimp shaped whale with dark skin and patches of white, its opened mouth revealing a curtain of hair-like baleen. A map to the right of the whale has a line of arrows marking the round-trip migration route of Grey whales from their northern summer feeding grounds in the Bering Sea off the west coast of Alaska, then along the west coast of the United States, to their southern mating and calving area in lagoons off the west coast of Mexico. In the center of the panel, three small illustrations show different whale behaviors. From left to right, a submerged whale points downward, only its V-shaped tail above water. Next, a whale underwater with only its head above water and the caption, Spyhopping. Sometimes whales stand nose-up to have a look around. Finally, a whale tail above water with the caption, Diving. As a whale begins a sustained dive, the flukes rise dramatically before disappearing beneath the surface. Spanning the bottom of the panel is a horizontal diagram showing nine positions of a swimming whale, underwater at times, then rising to the surface to breathe. A caption reads, Spouting. Gray whales swim in a pattern that makes them easy to spot. It usually consists of 3 to 5 spouts, followed by a dive that lasts 2 to 5 minutes as they swim along at about 5 miles per hour. After this dive they surface and repeat their breathing pattern. To the right of this wayside, a paved trail leads down a hill to the beach below. In places the pavement is uneven. About 10-feet down the path on the left is a second wayside panel titled, Drift Logs and Riptides. Filling the left side of the panel is a blue and white aerial view drawing showing the churning water of a rip current rolling perpendicular to the shoreline through a narrow gap between the shore and a sandbar. Text in the top right reads: Beach logs are the bones of a rain forest picked clean by the sea. They begin in river valleys—giant conifers like Sitka spruce. When a day’s downpour adds to glacial melt the stream may rise six feet, undermining the bank and toppling trees into the flood, washing them down to river mouth and beach. Some fall from eroding headlands. Numbered trunks are strays from tug-pulled log rafts. Drift logs are dangerous. At high tide they may suddenly roll. Unwary people have been crushed and killed by drift logs. Riptides make swimming and wading dangerous. There are no lifeguards. Swimmers beware. Below the text is a smaller drawing at beach level of a jumbled pile of drift logs. Where the paved path ends, a staircase with eight steps descends to the beach. Unfinished wooden handrails are on each side of the steps. At the bottom, rocks jut out of the sandy surface and log walls create a tunnel-like entrance onto the beach. Be advised: spanning this entryway on the ground is a drift log.",

    "audioDescription": "Kestner Homestead. Overview. 90 seconds At the entrance to the gravel parking lot on the left, a brown sign reads, Ranger Station, and has an arrow pointing up trail. Pet Regulations are attached to the signpost. The trail to the Homestead begins at the top of the lot. The trail is wide, flat and a combination of gravel and grass. Almost immediately, the trail reaches a swinging metal gate across the entrance to a wooden bridge. Access to the bridge is on the right side of the gate. A sign at the front of the bridge reads, Please walk on metal grate. This flat, 20-inch-wide expanded metal grate extends down the center of the bridge surface. The bridge has side railings and crosses over a gravel bottom creek. The homestead begins once across the bridge. On each side of the trail are split rail fences. On the left, an orchard grows in a meadow. On the right is a wide meadow. Straight ahead on the left are the homestead buildings. A dense forest of pine trees surrounds the homestead property and in the distance are forested mountains. Continue listening to hear a description of the buildings. 3 Minutes A wide grassy area surrounds the buildings. An old rusty piece of farm equipment sits weathering in the grass. A bathtub lays behind a fence. On the left are three side-by-side buildings. The first is a long, rectangular, wooden-shingled, two-story building with an A-frame peaked roof covered with wide cedar shakes. The shingles and shakes are silvery-brown and weathered. On the left short side of the building is a covered porch with a front door centered on the wall flanked on each side by a white framed window. Above the porch roof is a bank of four windows and at the roof peak, a small window. There is no access through the front door. On the side of the building facing the trail are two large and two small windows left and center followed by an open passageway through the building to the other side. A fifth window is to the right of the passageway. Inside the passageway, the floor surface is concrete as it crosses the building and in places uneven, and then gravel along the sides. Large overhead wooden beams are supported by thick vertical posts. The other side of the building has the same window configuration. The second building is a one-story square, brown wooden structure with wide, silver colored cedar shakes on a peaked roof. The bottom half of the left side of the building is fully open and used as storage. Next to this building on the left is a split rail fence, then a grassy area where the third building is located. It is a barn. It’s red, metal roof is tall and peaked in the center, then flares out and down like extended wings supported on each end by short walls. The front and back of the barn have no solid walls leaving the framework of beams exposed. Inside on a gravel surface are picnic tables. Behind these buildings is a tall wooden structure with a roof and no sides and a small brown, wooden plank building with a door. Beside this building is an old, red farm truck and other farming equipment. Further back is a white, metal modern building. Near this building is a sign on a post with arrows pointing to the left with the text, Kestner Homestead Trail. Maple Glade Forest Trail 0.7 miles.",

From kiosk start to the homestead, less than 5%<br /> <strong>Typical Cross Slope:</strong> Less than 1% (the first bridge has a cross slope of 4% for the last 15 feet)<br /> <strong>Description: </strong>This loop trail may be travelled in either direction: Following the Maple Glade Trail going left at the first junction, and then left again at 1,050 feet when reaching the sign for the Kestner Homestead Trail; or starting at the information kiosk. Starting from the Maple Glade Trail, it is .77 miles to the homestead. After leaving the Maple Glade Trail, the trail rolls up and down through a forest heavy with maple trees, and the tread is generally clear of obstacles. There is a 40-foot bridge at 1,125 feet, followed by 2 slightly steep sections (10 feet at 7% at 1,560 feet and 30 feet at 6-8% at 1,710 feet) before reaching a mossy bench at 1,710 feet. From the bench, there is a gradual hill for 290 feet at up to 7% grade. At 2,080 feet, the trail narrows to 3 feet. There is a 30-foot 8-10% downhill at 3,770 feet followed by a 25-foot bridge at 3,715 feet. The boundary of the Kestner Homestead is at 4,075 feet. From this point back to the kiosk at the parking area the trail is mostly flat.<br /> <br /> The first 170 feet of trail through the homestead is clumped with grass followed by a 110-foot section where the trail is all grass. Turning right at the homestead residence, the trail follows the original entrance road past the orchard for 500 feet before crossing a bridge over Kestner Creek. The decking of the bridge is pending replacement and a 2-foot-wide path of expanded metal is in place the length of the bridge to provide secure footing. Continuing around the gate at the end of the bridge, the trail turns right just before reaching the North Shore Road. From here it is 1,840 feet back to the trailhead kiosk at the parking area. There is a short stretch after turning along the road that is 3-feet wide and there is an adjacent ditch. Wheelchair users should exercise caution. There are roots that rise 2” above the trail tread at 5,800 and 6,490 feet.<br /> <br /> For those wishing to visit the homestead on a less-strenuous hike, depart from the trailhead kiosk and return the same way. This is a 1.1-mile round trip.",
    "audioDescription": "Kestner Homestead Trailhead. 2 minutes On the forest side of the parking lot which is lined with concrete parking bumpers is a concrete pad where a roof covered bulletin board stands. Posted on the board is information about pet and park regulations; firearms and weapons; bear and cougar awareness; no fireworks allowed; backcountry safety; nearest services; local trails; and a notice to contact a park ranger or dial 911 in an emergency. Behind and to the right of the bulletin board is a brown wooden sign that reads: Kestner Homestead Trail. A second sign reads: No pets, weapons, or vehicles. To the left of this sign is a brown box on a post with a sign on the hinged lid that reads, Trail Brochures. Welcome. We hope you enjoy exploring Olympic National Park. Donations for these trail brochures are accepted at park visitor centers. Thank you for your support. The sign ends with this quote by John Muir: In every walk with Nature one receives far more than he seeks. Filling the right side of the sign is a green and white illustration showing a high mountain peak with a forest and lake below. The dirt trail begins to the right of the trail sign and winds through a forest of tall trees, some covered with hanging green moss. The understory is a dense carpet of ferns, mosses, and other plants.",

A garbage can is behind the bulletin board. A brown directional sign with white lettering reads: Lake Angeles Trail. Lake Angeles 3.7 miles Klahhane Ridge 6.2 miles. Hurricane Ridge 9.9 miles. Below, another sign reads, No Pets, Weapon Use or Wheeled Devices. On the right side of the trailhead is a tall green and white informational sign with a map of the trail system marked with white lines and the text, You Are Here. The map shows the Lake Angeles Trail and Heather Park Trail branching off in different directions. Above the map, a trail profile diagram illustrates the elevation gain for the Lake Angeles Trail. Below the map, text reads: Lake Angeles Trail. Two trails leave and rejoin each other 6.2 miles from here, then continue on to Hurricane Ridge. Both pass through lower elevation forest for the first several miles, then break into spectacular vistas. Both trails also steepen after the first 2 to 3 miles. Lake Angeles, surrounded by high cliffs on three sides, is reached by the trail on the left. Lake Angeles, 3.3 miles. Klahhane, 6.1 miles. Hurricane Ridge, 9.8 miles. Heather Park, noted for its July wildflowers, is reached by the trail on the right. The halfway Rock lookout point provides a view across the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Vancouver Island. Halfway Rock, 2.2 miles. Heather Park, 4 miles. Klahhane Ridge, 6.2 miles. Hurricane Ridge, 9.9 miles Fire. Because of the large fire in 1898, most of the forest along these trails is second growth. Lake Angeles has been designated a “No Fire” area. On the higher slopes there is thinner soli, less moisture-giving snow, more wind exposure. Trees and plants grow slowly. A brown sign with white lettering for the Heather Park Trail reads: Halfway Rock, 2.2 miles. Heather Park, 4.1 miles. Klahhane Ridge, 6.3 miles. Hurricane Ridge, 10 miles",

    "audioDescription": "Lake Crescent Lodge. 3 minutes Single story, white duplex cottages with front porches and rocking chairs line the left side of the asphalt walkway leading to the lodge. A sign reads, Singer Tavern Cottages, Rooms 5 to 21. On the right of the walkway, a green, white and black sign with a drawing of the lodge reads, Welcome to Lake Crescent Lodge. Straight ahead, at the end of the walkway sits a three-story white shingled building with a brown shingled roof, dormer windows and a covered porch with railing on the front and right sides. Tall bushes grow in front of the porch. Pots with flowers sit on the ground on each side of a one-step staircase leading to the raised front porch, where directly ahead, is the double door entry. Hanging above the staircase, a green and black sign reads, Lake Crescent Lodge. Flags adorn the porch beams and bulletin boards with posted notices and flyers, are attached to the building. One flyer reads: A Historic Tradition. In 1915, Avery and Julia Singer built a small hotel at Barnes Point on the shore of Lake Crescent, opening Singer’s Tavern. At the time of its opening, the Tavern consisted of eight Lodge rooms, which are still in use today, and a series of cottages. Julia Singer planted an ornamental garden, together with a small golf course, a vegetable garden and fruit trees. The Singers sold the property in 1927 to the Seattle Trust Company and from there it passed to Walter and Bessie Bovee. In the latter half of the 1930s, members of Congress proposed the establishment of a large national park encompassing the central mountainous region of the Olympic Peninsula, and as a result, the lodge received its most notable guest, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who visited the peninsula in the fall of 1937. Roosevelt arrived at the lodge in the evening of September 30, where he spent the night and continued on to the lake Quinault Lodge the next day. While he was at Singer’s Tavern, Roosevelt discussed the proposed Olympic National Park with Park Service and Forest Service advisors, and with Washington senators. Following his tour of the Peninsula, the President signed authorization for the creation of Olympic National Park in 1938. The lodge remained an inholding through the 1940s, when several new lodges and an addition to the main lodge were built. In 1951, the National Park Service bought the lodge and its property for $95,000. The Mission 66 initiative proposed the lodge’s demolition and replacement with modern facilities. A number of accessory buildings were removed, but the main lodge was spared, though motel-style units were constructed nearby. Several cabins were replaced with newer units of similar character. The Main Lodge, Singer Cottages, Roosevelt Cottages and the main grounds are on the National Register of Historic Places. The lodge serves travelers seasonally from May until January 1. Facing the Lodge, the walkway turns right and leads to a wooden dock with side railings that juts out into the lake. Inside the lodge are restrooms, a gift shop, a restaurant, and a lounge.",

The interior of the Lodge was decorated with Native motif on the ceiling beams. Later, Sally provided basketweaving demonstrations while her family entertained the visiting tourists with singing, dancing and drumming. Additionally, long intricate canoes carved by Chief Howeattle provided exciting races on the lakefront of the Lodge.<br /> <br /> \"During the late 1920s, huge barbecues were held in the summer on the beach in front of the lodge. The crowds were entertained by foot races, water sports and square dancing on Fred Halbert's dance pavilion (R.H. Jones, A History of Lake Quinault Lodge, 1997). Many of these same activities persist today. Harvest Moon, Quinault Ambassador and master basketweaver is a frequent guest at the Quinault Lodge. Collaborative Interpretive signs provide tribal heritage and artistic works, with geologic, scientific and historical perspectives of the area on the Lakefront shoreline trail. Rented kayaks rather than tribal canoes ply the waters of Lake Quinault.\"</p>",

The second ramp has a 10-foot section with 7% grade that is the steepest part of the trail. The bridge has settled on the west end and has a cross slope of 4% for the last 15 feet. Trail brochures for the Maple Glade Trail and the Kestner Homestead Trail are available at the bottom of the 30-foot ramp. The Maple Glade brochure describes forest elements at 13 marked points along the trail. 200 feet farther down the trail, proceed right at the junction to follow the brochure in numerical order.<br /> <br /> The Quinault Rain Forest receives over 12 feet of rain annually. Portions of the trail may be flooded between the months of October and May, but the summer months are typically dry, and so is the trail. The rain contributes to escalated vegetation growth, so each side of the trail typically has low vegetation growth in the gravel surface, but it is still firm. Despite the gentle grade of the trail, the weather conditions make it difficult to maintain in accessible condition, so wheelchair users should proceed with caution.<br /> <br /> Continuing from the junction, the trail proceeds for 2,370 feet through a quiet forest of mossy bigleaf maple trees, braided with stream channels, before looping back to the junction. The grade is gentle for the entirety of the loop and crosses numerous short wooden bridges. There are multiple locations along the trail where bridge ends, tree roots, and trail construction features rise 2 inches above the trail tread. At 425 feet, there is a cut through a downed tree with a 4-inch step. At 1,530 feet, continue to the left at the Kestner Homestead Trail junction to complete the loop. There is a trailside bench at 1,685 feet. The roughest stretch of trail is from 2,010 to 2,090 feet where there are two 8-foot sections of numerous crisscrossed exposed tree roots, followed by a 45-foot section where flooded has caused a 10-inch deep, 18-inch wide rut down the middle of the trail. When back at the first junction, go right to return to the parking lot.",

Further along is a second wooden bridge. The trail become gravel again for about 20 feet and then the hand railings end. Here on the left is a brown box on a post with a sign on the hinged lid that reads, Trail Brochures. Welcome. We hope you enjoy exploring Olympic National Park. Donations for these trail brochures are accepted at park visitor centers. Thank you for your support. The sign ends with this quote by John Muir: In every walk with Nature one receives far more than he seeks.

    "bodyText": "<p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{64}\" paraid=\"6\">The Maritime Washington National Heritage Area (designated in 2019) encompasses 3,000 miles of western Washington’s saltwater coastline from Grays Harbor County to the Canadian border, 18 federally recognized tribes, 13 counties, 32 incorporated cities, and 30 port districts, as well as innumerable harbors, inlets, peninsulas, island shores, and parks—all connected by the nation’s largest ferry system. The Washington Trust for Historic Preservation, a state-wide non-profit dedicated to preserving the state’s historic resources, is the NHA’s Coordinating Entity. <br /> <br /> Communities here were connected to the rest of the world by boat long before roads and railroads were built. The first peoples created complex cultures around canoe journeys and salmon cycles. Then came Spanish, English, Russian and American explorers in search of territory and shipping lanes. As the country developed, the region’s ports began to bolster trade of vast natural resources, and naval installations came to guard the continent. <br /> <br /> Washington’s coastline is rich with historic buildings and vessels, museums, and archival collections, and the maritime industry remains a foundation of the region’s economy today. Shipyards, container ports, cruise ships, tugs, and marinas full of small and large pleasure craft are as much a part of this NHA’s inheritance as historic ships or lighthouses.   <br /> <br /> To read the Maritime Washington National Heritage Area management plan, click here. <br /> <br /> The vast diversity of this living landscape can be divided by geographic regions:  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{94}\" paraid=\"11\">Olympic Peninsula </h2> <p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{100}\" paraid=\"12\">The Olympic Peninsula is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Puget Sound’s Hood Canal. The Olympic Mountains rise prominently in the interior. Historic ports, coastal communities, and traditional tribal lands rim this boxy landmass. Home to Olympic National Park, the peninsula features the longest stretch of publicly-owned and undeveloped shoreline on the Pacific Coast, and closely resembles the shoreline inhabited by the tribes before Europeans arrived. Olympic National Park is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, designated for its ecosystem diversity, while the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary lies offshore, distinguished for its educational opportunities.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{106}\" paraid=\"13\">Puget Sound </h2> <p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{112}\" paraid=\"14\">A complex inlet of the Pacific Ocean and the third-largest estuary in the United States, Puget Sound comprises many waterways, basins, and bays, including Seattle’s brackish Lake Union. For millennia, the sound connected the Northwest people to the sea – for travel, trade, sustenance, protection, and recreation. Today, Puget Sound is home to maritime industries, military bases, small coastal communities, the cities of Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, and the state capital Olympia. The Kitsap Peninsula and enchanting islands lie in the interior of Puget Sound, with the Hood Canal between them and the Olympic Peninsula.    </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{118}\" paraid=\"15\">Northern Coast </h2> <p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{124}\" paraid=\"16\">Along the western edge of Skagit and Whatcom Counties lies Washington’s northern coastline, a series of protected bays stretching north to the Strait of Georgia, which separates Vancouver Island from mainland Canada. The traditional aquaculture, fishing, and sea trade economies remain important in this region. Continuing a centuries-old tradition, northern coastal cities like Bellingham still provide jumping-off points for journeys to Alaska through the Inside Passage.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{130}\" paraid=\"17\">Salish Sea Islands </h2> <p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{136}\" paraid=\"18\">Three Northwest water bodies – the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, and Canada’s Strait of Georgia - are together called the Salish Sea. The over 400 islands that lie in these waters are the ancient homelands of native tribes and habitat for some of the region’s most diverse marine wildlife. This varied island environment– including Whidbey Island, one of the largest islands in the contiguous United States, and the San Juan archipelago— contains some of the most remote and rugged places in this region, as well as active ports and popular vacation destinations. </p>",

The trail with the least grade and the widest tread begins from the center of the parking area. The trail is steep for the first 190 feet with the grade tapering off for the remaining 210 feet to an overlook with views of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Vancouver Island and the San Juan Islands on a clear day.<br /> <br /> Starting shortly before the overlook, the Big Meadow Trail runs east for 900 feet across the meadow to an intersection with the Cirque Rim Trail and the High Ridge Trail. The Big Meadow Trail grade remains under 5% for 800 feet and then increases to 9% downhill where it reaches the intersection of the Cirque Rim Trail and the High Ridge Trail. For the least strenuous option, consider turning around at the <em>Growing Gradually</em> interpretive exhibit and returning to the parking lot or overlook via the same route.<br /> <br /> The Cirque Rim Trail departs to the east from the overlook. The 4-foot-wide path follows the rolling contour of the northern slope at grades of 12-20% for 1,670 feet before meeting up with the intersection of the east end of the Big Meadow Trail and part of the High Ridge Trail. From here, the trail continues down a hill for 140 feet to reach the east end of the parking lot. To return to the center of the parking area via the Big Meadow Trail, follow the trail as it climbs a gradual 9% grade for 100 feet and then levels out to less than a 5% grade over the remaining 800 feet of trail leading downhill to the parking area.</p>",

Pouring over the lip of a high cliff, a white veil of water cascades down a steep rock face covered by a carpet of moss in various shades of green from bright to dark. Ferns and other plants grow on the rocky face away from the rush of falling water. The falls are framed by the surrounding forest of towering green pine trees with brown trunks covered in green moss, an understory of lush, green ferns, shrubs, and other low growing plants. At the base of the falls, the water splashes into the creek and follows its downward path over and around moss and fern covered rocks.",

Text at the top of the panel reads: Ancient Lake Morse. Thousands of years ago, a great ice sheet from Canada flowed south through the Puget Sound and west through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The ice sheet abutted alpine glaciers flowing from the Olympic Mountains. As warming occurred, meltwater from mountain glaciers was dammed by the ice sheet, forming ancient Lake Morse. Continued warming caused the ice sheet to withdraw, draining the lake. Morse Creek now parallels the road. In ancient times it flowed over a ridge of soft sediments connecting Blue and Round Mountains. When glaciers dammed the creek, it was diverted to a new path between Round Mountain and the present road, cutting through hard lava rocks. The resulting gorge is visible as you drive down the road or from the short trail at the Tunnels parking area. Below the text are two side-by-side images that compare the ancient landscape to present time. On the left, a color drawing depicts a past landscape. In the foreground, a green hill with scattered tall, dark pine trees, slopes into the expansive blue waters of Ancient Lake Morse. The lake extends into the distance cutting between the peaks of Round Mountain on the left and Blue Mountain on the right. The image on the right is a black and white photograph of the present-day landscape. Where the lake once existed is now a deep winding gorge filled with dense pine forests. Without the lake, the full height of Round Mountain and Blue Mountain is exposed.",

The color image filling the background shows a lake with still water flanked on the right by a hill with tall dark pine trees, and on the left and rear, by the slope of a tall mountain. Text reads: Moments in Time Trail. Shaped by time and water, Barnes Point punctuates the south shore of glacially carved Lake Crescent. This quiet delta, with its mantle of old-growth forest, continues to grow and change. For thousands of years, American Indians lived and traded here. Later, settlers homesteaded this area and entrepreneurs developed hotels and lodges. Today, Lake Crescent is protected in Olympic National Park for all to enjoy. As you walk this trail, you follow the footsteps of many who shaped this landscape. This accessible one-half mile loop has several entrances and exits. A trail map is provided below and at four other entry points. Please return it after use. These interpretive exhibits were provided by the Rob Reed and Lena Sharpe Memorial Foundation. Another sign posted at a split in the trail, is a brown, wooden directional sign with white text and arrows. The Moments in Time Trail travels left and right.

Growing on the ground are green ferns with tall, long fronds. Along the trail is a three-foot-tall angled wayside panel. The color image filling the background shows a lake with still water flanked on the right by a hill with tall dark pine trees, and on the left and rear, by the slope of a tall mountain. Text reads: Moments in Time Trail. Shaped by time and water, Barnes Point punctuates the south shore of glacially carved Lake Crescent. This quiet delta, with its mantle of old-growth forest, continues to grow and change. For thousands of years, American Indians lived and traded here. Later, settlers homesteaded this area and entrepreneurs developed hotels and lodges. Today, Lake Crescent is protected in Olympic National Park for all to enjoy. As you walk this trail, you follow the footsteps of many who shaped this landscape. This accessible one-half mile loop has several entrances and exits. A trail map is provided below and at four other entry points. Please return it after use. These interpretive exhibits were provided by the Rob Reed and Lena Sharpe Memorial Foundation. Another sign along the trail is a brown, wooden directional sign with white text and arrows. The Moments in Time Trail travels left and right. To reach Storm King Ranger Station and Marymere Falls, travel left, and Lake Crescent Lodge is to the right.",

    "audioDescription": "North Fork Skokomish. Trailhead. Overview On the edge of the parking area is the trailhead for North Fork Skokomish River. To the left of the trailhead is a large brown wooden sign listing the names and distance in miles to locations along the trail. Text reads, North Fork Skokomish River. Rapids Bridge 1. Flapjack Lake Junction 4. Camp Pleasant 6.9. Nine Stream 10. First Divide 13.1. To the right of the trailhead, and behind large rocks lining the edge of the parking lot, are two tall kiosks with information about planning and preparing for your hike and how to protect the wilderness. To the right of the kiosks stands a bulletin board with additional information about park rules and regulations. Continue listening for a description of the kiosk panels and bulletin board information. 7 minutes. Beginning with the kiosk closest to the trail, a text header across the top in white and green lettering on a black background reads, Your First 3 Steps into Wilderness. The remainder of the panel is an image of a lake surrounded by a forest of tall, thin green pine trees, with brown, jagged mountain peaks in the distance. In the lake’s blue water is a reflection of the forest and mountains. Text across the middle of the image reads, When you enter the Olympic Wilderness, you’re in for a wild time. Six hundred miles of trails link you to sea and sky. Are you hiking the coast, crossing creeks through old-growth forest or ascending mile-high peaks? Whatever your destination, Your First 3 Steps into Wilderness can lead to success or disaster. Attentive trip planning and preparation will help protect you and the future of wilderness. Step 1. Plan, Step 2 Prepare, Step 3 Protect. The header on the second panel reads, Step 1. Plan. Below, are two columns of text. On the left is parkwide planning information. On the right, is planning information pertaining to Staircase. Text in the Parkwide column reads: Before your trip, contact the park’s Wilderness Information Center (WIC) for safety information, permits and regulations. Group size limit is 12. Leave your trip itinerary, including date of return, with someone who expects you back. Observe all regulations, including those that restrict pets, weapons and wheeled vehicles or devices. Safely secure all food, garbage and scented items 24 hours a day to protect yourself and wildlife. Contact the WIC for bear cannister loan locations. Text in the Staircase column reads: Protect vegetation and the value of solitude by observing limits on the number and size of camping parties at Flapjack Lakes. Contact the WIC for reservations and permits. Check local conditions before heading out. Even if it is spring in the Skokomish valley, higher elevations may still be snow covered, making route finding and travel difficult. Observe stock regulations that help protect you, your animals and the wilderness. Above 3,500 feet, stay on trails and only use designated stock camps. Pack non-viable pellets or rolled grain. Below the text, is a Trail Grade Profile illustrating the elevation for locations along the trails. The Wagonwheel Lake trail terminates at 4,000 feet. Flapjack Lakes are at 4,000 feet. The North Fork Skokomish River trail reaches almost 5,000 feet before terminating a bit above 4,000 feet. A map at the bottom shows the trail system in the Staircase area with the text, You Are Here. Three small photographs are inset into the map. The first, a red and black frog; next, purple spiked flowers; and last, a black, white, and orange butterfly with wings opened on a pink flower. Moving to the right, the second kiosk has two tall vertical panels. The header on the first panel reads, Step 2. Prepare. Below the header, text reads, Parkwide. Carry backcountry essentials including extra food, extra warm-when-wet clothing, topographic map, compass, flashlight and extra batteries, sunglasses and sunscreen, pocketknife, matches in waterproof container, candle or firestarter and first aid kit. Prepare for hazards of weather, terrain, water crossing and wildlife. Prevent hypothermia in cool, wet weather by wearing wool and synthetic layers, a warm hat and raingear. Boil, filter or chemically treat all drinking water to avoid infection by Giardia, a microscopic intestinal parasite. Staircase. Always check the weather forecast and prepare for the unexpected. Consult a ranger about snow and trail conditions prior to every outing. Rely on basic gear and skill, not electronics. Cell phones, GPS units and other electronic devices may not work, especially in lower valleys and forested areas. Wear sturdy, waterproof boots and gaiters. The trail can be muddy or rocky and rugged. In the center of the panel are three photographs, the first, a swollen stream of white rushing water, cascading over boulders through the center of a thick pine forest; the second, a heavy-set black bear with long snout, close-spaced eyes, and rounded ears, stands in the forest looking directly at the camera; the third, a plant, with dark veined green leaves and three bunches of red berries. The header on the second panel reads, Step 3. Protect. Below, text reads: Parkwide. Leave no trace of your stay. Think about how your actions impact wildlife, vegetation and visitors. Use established campsites. If hiking cross-country, camp on durable surfaces like rock and snow. Minimize use of campfires. Pack out everything you pack in. Properly dispose of human waste. Use privies where available or dig a 6 to 8-inch hole at least 200 feet from camps and water. Do not urinate in composting or vault toilets. Wash your dishes and yourself away from lakes and streams. To protect water quality, avoid using soap. Leave natural objects and cultural artifacts where you find them to help protect this irreplaceable wilderness. Staircase. Never feed wildlife for their health and your safety. Backpackers and day hikers should always keep food secured from wildlife. Protect vegetation. Observe restoration closures to allow plants to recover. Avoid walking on or disturbing plants, especially near trails, water or campsites. Use a stove to eliminate impacts of fires and wood gathering. Campfires are prohibited about 3,500 feet. If you build a fire at lower elevations, keep it small and use an existing fire ring. Gather, don’t cut, only small pieces of dead and down wood. Be sure your fire is out cold as winds can reignite embers. To the right and below the text are three photographs. A tall image of red, yellow, and pink wildflowers, some growing between grey rocks; next, a brown and white adult marmot, standing in profile with a dark grey young marmot standing behind it; and, a dark blue mountain lake with a flower-strewn meadow in the foreground, and snow peaked gray mountains in the background. To the right of the kiosks is a bulletin board with park regulations pertaining to campfires, trails, wilderness camping permits, wildlife, and marijuana; instructions for obtaining a wilderness camping permit; and how to pay your park entrance fee. Below the regulations are safety notices about backcountry safety; mountain goats and your safety; and your safety in cougar country. The last notice at the bottom explains the fishing regulations for North Fork Skokomish River in Olympic National Park. A final sign along the parking area marks the head of another trail. Text reads, Wagonwheel Lake. 2.9 miles. 3,200 feet vertical elevation gain. Very steep. No Pets allowed on the trail.",

Enter on the right front side beneath an open alcove. The door to the restroom is on the left. A metal garbage receptacle stands in front of the restroom on the left. On the left side of the parking lot are fenced stock corrals. At the top of the parking lot is the trailhead. Be advised: the trail varies in width, is rough and uneven, and in places, covered with rocks. To the left of trail is a roof covered bulletin board, and to the right, a tall interpretive panel. Text at the bottom of the panel reads: North Fork Trailhead. The north fork Quinault River-Low Divide Trail follows the river grade through a rain forest of Sitka spruce and moss-curtained bigleaf maple. The trail parallels several narrow canyons 200 to 300 feet above the stream. After crossing the river at Sixteen Mile (13.2), you begin a 4.6-mile climb to Low Divide (3600 feet). From there you can make side trips to Martins Park, Martins Lakes, or along the Skyline Trail towards Lake Beauty. Text continues: The Press Expedition. In 1890 the first explorers to cross the Olympic interior struggled six months to get here from Elwha River. Now, on a well-marked trail, you can hike their route in less than a week. Pack mules carried 1500 pounds of equipment for the five men: tent, blankets, ammunition for rifles, snowshoes, tools, flour, bacon, coffee and cooking pots. For food they depended mostly on game. To the left of the text is a black and white illustration showing five men, four standing and one kneeling, wearing wide brimmed hats, and long-sleeved shirts and pants. Four have facial hair. They each hold a rifle and look in different directions. In the center of the panel is a map with the text, You Are Here, and the trail marked with white dashes. Park boundaries, campgrounds, and other trails are marked on the map. At the top of the panel is a trail grade profile showing the trailhead elevation at 500-feet and ending at Low Divide where the elevation is 3600 feet. The bulletin board has posted information on both sides regarding trailhead burglaries; contact a park ranger or dial 911 in an emergency; bear and cougar awareness; day hikes at Quinault; backcountry safety; river crossings; wilderness regulations; stock use; pet regulations; firearms and weapons; fish advisory; fishing regulations, and how to help preserve your park. Up trail, a sign with the header, North Fork Quinault, provides mileage distance to nine locations along the trail. Wolf Bar 2.5, Halfway House 5.1, Elip Creek Junction 6.5, Trapper Shelter 8.1, Twelve Mile Shelter 11.5, Sixteen Mile 12.2, Skyline Trail Junction 15.7, Low Divide 16.1, and Whiskey Bend Road 44.3.",

    "audioDescription": "Hurricane Ridge Road Wayside Overlook. 4 minutes Along the front edge of the parking lot is a flat, gravel overlook area completely outlined by a six-inch-high concrete bumper. The landscape beyond the overlook begins with low tree covered hills and open areas with structures, then a wide expanse of water, with mountains in the distance on the opposite shore. On the left side of the gravel area are three wayside panels, each in a three-foot-tall, angled metal frame. The wayside on the extreme left is titled, Siege of Ice. Text reads: Only ice, sky, and a few jagged islands of rock – an ocean of ice filled the horizon. If there is valley fog, imagine it is ice, and you will have a picture of the continental glacier, grinding against the terrain. Glaciers were the prime architects of the scenery before you. But in this green landscape the only way to comprehend the extent of the ice is to examine the aftermath. A thousand feet above this spot the melting glacier dumped tons of rock and gravel debris. Only glaciers could have carved this valley’s steep walls. Filling the left side of the panel, a black and white drawing shows dark finger-like edges of mountains in a white landscape. A smaller image beneath the text shows three large rocks on white ground with a dark hill in the background. The caption reads: House-sized boulders lie scattered around the park, their crystals foreign to Olympic rock. Moving to the right, the next wayside is titled, Oh say can you see? Filling the top of this wide panel is an illustration of the landscape before you with various points of interest labeled and the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the center. From left to right, Victoria, Canada, Mt. Douglas, Haro Strait, Discovery Island, San Juan Islands, American Camp, San Juan Island National Historic Park, Bellingham Washington, Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge, Mt. Baker 10,778 feet, Sequim, Washington, Protection Island, North Cascades National Park, Puget Sound, and Glacier Peak. Text below reads: In clear weather you can see Canada and the volcanic peaks of the Cascade Mountains. Visibility here is becoming increasingly impaired, however, by pollutants from sources including industry, wood stoves, and the automobiles we drive. A quote by Thoreau reads: Simply to see a distant horizon through clean air is wealth enough for one afternoon. The final wayside on the right is titled, Rainshadow. Text reads: Farmland to the northeast must be irrigated. Less than 20 inches of rain falls there annually. Behind you only 40 miles to the west grows a dense rainforest, a dripping jungle of ferns and giant spruce in a Jack-in-the-beanstalk environment nurtured by 140 to 180 inches of rainfall per year. Mountains cast the shadow. Saturated Pacific winds rise steeply up the coastal slopes. As sudden altitude cools and condenses the air, most of the moisture is wrung out over the peaks by the time clouds reach this corner of the peninsula. Filling the left side of the panel is a drawing of a snow-capped mountain with clouds overhead, one cloud dropping lines of blue rain on the left side of the mountain. A white arrow in the rain points up slope. A smaller image to the right captioned, Rain forest, shows tree branches covered with draping moss.",

    "audioDescription": "Obstruction Point Trailhead. Overview. 1 minute Off the parking area is an all gender, accessible, single stall restroom with a vault toilet. At the trailhead, a brown and white sign reads, Obstruction Point. Elevation 6100 feet. Listed below are destinations along the trails that branch off from here with mileage to each. Beside an upward pointing arrow are Badger Valley, .3 miles and Deer Park, 7.5 miles. Beside a right pointing arrow are Grand Lake, 3.7 miles, Moose Lake, 4.2 miles, and Grand Pass, 5.9 miles. Attached to the leg of this sign is a smaller sign that reads, No Pets, Weapons, or Vehicles. To the right of this sign is a tall bulletin board with changing park information. Behind the bulletin board are three, three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panels standing side-by-side providing information about the Olympic Wilderness, Obstruction Point Trail, and Backcountry Tactics. Continue listening for a description of each panel. 5 minutes Beginning with the wayside on the left, text at the top left corner reads, Olympic Wilderness. Local tribal people have visited the Olympic Mountains for centuries. Today wilderness use has increased so much that long-lasting impacts are occurring in this fragile environment. Text at the bottom right corner reads, Subalpine plants have adapted to wind, cold, and thin soil, but not to human use. Help protect Olympic’s wilderness character. Camp in established campsites or on bare ground. Travel on trails or trample-resistant surfaces. Bury human waste away from streams and lakes. Use a backpacking stove. Build small campfires only where allowed. Pack out all trash. Leave what you find for others to enjoy. In wilderness you may find unspoiled scenery, solitude and adventure. Be prepared to accept wilderness on its own terms. Four illustrations are spread across this panel. From left to right, a green and black dome tent sits atop smooth ground near an outcropping of rocks. The caption reads, Place tents on established campsites. Next, a booted, human foot, steps on grass with the caption, Travel on trails wherever possible. Then, a plastic, six-ring drink can holder and a blue, plastic cup laying on its side have the caption, Carry out all trash. The final illustration shows a jumbled, rock, fire ring on the ground surrounded by grass. Inset, is a small broad-based blue container with a thin neck and a single stove burner attached to the top of the neck. The caption reads: Use backpacking stoves to reduce impact. The second wayside panel has the header, Obstruction Point Trailhead. Filling the left side of the panel is a green map with trails marked in black dashed lines and the text, You Are Here, indicating your current location on the map. Filling the right side of the panel under the header text, reads: Deer Park Trail. This trail, one of the highest in the park, follows an open ridgetop all the way to Deer Park, 7.4 miles. From Elk Mountain near Obstruction Point there are good views of Mount Olympus. Badger Valley Trail. The trail traverses northeast .2 miles, then descends steeply through Badger Valley to Grand Valley. Grand Lake is .2 miles below the junction of the Badger Valley, Lillian Ridge, and Grand Pass Trails. Moose Lake is almost a mile from Grand Lake. From Gladys Lake to the pass is a steep climb for over a mile. Lillian Ridge Trail. For a steep but shorter route back to Obstruction Point from Grand Valley, climb 1200 feet in less than 2 miles to Lillian Ridge and follow the ridge 2 miles to Obstruction Point. Isolated Plants. Certain vegetation grows here and nowhere else. With no relatives among their lowland neighbors, some upland plants more closely resemble arctic species. The Ice Age ferried around a variety of seeds, and apparently some tundra plants found these mountaintops a familiar, favorable place to take root. Isolated from civilization, and from the common plant community, the Olympic Mountains were islanded by glaciers. Inset, is a black and white drawing of small plants, two with long stems topped by a bushy, oblong spike of leaves, and others, low lying, with five petals around a dark center. The header on the third wayside panel reads, Backcountry Tactics followed by the text, From this point on, meet the wilderness on its own terms. The weather can change swiftly, dramatically. Hypothermia, a sudden drop in body temperature, is a threat even in summer. Bring layers of clothing: wool shirt and sweater, wind and water-repellent shell or parka. If you plan to cross any high passes, carry an ice axe and know how to use it. Snow remains late and the trail can ice up. Travelers to Grand Valley who are caught by early autumn snow should stay in the valley until the storm passes. During blizzards people have died trying to hike out via Lillian Ridge. Below the text, a black and white drawing shows a person laying on their stomach dressed in winter clothing, holding a T-shaped ice ax. The head of the ax is square on one end and pointed on the other and is perpendicular to the shaft which is approximately 20-inches long. The base of the shaft ends in a spike. The illustration is captioned, Ice Ax, and depicts a person stopping their fall on an icy slope by pressing the head of the ax into the ice. To the left of the text, are four sequential drawings of a man in different stages of dress to illustrate how to layer winter clothing. First, the man wears white long underwear with long sleeves and long pants. Second, a blue hat, red and black checkered shirt, pants, and knee-high boots have been added. Third, a puffy, blue, zipped vest has been put on. Fourth, the man is shown wearing a green parka with a white, fur-rimmed hood and yellow gloves over top all the layers.",

    "bodyText": "<p>A short hike through coastal forest reveals spectacular Ruby Beach. Its dramatic sea stacks and tide pools make Ruby Beach a favorite among the many beautiful beaches of the Olympic Coast.<br /> <br />  </p> <hr /> <h4>Full Accessibility Description</h4> <strong>Length:</strong> Viewing area adjacent to parking area; beach access 735 feet<br /> <strong>Surface Type:</strong> Compacted gravel<br /> <strong>Typical Trail Width:</strong> 4-5 feet<br /> <strong>Typical Running Slope:</strong> Numerous drain dips that create steep cross slopes<br /> <strong>Typical Cross Slope:</strong> Mostly under 1%, though sections have a significant crown (higher in the middle than on the edges)<br /> <strong>Description: </strong>Ruby Beach is the northernmost beach access point in the Kalaloch Area. All of the beach access trails at Kalaloch descend from the top of the bluff to the beach. They are generally steep and constructed to weather the 8.5 feet of annual rainfall. Winter ocean swells typically rearrange the beach logs at each location, so conditions at the point where the trail reaches the beach are constantly subject to change.<br /> <br /> The Ruby Beach parking area is a sloped gravel lot with two vault toilets in the center. There is an accessible viewing area overlooking the ocean on the north end of the parking area, with a lower section of rail for wheelchair users on the left-hand side. Vegetation may obscure the view at sitting height.<br /> <br /> The Ruby Beach trail is the only beach access wide enough for a wheelchair to reach the beach. Be advised that the trail is steep, has multiple drain dips and there is a drain across the trail at the halfway point that is 3-6 inches deep. The trail starts on the west side of the overlook and runs approximately 300 feet downhill at 10-20% to the first switchback, which is wide and has a trailside bench. There are 3 drain dips in the top of this section placed 50 feet apart. Continuing downhill at grades of 8-16%, there is an angled drain dip 50 feet below the switchback that forms steep cross slopes, and a wood cross drain at 365 feet that creates a 12-inch wide, 3-6-inch drop. The grade remains steep at 7-16% until 510 feet, where it drops below 5% for the remainder of the trail. There is a spur access to the beach at 575 feet. At 675 feet, the trail narrows to 3 feet before ending at the beach at 735 feet.",
    "audioDescription": "Ruby Beach Trailhead. 1 minute Situated on a grass and gravel island on the right side of the circular parking lot is a brown, all gender accessible restroom building with vault toilets. The building front faces the parking lot. There are two restrooms, one door on the right and one on the left. The trailhead is located on the opposite side of the parking lot. On the right, before the trail enters the woods is a roof covered bulletin board with park information and regulations. Topics include: Marine debris; Beach Regulations regarding pets; resource preservation; Coastal safety regarding beach logs, slick footing, tides and headlands, sneaker waves, and rip currents; Beach fires; Tide charts; Ranger programs at Kalaloch; contact a ranger or dial 911 in an emergency; where to find the nearest services; traveling in cougar country; fishing; and that it is illegal to remove animals or plants found in the surf, on the beach, or in tidepools. To the left of the bulletin board is a brown lidded box on a post with trail brochures.",

At the far end of the gravel area is a brown, metal trash bin and an all gender, single stall, accessible restroom building with a vault toilet. Enter on the left front side of the building beneath an open alcove. The door to the restroom is on the right. Behind the gravel area is a forest of tall pine trees and an understory of low growing plants where a flat trail enters the woods. A brown wooden sign at the trailheads reads, No fishing in this area. A posted flyer attached to the sign reads: Fishing Regulations for Sol Duc River (main stem, North Fork, tributaries). Season: Open June 1 to October 31. Note: Area closed to fishing 100 yards upstream and 250 yards downstream at the Salmon Cascades. License: Not required. A Washington State catch record care is REQUIRED (bolded) to fish for salmon or steelhead, which must be accounted for as if caught in State waters. Catch and release: Except, anglers may retain 2 adipose clipped hatchery steelhead. Legal gear: Freshwater fishing is restricted to artificial lure with a single point, barbless hook. No bait is allowed. Fishing may only be conducted with a single rod, reel and line that is under immediate control. Only knotless nets may be used to land fish. Please report any violators to 360-565-3115 or contact a Park Ranger.

    "audioDescription": "Salmon Cascade Overlook. 3 minutes Be advised, tree roots and rocks protrude onto the trail surface in places. At the end of the trail is a wooden platform overlooking the cascades. The left side railing and one-half of the front railing on the left are about four feet high. The remainder of the front railing and the right side are lower, about three feet high. Upstream is to the left, where flat, dark green water flowing from left to right, soon meets rocks of many sizes becoming frothy white as it cascades over dark brown boulders and rocks of various sizes. Changes in creek bed elevation from high to low create a series of water falls until finally downstream, the water flattens out again. The light brown rocks lining the river are rough in texture and covered in places with green moss. On the far riverbank, small deciduous trees with white bark stand in front of a dense forest of green pine trees. Just before the platform on the left side of the trail, is a three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panel titled, Leaps of a Lifetime. Filling the panel’s background is a color cutaway illustration of a creek, two-thirds underwater and one third above. Underwater in the foreground, three salmon swim in shallow water above a gravelly creek bottom. One has bright red sides with a green and black spotted back, a hook nose that overhangs its mouth, a fin on its back and three fins on its belly. The other two salmon are greener with black spots and have pointed noses. In the near background, red and green salmon swim above a deep pool, and in the far background, two salmon leap out of the water at the base of a waterfall on their journey upstream. Text at the top left reads: Strength, endurance, instinct - how do tools of survival guide you through life’s challenges? Watch these powerful forces at work as coho salmon leap 11 feet up Salmon Cascades. Born in gravelly river beds above the cascades, thousands of juvenile coho salmon memorize river scents on their 70 mile swim to sea. For up to two years coho range hundreds of miles from Oregon to British Columbia. Ocean temperatures and salinity, angle of the sun and magnetic fields help guide them back to the Sol Duc River. These unique summer Coho enter the river in July when water levels are low and they can navigate the cascades. By recalling river scents, about 1,000 coho return to their birthplace from late summer to early fall. When they spawn and die, coho salmon bring new life. Their marine nutrients benefit forests and over 130 wildlife species. A caption in the bottom right corner reads: Do coho salmon share all their secrets of survival? Sometimes, when nature envelops us with wonder, and we are left with more curiosities than conclusions.",

    "audioDescription": "Shi Shi Beach Trailhead. Overview. 2 minutes At the entrance to the gravel parking lot, a brown and white sign reads, Shi Shi Trail Day Use Parking. Overnighters use secure venues Back .6 miles. Beyond the sign on the left is a square, gray cinderblock restroom with two brown doors that face the parking lot. The women’s room is on the left. The men’s room is on the right. In front of the doors is a three-foot-wide concrete pad with a five-inch step up. At the far end of the lot the trail enters a dense forest of tall trees. At the trailhead, a brown and white sign on the left reads, Notice. Pets, Weapons, Vehicles, and Bicycles prohibited beyond boundary of Olympic National Park 1.7 miles ahead. On the right is a sign with information about oil spill funds protecting old growth forest. About ten feet further on the right stands a covered bulletin board, its frame constructed of thick logs. Posted material includes in-depth information about the trail and the National Marine Sanctuary. Continue listening for full text of the posted information. 7 minutes. A white sign with black text reads, Oil Spill Funds Protect Old Growth Forest. In the forest behind this sign lies the Anderson Point Property, approximately 277 acres of coastal forest protected in 2006 for the benefit of a threatened seabird, the marbled murrelet. The area was set aside to ensure 200 years of protection for marbled murrelet nesting habitat as a restoration action funded by the Natural Resource Damage Assessment and Restoration Settlement. This protection was made possible through an agreement between the Makah Indian Tribe and the Tenyo Maru Natural Resource Trustees who worked to restore natural resources injured in the 1991 Tenyo Maru oil spill. Marbled murrelets are robin-sized seabirds that are protected by the State of Washington and the Federal Endangered Species Act. Marbled murrelets feed on small fish and fly inland to nest on large branches of mature conifers. One of the primary documented reasons for the decline of this seabird is the loss of nesting habitat: old growth and mature forests. Scientists estimate that 7 to 11 percent of the marbled murrelet population along Washington’s outer coast may have been killed in the 1991 Tenyo Maru oil spill. The agreement ensures that this area will be managed by the Makah Indian Tribe and excluded from their commercial land base, protecting it from commercial timber harvest and other land use activities. On the bulletin board are three posters. From left to right they read, Welcome to the Makah Tribe’s Shi Shi Beach Trail. This trail is 2 miles long and requires moderate exertion. Beach access in Olympic National Park is by steep trail. For your safety and enjoyment, please respect our few rules. This area is Makah Wilderness, don’t remove any flowers or foliage and don’t harass wildlife or take any shells or shellfish. Stay on designated trails and walkways. The sea cliffs and unmarked trails are dangerous. Supervise children closely. Don’t build fires or camp overnight anywhere on the trail. Overnight campers must obtain a backcountry permit through Olympic National Park. Pack out what you pack in. Consult tide charts for the area to guard against high tide accidents. Areas beyond Shi Shi Beach are impassable at high tide. Report vandalism to Makah Tribal law enforcement. Generations of Makah people have used this area. If you are patient and respectful, its enduring beauty will enrich and teach you too. A graphic in the right bottom corner shows a red and black bird with outstretched wings standing on the back of a black whale. The next poster reads, Welcome to Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. In July 1991, the Japanese fishing vessel, Tenyo Maru and the Chinese freighter, Tuo Hai collided in heavy fog northwest of Cape Flattery, Washington. The Tenyo Maru sank immediately, releasing 475,000 gallons of oil and fuel that killed thousands of seabirds. This education panel was funded by the Tenyo Maru Natural Resource Trustees as one of a number of restoration projects designed to educate the public and to restore natural resources injured by the oil spill. The Trustees include the US Department of the Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Makah Indian Tribe, and the State of Washington. An underwater photograph shows sunlight penetrating through green-hued water with long ribbons of kelp. Text reads, The Kelp Forests. Swaying fronds of kelp for a critical new sure habitat. Each plant may reach 70 feet in length their leaf light blades fan out across the water, providing shade in hiding places for fish and invertebrates. Look closely for sea otters eating or resting among the dense canopy of kelp just offshore in Olympic coast national Marine sanctuary. A photograph shows many birds with black heads and backs and white chests standing on the top of a rock ledge. Text reads, Murres at Risk. Common murres, the black and white seabirds seen along the coast, are signs of a healthy marine ecosystem. Murres use their wings to fly underwater in pursuit of small fish. They breed on remote islands or inaccessible cliffs, where they are protected from most predators. The young leave the nest before they can actually fly, leaping recklessly into the ocean to be raised at sea by their fathers. Because they spend so much time at sea, common murres are especially vulnerable to oil spills. Changing ocean conditions, entanglement in fishing nets, and low flying aircraft have also harmed the Washington breeding population, which has declined significantly over the last few decades. A final photograph is an aerial view of a large ship on the ocean. Text reads, Safer Maritime Shipping. The Makah Tribe and Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary sit at the entrance to one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. Over 13,000 vessels pass here each year, carrying large amounts of fuel oil. Collisions or groundings threaten wildlife, fish and shellfish, their habitats, historic and cultural sites and the scenic beauty of this area. Federal, tribal and state agencies and the shipping industry work together to prevent oil spills. Larger vessels observe and Area-To-Be-Avoided, a buffer zone designed to keep ships away from especially sensitive and dangerous areas near Cape Flattery. The final poster has a topographic map of the west coast of Washington State along the right edge. At the top is the Strait of Juan de Fuca and labels along the coast from north to south mark specific management areas. Text reads, nearby coastal waters are part of Olympic National Marine Sanctuary, a 3300 square mile protected area administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This area was designated in 1994 in recognition of its rugged character, rich marine life and vulnerable nature. Together with this landowner and other state, federal and tribal organizations, Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary protects marine resource supports, important scientific research and promotes compatible use and enjoyment of these resources. To enjoy your visit fully, remember the following. Don’t get trapped by the tide. Coastal headlands, stream crossings and sandy beaches can be treacherous. The water is cold and currents are strong. Hypothermia can kill within minutes. Beach logs are unstable. Don’t build fires among driftlogs. Avoid beached marine mammals. Dead or sick animals can past disease to humans. Injured animals can bight. Solitary seal pups are not orphans. Report beached marine mammals to the nearest ranger station or call 360-457-6622. Do not harass wildlife.

A smaller sign in the top right corner reads, U.S. Fee Area. To the left of the sign are three upright log posts. Attached to one is the National Park Service arrowhead logo atop a larger white arrowhead shaped base. The logo itself is shaped like an arrowhead with a scalloped edge, pointed at the bottom, with sides that widen out toward the top, before curving slightly inward, then flaring out to create a rounded top. The arrowhead is brown with etched words and images. On the right side are the words, National Park Service, in white letters. To the left, in green, a tall tree towers above smaller trees and the ground below and a section of lake in white. Behind the tree, a white outline of snowcapped mountains. Below the trees, text in white reads, Department of the Interior, and below this, is a green outline of a bison in profile facing left with a large head and shoulders and smaller hind area.",

The trail to the falls is uneven in spots from protruding rocks and tree roots, and in some areas, there are log, stone, and concrete steps. A wooden bridge with side rails crosses the falls. Upriver is on the left. In the distance, frothy white-water flows over rocks toward the bridge through a forest of green pine trees and yellow-green foliage growing along the riverbanks. Near the bridge, two boulders at the top of a rocky ledge, separate the river into three fingers of water that cascade over the edge of a steep gorge to the river below. Downriver, on the right, the narrow, deep gorge with its sides covered in lush green moss, ferns and other leafy plants, opens up a bit wider as the clear water flattens out briefly before another section of cascades begins. Along the steep banks are tall rock faces and above, a dense forest of green pines. Continuing across the bridge, the trail turns left. Railings span the river side of the trail. A bench is on the right. Then, as the trail slightly ascends, a series of uneven concrete steps and an uneven, rocky step section leads to an area that overlooks a section of the river. A bench is located on the right. This is the end of the trail. Traveling back over the bridge to the main trail, a brown wooden directional sign at the end of the bridge indicates that Seven Lakes Basin Loop Trail, Deer Lake, and Lover’s Lane are to the right and Sol Duc Falls Campground is to the left.",

    "audioDescription": "Sol Duc Falls Trailhead. Overview. 2 minutes Be advised, the trail surface may be uneven with tripping hazards of rocks and tree roots. In places, log steps span the width of the trail. Parking for the trailhead is along the entrance road that loops around a grassy picnic area with tables. An accessible restroom with vault toilets is located on the edge of the roadway before the road begins to loop. The women’s single stall restroom is on the left, and the men’s single stall restroom is on the right. The trailhead is at the top of the loop. Trash and recycling bins are located here on the right. On the right and left sides of the trailhead are roof covered kiosks with information about planning and preparing for your hike and how to protect the wilderness. Continue listening for a description of the kiosk panels. 7 minutes. Beginning with the kiosk on the left and the panel on the left, a text header across the top has white and green lettering on a black background that reads, Your first 3 steps into Wilderness. The remainder of the panel is an image of a meadow with pink flowers in the foreground and layers of snowcapped mountains in the background. In the bottom left corner, text in a tan graphic overlay, reads: When you enter the Olympic Wilderness, you’re in for a wild time. Six hundred miles of trails link you to sea and sky. Are you hiking the coast, crossing creeks through old-growth forest or ascending mile-high peaks? Whatever your destination, Your First 3 Steps into Wilderness can lead to success or disaster. Attentive trip planning and preparation will help protect you and the future of wilderness. Step 1. Plan. Step 2 Prepare. Step 3 Protect The header on the second panel reads, Step 1. Plan. Below, are two columns of text. On the left is parkwide planning information. On the right, is planning information pertaining to Sol Duc. Text in the Parkwide column reads: Before your trip, contact the park’s Wilderness Information Center or area ranger station for safety information, permits and regulations. Limit your group size to twelve. Leave your trip itinerary, including date of return, with someone who expects you back. Observe all regulations that restrict pets, weapons, and wheeled vehicles and devices. Store edibles, garbage and scented items in hard-sided food containers 24 hours a day to protect yourself and wildlife. To their detriment, wild animals can become accustomed to human food. Text in the Sol Duc column reads: To protect fragile vegetation and the value of solitude, quotas restrict number and size of camping parties in this area. Contact the Wilderness Information Center for reservations and permits. Carry a topographic map and compass and know how to use them. Snow is common at higher elevations through midsummer. Use good route-finding and personal safety skills. Stock regulations help protect you, your animals and the wilderness. Above 3500 feet, stay on trails and only use designated stock camps. Pack non-viable pellets or rolled grain. Observe all other regulations. Below the text, is a Trail Grade Profile illustrating the elevation for locations along the Sol Duc trail. Sol Duc Falls is at 2,000 feet, Heart Lake is a bit below 5,000 feet, and High Divide is a bit above 5,000 feet. A map at the bottom shows the trail system in the Sol Duc area with the text, You Are Here. Three small photographs are inset into the map. The first, an orange lily with black spots, then a brown fawn with white spots lays on rocky ground surrounded by green plants, and a high mountain view with tall green pine trees and mountain peaks in the distance. Moving to the second kiosk on the right side of the trail, the header on the first panel reads, Step 2. Prepare. In the center of the panel is an image of white water flowing down a rocky streambed. Above the image, text reads: Parkwide. Carry backcountry essentials including extra food, extra warm-when-wet clothing, topographic map, compass, flashlight and extra batteries, sunglasses and sunscreen, pocketknife, matches in waterproof container, candle or Firestarter and first aid kit. Prepare for hazards of weather, terrain, water crossing and wildlife. Prevent hypothermia in cool, wet weather by wearing wool and synthetic layers, a warm hat and rain gear. Boil, filter or chemically treat all drinking water to avoid infection by Giardia, a microscopic intestinal parasite. Below the image, text reads: Sol Duc. Always check the weather forecast to help you prepare for the unexpected. Check with a ranger for snow and trail conditions prior to every outing. Electronics should not replace basic gear and skill. Cell phones, GPS units and other electronic devices might not work, especially in lower valleys and forested areas. Repackage food prior to your trip to reduce pack weight and litter, and to lessen the risk of problems with animals. The header on the second panel reads, Step 3. Protect. Below, an image of a meadow with red flowers, a blue mountain lake, and mountains in the distance fills one third of the panel on the right. On the left, black text on a tan background, reads: Parkwide. Leave no trace of your stay. Think about how your actions impact wildlife, vegetation and visitors. Use established campsites along the trail system. If hiking cross-country, camp on durable surfaces. Observe revegetation closures to protect plants. Minimize use of fire. Pack out everything you pack in. Properly dispose of human waste. Use privies where available or dig catholes at least 200 feet from campsites and water. Do not urinate in composting or vault toilets. Wash your dishes and yourself away from water sources. Use small amounts of biodegradable soap or none at all. Leave natural objects and cultural artifacts where are you find them to help protect this irreplaceable wilderness. Below the text are two photographs, one, a photograph of a black bear eating berries in a meadow, and a close up of a blue berry hanging from red leaves. Text continues: Sol Duc. Never feed wildlife for their health and your safety. Day hikers should keep their food within reach and secure from wildlife. Protect vegetation. Avoid walking on or disturbing plants, especially near trails, water or campsites. Minimize your space by sharing tents. Use a few big tents, not many small ones. Use a stove to eliminate impacts of fire and wood gathering. Campfires are not permitted above 3500 feet in elevation. If you build a fire at lower elevations, keep it small and use an existing fire ring. Gather, don’t cut, only small pieces of wood. Be sure your fire is out cold as winds can reignite fires. Up trail from the kiosks on the right is a bulletin board with park information pertaining to Wilderness regulations, Stock use in the Sol Duc Area, ways to tread lightly, backcountry safety, Day Hikes at Sol Duc, Pet Regulations, fishing regulations, and hypothermia. Other notices include alerts about cougars, mountain goats, and bears in the area; what to do in an emergency, contact a ranger or dial 911; an alert that thefts have occurred in the area; and the nearest services. In the center of the bulletin board is a map of the area. Beyond the bulletin board along the trail are three brown wooden signs with text in white. The first sign, on the left reads: Soleduck Trail. Soleduck Falls one-eighth mile. Deer Lake 4 miles. Lunch Lake via Deer Lake 8 miles, Soleduck Park via Soleduck River Trail 8 miles. The second sign on the right reads: No pets, weapons, or vehicles. The third sign on the right reads: Wilderness camping permits and bear cannisters required for all overnight trips.",

It is a loop trail that starts and ends on the Beach 1 Trail. There are parking pullouts on both the east and west side of the highway for Beach 1.

All grades on this hike are under 5%. Proceed up the Beach 1 Trail for 115 feet. There is a sign for the Spruce Burl Trail at the intersection. Turn right to follow the trail. At 445 feet, there is a short, narrow bridge. On the ocean (west) side of the loop, grasses and berry vines often grow densely along the trail. There are also numerous roots crossing the trail, some on the west side 8-10 inches. At 565 feet, the trail meets the Beach 1 Trail. Turn left to return to the parking area.

The burls are spherical woody growths, some small and growing alone, and some larger and growing in masses. Tree bark covers the burls. On the left, a 10-foot-long spur off the trail leads to the intertwined roots of two spruce trees where you can feel the roundness and rough bark of several burls growing on the roots.",

A spur trail leads to a huge fallen cedar.<br /> <br /> This trailhead also accesses the Four Stream and Shady Lane Trails, described below.<br /> <br />  </p> <hr />  <h4>Full Accessibility Description</h4> <h4><strong>Four Stream Trail</strong></h4> <p><strong>Length:</strong> 1,645 feet, .31 miles<br /> <strong>Surface Type:</strong> Compacted gravel<br /> <strong>Typical Trail Width:</strong> 6-8 feet<br /> <strong>Typical Running Slope:</strong> Under 5%, except the last 200 feet which has some brief steep sections up to 16%<br /> <strong>Typical Cross Slope:</strong> Less than 2%, trail is crowned (higher in the middle than on the edges)<br /> <strong>Elevation Gain/Loss:</strong> Less than 25 feet<br /> <strong>Accessible Parking:</strong> Van-accessible parking along parking area.<br /> <strong>Description: </strong>The accessible portion of the Four Stream Trail runs along the southern bank of the Skokomish River, and ends at a river overlook at 1,645 feet. The trail narrows and continues beyond that point. The Staircase parking area by the ranger station has one accessible parking spot at the west end of the parking lot. Cross the bridge over the Skokomish River. The trailhead sign will be visible from the west end of the bridge. From the trailhead sign, the 8-foot-wide compacted gravel trail dips down and back up in the first 140 feet, in which 2 sections under 20 feet reach 8% grade. From here, the trail continues at grades under 5%. At 690 feet, there is an intersection with the Big Cedar Trail.<br /> <br /> Continuing forward to the right, passing a pullout with a view of the river at 910 feet. At this point, the trail narrows to 6 feet. At 930 feet there is a 50-foot stretch at 6 to 8% grade. The trail continues at under 5% grade with another pullout at 1,150 feet before rising to another river overlook. From 1,360 to 1,390 feet the grade varies from 8-10%, increasing to a max of 16% for 25 feet. Beyond this is a gentler section with grades of 7-15% from 1,450 to 1,490 feet. After twenty feet under 6%, there is a final steep section from 7-11% from 1,510 feet to 1,525 feet. The grade is under 5% for the final approach to the overlook which is at 1,645 feet.<br /> <br />  </p> <h4><strong>Shady Lane</strong></h4> <p><strong>Length:</strong> 4,410 feet, .84 miles (trailhead at end of bridge to Four Stream Road trailhead)<br /> <strong>Surface Type:</strong> Compacted gravel<br /> <strong>Typical Trail Width:</strong> 2 feet<br /> <strong>Typical Running Slope:</strong> First quarter of trail is rugged with numerous very steep sections 20-40% grade. From 1,050 to 3,940 feet mainly under 6% grade with occasional steep section 12-17%. Final 500 feet starts with an 85-foot section at 30-35% grade and is then mostly under 6% grade with a few 10-foot sections at 15% grade<br /> <strong>Typical Cross Slope:</strong> Less than 2%, trail is crowned (higher in the middle than on the edges)<br /> <strong>Accessible Parking:</strong> Van-accessible parking along parking area<br /> <strong>Description: </strong>From the Staircase parking area, across the bridge over the Skokomish River, the trailhead is identified by a sign on the left-hand side at the far end of the bridge. The next 310 feet of the trail is compacted gravel 3 feet wide. The first 20 feet of this stretch of trail descends from the bridge at a steep 16% grade, decreasing to 8% to 50 feet, and then leveling out to less than 5% grade to 310 feet. The tread then becomes quite rocky to 430 feet, with cross slopes up to 4%.<br /> <br /> At 425 feet, there is a steep informal trail down to the river’s edge. At 430 feet, 2 steps lead up to a 2-foot wide, 40-foot-long bridge. The trail width remains at 2 feet for the remainder of the trail. From the end of the bridge to 1,050 feet, the trail follows the contours of the river along a steep slope that has been impacted by several slides. There is a short spur trail to an old mine shaft on the far side of the bridge.<br /> <br /> The trail continues to the left, proceeding downhill at grades up to 10% to 500 feet. A water bar runs across the trail at 515 feet before the trail begins uphill to cross the slide area. From 555 feet to 570 feet, there is a rugged stone staircase with 6 steps. The trail continues downhill again at grades up to 18% to a 25-foot level section that is held in place by a large log. Beyond the log, the trail climbs uphill at 10% and then steepens to 20% grades with 2 stone steps in the middle from 675 feet to 695 feet before again going downhill at 14-20% to 765 feet. Going uphill again at 10% from 765 to 790 feet, the trail reaches a second bridge, 25-feet long. Beyond the bridge, the trail runs downhill with sections of exposure to a 15-foot drop on the river side, before dropping steeply through a section of bedrock from 830 to 855 feet.<br /> <br /> The next section continues downhill at 20% grade with many roots in the trail from 875 feet to 900 feet. From 900 to 935 feet, the climb increases to 40% grade before becoming more gradual to 985 feet and switching again to downhill at 20% grade to 1,050 feet. From this point on, the trail enters the forest. There continue to be steep sections and periodic roots and rocks in the trail, but they are interspersed with long gentle sections under 6% grade that weave between impressive old-growth cedar trees.<br /> <br /> From 1,050 to 1,830 feet, the trail meanders through the woods at grades under 6%. At 1,830 feet, there is a 15-foot downhill at 17% followed by a brief uphill around a large fallen tree. At this point, the trail fluctuates downhill at up to 17% grade to 1,975 feet, followed by gentler downhill under 7% grade to 2,220 feet. From 2,220 to 2,535 feet, alternating gentle ups and downs in the trail under 6% lead to a root-heavy downhill at 14% for 25 feet. Beginning uphill again, gentle grades run to 2,695 feet at 9% before beginning downhill again. The next stretch of trail covers grades under 6% to 3,710 feet, and one 12% from 2,775 to 2,815 feet.<br /> <br /> There is an intersection with an unofficial trail to the river at 3,710 feet. This is a good point to turn around, if returning to the Staircase parking area, as the remainder of the trail is a climb up to the Four Stream Road trailhead. If continuing, proceed to the right from the intersection. From 3,940 to 4,025 feet there is a very steep 30-35% climb. The remainder of the hike is uphill at gentle grades, interspersed with a few 10-foot sections at 15%. Arrive at Four Stream Road at 4,410 feet.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Staircase Trailhead. 2 minutes The trailhead is located across a concrete bridge with side rails near the parking lot. Be advised. There is a two-inch high metal lip across the front surface of the bridge. A sign at the end of the bridge on the left reads: Staircase Rapids with an upward pointing arrow, and Shady Lane with a left pointing arrow. Underneath, a second sign reads, No Pets. Along the flat gravel trail on the right is a brown covered box holding trail brochures. A sign on the lid reads: Welcome. We hope you enjoy exploring Olympic National Park. Donations for these trail brochures are accepted at park visitor centers. Thank you for your support. The sign ends with this quote by John Muir: In every walk with Nature one receives far more than he seeks. Further up trail on the right is a tall informational sign with a map of the trail system marked in white lines. Above the map is a trail profile illustrating the elevation gain for three trails. Below these images, text reads: Staircase Trailhead. The main up-valley trail follows the North Fork Skokomish River Valley, climbing through lowland, montane and subalpine forests. Side trails lead to mountain ridges, lakes and scenic vistas. The first mile of this trail shares one leg of the 1.9 mile Staircase Rapids Loop Trail. Text continues: Evolving Wilderness. On the way to Staircase you have passed logged-over land and man-made lake Cushman, dammed to harness hydroelectric power. The Olympic interior was unexplored until 1889. Lieutenant Joseph O’Neil, leader of an 1890 expedition, brought infantrymen and pack mules up this valley on his way to map and survey a swath across the peninsula. A few settlers and miners later tried to extract a living from the steep canyons and rugged peaks. Since 1938 the National Park Service has been charged with preserving the Olympic backcountry. To the left of the text is a drawing of Lieutenant O’Neil with mustache and beard, standing on a slope wearing a blue, short-brimmed square hat and a blue uniform jacket with several medals pinned on his chest. He holds a pair of binoculars. To the left of the Lieutenant in the distance, are the three human figures traversing the snowy slope. In the far distance are pine trees and a snowy mountain ridge under a blue sky.",

Outside the corral is a six-foot-high bulletin board with informational about wilderness regulations, backcountry safety, stock use in the Quinault area, and wildlife, food, and your safety. On the far right is a hitching post. Text on each notice, reads: Wilderness Regulations. Wilderness Camping Permit is required for overnight stays in the backcountry. Food, garbage and scented items must be stored away from wildlife at all times. Campfires are prohibited above 3500 feet elevation. Pets are not allowed on trails, beaches, and in the wilderness. Weapons, bicycles and vehicles are prohibited in the backcountry Backcountry Safety. Plan your trip and know you limits. Tell someone where you are going and when you will return. Be aware of the weather. Carry the 10 essentials which are food, water, extra clothes including rain gear, knife, flashlight, and batteries, first aid kit, map, compass, fire starter and matches, sunscreen and sunglasses. Stock Use in the Quinault Area. Ride only on trails designated for stock use. Wilderness Camping Permit is required for overnight stays in the backcountry. Food, garbage, and scented items must be stored away from wildlife at all times. Tying stock to a single tree for more than one hour is prohibited. For long stays, hitch racks and lines must be at least 200 feet from water. Feed must not contain viable seeds. Grazing is permitted with one-quarter mile of stock camps. Wildlife, Food and Your Safety. Many animals, including bears, rodents, birds, deer, elk and racoons can become habituated to humans. Often that are attracted by food. This leads to unnatural tameness, unpredictable aggression, and other safety and health concerns. These changes in behavior may result in area closures or the death of the animal. Keep your distance. Stay at least 50 yards away from animals. Do not touch or disturb. All foot (human and pet), drinks, cooking tools and supplies, and anything else with a strong odor must be secured from wildlife. Put garbage in dumpsters or pack it out. Do not put garbage in fire pits. Backcountry food storage includes using bear cannisters which are available for loan from ranger stations or hanging food at least 12 feet high and 10 feet out from the nearest tree trunk.",

    "audioDescription": "Storm King Ranger Station. 4 minutes From the parking lot, a flat path leads to the log cabin Ranger Station. The building is two-stories with two second floor A-shaped dormers sitting midway up the wooden shingled roof. A red brick chimney extends above the roof in the center of the building and a grey, stone chimney on the cabin’s right wall rises above the roof line. A raised front porch with four steps and handrails provides access to the centrally located front door. Windows trimmed in white are on either side of the door. Attached to the cabin and directly adjacent to the door on the right and left, are wooden boxes holding park brochures and other information. Inside, the wooden walls of the cabin are reddish gold in color with prominent dark scattered knots. The wood floor is similar in color. In the center of the room, interpretive material such as tactile casts of animal footprints and touchable animal pelts are laid out on a table with chairs. Hanging on the wall is a black and white historic photograph of nine women and five men aboard a long white wooden boat sitting low in the water. A canopy covers two-thirds of the boat. The boat engine’s chimney rises above the canopy. The women wear ankle length, high collared, long sleeve patterned dresses and wide brimmed hats. The men wear white long-sleeved shirts, dark vests, and pants. One woman holds a guitar. A sign below the photograph reads: Lady of the Lake. Ferries were the only means of transportation at Lake Crescent during the turn of the century. Lady of the Lake, one of the ferries, transported passengers and goods from the East Beach area to Fairholme. It could reach a speed of eight miles per hour and frequently stopped at resorts around the lake. Ferries remained in service until shortly after 1922, when the road around the south shore was completed. A taxidermied trout also hangs on the wall, its pointed mouth opened, exposing sharp teeth. The skin of the trout is gray on top, pink and lightly spotted on the side, and light tan on the belly. Along the spine are two fins and along the belly, four fins. The V-shaped tail fin is spotted. A sign below the fish reads: Beardslee Trout. The Beardslee trout brough considerable acclaim to lake Crescent as early as the 1890s. A subspecies of rainbow trout, it is unique to the lake. The tout is named after Admiral Lesley A. Beardslee who initiated scientific interest in this species. The trout on display weighed 16 ¾ pounds. The largest Beardslee ever caught tipped the scales at 23 pounds. Next to the text is a small black and white photographic portrait of a man from the shoulders up facing slightly left with the caption, Admiral Beardslee. He is light complexioned with a dark, bushy moustache, thick dark eyebrows, close cut gray hair, and dark eyes. His dark jacket has a tall collar adorned with two white stars and an anchor. His black hat has a round side band with military insignia on the front, flat crown, and short front brim. Next to the sign is a taxidermied owl with brown and white feathers, big, round, dark eyes, and a short yellow beak.",

From here the trail climbs steeply, 1,600 vertical feet in 1.5 miles, to Klahhane Ridge. From there trails continue to Heart O’ the Hills via Heather Park or Lake Angles. A spur trail to Hurricane Ridge lies one-half mile up this trail. A climb to the summit of Mount Angeles necessitates climbing steep scree slopes and should be done by experienced hikers only. Heart O’ the Hills via Heather Park, 7.7 miles. Heart O’ the Hills via lake Angeles, 7.6 miles. Hurricane Ridge, 3/2 miles Additional text reads: Ghost Forest. A fire in 1940 left the stand of silver tree trunks. Because of the slope’s steepness, the blaze travelled so quickly that only needles and outer bark were scorched. Most of the forest is Alaska yellow cedar, whose roots are very decay resistant. Now, new trees are beginning to obscure the burn.

    "audioDescription": "The Beaumont Cabin. 3 minutes A concrete walkway encircles the cabin. The log cabin is a square building of weathered logs with interlocking dovetailed corners and a roof of weathered wood shingles covered in moss. On the front of the cabin, as you face the building, is a screen door offset to the right. To the left of the door is a window with six glass panes, three over three. On the right side of the cabin, a grey stone chimney rises up the wall from the ground level to about a foot above the roof line. The chimney is bottle shaped – wide at the bottom and narrow at the top. To the right of the door is a sign with a sepia toned photographic head-to-waist portrait of Elliott Beaumont. He has a white moustache and long white beard and appears happy as he looks at the camera. He wears a dark brimmed, rounded-crown straw hat, a black coat, vest and shirt. Rolled white papers protrude out from an inside coat pocket. Text to the right of the portrait reads, The Beaumont Cabin This log cabin was built in 1887 about a mile south of here by Mr. And Mrs. Elliott Beaumont as a home while “proving up” on a 160-acre Government homestead. They lived in this cabin for almost 40 years. The cabin was donated by Mr. Don Newman to the Clallam County Historical Society to be used as an exhibit of pioneer life on the Olympic Peninsula. It was moved from the original site on this property in 1962 by members of the society. They have restored the cabin with representative furnishings of the pioneer period 1850-1900. To the left of the cabin in the grass, is a low-to-the ground concrete platform upon which is a large bell and train whistle. The gold-colored metal bell is flared at the bottom and slimmer at the top and is suspended in a somewhat circular yoke. The train whistle sits atop the bell and is a tall, dark green metal cylinder with a cap at the top and two semicircular openings at the bottom. Text on a brass plague affixed to the front of the platform reads, Baldwin Locomotive whistle and bell. Lyon and Hill’s Train Number 4, hauled first load logs, Sol Duc Valley to Port Angeles, 1926. To Clallam County Historical Society from Harry LeGear, 1970.",

This quiet delta, with its mantle of old-growth forest, continues to grow and change. For thousands of years, American Indians lived and traded here. Later, settlers homesteaded this area and entrepreneurs developed hotels and lodges. Today, Lake Crescent is protected in Olympic National Park for all to enjoy. As you walk this trail, you follow the footsteps of many who shaped this landscape. This accessible one-half mile loop has several entrances and exits.

Follow a droplet of water. Standing here you can view most of its route. Restless. Hitchhiking a ride on Pacific breezes, moisture blows inland. Fog breathes through the forest turning trees dark green. Drifting upslope, the drop cools and condenses, freezes, and floats down on white peaks. From the highlands melting snow tumbles down this steep-walled canyon and join other torrents to form a stream on its way to the sea. Saltwater surrounds three sides of the Olympic Peninsula. Viewed from the air the glaciated mountains are the heart; streams and rivers are veins and arteries. Water flows so steadily here that people once thought the source must be a great lake in the unexplored center of the mountains. On the left side of the panel is a black and white drawing of two mountains with white snow fields. At the V-shaped base of the mountains, a white line represents a stream. High on the left, an arrow extends upward from a snowy slope, pointing to a white cloud in the sky. On the right, a second arrow next to a snow field points downslope, and a third arrow above the stream, points downward, indicating the streams direction of flow. Below the text, a black and white drawing shows a low, front view perspective of a winding forest stream, swollen with water, tumbling over rocks and boulders. Trees line the stream banks, and one fallen tree spans the stream like a bridge.",

    "audioDescription": "Park Entrance Sign - Hurricane Ridge Road. 2 minutes This large brown wooden sign is attached to two bark-less log support structures, one on each side of the sign. The base is constructed of colorful, round river rocks in various hues of pink, grey, green, and blue. A concrete sidewalk leads to the sign. Large text on the sign reads, Olympic National Park. Above this, the word, Welcome, is followed by the same word translated into the Klallam language. The symbols and lower-case letters that form this written word are described as: Inverted question mark. An upside-down inverted letter e. The letter n. Inverted question mark. The letter a with a left pointing accent mark above. A space. The letter c with a V-shaped accent mark above. An apostrophe. An upside-down and inverted letter e with a left pointing accent mark above. The letter y. An upside down and inverted letter e. The letter x. A small letter w at the top right corner of the preceding letter x. On the right side of the sign is the National Park Service logo. It is shaped like an arrowhead with a scalloped edge, pointed at the bottom, with sides that widen out toward the top, before curving slightly inward, then flaring out to create a rounded top. The arrowhead is brown with etched words and images. On the right side are the words, National Park Service, in white letters. To the left, in green, a tall tree towers above smaller trees and the ground below and a section of lake in white. Behind the tree, a white outline of snowcapped mountains. Below the trees, text in white reads, Department of the Interior, and below this, an outline of a bison in profile facing left with a large head and shoulders and smaller hind area.",

A black and white drawing on the left shows a man leading two mules up a trail between forested mountain slopes. The man wears a brimmed hat, white shirt, and black pants. Bundles wrapped in cloth and rope are strapped across the back of each mule. Text reads, The Staircase. This area was first called the staircase in the 1890 diaries of the O’Neil Expedition. A “staircase” was the only possible route up certain slopes. On the way to map and explore the Olympic interior, O’Neil’s party cut zig-zag trails up ridges, felled trees against cliffsides and covered the logs with brush and dirt to create a stair-like path for pack mules. Today the name Staircase describes the rapids one mile upstream. Below the text is a map of the Olympic Peninsula with the blue Strait of Juan de Fuca to the north, and the blue Pacific Ocean to the west. On the peninsula, the text, You Are Here, marks your location along the O’Neil party’s route which is illustrated by a black dashed line that heads north to the Quinault River, bears west along the river, then turns south",

    "audioDescription": "Three Steps Into Wilderness. Overview 30 seconds On the left, just before the flat, gravel trail begins is an all gender, single stall, accessible restroom building with a vault toilet. Enter on the right front side beneath an open alcove. The door to the restroom is on the left. On the right and left sides of the trailhead are wooden roof covered kiosks each holding two panels with information about planning and preparing for your hike and how to protect the wilderness. On the left side of the trail another sign reads, No Pets. Continue listening for a description of the kiosk panels. 6 minutes. Beginning with the kiosk on the right and the panel on the left, a text header across the top has white and green lettering on a black background that reads, Your first 3 steps into Wilderness. The remainder of the panel is color photograph of dark sea stacks silhouetted in front of a dark blue, pink, and yellow sky with pink reflections in the water. Text on the image reads: When you enter the Olympic Wilderness, you’re in for a wild time. Six hundred miles of trails link you to sea and sky. Are you hiking the coast, crossing creeks through old-growth forest or ascending mile-high peaks? Whatever your destination, Your First 3 Steps into Wilderness can lead to success or disaster. Attentive trip planning and preparation will help protect you and the future of wilderness. Step 1. Plan. Step 2 Prepare. Step 3 Protect The header on the second panel reads, Step 1. Plan. Below, are two columns of text. On the left is parkwide planning information. On the right, is planning information pertaining to South Coast. Text in the Parkwide column reads: Before your trip, contact the park’s Wilderness Information Center (WIC) or area ranger station for safety information, permits and regulations. Group size limit is twelve. Leave your trip itinerary, including date of return, with someone who expects you back. Observe all regulations, including those restricting pets, weapons, and wheeled vehicles and devices. Safely secure all food, garbage, and scented items 24 hours a day to protect wildlife and you. Contact the WIC for bear container loan locations. Text in the South Coast column reads: Outsmart thieving racoons and other wildlife by using required hard-sided food containers. Consult and carry a tide chart and detailed topographic map. Don’t attempt to round headlands without knowing the tides. You may get trapped as the tide rises against the cliffs. When necessary, ascend marked, but often steep, headland trails. Cross Goodman, Falls, and Mosquito Creeks at low tide. Storms or high tides may make these streams difficult. Below the text, a map of the coast with the text, You Are Here, includes trails, creeks, campgrounds, beaches, and other points of interest along the coast. Inset on the map are three photographs. One a red berry hanging from a stem, next a red five-pointed sea star on a bed of green seaweed, and last, a person on a trail with a yellow and red sunset in the background. Moving to the second kiosk on the left side of the trail, the header on the first panel reads, Step 2. Prepare. Text in the parkwide column reads: Carry backcountry essentials, including extra food, extra warm-when-wet clothing, topographic map, compass, flashlight, extra batteries, sunglasses and sunscreen, pocketknife, matches in waterproof container, firestarter. Prepare for hazards of weather, terrain, water crossing and wildlife. Prevent hypothermia in cool, wet weather by wearing wool and synthetic layers, a warm hat and raingear. Text for South Coast reads: Watch your step. Rugged headlands, sand ladders and rocky beaches can have challenging, wet, slippery footing. Adjust your expectations. Coastal hiking takes much longer than trail hiking. Boil, filter or chemically treat all drinking water to avoid infection by Giardia, a microscopic intestinal parasite. However, the tree tannins that darken coastal streams are harmless. Avoid dangerous driftlogs that roll in the waves and pound the beach during storms. There are three color photographs on the panel. Along the left side, the image shows a foggy, rocky coastline. In the foreground is a tidepool with orange and purple sea stars and barnacles clinging to the rocks. To the right is a photo of a red, round spiky sea urchin among a cluster of purple sea urchins. Below, a brown racoon with a black mask-like streak across its eyes stands atop seaweed. The header on the second panel reads, Step 3. Protect. Text in the parkwide column reads: Leave no trace of your stay. Think about how your actions impact wildlife, vegetation, and visitors. Use established campsites along the trail system. If hiking cross-country, camp on durable surfaces. Protect plants by observing restoration closures. Minimize use of campfires. Pack out everything you pack in. Properly dispose of human waste. Use privies where available or dig a 6-to-8-inch hole at least 200 feet from campsites and water. Do not urinate in composting or vault toilets. Wash your dishes and yourself away from lakes and streams. To protect water quality, avoid using soap. Leave natural objects and cultural artifacts where are you find them to help protect this irreplaceable wilderness. A photograph to the right of the text shows a person descending a sand ladder to the beach below. White waves roll onto the shore. In the distance seastacks rise out of the ocean. In the center of the panel a photograph shows a blue ribbon of water winding across the brown sandy beach to meet the ocean. A finger of land with dark trees juts out into the ocean on the left. Mist rises. In the distance are offshore islands. At the bottom of the panel, text in the South Coast column reads: Use a stove to eliminate impacts of fire and wood gathering. Build campfires only on the beach and use driftwood to protect the forest. Be sure your fire is out cold as winds can reignite embers. Never feed wildlife for their health and your safety. Backpackers and day hikers should always keep food secured from wildlife. Do not climb on offshore islands and seastacks. They are protected havens for nesting seabirds and resting marine mammals. On the left is a photograph of a tall, wide waterfall in a green forest, its water cascading into the stream below.",

    "audioDescription": "Overview. 1 minute A roof covered open air post and beam building houses seven interpretive panels attached to a semi-circular wooden half wall structure in the center of the building. The ground surface in and around the building is gravel. The panels provide information about three steps to take to help ensure a successful visit parkwide and here at Ozette: Plan, Prepare, and Protect; the Makah people and their relationship with the sea; Ozette pioneers who settled in the area, and how island habitats create sanctuaries for many species of seabirds. Continue listening for a description of each panel. 10 minutes. Attached to the front entrance on the left, a brown sign with white text reads, Wedding Rock Petroglyphs. Petroglyphs are protected archeological resources. It is illegal to excavate, remove, damage, or deface them. Please help to protect these resources. Use only lighting to enhance your photographs and report any disturbance or damage to park personnel. To the right of the sign on the wall is a white bone of an ocean mammal which you may touch. On the right side of the entrance, is the first panel. Filling the background of the panel is a color image of tall cliffs at oceans edge along a rocky shoreline and sea stacks in the distance. A person wearing red walks in the tidepool area. Text along the top reads, Your First 3 Steps into Wilderness. Below, text continues, Step 1, Plan. Step 2, Prepare, Step 3, Protect. Text continues, when you enter the Olympic Wilderness, you’re in for a wild time. Six hundred miles of trail link you to sea and sky. Are you hiking the coast, crossing creeks through old-growth forest or ascending mile-high peaks? Whatever your destination, your first three steps into wilderness can determine the success or disaster of your trip. Attentive planning and preparation will help protect you and the future of wilderness. Entering the building, the first panel on the left wall is titled, Step 1 Plan. Text reads, Parkwide. Before your trip, contact the park’s wilderness information center (WIC) or area ranger station for current safety information, backcountry permits and regulations. Leave your trip itinerary, including date of return, with someone who expects you back. Be aware of the regulations that restrict pets, weapons and wheeled vehicles and devices. Limit your group size to twelve. To their detriment, wild animals can become accustomed to human food. Store all edibles, garbage and scented items in hard sided food containers. Ozette. Reservations are required for overnight trips spring through fall. Check at the ranger station or call the WIC. Be prepared to outsmart thieving raccoons on the coast by observing parkwide food storage practices. Consult and carry a tide chart and detailed topo map. Don’t attempt to round headlands without knowledge of high tides. You may not be able to escape the tides that rise against cliffs. When necessary, ascend marked headland trails with extreme caution. The Ozette River should be crossed at it mouth at or near low tide. During winter or heavy rains, the river may not be fordable. Down the right side of the panel is a green and white map of Olympic National Park North Wilderness Coast. Sites of interest are labeled with mileage between the points. Two trails beginning at the Ozette Ranger Station and ending at the coast are marked on the map: the 3.1-mile Cape Alava Trail and the 3-mile Sand Point Trail. North of the trails, the Ozette Indian Reservation is outlined. To the left of the map at the bottom is the map key. Next to a red exclamation mark text reads, Caution Headland. Hiker must use Overland Trail mark with trail sign during higher tide levels. Next to the word, Danger, text reads, Hiker must always use Overland Trail to round headland. As the wall begins to curve, the next panel to the right is titled, Step 2 Prepare. Text reads, Parkwide. Prepare for hazards of weather, terrain, water crossings and wildlife. Prevent hypothermia in cold, wet weather by layering wool and synthetics. Keep hat and rain gear handy. Carry backcountry essentials, including extra food, map, compass, flashlight, extra batteries, sunglasses and sunscreen, pocket knife, matches in waterproof container, firestarter, first aid kit and extra clothing. Boil, filter, or chemically treat all drinking water. Ozette. Watch your step. The boardwalk is slippery when wet. For good traction, wear tennis shoes or lightweight hikers with soft rubber soles. Tree tannins that darken streams are harmless but remember to sterilize all water for contaminants. Avoid dangerous driftlogs that roll in the waves and pound the beach during storms. A photo at the bottom shows a wooden boardwalk with stairs winding through a forest dense with green understory. A second photo shows jumbled piles of bark less bleached logs covering the length of a beach. Continuing, the next panel on the right is titled, Step 3. Protect. Text reads, when hiking and camping, think about how your actions impact wildlife, vegetation, or visitors. Respect the wilderness experience of others. Leave no trace of your stay. Along the trail system, use established campsites. If traveling cross-country, camp on durable surfaces. Observe revegetation closures to allow plants to recover. Minimize use of fire. Pack out everything you pack in. Wash yourself and your dishes away from water sources. Use small amounts of biodegradable soap or none at all. Properly dispose of human waste. Use privies where available or dig catholes at least 200 feet from campsites and water. Leave what you find, including natural objects and cultural artifacts. Ozette. Along the coast, camp on the beach above high tide line or in established forest sites. Note: Cannonball and Ozette Islands are closed for day or overnight use. Observe campfire bans. Where permitted, small beach fires may be constructed away from driftlogs. In the forest, preestablished fore rings must be used. For forest and beach campfires burn only driftwood, the smaller the better. Be sure your fire is out cold, as winds can reignite fires. When exploring tidepools, walk on bare rock or sand. Leave all organisms where you find them. Do not approach seal pups. Help protect prehistoric Makah Indian rock art and Ozette pioneer homesteads. A photograph at the bottom shows starfish clinging to the side of a rock at low tide. Three are purple and three are orange. Each have five spine covered arms. Green leafy seaweed hangs on the rock and other tidepool animals cling to its side. The panel titled, People of the Sea, is next. Filling the top and left side is a blue and white illustration of a whale in the foreground, its fluked tail above the water. In the background is a canoe carrying eight people atop a rough sea. Three hold harpoons. A harpoon line extends from the canoe to the whale. Text reads, When the whale surfaces again they are already there, matching its speed. Eight men backpaddle the cedarlog canoe as the harpoon strikes. One flick of the tail flukes could interrupt their hunt forever. Like huge balloons, sealskin floats attached to the harpoon line slow the diving whale. A 3.7 mile hike from here is the Ozette Site now closed where archeologist have unearthed village upon village of the Makah people, a North American culture as old as the Pharaohs, yet continuing today. Recovered from buried cedar plank longhouses, the robes of migrating fur seals, ingenious fishhooks and baskets of cedar bark express a ceremonious life of bounty. Objects from the site are on display at the Makah Cultural and Research Center in Neah Bay. Visitors are welcome. The next panel is titled, Ozette Pioneers. An illustration filling the top of the panel shows a brown wooden cabin with a stone chimney in a forest clearing. Standing in front of the cabin, a man holds a long pole. He has a dark beard and moustache and wears a brown wide brimmed hat, blue long-sleeved shirt, and black pants with suspenders. In the bottom left the illustration continues with the end of a split rail fence. Text to the right reads, to reach Ozette lake in 1890 you might have journeyed by steamer to Neah Bay and then by Makah canoe around Cape Flattery to the mouth of the Ozette River. Hauling belongings on your back, you still had to trek several miles through dense forest. The Makah tribe occupied the Ozette Lake area for centuries. By 1892 settlers had built over thirty homesteads around the lake. They hoped for a road. Most of the settlers left before the road was finally completed in the 1930s. Today, as nature reclaims the land, the Roose and Ahlstrom homesteads still stand as reminders of Ozette’s unique history. The final panel is titled, Island Sanctuaries. Text in the lower right corner reads, many species of seabirds coexist on the offshore rocks and islands. Because their food and nesting preferences differ - cormorants perch on ledges, puffins burrow, gulls nest in the grass on top – there is little competition. Without the islands, these birds would cease to exist. Nowhere else can they nest close to abundant ocean food yet stay removed from predators and human disturbance. But seabirds are still vulnerable to chemical pollutants even in surf-washed isolation. A blue and white side view cut-away illustration of a tall rock island extends down the left side. It shows different bird species and their preferred perching and nesting spots. From the top, a Bald eagle stands on a tree branch. A Western gull and Glaucous-winged gull fly above the grassy top of the rock. A Cassin’s auklet sits in the back of a burrow. Then, another burrow with a Rhinoceros auklet. Two tufted puffins sit on a small ledge in front of their long deep burrow with one egg. Two Common murres stand on a ledge followed by other birds on ledges: a Peregrine falcon, Double-crested cormorant, Pigeon guillemot, and Black oystercatcher. Rock islands rise in the distance.",

In the center is an enclosed cabin with windows. Along the side of the cabin is a wooden water wheel. In the foreground on the lake shore, is a woman, her back to us, with long dark hair, wearing an ankle length red skirt, long sleeved white bouse and a white wide brimmed hat. She stands under a tall, wooden-lattice gate-like structure looking out toward the ferry. At the top of the structure is the word, Rosemary, reversed, so it may be read correctly from the water. Text reads: Imagine yourself here in 1920, traveling by paddle wheel ferry across lake Crescent.

Blow-downs are only a phase in the forest’s life-cycle. In the new clearing seedlings thrive on sunlight, and can begin life on the decaying trunks of storm-downed trees. Below the text is a blue and tan weather map of the Northwest Coast showing closely spaced circles within circles with the letter L in the middle, all centered over the Olympic Peninsula. A straight black line with arrows stretches across the blue Pacific Ocean from south to the north ending at the letter L. A caption reads: Path of storm, February 12, 1979.",

One salmon has a hook nose that overhangs its mouth while the other has a pointed nose. Text at the top right reads: Coho in the Creek. Look into the clear waters of Taft Creek. In late fall and winter, coho salmon spawn in stream gravels. The fry emerge in spring and feed in the river for a year before swimming to sea. Surviving salmon return as three-year-olds to spawn and die. Over 130 wildlife species benefit from salmon, and the remaining fish carcasses decompose and nourish the forest. In their remarkable journey, salmon unite mountains, forest and sea. Below the text is an underwater color illustration of two small fish swimming above a rocky stream bed. Their backs are light reddish-yellow with dark spots and two fins and their bellies with three fins are white with a horizontal line of dark spots. Along their sides are vertical black stripes.

The men have brown skin, long black hair, muscular arms, and are bare chested. In a synchronized pose, they each hold a brown wooden long-handled paddle, partially submerged along the right side of the canoe. The water around them is dark blue and in the near distance is a shoreline with pine trees. Each end of the canoe rises up to a squared off tip, the front being twice the height of the back. Attached to the front is a bright red figure shaped in the form of an animal head with two ears and a snout. Text on the left side of the panel reads: Cultures Carved in Cedar. In traditional Northwest Native American style, skilled craftsmen carved an entire canoe from a single western red cedar log. Artisans added a precisely aligned bow and stern to ready their river and ocean canoes for fishing, whaling or extended voyages at sea. Imagine the challenges of blustery rains, enveloping fogs and aching arms endured by tribal paddlers on Northwest waterways. The wooden canoe on display is actual size, gray in color, and has been carved from one log. It sits about three feet above the ground under a roof covered structure that has a flat walking surface. The canoe may be touched.",

When a day’s downpour adds to glacial melt the stream may rise six feet, undermining the bank and toppling trees into the flood, washing them down to river mouth and beach. Some fall from eroding headlands. Numbered trunks are strays from tug-pulled log rafts. Drift logs are dangerous. At high tide they may suddenly roll. Unwary people have been crushed and killed by drift logs. Riptides make swimming and wading dangerous. There are no lifeguards. Swimmers beware.

Text on the left reads: Early Logging. Can you find the clues? Notched springboard holes and flat-topped stumps indicate these ancient giants were cut during the early 1900s. Using only hand tools, woodsmen relied on springboards to lift them above the buttressed bases of large trees. Steam donkeys, horses or ox teams pulled the downed logs along greased skid roads. The image shows two men, one on each side, of an extremely large reddish-brown tree, standing on boards that have been inserted into the tree above ground level. The men wear brimmed hats, button-down long-sleeved shirts, pants, and brown leather boots. Each man holds one end of a long saw that spans the inside of a large, angled notch cut into the tree. Scattered on the ground in front of the tree are pieces of wood sawn from the notch. To the left of the men is a tree stump, its top smooth on one side and jagged on the other. Bits of woods lay around the stump. In the background is a dense forest of uncut trees, green moss hanging from the limbs.",

    "audioDescription": "Elwha River Valley Upright Wayside. 6 minutes At the edge of a parking lot near a grassy area with picnic tables is a six-foot-tall metal upright frame holding two informational panels. A blue toned photograph of the river with mist rising up the green forested slopes is the background that spans across both panels. Beginning with the panel on the left, text at the top reads: Welcome to Olympic National Park. With nearly one million acres, the park protects rugged coasts, old-growth forests, wild rivers, snowy peaks, diverse wildlife, and rich human stories. Experiencing the major ecosystems of this internationally recognized wilderness is within easy reach. Enjoy exploring, whether for a few hours or a lifetime. Below, is the text, Elwha River Valley, then two side-by-side maps. The small map on the left shows the entire Olympic Peninsula. In the center, a large green roundish area indicates the park. Place names ring its outer edge with the Elwha area on the north side of the park highlighted. Below the map, text reads: A Wilderness Portal. In the mountains before you, the mighty Elwha River is born of snow melt, then flows 45 miles (72 kilometers) before emptying into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. For millennia this valley, the largest watershed in Olympic National Park, has sheltered old-growth forests, abundant wildlife, and massive salmon runs. Walk a trail or two. Discover the Elwha wilderness. To the right, is a larger map showing the Elwha area trail system. A black box with an arrow and white text reading, You Are Here, points to your current location. Below the map is a list of eleven trails each with a description, its one-way distance, and elevation change. Along the left side of the panel is vertical text that reads, Olympic National Park. Below, is a vertical row of three color photographs. From top to bottom, Madison Falls, its white water cascading straight down over green moss-covered rocks. Next, Humes Ranch, a small one-story log cabin with a wooden shingled roof and covered front porch, sits in a green grassy opening in the forest. Lastly, Glines Canyon, showing a section of old concrete spillway on the right and the winding, free flowing river passing forested hillsides on the left. The panel on the right begins with the text, Follow the paths travelled by Elwha Klallam Indians, homesteaders, hikers, and industrialists. Those who came before you each found something of value here – home, adventure, work. What will you discover? Down the right side of the panel, four sepia toned historic photographs in round frames are aligned vertically. A text header reads, Many Have Come Before You. The photograph at the top labeled, Native Americans, Ernie Sampson, 1914, shows a man with dark hair facing left with a slight smile on his face. He wears a white cap, white shirt and dark overalls and shoes. His left hand is placed on his waist. His right hand holds a pole balanced atop his right shoulder. A fish as tall as the man is attached to the front of the pole and a fish half the size is attached to the back of the pole. Next to the man on the ground is the front half of a canoe. A caption to the left of the photograph reads, For the Elwha Klallam, the valley is not only their home and source of food, but also the place of their creation. The next photograph is labeled Homesteaders, Chris and Christina Lollick, 1890s. The image shows a smiling robust woman with tightly pulled back hair and a round white face. She wears a light colored button-down long-sleeved shirt tucked into the waist of a long black skirt. To her left is a bearded man wearing a dark colored brimmed hat, white shirt with rolled up sleeves, a black vest, dark pants and a tan apron tied around his waist. He holds the handle of a tool perched on his left shoulder. In front of the couple is a black dog that stands knee high to the man. Behind the couple is a wooden building with two large windows on the left and a door on the right. A bench holding four buckets lined up in a row sits against the front of the building. A caption reads, In the late 1800s, European Americans began exploring these forests and mountains, followed by homesteaders who made a living farming, ranching, and guiding people through the valley. The third photograph, labeled Hikers, Heading to Mount Olympus, 1913, shows a group of women in single file walking across a fallen tree toward a dark forest. The women wear brimmed hats and carry tall hiking poles. Two of the women are dressed in brown long-sleeved jackets belted at the waist and baggy pants tucked into knee high boots. Several other women wear white jackets, mid-calf brown skirts, and knee-high boots. A caption reads, Hikers and mountain climbers sought wilderness challenges. Others came seeking fish and game. The last photograph is labeled, Industrialists, Building Glines Canyon Dam, 1926. It shows the scaffolded face of the tall dam under construction flanked on either side by brown rocky slopes. Beyond the dam is the river. A caption reads, Entrepreneurs built two dams in the early 1900s to power growth on the Olympic Peninsula. A century later the dams were removed and the Elwha River began to heal.",

    "audioDescription": "Era of Elegance Wayside. 3 minutes This three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panel stands in a grassy area to the right of the Sol Duc Hot Springs Resort entrance. An old black and white photograph of a large four-story hotel and adjacent buildings fills the panel. The photo shows one side and the front of the building. The windows on the top floor are encased in dormers that protrude off the roof, five on the front of the building and two on the side. The third and second floors each have twelve windows flush to the building across the front and six windows on the side. The first floor is wrapped in a covered porch with large windows spanning each side. In the distance, in line with the hotel, are smaller buildings. In front of the hotel is a manicured lawn with a few bushes and trees. Text across the top reads: Era of Elegance. Excitement and bustle fill the air as passengers board a steamship on a misty Seattle morning in 1912. They cruise seventy-five miles to Port Crescent, shuttle twenty miles by auto stages, ferry across Lake Crescent on the steamboat Betty Earles, and travel the final fourteen miles via Stanley Steamers to celebrated Sol Duc Hot Springs Hotel. Michael Earles built the original hotel on this site between 1910 and 1912. He was convinced the hot mineral waters offered cures for rheumatism, liver diseases, alcoholism and other disorders. Rustic yet elegant, the 165-room hotel sported a large veranda encircling three sides. The nearby sanitorium featured a medical staff, operating room and sun parlor. As many as 10,000 guests each summer sipped mineral waters and soaked in hot baths. Horseback riding, tennis, croquet, bowling and dancing ensured a full agenda. After only four years of grandeur, sparks from a defective flue set the cedar roof afire. Within a few hours much of this magnificent resort had burned to the ground. On the left below the text are two old color advertisements for the Sol Duc. Each ad shows massive snow-covered mountains rising up behind the red roofed hotel with its large green front lawn where people are walking. A banner across the bottom of the ad on the left reads, Magnificent Hotel and Playground, and across the ad on the right, Baths and Sanitorium. Below the ads is a quote from Chicago, Milwaukee and Puget Sound Company, circa 1912 that reads: The mail lobby, capacious and ornate, with massive columns running through the center greets the eye of the guest while near the front entrance is a great fireplace, lending an air of comfort and cheeriness.",

In the foreground of the image on the left and right are lower trunk sections of light brown trees, their bases not flat to the ground. Instead, like curved fingers touching a flat surface, long, thick, downward arched roots ring the bottom of the trees, elevating them above ground level. Green moss grows on the roots and green ferns dot the ground. In the background, the dense green forest extends into the distance.",

Stories and traditions of the Klallam and Quileute people tell us that American Indians maintained a long and intimate association with Lake Crescent. The lakeshore served as a meeting place, and area tribes gathered here to trade and join in ceremonies. On the right, a woman facing left stands on the lake shore. She has long dark hair pushed to the back, light brown skin, dark eyebrows and high cheekbones. She stares forward with a look of determination on her face. She wears a brown and black woven shawl, a mid-calf length skirt of the same material, and dark boots. A large open weave basket holding a piece of wood hangs down her back, supported by a decorated strap wrapped across her forehead. To the woman’s right at the water’s edge is a wooden canoe. Beyond, is the green-blue lake and mist shrouded mountains in the distance.",

    "audioDescription": "232 words Forest Fire Scars. 2 minutes Along the 2-foot-high stone wall edging the visitor center patio overlooking a sloping meadow, a valley with dense tall green pine trees, and layers of overlapping mountain ridges in the distance sits this three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panel. A black and white drawing on the left shows two mountain ranges, the one in the foreground labeled, Long Ridge. On the face of the mountain slope are irregular patterns of black and white. Text at the top right reads: Forest Fire Scars. Across the valley below you the lighter-colored vegetation defines the boundaries of old burns, which have occurred over the last two centuries. Lightning probably sparked most of the fires. Gradually at this elevation, new trees re-covered the ridge. The landscape’s pattern of colors, different shades of green, can be hieroglyphics of natural disasters, part of the forest’s life-cycle. Other scars mark the slopes: the narrow, vertical clearings of winter avalanche, and the landslide above the lower end of Long Ridge. Below the text is a black and white drawing of a man in profile from the waist up. He has a dark beard and moustache and wears a hard hat and jacket. Strapped to his back is a tank with a hose that is attached to a sprayer the man holds in his right hand. In the background, trees grow on a steep slope.",

These quick-growing trees add valuable nitrogen and humus to forest soils and prevent erosion. Eventually, western hemlock and western redcedars will tower above these short-lived hardwoods. Several centuries from now, a mature old-growth forest could stand here. The image shows two short, dark tree stumps, one on the left and one on the right, partially covered with green moss. The top of each stump is flat and horizontal exposing the reddish- brown wood on the inside. On the right-side edge are jagged, vertical splinters ripped from the tree as it fell. Reddish-brown wood chips are piled up at the foot of each stump. On the forest floor, green ferns grow around remnants of fallen trees. In the background, a sparse forest of tall and short trees is shrouded in a gray-white mist, a blue-sky peeking through.",

    "audioDescription": "Glaciers in Peril. 3 minutes Along the 2-foot-high stone wall edging the visitor center patio overlooking a meadow, valley, and mountain landscape, is a three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panel with two sets of black and white photographs comparing snow abundance on glaciers over time. Text at the top left reads: Glaciers in Peril. Abundant snow and cool summers create ideal conditions for Pacific Northwest glaciers. These rivers of ice, once considered permanent, are disappearing in our warming climate. A healthy glacier receives enough snow in winter to offset its summer melt. Now this sustaining snow often falls as rain. Olympic Mountain glaciers lost over 30 percent of their surface area from the 1970s to 2010. Blue Glacier retreated three football fields in length and lost over 74 feet of thickness, the height of a seven-story building, between 1987 and 2010. Some smaller glaciers in the park have completely disappeared. Glaciers have carved and adorned these mountains for millennia. Their meltwater feeds rivers that nurture life downstream, from forests to fish to people. As we continue to change our climate, the choices we make today will affect the future of these icy Olympic icons. To the right of the text, are two small, stacked photographs with the caption, Lillian Glacier, near Obstruction Point, was nearly gone by 2010. The image on top dated 1905 shows a mountain area with a large glacier filling in a wide bowl-shaped expanse between two peaks. In the bottom photo dated 2010 the bowl-shaped area is empty except for a few areas where snow clings to the sides of the bowl. Below the text are two larger side-by side black and white photographs showing a wide mountain range with Blue Glacier on the left and Carrie Glacier on the right. The photo on the left dated 1889 has an arrow pointing to the end of Carrie Glacier. In the second photo dated 2009, the arrow remains in place, but the end of Carrie Glacier has retreated up the mountain. Blue Glacier has also been reduced in size. A caption reads: From Hurricane Ridge, you can see Blue Glacier on Mount Olympus and Carrie Glacier to the southwest. The historic late summer photograph of Carrie Glacier shows a thick, healthy glacier. By 2009 the glacier had thinned dramatically and retreated far upslope.",

Text at the top right reads: Green Draperies. Some rain forest trees are more luxuriantly clothed than others. Notice the rough bark and spreading boughs of bigleaf maple. The clinging mosses and moss-like plants don’t drain their host but catch moisture and minerals from the breeze. Sometimes the added weight breaks branches. Below the text is a drawing of a Bigleaf maple leaf hanging on the tip of a stem. It has five lobes with jagged edges. Beginning at the base of the leaf, the two smallest lobes extend out to each side like open wings, then two larger wing-like lobes extend downward. The fifth and largest lobe fills the tip of the leaf.",

Salmonberry shrub, with three leaves at the tip of each stem and round raspberry-like berries. Sword fern, its long thin fronds spread wide like a seven-pointed star, and Water parsley, with an A-shaped stem having many leaves and a second stem with a cluster of leaves at the tip.

The text, “You Are Here,” indicates your location. Text on the left reads: High Ridge Trail. This 0.5-mile loop climbs nearly 200 feet to a dry, wind-swept ridge where wildflowers hug the ground and trees are stunted. A short spur trail ends at Sunrise Point where clear days offer panoramic views. With less moisture-giving snow, this ridge can be a challenging place for plants to survive.

This facility supplies fresh spring water to the Quileute Indian Tribe’s fish hatchery at nearby Lonesome Creek. Each year the tribe raises thousands of salmon and steelhead for release into the wild streams and rivers of the North Coast. The Quileute people have long depended on strong runs of fish for their survival. At the top of the panel is a black, white and red drawing of a fish in profile, its head facing left. It has an arched back and a tail that curves down and under its body. The entire body, including fins and tail, is outlined by a bold black line. The head of the fish is mostly black. It has a white dot at the tip of the nose followed by a horizontal white and red U-shaped design across the top of the nose. A red, four-point star-shaped eye is encircled by a white oval line. Under the eye, a red and white J-shaped design curves down the cheek and along the jaw line ending below the mouth with its long, red tongue Behind the head, the body of the fish is mostly white. It is segmented into sections, the first a D-shaped area defined by a thick black line. Inside, a thin red line follows the inside curve of the D-shape ending at the bottom with a row of seven vertical black lines topped by an upward curving red line. In the center is an eye outlined in red with a round, black pupil. Above and below this section on the outside of the body are fins. On the back of the fish is a white fin with a red elongated M-shape in the center. On its belly, the white fin is mostly filled in by a red design with a white four-point star shape in the center. The next section follows the curve of the body. A thin, red line, begins at the top and bends downward, ending above the tail fins. A row of red dots follows the curve of this line. Along the belly, are three red upward arched markings. The final sections are two, white, side-by-side tail fins, both oval shaped and pointed at the tips. Inside each fin is a red circle segmented into four pieces creating a white four-point star in the center.",

Text across the top reads: Meadow Invasion. Change is constant. Imagine this scene as a silent movie spanning a century. Research shows that wetter summers beginning in the 1940s allowed subalpine firs to invade open meadows in this area. In 100 years, this scene may be a dense forest. In national parks, processes like climate, wind, fire, and avalanches are the directors. The result is a dynamic landscape where the line between meadow and forest is in constant flux. Below the text, the image on the left, dated 1945, shows the mountainside with one dense area of trees and several thin lines of trees. The image on the right, dated 2045, shows the same mountainside but the thin lines of trees have now filled in creating larger areas of dense forest spanning the hillside.",

Below the text is a green and white illustration of a Sword Fern with many fronds, some lying flat to the ground, some extending upward. The trail passes through a lush forest of young and old trees, many draped with green moss. Ferns and other low growing plants create a carpet of green on either side of the trail.",

Such openings are brief interludes in the life of the forest. Along the meadow’s edge, young Douglass-fir trees have already begun to reclaim this site. The image shows a green field in the foreground with rows of plants, bordered on the left by a dirt road that curves up, then to the right, ending in front of a horizontal row of buildings at the top of the panel. Near the buildings on the left, a brown automobile is parked facing left. Its rectangular body has a tall, square drivers’ compartment in the center and large arched bumpers above black wheels with white sidewall. Behind the auto, is a house with white wooden siding and a large front door flanked by windows. Its A-frame roof is topped with dormers on either side of the peak and a chimney. A small white shed with a peaked roof sits beside the house near two brown barn structures with wooden fencing. A green lawn, shrubs and trees grow around the buildings. Tall pine trees stand behind the homestead, and in the distance, are tree covered hills.",

This quiet delta, with its mantle of old-growth forest, continues to grow and change. For thousands of years, American Indians lived and traded here. Later, settlers homesteaded this area and entrepreneurs developed hotels and lodges. Today, Lake Crescent is protected in Olympic National Park for all to enjoy. As you walk this trail, you follow the footsteps of many who shaped this landscape. This accessible one-half mile loop has several entrances and exits.

Text reads: Moments in Time Trail. Shaped by time and water, Barnes Point punctuates the south shore of glacially carved Lake Crescent. This quiet delta, with its mantle of old-growth forest, continues to grow and change. For thousands of years, American Indians lived and traded here. Later, settlers homesteaded this area and entrepreneurs developed hotels and lodges. Today, Lake Crescent is protected in Olympic National Park for all to enjoy. As you walk this trail, you follow the footsteps of many who shaped this landscape. This accessible one-half mile loop has several entrances and exits. A trail map is provided below and at four other entry points. Please return it after use. These interpretive exhibits were provided by the Rob Reed and Lena Sharpe Memorial Foundation.",

The woman on the left wears a black and white hooded jacket that extends to her waist and a dark colored mid-calf-length skirt. A basket hangs down her back, supported by a strap that wraps across her forehead. She carries a brown and black satchel. She is barefoot. The second woman wears similar clothing with the addition of a long, brown fur draped across the front of her body. She holds a walking stick in her right hand. She is also barefoot. The women stand upon a green and white section of ground. Plants rise up in the foreground of the image and a mountain range spans the background underneath a blue sky. Text on the left side of the panel reads: Mountain Travelers. Why did you come to the mountains? People have been traveling to these peaks for millennia. Ancestors of local tribes hunted elk and deer and collected plants for food, fiber and medicine across these ridges. Tribal elders tell of using the mountains as travel routes, and for spiritual and social pursuits. People have come to these slopes for centuries for the same reasons that visitors journey to Hurricane Ridge today. Wilderness that provided survival necessities like food and tools also nourished the soul. The mountains continue to offer solitude and renewal to anyone who travels here.",

A color illustration that assembles, in one scene, many of the plants and animals living in this old-growth forest habitat before you fills the panel. Text on the top left reads: National Treasure. Mingle with the centuries-old giants of Olympic National Park’s old-growth forests and become a part of history. Many of these western hemlock and Douglas-fir trees were thriving before Columbus set sail in 1492. They greeted guests at Sol Duc Resort in 1912 and stood stately when Olympic National Park was established in 1938. From seedlings to 750-year-old sentinels, this multi-layered forest harbors countless residents, from black bears and banana slugs to birds of many songs. In death, old growth takes on vital new roles. Standing snags serve as nesting sites for owls and small mammals. Fallen trees become nurse logs where saplings can sprout above the crowded forest floor. Decomposing leaves and logs provide refuge for salamanders, beetles and a bustling unseen world. This magnificent old-growth forest offers adventure and solace for wilderness enthusiasts from around the globe. It is a finely tuned system that ties the past to the present. Will this national treasure be a link to our future?” The illustration is a ground level view of an old growth forest. On the forest floor, a fallen tree dominates the foreground. It is covered with moss, white wildflowers, and plants with red berries. A snake, with its red tongue extended, slithers up the side of the tree. On top, are two yellow slugs with black spots and antenna, a black and orange bird, and two small pine tree saplings. Attached to the side of the tree are orange and white shelf-like fungi. On the ground, a small brown and white squirrel holds a pinecone. Next to the fallen tree on the left, the head of a small grey animal with dark eyes, short snout, and small rounded ears, peeks out from behind a moss-covered tree stump. In the forest background, a black bear walks by a tall plant with wide green leaves and red flowers. A brown elk with two five-pointed antlers stands near the wide base of tree. A brown and whited spotted owl is perched at the top of a dead tree, while below, a black and white woodpecker with a bright red head, clings to the bark. A small bird sits on its nest on a high moss-covered tree branch as a brown bird flies into the forest. On the left, a group of hikers walk through the forest.",

In the grass opposite one of the logs, is the three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside. A color illustration assembling many of the plants and animals that live in the forest habitat before you, fills the panel. Text on the left reads: Night Shadows. Enter Olympic’s old-growth forest at twilight and share the darkening hours. A Columbia black-tailed deer unveils her silhouette through the evening curtain. Elusive cougars stalk deer by scent and sound. Songs of owls and frogs quicken the air. Fiery shadows leap from tree to tree as the setting sun kindles an intricate night world. One night creature, the northern spotted owl, needs old growth for survival. This threatened species nests in broken treetops and trunk hollows far above the forest floor. Flying squirrels, favored prey of spotted owls, scurry down to the forest floor to dig for truffles and spread the spores of future fungi. At this moment of opportunity, a vigilant spotted owl swoops down to snag a squirrel. Northern spotted owls, flying squirrels and truffles weave a unique tapestry in the old-growth forest night. What other vital connections can you discover? The illustration is a ground level view of a forest of tall trees, its floor covered in a lush carpet of green ferns, moss and decaying wood. Above the ground is an owl in flight with outstretched, upward curved brown wings edged with individual finger-like feathers and fanned out tail feathers. It has a white and brown chest and round head with two large dark round eyes and a thin white downward curved beak. A thin line of dark feathers shaped like a heart encircles its face. Clawed feet hang from its legs. On the ground, a grayish-brown squirrel crouches near a fallen tree, and a brown deer with large ears stands sideways as a brown cougar walks nearby.",

You might not see them now, but all around there is evidence of the resident elk herd. Look for tracks in the soft ground — elk have trampled a path near here. Observe cropped-off shoots along the trail. Despite the lush growing conditions, browsing elk keep the forest floor relatively open Below the text, a drawing of a left and a right Elk track shows the split hooved characteristic of an Elks foot that resembles a circle split down the center.

Enjoy, appreciate, and help us preserve this irreplaceable treasure by not collecting any specimens from the intertidal zone. The store at Kalaloch sells bait for those who wish to surf fish. In midsummer you can catch smelt with a net. Below the text is a drawing of two types of fish. The largest, labeled Perch, has a wide oval body that is dark across the top with a white side and belly. A spined fin runs along most of its back with a shorter fin along its underside. Smaller fish called Smelt are long and thin and about one-sixth the size of the Perch. Their bodies are dark on top and white on the sides and belly.",

Several young orange-red salmon with yolk sacs attached to their bodies swim above the gravel in the blue green water.

At the far end of the grassy section is a three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panel with a brightly colored illustration that assembles, in one scene, many of the plants and animals living in this river habitat. Green ferns, pillows of yellow-green mosses, and plants with purple berries grow low to the ground. Bright red shrubs growing beneath green pine trees and deciduous trees with yellow, red, and green leaves line the riverbanks. Slim gray river otters and brown beavers with rounded flat tails are on the bank and in the water. A brown frog hides among fallen leaves while a gray bird pulls a worm from the ground. A blue, white and red Kingfisher perches on a branch, a brown and white Osprey watches for fish from a dead tree branch, a red-headed duck with a gray body stands on a river rock, and a bald eagle with a white head and white tailfeathers, flies above the river, its long black wings extended. In the river, red and yellow trout keep to a deep pool, and schools of salmon with bright red markings swim upstream. On the top left of the panel text reads: Pulse of the River. The Sol Duc River launches its conversation with the landscape at 5,000 feet near High Divide. A trickle of mountain water feeds tiny rivulets that merge into streams. The route steepens, waters plunge down hanging paths carved by Ice Age glaciers. Fallen old-growth leaves, logs and branches change the course of the river, crafting pools that provide crucial habitat for beaver, mink, river otter, salmon and salamanders. Tumbling rocks and abrasive sediments create fresh rhythms as the river flows to sea. The Sol Duc River begins and ends with gentleness, but its overriding temperament is vigorous. It is rarely hushed, never resting in one pool for long. Time is its vehicle, change a constant companion. Text in the lower right reads: Coho Cadence. A unique stock of coho salmon with unusual behavior inhabits the Sol Duc River. While most stocks of coho swim up western Washington rivers in October and November, when water levels are high, summer coho enter the Sol Duc in July when stream flows are low. They spawn from late September to November. Winter steelhead and cutthroat trout also swim in these silvery waters.",

    "audioDescription": "Queets River Trail Wayside. 2 minutes On this upright interpretive panel, text at the bottom reads: Queets River Trail. To begin the hike up the Queets Valley you must ford the river, an important habitat for Pacific salmon and trout. The river bottom is slippery, and the water is often too deep and swift to wade, particularly in the fall, winter, spring, or after heavy rains. This rain forest trail winds along the river at an easy grade. The last five miles are primitive and difficult to follow. Text continues: How to Cross the Queets. Check up and down river to find the best spot for fording. Wear sturdy sandals, tennis shoes, or hiking boots. Loosen shoulder straps and unbuckle hip belt if you are carrying a pack to shed it quickly if you slip. Use a stout pole, held in both hands, to brace against the current. To the left of the text is a black and white illustration showing a hiker wearing a backpack and holding a pole while crossing a river. In the center of the panel is a map with the text, You Are Here, and the trail marked with white dashes. Park boundaries, campgrounds, and other trails are marked on the map. At the top of the panel is a trail grade profile showing the trailhead elevation at 300-feet and the end of the trail a little less than 1000 feet.",

Text at the top right reads: Razor Clams. Razor clams dine on a floating banquet, siphoning microscopic plants and animals from the surf. At low tide dimples in the sand reveal their position. But with a sharp, powerful foot clams can submerge rapidly beneath soft, damp sand to escape crabs and people. The clams are fattest just before spawning in April or May when the water temperature rises. For razor clams to survive, digging season and catch are limited. Check the current posted regulations.

Text at the top right reads: Signs of Wildlife. Most animals seek shelter in the heat of the day. But you can discover their signs. Deer trails criss-cross the hillsides; excavations are marmot burrows. Listen for the whistle of the marmot or the booming sound of the male blue grouse. Below the text is a drawing of the top half of a standing Marmot. Its horizontal, oval shaped head faces right. A small ear sits far back on the side of its head and a dark oval eye sits high and centered. It has a flat nose and a wide closed mouth. Its body is stout, and its two front legs and four-toed feet hang in front of its belly. On the left side of the panel, is a larger drawing of a forward-facing bear standing on all four long-clawed feet. The bear has dark fur, a broad, bulky body and a small round head with two upright oval shaped ears. Closely spaced eyes are set on either side of the snout which extends out from its face. At the tip of the snout is a large black round nose and the bear’s mouth.",

Text on the left reads: Spruce Railroad. Imagine the continuous clank of steel upon steel echoing across Lake Crescent. To secure spruce lumber for World War 1 warplanes, a railroad was built in 1918 along the far shore of the lake. Soldiers and civilians toiled for five months, cutting two tunnels and laying rails in record time. The war ended just weeks before the railroad was completed, but it was used to haul timber until 1954. Today, a hiking and biking trail follows this route. On the right side of the panel, the front of a gray metal tube-shaped steam train emerges from a dark tunnel cut through a brown rocky mountain slope. The tunnel opening is framed on the top and sides with thick wooden timbers. The train travels towards us on two metal rails atop many squared off wooden beams laid perpendicular to the rails. On top of the train, a smokestack belches thick dark grey smoke. The flat face of the train is round with a smaller round door and headlight in the center. Below, is a platform with handrail, both the width of the train. On the bottom, a forward angled metal grill with vertical bars, slightly wider than the train tracks, almost touches the tracks. On the left side of the panel is the lake, its blue water and surrounding mountains partially obscured by thick light gray mist.",

Alder groves, wet meadows and small forest openings provide the cover and open feeding areas preferred by many species of wildlife. On the right side of the image, a reddish-brown squirrel, facing right, stands on all four legs atop a tree branch draped with strands of light green moss. The squirrel has a round head, two fur tipped ears, a dark oval eye encircled by tan fur, and a small dark nose flanked by long black whiskers above its mouth. Its bushy tail is brown with black streaks and curves up and away from its body. The squirrel’s feet each have four toes ending with a claw. The branch is attached to a dark colored tree trunk with rough bark. More trees stand in the background.",

More than one third of the bird species common to Northwest forests, as well as other small animals, nest in these cavities. Can you think of any? On the right side of the panel, a right-facing, mostly black, pileated woodpecker is vertically anchored by its four toed clawed feet to a light brown tree trunk with several holes. Crowning the birds entire head is a cap of bright red feathers that end at the back of the head in an upward pointing crest. Its round eye is yellow, and its tan beak is long and pointed. Above the eye is an upward curving white stripe. Below the eye, beginning at the beak, a bold white stripe runs to the back of the head, then curves downward ending at the chest. Under this stripe on the bird’s cheek is a patch of red, then below this, another white strip on the underside of the head. The scene in the center and left side of the panel, shows a dark, dense green and brown forest. Green moss grows on some of the trees.",

The downward sloping meadow has clumps of purple and white wildflowers and short, green grasses. On the far edge of the meadow, lines of pine trees descend down slope. Then, snow-free forested mountains in the near distance and snowcapped mountain peaks in the far distance. Nineteen peaks are labeled by name and elevation. Below the mountain peaks in two valleys separated by a ridge are the Lillian River on the left and Elwha River on the right. Text below the illustration reads: The Olympic Mountains. On a clear day you can gaze far into the Olympic Wilderness, from deep valleys to deep ridges. This young mountain range is made of basalts and sedimentary rocks uplifted from their birth on the seafloor and later sculpted by glaciers and erosion. Winter snow lingers on the mountains well into summer. By autumn, only permanent snowfields and glacial ice cling to the highest peaks. From left to right, the names and elevations of the mountains read: Steeple Rock 5567 feet. Obstruction Peak 6450 feet. Mt. Deception 7788 feet. Mt. Cameron 7190 feet. McCartney Peak 6784 feet. Mt.

The remainder of the panel is an image showing a tangle of moss-covered tree roots curving above the ground carpeted with red and yellow leaves and green ferns. In the background are more roots and leaves. At the bottom, white text reads: When you enter the Olympic Wilderness, you’re in for a wild time. Six hundred miles of trails link you to sea and sky. Are you hiking the coast, crossing creeks through old-growth forest or ascending mile-high peaks? Whatever your destination, Your First 3 Steps into Wilderness can lead to success or disaster. Attentive trip planning and preparation will help protect you and the future of wilderness. Step 1. Plan. Step 2 Prepare. Step 3 Protect The header on the second panel reads, Step 1. Plan. Below, are two columns of text. On the left is parkwide planning information. On the right, is planning information pertaining to Graves Creek. Text in the Parkwide column reads: Before your trip, contact the park’s Wilderness Information Center for safety information, permits and regulations. Group size limit is twelve. Leave your trip itinerary, including date of return, with someone who expects you back. Observe all regulations, including those that restrict pets, weapons, and wheeled vehicles and devices. Safely secure all food, garbage, and scented items 24 hours a day to protect wildlife and you. Contact the WIC for bear cannister loan locations. Text in the Graves Creek column reads: Check local conditions before heading out. Even when it is early summer in the Quinault rain forest, higher elevations may still be snow covered, making route finding and travel difficult. Bears commonly forage in this valley, especially in the spring. For their safety and yours, follow food storage requirements by using bear cannisters or bear wires. Observe stock regulations that help protect you, your animals, and the Olympic wilderness. Above 3,500 feet, stay on trails and only use designated stock camps. Pack non-viable pellets or rolled grain. Below the text, is a Trail Grade Profile illustrating the elevation for locations along the Graves Creek trail. Elevation at this trailhead is 615 feet. Lake Sundown is just below 4000 feet, and Anderson Pass is around 4500 feet. A map at the bottom shows the Graves Creek trail system with the text, You Are Here. Four small color photographs are inset into the map. A tan slug with two antennae on a bed of red, yellow, and green moss. A stream with a waterfall in the background. A small brown bird with brown spots on a white belly stands on a branch. A green fern frond hovers over green clover. Moving to the second kiosk to the right, the header on the first panel reads, Step 2. Prepare. In the center of the panel is an image of white water flowing down a rocky streambed. Green trees line the banks, and a snowcapped mountain rises in the distance. Above the image, text reads: Parkwide. Carry backcountry essentials including extra food, extra warm-when-wet clothing, topographic map, compass, flashlight and extra batteries, sunglasses and sunscreen, pocketknife, matches in waterproof container, candle or Firestarter and first aid kit. Prepare for hazards of weather, terrain, water crossing and wildlife. Prevent hypothermia in cool, wet weather by wearing wool and synthetic layers, a warm hat and rain gear. Boil, filter or chemically treat all drinking water to avoid infection by Giardia, a microscopic intestinal parasite. A small photo to the right of the text shows dark tree trunks standing in front of trees with red and yellow leaves. Below the image, text reads: Graves Creek. Wear sturdy, waterproof boots and gaiters. The trail often remains muddy, even during dry weather, and becomes more steep and rugged upriver. Rely on basic gear and skill, not electronics. Cell phones, GPS units and other electronic devices might not work, especially in valleys and forested areas. Be prepared to travel inclement weather. Always check the weather forecast but also prepare for the unexpected. Use shelters for emergencies only – rain is not an emergency. To the left of the text is a photograph of an elk. It has no antlers, a brown head with a long snout facing right, and its body is tan. It stands among ferns in a forest. The header on the second panel reads, Step 3. Protect. An image filling the right side of the panel shows a high alpine area with yellow-green moss and lichen growing on a rocky slope with snowcapped mountain peaks in the background. On the left, text reads: Parkwide. Leave no trace of your stay. Think about how your actions impact wildlife, vegetation, and visitors. Use established campsites along the trail system. If hiking cross-country, camp on durable surfaces. Observe revegetation closures to protect plants. Minimize use of fire. Pack out everything you pack in. Properly dispose of human waste. Use privies where available or dig a six-to-8-inch hole at least 200 feet from campsites and water. Do not urinate in composting or vault toilets. Wash dishes and yourself away from lakes and streams. To protect water quality, avoid using soap. Leave natural objects and cultural artifacts where are you find them to help protect this irreplaceable wilderness. Graves Creek. Use a stove to eliminate impacts of fires and wood gathering. Campfires are prohibited above 3,500 feet. If you build a fire at lower elevations, keep it small and use an existing fire ring. Gather, don’t cut, only small pieces of dead and down wood. Be sure your fire is out cold as winds can reignite embers. Hike in the center of the trail even if it is muddy. Walking around mud damages plants and widens the trail. Never feed wildlife for their health and your safety. Backpackers and day hikers should always keep. Their food secured from any wildlife. Below the text are three color photographs. Pink and white flowers with five petals grown among rocks. A side view of a red and yellow fern before it opens, its head curled in a spiral.

Filling the right side of the panel is a color illustration of stacked rocks covered with sea life. Tree-like seaweed with many branches reach upward. Red and yellow five-pointed sea stars cling to the rocks. Cone shaped barnacles and ring-shaped sea urchins, some red and with long spikes, cover the rocks. Round, flat sea anemones edged with short green tentacles, a crab with two large front pinchers, and a striped fish with a spikey top fin are also on the rocks. In the top left corner, text reads, Human disturbance has severely impacted most Pacific Coast tidepools. This brilliant collage of plants and animals can easily be destroyed. Tubeworms, seastars, sea anemones and other tidepool creatures, along with all wildlife, are protected in Olympic National Park. Please leave intertidal plants and animals undisturbed in their natural habitat. To the left of the text is an illustration of tubeworms standing erect, their feathery gills extending above the top of their long, thin bodies like open umbrellas. The final illustration in the left bottom corner shows a person standing in the surf at ocean’s edge holding a fishing rod. Text reads, Surf fishing? Any natural bait native to Olympic National Park can be used only during its legal harvest season – check park regulations regarding crabs, fish, and shellfish. It is never legal, however, to remove or possess tidepool life. Removing only a few tubeworms weakens the entire colony.",

They begin in river valleys, giant conifers like Sitka spruce. When a day’s downpour adds to glacial melt the stream may rise six feet, undermining the bank and toppling trees into the flood, washing them down to river mouth and beach. Some fall from eroding headlands. Numbered trunks are strays from tug-pulled log rafts. Drift logs are dangerous. At high tide they may suddenly roll. Unwary people have been crushed and killed by drift logs. Riptides make swimming and wading dangerous. There are no lifeguards. Swimmers beware. On the left side of the panel, an aerial view illustration shows the churning water of a rip current rolling perpendicular to the shoreline through a narrow gap between the shore and a sandbar. In the center of the panel, is a smaller drawing at beach level of a jumbled pile of drift logs.",

Originally, these sediment layers settled in a deep ocean basin to the west. But continental movement has shifted things during the last 15 million years. Earth’s outer crust consists of vast mobile plates carried along by convection currents. As the ocean floor collided and dipped beneath the land plate, the rocks which form the Olympic peninsula were skimmed off and added to the continent. Below the text is a diagram illustrating the geologic process of land building. To the right, is a cross section illustration of clams buried in sandstone with text that reads: The holes in the rocks around you were drilled by piddock clams. These clams use a rocking motion to burrow into the sandstone.",

The tree in the center is the tallest and thinnest of the three. It has a straight trunk with branches all of similar length with drooping needles. The tree on the right, the middle-sized tree, has a thin A-shape with a slightly rounded top, a straight trunk and needle covered branches, some upturned, some drooping.

The rocks across the road are volcanic, but there are no volcanoes in the Olympics. Eons ago, underwater eruptions occurred in the Pacific Ocean forming pillow basalts. The rocks across the valley formed from sediments shed onto the ocean floor. Both kinds of rock were rafted towards North America by ocean floor movement, then uplifted and tilted by powerful forces. Below the text is a horizontal diagram showing a geological cross section of the Pacific Ocean on the left and the Olympic Mountains on the right. Two-thirds of the diagram is the Pacific Ocean, its blue water atop a layer of wavy black horizonal lines labeled Sediments, then a layer of black dots labeled New Ocean Floor. Below these layers is a white unlabeled area. At far left, a section of the New Ocean Floor layer is split by a fault line, each side pushed up through the sediment layer. In the center of the diagram, in the sediments layer, is a brown triangle-shaped underwater volcano, its pointed peak rising into the ocean. On the bottom of the volcano, a long, thin magma tube extends downward, deep into the earth. The last one-third of the diagram on the right shows the Olympic Mountains. Where the mountains begin, the ocean and sediment layers end while the New Ocean Floor layer dips under the mountains. On the face of the mountains are several brown areas of Basalts, dense vertical columns of stacked pillow-shaped rocks. The largest area spans from the tallest peaks to the base of the mountains where a text label reads, North America. To the right of the basalts on the mountain’s down slope is an area of horizontal wavy lines labeled Ocean Sediments.",

Devastating waves called tsunamis can strike Washington’s coast at any time. These giant waves are usually caused by great undersea earthquakes. Such earthquakes can occur along the Cascadia Subduction Zone, one of the largest active faults in North America. This fault zone lies 32 to 70 miles offshore and roughly parallels the coast. A tsunami on the Washing Coast may also result from an earthquake striking areas as far away as Alaska or Japan. Tsunamis are dangerous and destructive. They have struck the Washington coast repeatedly and will again in the future. Tsunamis can follow within minutes of an earthquake. They move rapidly, but quickly run out of water as they sweep inland and uphill. Flooding can occur several miles inland along rivers and streams. Remember, most tsunamis are not solitary giant waves; instead, many large waves. What to do to escape a tsunami. Drop, cover, and hold during an earthquake. After the earthquake, immediately move uphill or inland. Do not return to the beach after the first tsunami wave – more waves may arrive for several hours. Wait for official notice from authorities that the danger has passed before returning to the beach. For additional information, contact the Washington Emergency Management Division 1-800-562-6108 or your local Emergency Management Division: Clallam County 1-360-417-2305.

    "audioDescription": "Welcome to the Whale Trail Wayside. 5 minutes Text on the far-right side of this three-foot-tall, angled metal wayside panel reads: Grab your binoculars and scan the horizon! Look for the heart-shaped blows of gray whales on their annual migration. Spot the distinctive dorsal fin of orcas. Search for sea otters in the kelp and seals on the rocky shores. Farther out, humpback, fin, and sperm whales feed in nutrient-rich waters. Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary, extending nearly 50 miles offshore, protects a wide array of marine life. Safeguarding species closer to shore, Olympic National Park shares 65 miles of wild Pacific coast with the sanctuary. Your stewardship is vital in preserving these diverse and fragile marine environments. Follow the Whale Trail to watch whales from shore. From the Pacific Ocean to the Salish Sea, what will you discover. On the left, a text header reads, Welcome to the whale trail. Kalaloch. Below, are images with information about five sea animals. Clockwise from top left, an Orca, its oval shaped body, mostly black in color with a white rear side panel, a white oval eye patch, and a white underside. Its V-shaped tail fins are black on top and white underneath. On its back is a tall, pointed black dorsal fin, and near its head on each side of its body are black flippers. Text reads: Orca (killer whale) (Orcinus orca). Length: adult male 26 feet; female 23 feet; calf 8 feet Orcas are the largest member of the dolphin family. Highly social and intelligent, they live in tightly bonded family groups called pods. Three pods of fish-eating orcas (J, K, and L pods) live in Washington waters. These iconic mammals were listed as endangered in 2005. Next, a Harbor seal on its side, its body robust and oval, with grayish white and dark spotted fur. A small head with dark eyes, a V-shaped nose, and wide mouth is angled upward. It has two, short front flippers and tail flippers folded together like hands. Text reads: Harbor Seal (Phoca vituline). Length: adult 6 feet; pup 3 feet. Harbor seals are the most common marine mammal in the Pacific Northwest. Pups are left on the beach for extended periods while their mother feeds; please stay at least 100 yards from the pups. Continuing, a sea otter floats on its back, its belly, head, front paws and back flippers above water. It has a light brown head and dark brown body. Text reads: Sea Otter (Enhydra lutris). Length: Adult male 5 feet; female 4 feet; pup 10 inches. Once hunted to nearly extinction for their warm fur, there is a thriving population of sea otters along the Olympic Coast. Sea otters rest on their backs and use rocks as tools to crush mollusks and shellfish. Next, a harbor porpoise, its oval-shaped body dark gray on top and white on the sides and belly. It has a small, sharp dorsal fin midway down its back, and dark gray front flippers and tail fins. Text reads: Harbor Porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Length. Adult 5 feet. Calf 27 inches. Shy and elusive, when harbor porpoises surface you may briefly catch a glimpse of their triangular “chocolate chip” shaped dorsal fin. They travel in small groups of up to ten animals. Last, a gray whale, its long, sleek body a uniform mottled gray and white in color. It has two front flippers, small, raised bumps midway down its spine, and V-shaped tail fins. Text reads: Gray Whale (Eschrichtius Robustus). Length: adult 46 feet; calf 15 feet Gray whales migrate close to shore along this coast between April and May. They feed in Alaska in the summer, and swim to Baja California to give birth in the winter. To the right of the images is a map of the Olympic Peninsula. The boundary outline for the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary is marked in the Pacific Ocean. A list of wildlife viewing sites along the Whale Trail is next to the map. Across the bottom of the panel are six additional images. From left to right, an adult and two children face the ocean, one child looks through binoculars. Two Orcas, one vertical and halfway out of the water, the other swimming, its tall dorsal fin above water. A harbor seal with long whiskers, pops its head above water. An aerial view of a spouting gray whale, a white cloud of air above its body. A pair of sea otters, one on top of the other, floating on their backs in the ocean. And two harbor porpoises swimming side-by-side.",

In the fall they are migrating south to calve and nurse in the warm lagoons of Baja California. The gray whales return in early spring on their way to arctic feeding grounds where they comb clouds of shrimp-like creatures from the water. Somehow, across 4000 miles of ocean, the huge mammals navigate precisely, on a predictable timetable. Watch for signs. Fifteen-foot spouts of warm condensing breath punctuate the rhythm of diving and breathing. Occasionally gray whales breach, burst from the water, turn and fall back with a tremendous splash, just playing, or maybe checking their bearings. Filling the left side of the panel is a long, blimp shaped whale with dark skin and patches of white, its opened mouth revealing a curtain of hair-like baleen. A map to the right of the whale has a line of arrows marking the round-trip migration route of Grey whales from their northern summer feeding grounds in the Bering Sea off the west coast of Alaska, then along the west coast of the United States, to their southern mating and calving area in lagoons off the west coast of Mexico. In the center of the panel, three small illustrations show different whale behaviors. From left to right, a submerged whale points downward, only its V-shaped tail above water. Next, a whale underwater with only its head above water and the caption, Spyhopping. Sometimes whales stand nose-up to have a look around. Finally, a whale tail above water with the caption, Diving. As a whale begins a sustained dive, the flukes rise dramatically before disappearing beneath the surface. Spanning the bottom of the panel is a horizontal diagram showing nine positions of a swimming whale, underwater at times, then rising to the surface to breathe. A caption reads, Spouting. Gray whales swim in a pattern that makes them easy to spot. It usually consists of 3 to 5 spouts, followed by a dive that lasts 2 to 5 minutes as they swim along at about 5 miles per hour. After this dive they surface and repeat their breathing pattern.",

Next, a whale underwater with only its head above water and the caption, Spyhopping. Sometimes whales stand nose-up to have a look around. Finally, a whale tail above water with the caption, Diving. As a whale begins a sustained dive, the flukes rise dramatically before disappearing beneath the surface. Spanning the bottom of the panel is a horizontal diagram showing nine positions of a swimming whale, underwater at times, then rising to the surface to breathe. A caption reads, Spouting. Gray whales swim in a pattern that makes them easy to spot. It usually consists of 3 to 5 spouts, followed by a dive that lasts 2 to 5 minutes as they swim along at about 5 miles per hour. After this dive they surface and repeat their breathing pattern.",

On this 4-foot-tall upright wayside panel, text in the bottom right corner reads: Wild Coast. The sea makes the rules. Hiking this long stretch of wilderness beach, you may have to climb headlands, cross numerous streams, enter a cocoon of fog, or follow animal tracks in the sand. There are no sheltered lagoons. If you ignore the tides, storm waves may trap you against a sheer cliff. Find solitude, or a whale’s jawbone, or a kind of bird you’ve never seen before. Filling the top half of the panel is a blue and white drawing of a wave hitting the rocky shoreline below high tree topped hills. A sea stack is offshore. In the bottom left corner, a blue and white drawing shows a hiker holding a hiking pole while traversing a jumble of rocks at the base of a hill, the ocean in the background.",

Text on the left side of the panel reads: Wild Things. Elusive bald eagles, black-tailed deer, river otters and freshwater clams inhabit this area. Two unique varieties of trout, Beardslee (rainbow) and Crescentic (cutthroat), are found only in Lake Crescent. The interface of water and land creates a diversity of wildlife habitats. The illustration shows a narrow stream flowing from left to right between steep banks of moss-covered rocks and ferns. A small waterfall cascades over rocks, then the stream becomes flat. Here, a brown river otter crosses the stream from right to left, its two front feet in the stream and its hind feet on the stream bank. The otter is long and narrow with a long thin tail, flattened head with a small dark oval shaped eye, and a small, rounded ear set back on the side of the head. Its short flat snout has a black nose above the mouth and white whiskers on each side.",

Or go cold-weather camping and become an intimate of winter, another face of wilderness. Below the text, is a drawing of one-half of a snowshoe. The top rounded section is constructed of a stringed material woven in a crisscross pattern to create webbing that is attached to the frame. The center of the snowshoe is open and free of webbing. On the left, a drawing of a person on skis with a ski pole in each hand, faces left toward a downward slope. The skier wears winter clothing and a backpack. Mountain peaks are in the distance.",

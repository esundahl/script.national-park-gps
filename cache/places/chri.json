It served many roles over the centuries: housing the first Danish governors, a prison, an instrument of mass oppression and eventually a place of liberation.<br /> <br /> On the south side of the fort is a triangular shaped area; this is called the \"ravelin.”  The ravelin would split attacking enemy forces.<br /> <br /> A red guard stand is next to the green doors to the fort. Next to the guard stand is a somber reminder that despite the vivid bright colors, Fort Christiansvaern also harbored a darker side. A section of ground is exposed marking the location of the whipping post, where enslaved people were publicly brutalized as a sign of force and oppression.<br /> <br /> The last major additions to Fort Christiansvaern were completed between 1835–1841. The original fabric of the fort remains largely unaltered. In the 1830s, a stable yard was added to the east of the fort and a walled prison yard to the west. It served as the focal point of the Danish presence and control on the island. Fort Christiansvaern is one of the best-preserved colonial forts in the Caribbean and is the largest structure at the historic site. ",

    "bodyText": "During the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark sided with the French after an attack on its Capital, Copenhagen, where the British absconded with most of their naval fleet. The wars ended in 1815, and Denmark saw a need to improve its military capabilities. In 1828, the Danes adopted a new pattern of flintlock musket, the Model 1828. This musket evolved from the earlier pinned and wedge retained barrel designs to the French influenced system that used flat, spring-retained bands to secure the barrels.<br />  <br /> The Danish Model 1828 was a traditional muzzleloading, flintlock ignition, smooth bore musket with a 41” long (.70 caliber) barrel secured by three flat, iron, spring bands. The muskets were 56 ½” in overall length and stock was made of beech wood. The guns were iron except for a brass trigger-guard bow, brass side-plate and a small brass plate in the top of the stock. A fixed rear sight was in the same manner as the Prussian Model 1809 muskets and a front sight was attached to the forward strap of the upper barrel band. The design was credited to Danish Colonel Wildenradt and Ordnance Master Kurtzhals. The gun utilized the Danish Kyhl spring secured socket bayonet. <br /> <br /> At the time, these guns had no major advancements over previous types of muskets, such as rifling or percussion caps, and interchangeable parts, all of which came later in the late 1840s-1850s. None-the-less these guns represented survival and power to those who wielded them and death and oppression to those who found themselves at the wrong end of the barrel.",

    "bodyText": "The upper level of the fort where the cannon are housed is called a <i>barbette</i>. The north facing wall (or scarp) looks out over Christiansted Harbor offering an impressive view, where on clear days, St. Thomas and St. John islands can be seen. <br /> <br /> Today only a few of the cannon that were originally placed inside the fort remain. At first, on this north-facing barbette, stood 8 cannon, all of which were 18-pounder cannon. An 18-pounder cannon shot cannonballs that weighed 18 pounds. However, the cannon themselves weighed around 4600 lbs. The maximum range of these cannon are about 1.25 miles, or 1.6 km.<br /> <br /> Some of the original cannon can be seen throughout Christiansted where they served as bollards starting in the 1830’s, protecting building’s corners from ox drawn carts transporting sugar, molasses, and rum to the wharf. Some along the bulkhead were used as moorings for vessels. Ironic once again how weapons that served to oppress eventually were used for the most menial of tasks.<br /> <br /> Denmark relied heavily on its neutrality in foreign wars to maintain global maritime trade. Until the late 1840s, the role of the limited Danish military presence was to protect commercial shipping in the harbor against attack by pirates or privateers. They were also stationed here to prevent and quash any rebellions by the enslaved of the island. <br /> The guns at Fort Christiansvaern were never fired in aggression, but were, periodically, fired for ceremonial purposes.<br /> <br /> The closest Fort Christiansvaern came to needing to use the cannon in defense was in 1807 when the British arrived to occupy the island with nearly a dozen of the British Royal Navy Warships. Knowing a battle would end poorly for them, the Danish surrendered the Fort and the island. Though the occupation was short lived, it was a reminder to the enslaved people here on St. Croix that even those who were oppressing them were not all powerful after all.<br /> <i><br /> To protect yourself from injury, please do not climb on the cannon. </i>",

The quality of life for the officers, in comparison with the soldiers and then the prisoners is something to be noticed. Picture in your mind what you might have done in this room. Scribbling away on paperwork, writing letters back home to your siblings and parents, playing a game of checkers with one of the younger soldiers who missed his family, or maybe giving corrections to a soldier who had disobeyed orders.<br /> <br /> The rooms to the side of this room served many purposes. Bedrooms, detention cells, storage facility, kitchen, commandant's storage room, police office, barracks and examination room.<br /> Today the closed rooms are now used as the Parks research library and archival office. Once again, a perfect demonstration of change throughout the centuries.<br /> <br /> This Fort served many purposes. It was a place of both justice and injustice. Nevertheless, the preservation and protection of it is vital, if we hope to preserve the history of the people who were impacted, whether negatively or positively, by its presence.<br /> <br /> As you continue to explore the fort and the other areas of Christiansted National Historic Site, look for cluse to St. Croix’s role as the Crossroads of the Caribbean. Here cultures from four continents met, clashed and evolved into the vibrant culture that exists today on “the big island.”",

For without it, their muskets and the balls of death they launched would be nothing but sticks of wood and metal.<br /> <br /> In this room, the windows and doors were placed with bronze, a non-sparking metal, to prevent the ignition of the black powder. Due to high humidity here in the Caribbean, better ventilation systems were incorporated into the structure to provide a better environment for the black powder also.<br /> <br /> Ironic how the very powder they so relied on was so vulnerable to even opposing elements.

    "bodyText": "Constructed on the foundations of an earlier French building, the Church of Our Lord God of Sabaoth was the first established Lutheran church in Christiansted (1753). Construction on the Steeple Building began in 1750 and the steeple tower and clock were added 1794–96. As a Lutheran church, multiple religious organizations—many that admitted Africans and African descendants—rented the space during “off-hours” to hold their services. In 1831 the building was deconsecrated and the Lutheran congregation moved to its present location. Afterward the structure served a number of different uses including: a military bakery and warehouse, community hall, hospital, elementary school, and museum. Despite its multiple uses, the Steeple Building maintained the formal and classical details of 18th century Nordic/Danish architecture. The Steeple Building was restored in 1960 to its circa 1800 appearance and interprets religious and community life under Danish rule. In 2012, the National Park Service completed and installed reproductions of church pews, the pulpit, and the Governor General’s pew box. In partnership with the Department of Planning and Natural Resources / Virgin Islands State Historic Preservation Office, the National Park Service will begin restoration work on the Steeple Building’s 1920’s-era E. Howard & Company time and strike tower clock in 2015, using parts from Fort Frederik’s sister clock that is no longer functional.",

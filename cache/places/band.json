Portions of the trail are relatively flat and can be traveled by wheelchairs and strollers. Other sections have numerous narrow stairs and can be difficult to those with mobility issues or strollers. This is the best trail for anyone wanting to see much of what Bandelier is known for without a long walk.<br /> <br /> As you walk, you will see evidence of the people who lived here in the past. The remnants of stone structures and many carved or a few painted images on the rock walls provide indications of the Ancestral Pueblo people who inhabited this area and the lives they lived. In addition to these physical artifacts, we also gather clues to these past lives from the modern descendants who still live in the pueblos around us. Frijoles (free-HOH-lace) Canyon maintains very important connections for today’s Pueblo people. Please treat this area with respect. You can help the National Park Service preserve this cultural heritage for all to experience. Any disturbance is vandalism and against the law.",

    "bodyText": "Bandelier was established as a National Monument in 1916, but until the mid-30’s the only visitor facility in Frijoles Canyon was a lodge built in 1909 by Judge A. J. Abbott. Even by 1925 when George and Evelyn Frey acquired the lease to run the lodge, the only way for visitors to access the canyon bottom and the lodge was on foot.<br /> <br /> In 1932, when Bandelier was transferred from the United States Forest Service to the National Park Service, Frank “Boss” Pinkley was the Superintendent of the Southwestern National Monuments. He knew that to make it possible for more people to visit Bandelier, improved facilities and better access into the canyon were necessary. When the Emergency Conservation Work Act in 1933 created the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), funding and workers became available to do this work.<br /> <br /> The CCC was a Depression-era program designed to produce public works while providing much-needed jobs and work experience for men between the ages of 17 and 26. With the desperate nationwide lack of employment, young men welcomed the opportunity to get room, board, and training. As soon as a CCC camp was approved for Bandelier, “Boss” Pinkley began putting together plans for the road into the canyon and facilities for visitors. It was considered very important for park structures to harmonize with the environment and local culture, so a regionally popular style often called Pueblo Revival was chosen. The Park Service architect, Lyle Bennett, had worked on several other Park Service and CCC buildings in the Southwest and was well schooled in this style.<br /> <br /> The first project, the road, was opened as a truck trail in 1933. Over the next 8 years the enrollees built 31 stone buildings for visitor facilities, Park Service residences, offices, the fire tower and entrance station, along with the hand-carved wood furniture and pierced-tin light fixtures to furnish them. Their work also included building trails, helping archeologists stabilize the Ancestral Pueblo sites, and widening and completing the road.",

This area was originally built to be the park campground. In 1963, the campground was moved to the mesa top near the park entrance and the old campsites converted into a picnic area. Look for a building on the hill to your left. Completed in 1934, this campground comfort station was the first permanent building constructed by the CCC in Bandelier. Since people often camped for weeks at a time, the comfort station included showers and laundry facilities. The plumbing and electricity for the comfort station was cut off by the 2011 flooding.

    "bodyText": "You will be making use of one more CCC project as you leave the park: the road into the canyon. The road is particularly significant because it was the CCC’s first project here, and it was a real engineering and construction challenge. Until that time the only way to enter the canyon was a steep, switchback walking trail, now known as the Frey Trail, about a half mile up the canyon. To provide the opportunity for more visitors to use the park, a road was a real necessity. Within about a month after the CCC camp was established, the enrollees had built a 12-foot-wide truck trail, which they widened and completed later. It was carefully planned to provide the maximum view of the canyon upon entry, while providing the least possible visual intrusion from the canyon bottom, and the original route and roadbed are still in use. As you drive out of the park, you may notice the original stone gutters, which are carefully maintained. You may also notice several stone houses back from the left side of the road; the CCC built these as residences for park staff and the Superintendent. About a quarter of a mile up the road is a service road (open to employees only). It leads to the stables, which were originally built to house horses for the guests to rent.",

It contained restrooms and was used for storage of linens and the boiler for this complex.<br /> <br /> Each cabin unit has a corner fireplace and was originally furnished completely with CCC hand-made furniture. Most of the furniture is presently in protective storage. The wall material in all the CCC buildings is tuff blocks quarried from the mesa top. The quarry area is now used as the amphitheater in Juniper Campground, where Ranger programs are held on summer evenings. Here in the cabin area is a good place to notice that the walls angle in from bottom to top, which is called “battered.”",

Mrs. Frey always said that she started it with a cutting from a wild canyon grape plant she found along the Rio Grande near the mouth of Frijoles Creek. The windows above it are part of the residence built for Mrs. Frey, which she occupied until her death in 1988; it is now the Superintendent’s office and conference room. The windows across the patio from the Snack Bar door look out of what was the lodge dining room. The patio itself is now filled with picnic tables, but when there were overnight guests staying at the Lodge, it was used for socializing. On some evenings, Pueblo people on the staff would present traditional dances for the guests. Surrounding the patio is another good example of a portal, just as welcome on a hot day now as it was in the 1940’s. On your right notice the wooden gates leading into the patio from the parking lot. The walls on either side of them were originally more than a foot taller, which must have made this space quiet and private, but probably also made it harder for visitors to find their way in.",

The buildings, built in the Pueblo Revival Style to fit with the local culture and surroundings, comprise the largest assemblage of CCC buildings in the National Park System at the time.<br /> <br /> Looking at the Visitor Center, you can see the external structural elements that are part of all the Pueblo Revival style buildings here:<br /> Vigas (VEE-gahs) - beams that support the roof. You will see them inside, and jutting out from the roof about every 4 feet. Each hand-peeled Ponderosa log extends the full width of the structure.<br /> Canales (kah-NAH-lace) - roof drain spouts. Each consists of a log cut to make a drain and then lined with metal, often copper.<br /> Lintels - large squared-off wooden beams over the doorways and windows.<br /> Corbels - supporting blocks at each end of the vigas, often decoratively shaped or carved.<br /> Latillas (luh-TEE-yuhs) - whole or split saplings placed across the vigas to help support the roof.<br /> Bancos (BAHN-kohz) - bench-style built-in seats, usually made of masonry. They are often found on either side of fireplaces.Parapets - raised walls surrounding a flat roof. Canales (drains) are cut through them.<br /> Walls - here, the thick masonry walls are made of blocks of tuff (volcanic ash.). They were originally covered in earthen, lime, or cement plaster. There is ongoing research to find the blend of materials to reconstruct this covering.<br /> Portal (pour-TAHL) - a covered porch space along some buildings.",

The latillas in this room are arranged in a diagonal or herringbone pattern, while others in the complex are usually laid perpendicular to the vigas. The fancy diagonal pattern is usually reserved for public use buildings rather than offices or quarters. The flooring is chunks of native volcanic rock. Building a fireplace in a corner is a tradition widespread in New Mexico, and here bancos were built extending from its sides. There is another corner fireplace in the book store, as well as more tin light fixtures in the museum.",

The original museum exhibits consisted of glass cases containing items related to the past and present Pueblo culture. As a part of the Works Progress Administration Arts Program (WPA), the late Helmuth Naumer Sr. used pastels to depict local scenes and pueblos. Young Pablita Velarde of Santa Clara Pueblo was hired to paint scenes of traditional Pueblo culture as illustrations for the museum cases. She went on to become one of the best-known Pueblo artists. As Pablita later said about her work, “This period of my life at Bandelier, I figure, I’ve learned more about my own people … than I would have … and I appreciate what the old ones have tried to pass on … I want the earth to remember me through my work.”",

    "bodyText": "Ancestral Pueblo people lived at Tsankawi for several hundred years.  They built homes, raised crops, and loved their families.  Seasons passed as they watched snow cover the mountains followed by flowers blooming across the rocky mesas and canyons.  They listened as cranes migrated north in the spring and south in the autumn.  Times were pretty good.  There was enough food from the fields and gathering of the native plants to sustain a secure life.  Trade brought tales and items from distant lands.  As with all things, with time those circumstances changed.  There was not as much food in the pantries.  The sun baked the soil into dust and the summer rains came with less frequency.  Archeologists don’t know all the reasons but by the mid 1500’s the Ancestral Pueblo people began to move away from Tsankawi and the Pajarito Plateau.  When the people decided they must leave, they traveled slightly north and mostly east.  There nearer the Rio Grande, they settled into San Ildefonso Pueblo where their descendants live today.  <br /> <br /> Today, Tsankawi serves an important role in the spiritual lives of the people of San Ildefonso and provides connections with traditions passed down through generations.  You can see many of these cultural activities still being performed if you visit San Ildefonso Pueblo. Check their website for details.<br />  ",

The squirrel also eats the new buds and inner bark of the ponderosa.<br /> <br /> You may think this would be bad for the ponderosas. But, as the squirrel eats the cones, it also eats ectomycorrhizal fungi. This fungi is very beneficial to ponderosa pines, helping the trees retain water.

    "bodyText": "<p>Across the canyon, you can see layered volcanic rock. These are sediments from an ancient maar volcano. A maar volcano is one that erupts through water, such as an underground aquifer. When underground water is suddenly heated, it expands into a significant volume of steam. This expansion creates a vertical eruption of steam, water, molten rock, and debris. Maar volcanos are low and wide. This one is approximately two miles across and 100 feet high. As is common with this type of volcano, the volcano’s bowl was later covered by basalt after the eruption ended. Maar volcanoes are the second most common type of volcanic landforms in the world. (The most common are cinder cones, like Capulin Volcano in northeastern New Mexico.) </p>",

Today most changes are slow, as the soft rock walls of the canyon erode one minuscule particle of stone at a time, the grains giving way to the actions of wind, water, or freeze-thaw cycles. Plants also play a role in shaping the canyon. Their roots penetrate susceptible areas and pave the way for water or ice to break a rock’s grip on its neighbor.On occasion, this slow, plodding process is rapidly advanced by flash flooding. In these instances, rocks, trees, and water are carried ever further on their journey to the Rio Grande and ultimately the ocean. The cacophony of such events soon quiets again, leaving the sounds of gentle water babbling and murmuring over rocks, the strident call of a Steller’s jay, and the thump of an occasional rock as it loses its slow, ongoing fight with gravity.</p>",

Put your nose to the orange-brown bark on a warm day, and the faint smell of vanilla will waft your way. During the last Ice Age, these majestic trees would have dominated not only the canyon, but also the adjacent mesas. As temperatures warmed, the ponderosas have moved ever upward, with only creekside groves and small thickets of trees on the mesas remaining. This trend is expected to continue. </p>",

Cottonwoods get their names from the cotton-like strands that catch the breeze and transport the seeds. Narrowleaf cottonwood can easily be confused with willows. In early spring, willows are distinguished from cottonwoods because they only have one bud scale, which forms a little cap over the developing flower. Before the flood events in 2011 and 2013, willows were rare in this part of the canyon due to the dominance of ponderosa pine. The pines created a thick overstory that blocked light from the willows. The floods downed many tall pines and deposited fresh soils. The new environment seems to benefit the willows. </p>",

Several species of oaks can be found not only in riparian areas like this one, but also in the piñon-juniper woodland and mixed conifer forests of the mesatops. In the canyons, oaks grow into small trees up to 60 feet tall, but usually remain short and shrubby on the drier mesas. The acorns of these trees are an important food for wildlife such as black bears, jays, and rock squirrels. The Ancestral Pueblo people ate these acorns too. Acorns are usually boiled before eating to remove acid that makes them taste very bitter. In autumn, oaks turn yellow or red. However, the dead brown leaves do not fall until the next spring, when new growth begins. </p>",

From studying tree rings scientists know that the natural fire cycle here was a low intensity fire every fifteen years or so. In recent decades several large-scale landscape altering fires have affected this terrain. All of these fires have been caused by human activity. Las Conchas Wildfire in 2011 was the largest, intensely burning over ¾ of the park and having impacts far into the future. That fire reached the mesa across the canyon from you and threatened to destroy the historic park visitor center in the canyon below until heroic firefighting efforts quelled its progress. Look at the difference in vegetation from this side of the canyon to far side. That is the result of fire removing most of the larger trees and leaving more open grasslands.",

In recent years it is not uncommon for this stream to dry up in summer from near Alcove House and downstream. Before Las Conchas Fire in 2011 this stream ran at least past the visitor center during all seasons. Since water is so important to life in the arid southwest, it is reasonable to assume that during much of the 400 years the Ancestral Pueblo lived here this was a year-round water source.<br /> <br /> Water is important to support a diversity of plant life that in turn encourages a wider variety of wildlife. This area near the creek, called a riparian area, hosts the widest array of life in the entire 33,000+ acre monument. Giant water loving cottonwoods and shorter box elder and willow trees line the creekside. Ponderosa pines, junipers, and piñon pine are also found here. This rich array of plant life attracts deer, rabbits, and a host of birds that were important food to the Ancestral Pueblo people.",

    "bodyText": "Frijoles Canyon is carved into a thick layer of volcanic ash that over time compacted into a soft rock known as tuff. This ash was deposited over 1 million years ago in two separate eruptions of the Jemez Volcano, each spewing over 600 times more ash than Mt St Helens in 1980. Tuff is a malleable rock overall and one component within the tuff, pumice, is especially susceptible to erosion by wind and water. Using this quality of the tuff, Ancestral Pueblo people used harder rock, such as basalt found further down this canyon and under the tuff, to enlarge natural erosional cavities into human excavated openings called cavates (CAVE-eights). You will be able to climb ladders into several of these further down the trail.If you are interested in learning more about this fantastic volcanic geology, visit the Valles Caldera National Preserve located about 40 minutes away on Highway 4. The Preserve protects the collapsed top (caldera) of the Jemez Volcano.",

Subsequently the plateau has been carved into a series of narrow canyons and broad mesas by erosion.",

Both provided important sustenance to the Ancestral Pueblo people, one in the form of pine nuts and the other a tart but healthy berry. Three-leaf Sumac, an indigenous bush that has tangy berries, could be made into drink with a sharp taste similar to lemonade. A number of native plants provided either food or other utilitarian needs including farming or hunting implements.",

These wily herbivores are active year-round and are most active and visible at dawn or dusk.  <br /> <br /> From here, there is a choice of routes: climb the narrow rock crevasse straight ahead or continue to the right to a ladder that provides access to mesa top.<br />  ",

How about the one of an elk to the left of the macaw?<br /> <br /> The people of Frijoles Canyon lived, worked, laughed, and died here for over four centuries. In that time, they learned to grow crops, read the weather and the stars, use the abundant natural resources, and live comfortably. However, like all cultures and all societies, things change. Frijoles and the surrounding areas of Bandelier were not abandoned. There was no mysterious migration or sudden disappearance of its people. Old systems gave way to new traditions and ways of life. Although the pueblo people have not lived in the canyon since the late 1500’s, a deep spiritual connection still exists. Pueblo residents often come to visit, remember, and teach the next generation about life in the canyon when their ancestors lived here. We can do the same and take care of it for future generations.<br /> <br /> This is the end of the Pueblo Loop Trail. Continuing and crossing the creek will bring you to the junction with the Alcove House Trail. Turn right to go the half mile to Alcove House, another cliff dwelling 140 feet above the canyon floor with four large ladders to climb up and down. Or turn left to return the half mile back to the Visitor Center and parking. In winter it may be best to back track on the trail you just walked, as the rest of the trail and the creek crossing, can be slick and icy.",

One-seed junipers are short bushy trees that rarely exceed 25 feet.  Their leaves are scale-like and they produce bluish fruit with only a single seed.  The shreddy gray bark of the tree was pounded to become more absorbent and then used as diapers.  The wood makes excellent firewood and thicker branches are often used as the rungs in ladders. Juniper berries are not very tasty but are nutritious and edible. ",

    "bodyText": "The late 1990’s and early 2000’s were a time of sustained drought.  In some localities, including Tsankawi, as many as 97% of the adult piñon pines died.  Without enough moisture, the trees could not produce excess sap to ward off the killing effects of an explosion in the native pine bark beetle population.  For a decade, dead brown piñon trees dominated the viewshed. Today, only mostly decomposed skeletons remain from this mass die-off and numerous baby piñon pines have appeared scattered amid the graveyard of their predecessors.  Only time will tell how many of these pines will live long enough to provide a life supporting crop of nuts.  A piñon pine is approximately 75 years old before it bears its first fruits.  ",

For many years park staff believed the reconstruction was inaccurate due to what appears to be doorways in the front of each room block. However, in recent years, when Talus House received some much-needed TLC to its eroding roof, we discovered that the original rebuilds did indeed include doorways in the roofs that at some point were covered over during past maintenance. Having an opening or doorway in the roof undoubtedly added to the difficulty of keeping the structure intact and reminds us of the constant maintenance that would have been done regularly when these building were inhabited. What appeared to be doorways in the front were actually included to allow visitors a view inside the structures.",

To your left you can see the Frey Trail that carries visitors from the canyon to Juniper Campground. Although today it is a wide dirt trail it was probably a much simpler path in Ancestral Pueblo times. Would you have wanted to hike up from the canyon carrying the farming implements you would need to plant your fields? Imagine how different this view would have been with the many standing structures and farm fields across this mesa during the time the Ancestral Pueblo people called it home.<br /> <br /> If you haven’t done so already, it is highly recommended that you walk the Pueblo Loop Trail you see below. Best times are early or late in the day. You will get a closeup view of many of the canyon’s archeological sites.",

    "bodyText": "The hike to Yapashi pueblo is a beautiful, but strenuous day hike. It is about a 12 mile hike to Yapashi and back, or you can make it a 16 mile loop by continuing on the Stone Lions trail and connecting back to the Visitor Center on the Frijoles Rim trail. Any way you hike to Yapashi you will have cross Alamo canyon twice. There are no water sources on the out and back, but there is usually water in upper Alamo canyon on the loop route. Remember to filter all water in Bandelier. There is also an option for a shorter 7 mile out and back hike out to the edge of Alamo canyon on the Mid Alamo trail, enjoying a snack and the view, and hiking back to the Visitor Center.",

    "bodyText": "You are now on Tsankawi mesa.  Even though you have climbed, you are still in the Piñon-Juniper Woodland.  You can see both trees in great numbers on the mesa.  You can also spot the sharp-edged leaves of a banana yucca (yucca baccata), forming a rosette at the base of the plant.  In early summer, a stalk of soft creamy white flowers may arise from this otherwise hostile-looking plant. Yuccas were very important to the Ancestral Pueblo people.  Almost all parts of the plant are edible including the flowers, the fruits, and the roots.  Soap is made from the roots and the thorns at the end of each waxy leaf make excellent needles for the thready fibers pulled from the leaves.  <br /> <br /> Continue straight on this trail for the best views.  Please do not create additional trails along the mesa top. <br />  ",

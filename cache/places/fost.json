    "bodyText": "<h4><strong>History:</strong></h4> <p>In 1755 two forts were built by the British to protect each end of the Oneida Carrying Place, a strategic land portage located between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek. Fort Bull (Wood Creek Fort) named after its commander Lt. William Bull was located on the western side of the portage and also served as a supply depot for the British garrison at Oswego. Recognizing the strategic importance of the Oneida Carry and the need to disrupt this critical British supply line between Albany and Oswego the French sent Lt. Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry with a force of more than 360 to attack the Oneida Carry. After marching across northern NY for two weeks, de Léry would arrive along the carry road on March 27, 1756, where he ambushed a supply convoy and initiated his attack on Fort Bull. As a result, more than 60 British were either killed or captured, the fort was destroyed and its stores were blown up or dumped into Wood Creek. Within a month of its destruction, the British recognized the need to build a more substantial fortification to replace Fort Bull and began constructing Fort Wood Creek. Today, it is the earthworks of Fort Wood Creek that still remain along with a large boulder monument that was placed on the site in 1907 in recognition of the Battle of Fort Bull.</p> <p>Listed on the State and National Register of Historic Places in 2019 Fort Bull - Fort Wood Creek continues to remain subject to looting and exploitation.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Visitation:</strong><br /> Due to liability issues, the site is open by guided tour only and all access <u>must</u> be approved by the Rome Historical Society.

    "bodyText": "Many flags have flown over the walls of Fort Stanwix/Schuyler. During the French & Indian War, the King's Colors (or British flag) was hoisted over it for the first time in spring of 1759. Today, you can see the modern American flag flying on days the fort is open.<br /> <br /> The most significant flag that was ever hoisted there, however, is still unknown. Several descriptions of it's appearance exist. All are red, white, and blue, however arranged in very different fashions. It was flown throughout the month of August 1777, during a bitter siege that was won by Colonel Peter Gansevoort, his Third New York Regiment, and their allies. On August 2, approximately 1,600 British troops and allies arrived at the fort. The British commander, General Barry St. Leger, offered the Americans escape in exchange for unconditional surrender. By August 3, Gansevoort and his officers gave their response to this offer, as recorded by a young lieutenant: Early this Morning a Continental Flag made by the Officers of Col. Gansevoort's Regiment was hoisted and a Cannon Levelled at the Enemies Camp was fired on the Occasion. Gansevoort himself later issued a statement back to St. Leger on the occasion as well: <em>\"It is my determined resolution...to defend this fort and garrison to the last extremity, in behalf of the United American States, who have placed me here to defend it against all their enemies.\"</em><br /> <br /> Could it have been the \"Stars and Stripes?\" Maybe not … Is the flag the most important thing about the events of August 1777? Again, probably not. The pride associated with the flag is still reflected in the lives of people who live in Rome, New York, and throughout the Mohawk Valley to this day. THIS was the flag that flew at the only American fort to never surrender under attack during the entirety of the American Revolution. So whether it was the Grand Union, New York State, or some other flag that has yet to be discovered, Romans can be proud that like the generations before them, they remember our history and live in one of the birthplaces of our “United American States.”",
    "audioDescription": "A large log cabin style wall juts out from the main fort structure. It is about 20 feet high. Above it, you can see what appears to be a sailboat mast. On the mast pole it is a flag. On the edge of the wall pointed sticks are attached to prevent climbers from ascending them. They look like a wooden collar. Below the wall is a grassy, sloped ditch approximately 10 feet deep and 20 feet wide. A large wooden picket fence surrounds the exterior edge of the ditch.",

The watery landscape allowed for natural protection on that side of the fort.<br /> <br /> On August 6, 1777, Colonel Marinus Willett took approximately 200 soldiers through the sally and raided enemy camps. Their goal was to find General Herkimer, unaware that Herkimer and his forces were under attack at Oriskany.<br /> <br /> <strong>The day's events and raid are described as follows:</strong><br /> \"According to General Harkeman's request, the colonel detached 200 men and one field piece under command of Lieutant Colonel Willett with orders to proceed down the road to meet the generl's party; having marched a mile, they came upon an encampment of the enemy which they totally routed and plundered them of as much baggage as the soldiers could carry. Their loss is supposed to be between fifteen and twenty killed. The number of wounded who got off is unknown. They took four prisoners, three of whom were wounded, and Mr Singleton of Montreal, who says he is a lieutenant, without the loss of one man killed or wounded.<br /> <br /> \"Our party returned immediately and brought in a number of blankets, brass kettles, powder and ball, a variety of cloths and Indian Trinkets and hard cash, together with four scalps the Indians had lately taken, being entirely fresh and left in their camp. Two of the scalps taken are supposed to be those of the girls, being neatly dressed and the hair plaited. A bundle of letters was found in the enemy's camp, which had been sent by a Luke Cassidy for this garrison, who is supposed is either killed or taken; the letters were not broke open. Four colors were also taken, and immediately hoist.\"<br /> <em>Account taken from the Journal of William Colbrath.</em><br /> <br />  ",

They form a square leaving an empty gravel and grass filled space in the middle with a single wooden post and field cannon. There are glass windows in all of them. On the exterior, the large wooden walls fall sharply into a ditch. The ditch is filled with grass. Surrounding the ditch and the grass is a stockade style picket fence.

The Americans won a key victory. When combined with American victories in the Hudson and Lake Champlain Valleys, the Americans were able to defeat British General John Burgoyne and his army after the Battles of Saratoga. This series of battles combined are considered the turning point of the American Revolutionary War.

The portage was replaced by roads, canals, and then railroads. Lynchville (later renamed Rome) was built around then over the site of Fort Stanwix and has enjoyed years of innovation and prosperity because of the commerce that passes through it.<br /> <br /> Monuments dedicated to the Siege of 1777, the Erie Canal, and the commander of the fort, exist in this park today. A statue of Fort Schuyler commander Colonel Peter Gansevoort was dedicated by his granddaughter, Mrs. Katherine Gansevoort Lansing, in the late 1800s. Across the parking lot stands the city of Rome former post office. After the new post office was opened, the Rome Historical Society moved into the building.<br /> <br /> Today, the Fort Stanwix National Monument administrative offices occupy the second story of this historic building as park property sits adjacent to it. ",

This was attacked and looted Aug. 6 by Lt. Col. Willett and 250 Continental troops. Capt. Lerndult and 100 British regulars then erected here a fortified camp with a cannon and held it for the remainder of the siege. Here also was the lock, the starting point for the first canal connecting the waters of the Mohawk and Wood Creek commenced by the Western Inland Lock and Navigation Co. in 1792.\" </p> <p><strong>Location:</strong><br /> The stone and pathway is located on Martin Street, near the intersection of Mill and Martin Streets.

The Oneida Carry was a 2 - 6 mile long portage where boats had to be dragged between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek. It was also the longest portage in the larger New York water way system that connected the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes.<br /> <br /> The area was settled by the Oneida tribe of the Haudenausaunee Confederacy. In the 1600s, Europeans began traveling the area to participate in the lucrative fur trade and prostelelize to the Native population. The path became a critical strategic area during the American Revolution when the Oneidas helped defend nearby Fort Stanwix from British Siege of 1777. The attempted siege failed and the Americans, with their Oneida allies, helped change the momentum of the war.<br /> <br /> One panel of the monument includes a bear, wolf and turtle, which represent the Oneida clans. At front of the monument stands an Oneida ancestor carrying a beaded wampum belt, whose beads would have been cut from the purple and white parts of clam shells. The shell is thought of as a living record of the Haudenosaunee, an alliance among the six Native American nations who are more commonly known as the Iroquois (or Haudenausaunee) Confederacy.<br />  <br /> Another panel of the monument shows the Great Carrying Place, as Native Americans unload goods from boats for trade, which depicts a friendship and peaceful alliance with the newcomers of their land. It became such an important place, that the Europeans would build forts around to protect it, Halbritter said. It would then become a great military complex during the Revolution.<br /> <br /> The sculpture sits 1.5 blocks walking distance from the Fort Stanwix National Monument Visitor Center on West Dominick Street in Rome, NY. </p>",

    "bodyText": "In August 1777, while the British were attacking Fort Stanwix, Brigadier General Nicholas Herkimer assembled 800 Rebel militiamen supported by a party of allied Oneida warriors, and marched from Fort Dayton to aid against the British siege. Upon hearing of Herkimer's advance, Loyalist troops under Sir John Johnson and Col. John Butler, and Indian forces under Seneca leaders Old Smoke and Corn planter, and Mohawk Joseph Brant, set a trap near a series of boggy ravines west of Oriskany Creek. As the unsuspecting American troops crossed through the ravines, the Indians and Loyalists attacked. The militia fought in brutal hand-to-hand combat, and in spite of heavy losses, stood their ground. A Rebel attack on their camps around Fort Stanwix finally caused the Seneca and the Mohawks, followed by the Loyalists to retreat. The militia had lost too many men to continue their advance and retreated back to Fort Dayton. It was in this battle that General Herkimer received the wound to his leg which led to his death ten days later.<br /> <br /> Today, visitors to the battlefield can walk the site, read a series of interpretive signs, and at certain times of the year visit the park’s visitor center.<br /> <br /> <strong>NOTE:</strong> Oriskany Battlefield is managed in partnership with the National Park Service at Fort Stanwix National Monument.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Rome Historical Society - Friends of the Fort sits next to the grounds of Fort Stanwix National Monument. This free museum has exhibits related to the historic fort, the Erie Canal, the history of Rome, NY, and more! Check the <a href=\"https://romehistoricalsociety.org/\">main website</a> for museum hours and research information. <br /> <br /> In 1936, America was still struggling through the Great Depression and attempting to right itself in a world that, in the aftermath of World War I, was rapidly becoming more “global.” Technological advances were fundamentally and continuously altering the fabric of American life, alongside sweeping social changes. It’s not surprising that, out of this moment in history, Americans began to really study matters of American history and American culture.</p> <p>One man with such an urge to examine and preserve the history of American life was Edwin D. Bevitt, the Executive Secretary of the Rome Area Chamber of Commerce. The history of Rome is a long one, with a number of historic sites and interests he felt were not only important to this area, but to American history as a whole. On February 20, 1936, he called a meeting of some of Rome’s most socially and civically minded citizens, to discuss the founding of what would become the Rome Historical Society. This crowd of citizens didn’t require much persuading, and immediately set to work drafting a charter. After many hours of hard work donated by countless people, the Rome Historical Society was granted its provisional charter on September 21, 1936, and a museum was opened in the third floor of the Jervis Public Library, located at 613 North Washington Street. The Rome Historical Society would be granted its absolute charter in 1944.</p> <p>Since receiving its charter, the Rome Historical Society has operated from a number of historic locations. In 1958, Mrs. Alexander Rutherford gifted the Society with the former armory building at 117 East Dominick Street for use as the Fort Stanwix Museum. This building was vacated in 1970 to make way for the construction of Fort Stanwix National Park and other Urban Renewal projects. During the Urban Renewal years, the Society operated from a number of temporary locations, first at a former supermarket building at 112 Spring Street from 1970 to 1974, and then at the Lunger House at 113 West Court Street until 1980.</p> <p>It was in 1980 that the Rome Historical Society would purchase its present location at 200 Church Street. This building was a former United States Post Office, built in 1936 as a part of the New Deal projects being constructed across America, the same year as the Society’s founding. After extensive renovations, the Society’s museum reopened in 1985 and has since operated uninterrupted.</p> <p>From 200 Church Street, the Rome Historical Society operates a 3,700 square foot museum with both permanent and rotating exhibits. These exhibits are based on our collection of more than 40,000 items, carefully preserved in 8,400 square foot artifact storage. The William E. Scripture Research Library is home to more than 10,000 archived books, documents, photographs, and paper records to aid curious genealogists, home and business owners, and seasoned historians alike.</p> <p>The Rome Historical Society was chartered by the State Board of Regents in 1936, the thoughtful undertaking of a number of civically engaged Romans. Their goal was ultimately simple: to foster the study of the historic city of Rome, New York, and to share that history with as many other people as possible</p> <p>At the Rome Historical Society, you can discover the ways Rome has adapted, grown, and changed over time, from its days as a place of portage for colonial traders to its early fortifications like Fort Bull and Fort Stanwix, from a small town briefly named Lynchville to the industrious city of Rome that supplied one-tenth of the world’s copper and was home to Griffiss Air Force Base. The study of Rome, the City of American History, is a densely layered look at what it means to be American, from our earliest colonial history to our global present—and beyond.</p> <p>The Rome Historical Society runs a wide variety of lectures, book signings and other events in their 95-seat Stevens-Kingsley Foundation Auditorium. Also installed in the auditorium is the “Our Goodly Heritage” diorama, a multimedia presentation on Rome’s long and richly storied history.</p> <p>In autumn of 2015 the Rome Historical Society became the official Friends Group of Fort Stanwix National Monument. As a Friends Group we support the mission of the National Park Service to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. This means that Rome Historical Society can accept charitable donations on behalf of Fort Stanwix National Monument to advance mutually beneficial goals.</p> <p>Our role as a Friends Group not only allows us to solicit and accept philanthropic contributions on behalf of Fort Stanwix National Monument, but also allows us to conduct collaborative strategic planning, share resources, partner in the development of exhibits, conduct joint programming, and more.</p> <p>In addition to the Church Street Location, the Rome Historical Society owns and maintains three additional historic sites: The Lower Landing Place, Fort Bull/Wood Creek, and The Tomb of the Unknown Soldiers of the American Revolution. Please see our Historic Sites page to learn more about these locations.</p>",

    "bodyText": "A veteran of the Prussian Army, Frederick Wilhelm Von Steuben was in France in 1777. There he was introduced to Benjamin Franklin and he volunteered his services to advise the ill-trained American army. Starting at Valley Forge, he converted the ragged, starving army into an effective fighting force and developed the logistical system that allowed the army to survive in the field. His program greatly increased morale and strengthened the army. He authored the \"Regulations for the order and discipline of the troops of the United States\", sometimes referred to as the \"Blue Book,\" which still remains a basic reference for military training and organization.<br /> <br /> As gratitude for his wartime contributions, New York State deeded him a large parcel of land in 1786 and congress granted von Steuben a life annuity in 1790. He spent his summers at his two room log house on the site until his large manor house could be built. Steuben also planned on large scale development of his lands. His large house remained unbuilt and only minimal land development had been accomplished when Steuben died in his cabin in November of 1794. Per his request he was laid in an unmarked grave, but road development exposed his grave in 1804. One of his former aids, Benjamin Walker, took charge of his remains and donated part of the land Steuben had bequeathed him as a final resting place for the Baron’s remains. The site today is known as the \"Sacred Grove.\" <br /> <br /> In addition to the “Sacred Grove”, the site also contains a replica of Steuben’s cabin. <br /> <br /> <strong>NOTE: </strong>Steuben Memorial is managed in partnership with the National Park Service at Fort Stanwix National Monument.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "<h4>The Ditch</h4> <p>A typical feature of forts, the ditch at Fort Stanwix surrounds 3/4 of the fort. It never held water, because the water would damage the fort's wood and earth structure. It still proved an effective obstacle and served to increase the height of the walls. During the siege, the ditch was used primarily as a safe area for livestock. Typically, the ditch served as a living space for a majority of families that followed soldiers to the fort. Period documents and artifacts suggest that the families and soldiers lived there in tents and wooden huts.<br /> <br /> <strong>From the Orderly Book of the 1st NY Regiment: </strong><br /> <em>Fort Schuyler 3rd September 1779</em></p> <p><em>G:O  Officer of the Day to morrow Captain Finck for guard Lt VallcenBurgh = no Cowes to be kept in the Ditch for the Futer the Centries in the gates Will not Suffer any to come in from the Date of this Order       <br /> By Order of Col V Dyck</em></p> <h4><strong>The Gardens</strong></h4> <p>Before his arrival to the fort in the spring of 1777, Gansevoort sent a letter to his second in command, Lieutenant Col. Marinus Willett, ordering a garden to be planted near the fort. Orders within state that: </p> <p><em>“As soon as the Season will permit you will have the Garden put in Seed, that the Garrison may not be without vegetables in their Season.”</em></p> <p>The vegetables within provided the lifeline needed to survive on the New York frontier so far away from the main Continental Army Supply lines. Root vegetables such as potatoes and onions were grown in them. As well as cabbage, a standard crop useful in preventing the onset of scurvy (vitamin C deficeny) in th 18th Century. The orginal gardens would've be planted just beyond the fort pickets, downstream from the garrison's main nessecary house; taking full advantage of the free fertilizer!</p> <p> </p>",

The Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldiers would be his last architectural work.<br /> <br /> The tomb was officially dedicated on July 4, 1976, when a contingent of staff and volunteers from Fort Stanwix National Monument laid the eight soldiers in their final resting place at the tomb.<br /> <br /> The Tomb stands on a small park plot on the corner of North James and West Liberty Streets in Rome, New York, and is located near the northwest corner of the restored Fort Stanwix National Monument. </p>",

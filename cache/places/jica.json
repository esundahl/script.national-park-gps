In 1972, Mill Jennings sold the station to Billy Carter, brother of President Jimmy Carter. It became an important landmark in the history of Plains in 1976 when Billy’s station became famous nationwide, as journalists covering Jimmy Carter’s presidential campaign made it their headquarters. In 1981 Billy sold the station to his son- in-law. In 2008, the Plains Better Hometown program acquired the building, opening it as the Billy Carter Museum.",

This three bedroom home served as the Carter home until 1949 when Earl Carter sold the house and the surrounding farm land. Jimmy Carter had left the home in 1941 to attend college. In 1994 the National Park Service purchased the house and seventeen acres to make up the park you see today. A multiyear restoration was started and the house and surrounding farm were returned to their 1937 appearance. In 2000 the house and surrounding farm was opened to the public as the Jimmy Carter Boyhood Farm. ",

The house is surrounded by white sand and has a sidewalk in the front. A large Magnolia tree dominates the front view of the house on the right, while a Jessamine bush dominates the view on the left. In front of the Magnolia and next to the road is a silver mailbox on a wooden post.",

After the bank closed, the building remained empty for several years. Jimmy Carter and his cousin, Hugh Carter, as young boys, sold hot dogs, hamburgers, and ice cream here on Saturdays. Later, in the 1930s, the Post Office was located here and served in this capacity until 1963. About this time, Hugh Carter began to use the building as the office for his worm farm. After Hugh’s death in 1999, it closed and remained closed until 2002. The Plains Better Hometown Program acquired the building and renovated it, naming it “The Buffalo Café at the Old Bank.”",

The Plains Depot was built in 1888 in the center of town, after a railroad employee, Milton Leander Hudson donated the land. Residential neighborhoods soon developed around the depot and despite several changes in railroad management, the town prospered. Although the depot closed in 1951, it was reopened on April 18, 1976 to serve as the Presidential Campaign Headquarters for Jimmy Carter. During that time approximately 10,000 people a day came to Plains to find out about candidate Carter. Many state primary victories, as well as the Presidential victory, were held in the streets around the depot. The depot now contains a self-guided museum with exhibits focusing on the 1976 Presidential campaign.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br /> <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "Legacy of an Outdoor Childhood<br /> <br /> <i>“Why do you fish and hunt?” I’m often asked. The easiest answer is: “My father and all my ancestors did it before me. It’s been part of my life since childhood, and part of my identity, like being a southerner or a Baptist.”</i><i>I could add that, during the proper seasons, the urge within me to be in the woods and fields or along a stream is such a strong and pleasant desire that I have no inclination to withstand it.\"</i><br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter 1994, <i>An Outdoor Journal</i><br /> <br /> Young Jimmy Carter heard the doctrine of stewardship – how to care for God’s gifts – from his father, in his church, and at school in the Future Farmers of America. During the 1930s, he saw Earl Carter terrace his eroded fields, preserve wildlife, and plant pine trees on marginal land. The boy who loved to be outdoors became a governor and a president known for his strong environmental stands. When he signed the Alaska Lands Bill in 1980, Jimmy Carter placed more acres into conservation than had any other president.<br /> <br /> Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter promoted tree farming in the 1980s. Farmers like the Carters have planted so many trees that today more pines grow in Georgia than 100 years ago. With more acres of commercial forests than any other state, timber is one of Georgia’s most profitable agricultural crops.<br /> <br /> Photo: Rosalynn Carter holds a small pine tree as she and Jimmy Carter stand in a field.",

Here Jimmy Carter mastered the rules and the roles he would carry all the way to world leadership.

His parents, “Mr. Earl” and “Miss Lillian,” raised four children to value education, community service, their Christian faith, and each other.<br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter left his parents’ farm after high school, intending to spend his life as a naval officer. When his father died of cancer in 1953, Jimmy Carter came back to his Georgia roots – but not to this home of his boyhood.<br /> <br /> Small Photo: Ensign Carter married Rosalynn Smith, his sister Ruth’s close friend, just after his graduation.

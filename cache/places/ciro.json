As the crust is stretched (pulled apart), high angle faults develop. Along these faults, mountains uplift and valleys drop, creating the distinctive mountain ranges and wide valleys of theBasin and Range province.  <br /> <br /> As rocky ranges rise, the newly exposed rock is immediately subjected to <u>weathering</u> and erosion. This rock is attacked by water, ice, wind, and other erosive agents, that have produced many of the geologic features visible today.  <br /> <br /> The majority of outcrops at City of Rocks, and all of the pinnacles, consist of <u>intrusive igneous rock</u> with a granitic composition. Geologists have mapped the two different types of granitic rock within the Reserve as the Green Creek Complex and the Almo pluton.  </p>",

Radiometric analysis indicates that the Green Creek granite may be as old as 2.5 billion years (<u>Archean</u>) and is considered to be some of the oldest rock exposed on the continent west of the Mississippi River. This granite has a porphyritic texture, meaning it is composed of crystals of two distinct sizes.The larger crystals are potassium feldspar. They are embedded in a matrix of smaller crystals consisting of quartz, biotite, and plagioclase feldspar. <br /> <br /> Feldspars are the most common family of silicate minerals. They are broadly divided into two groups: sodium and calcium bearing feldspars, called plagioclase, and potassium bearing feldspars, called orthoclase, microcline or sanidine, depending on their crystallographic structure. </p>",

The pluton started out as an intrusive body of magma and has a convoluted contact with the Green Creek Complex. It is the youngest rock at City of Rocks and formed about 28 million years ago. <br /> <br /> Unlike the granite of the Green Creek Complex, the Almo pluton has an equigranular texture. Notice in the photograph the small uniform size of the crystals in the Almo pluton in contrast to the variety of sizes in the Green Creek Complex. <br /> <br /> Both types of granite are cut in many places by dikes of pegmatite, a very coarse-grained granitic rock that usually forms during the last stages of crystallization of a large granitic pluton. The pegmatites at City of Rocks contain large quartz and feldspar crystals about the size of a fist. </p>",

These images are rare reminders of ancient human history and that people have interacted with this landscape for thousands of years. <br /> <br /> Images on rock or rock art were produced by many cultures worldwide. Petroglyphs are pecked or incised into the rock and pictographs are painted. Both types are found in this region, displaying images of animals, people, geometric designs, and natural features.<br /> <br /> Pictographs can serve a variety of purposes. They are visual reminders of events, or serve to transmit information about the environment. These images may be communication between human(s) and the supernatural, or between two or more people.<br /> <br /> Perhaps the images here were created during a healing ceremony, a vision quest, or a prayer to the creator, to a spirit helper, or to hunted animals. They might be symbols, or a sign marking the way, reminders of a vision and not meaningful to any other individual.<br /> <br /> These pictographs were identified in 2003 by a park ranger and have been professionally documented. This documentation included the photographs seen here, taken with polarized light to capture pigment not visible to the unaided eye. Still unknown are the originator(s), age of the images, and the material used to paint the rock.<br /> <br /> Can you find the designs in the pictographs on the rock?",

A joint is a type of extension fracture formed by movement of the rock in a direction perpendicular to the plane of fracture. Joints form in solid rock that is stretched and its brittle strength (the point at which it breaks) is exceeded. When this happens, the rock fractures. <br /> <br /> The presence of joints allows water to infiltrate the rock and makes the granite vulnerable to weathering. The joints also trap soils, creating micro-habitat for a number of cliff-loving plants, such as ferns, limber pine, and pink alumroot. </p>",

These hollows gradually enlarge through the creation of a sheltered micro-climate that facilitates the accumulation of salt. Salt is a corrosive agent that expands when dry and breaks apart the granitic minerals. While salt minerals do occur naturally in the granite, they are more likely transported by wind and rain from the playas of the Great Salt Lake basin, only 30 miles south of here.  <br /> <br /> As salt eats away the interior, the case-hardened outer layer or shell erodes much slower, creating delicate arches, windows, and honeycombs.  </p>",

The longer water remains on the granite surface, the greater the dissolution of minerals by acidic water. One way that rainwater becomes acidic is when it mixes with decaying vegetation. Another way is when minerals in the rock leach into the water. <br /> <br /> Panholes are sometimes incorrectly called potholes. Actually, a pothole is formed in the rocky bed of a stream by the grinding action of stones. There are no known potholes within the Reserve. One of the nearby locations to easily find potholes is in the basaltic bedrock of the Snake River, 50 miles north of here. </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Going-to-the-Sun Road closes to vehicle traffic in the winter just past Lake McDonald Lodge. Though this section of the road is closed in the winter to vehicles, the road remains open to hikers and skiers. Winter visitors can park at the Lake McDonald Lodge parking lot, which remains open for winter recreation, even though the lodge is closed. Gentle terrain, generally ample snow, and easy access makes this the most popular skiing area in the park. The following areas are recommended to snowshoe and ski.  <br /> <br /> McDonald Falls, 4 miles roundtrip. Ski up the road 1.8 miles. Turn left and ski a short distance to the bridge over McDonald Creek for a view of McDonald Falls.  <br /> <br /> Sacred Dancing Cascade, 5.3 miles roundtrip. Follow the route to McDonald Falls. Ski across the bridge and turn right. Ski upstream one mile along the west bank of McDonald Creek. Cross the foot bridge over the creek, then turn right and follow the road back to Lake McDonald Lodge.  <br /> <br /> Avalanche Picnic Area, 11.6 miles roundtrip. Ski up the unpaved road about 5.3 miles to Avalanche Picnic Area. Avalanche Lake is also accessible from here for skiers but there are steep narrow sections that can be difficult to ski up and down, especially when icy. The Trail of Cedars is generally not good skiing.  </p>",

In the summer, grizzlies are often seen churning up meadows, looking for food like glacier lily bulbs and ground squirrels. Bears are omnivores, which means they eat both plans and meat. You might be surprised to learn that in Glacier National Park, most of a grizzly bear’s diet is plants, especially berries. During the winter months, when food is nearly nonexistent, bears will hibernate, living off fat reserves.<br /> <br /> Grizzly bears depend on high energy foods to get them through their long hibernation in winter. The meadows the grizzly bears depend on to find their yummy plants and roots are being filled in with trees. It seems that the warmer the climate gets, the more trees that can move into the meadows. Also, foods like whitebark pine nuts help the bears to build up enough fat to hibernate through the winter. These pine nuts have all but disappeared in Glacier because of a disease called white pine blister rust that is killing the whitebark pine trees. Bears have to find other foods to replace the nutritious pine nuts they used to depend on. Protected places like Glacier National Park provide a diversity of food sources for these super excavators.</p> <p paraeid=\"{3115bb90-04cd-4e06-86d3-dfe500aa6358}{142}\" paraid=\"1369756085\"><br /> <strong>Mountain Explorer (Wolverine) </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{3115bb90-04cd-4e06-86d3-dfe500aa6358}{160}\" paraid=\"784035435\"><em>Did You Know?</em> Wolverines are super explorers. They routinely travel hundreds of miles a week through some of the most remote regions of the park. As they explore their territory and look for food, even the high peaks like Mt. Cleveland are no obstacle. One male wolverine climbed 5,000 feet in 90 minutes on his way up and over the summer. <br /> <br /> Researchers in Glacier National Park have found that the deep snow covers up their burrows where they have their babies in the middle of winter. The air trapped in the snow makes it act like a blanket over the cold ground, keeping their burrows cozy for their young. Wolverines may suffer if they cannot find enough places with deep snow that they can burrow underground into to have shelter for their families. Right now, protected places like Glacier National Park provide important strongholds for these super explorers.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Two panels stand upright along a trail overlooking the sub-alpine meadow in Logan Pass. One panel is titled \"Meadow Excavators,\" and the other is \"Mountain Explorer.\" The title of this panel is Meadow Excavators. All of the content and illustrations are in the format of an action style comic. There are two illustrations, both reflect the summer and spring grizzly bear’s activities leading up to the winter season. In an artistic comic book style, this panel illustrates the grizzly bear’s special super digging powers in order to find food in to its surroundings while living in the Sub Alpine ecosystem of Logan Pass. On the left there is an image of a large grizzly bear vigorously digging in the earth for glacier lilies. Its long claws are tossing dirt and grass aside with ease.It has a mouthful of leaves and a yellow glacier lily. It has turned its head as if to look right at you. Above the grizzly’s head appears a speech bubble and the bear says “Yum! I dig glacier lilies. It’s a good thing I have big paws and strong shoulders.” To the right of the grizzly bear is an illustration of a very relieved ground squirrel. It is standing upright on a rock and surrounded by glacier lilies, and holding its mouth in surprise while the grizzly devours the glacier lilies a short distance away. A thought bubble appears above its head and it says to itself “Yikes! I’m glad he doesn’t see me and is more interested in glacier lilies right now.” At the bottom of the panel the words “Did You Know?” appear and to the right additional information is provided. … (read the did you know section). The title of this panel is Mountain Explorer. All of the content and illustrations are in the format of an action style comic. There are two illustrations depicting the harsh winter season. In an artistic comic book style, this panel illustrates the wolverine’s special ability to explore hundreds of miles each week through some of the most remote regions of Glacier National Park with ease. On the left there is a snow covered mountain. There is a strong wind blowing and a trail of animal footprints is visible extending over several mountaintops, but no animal present in the image. There is a signpost present shaped like an arrow, covered in snow, and pointing to the right. The words written on the sign read “summit.” The sign and the unknown animal footprints are going in the same direction. The illustration on the right depicts a wolverine standing proudly at the top of the summit. It has a necklace with a compass hanging around its neck, and it holds a stick with a blue flag at the end. The wind and snow is blowing by the wolverine wildly. A comment bubble appears above its head and reads the wolverines location, “Mt. Cleveland Summit. 10,466 ft. highest peak in Glacier National Park. Beside this image is an illustration of a ground squirrel resting, curled up, hibernating and dreaming. A thought bubble appears above the squirrel’s head as it dreams about the wolverine’s amazing journey to the summit, “That must take a lot of energy. I bet he’s hungry and would love to find me!” At the bottom of the panel the words “Did You Know?” appear and to the right additional information is provided. … (read the did you know section).",

Before Glacier National Park was established in 1910, oil wells could be seen below active glaciers.  <br />  <br /> Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that warms the planet. High elevation areas like Logan Pass are warming much faster than the global average, causing glacier retreat here and around the globe.  <br />  <br /> Charted below in red, you can see that since early drillers moved into this area the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen sharply.  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{186}\" paraid=\"2005846129\">If the old stories are true, early prospectors were lured to natural oil seeps in Glacier by bears that had wallowed in the “black gold.” In 1892, a local paper presumed that this was “the only case where bears have been the guides of men to valuable deposits beneath the surface of the earth.”  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{192}\" paraid=\"303837474\">By the end of 1901, the Butte Oil Company had started drilling Montana’s first oil well at the head of Kintla Lake in what is now the northwest corner of the park. Others thought they would find fortune by drilling in the Many Glacier Valley, pictured here.  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{206}\" paraid=\"1931252613\">But the dream of riches did not pan out. One prospector was able to pipe just enough gas to burn for warmth in the winter. No one else did much better. The eager team at Kintla only ever found enough to get their hopes up. Then, sometime in the winter of 1902-1903, the accidental ignition of leaking gas sparked a fire that destroyed their whole operation. What little oil they had found, along with their buildings and equipment, went up in a cloud of black smoke.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{212}\" paraid=\"1547221170\"> <br /> The oil boom ended by the time the park was established, but carbon dioxide molecules released in that fire are still in the atmosphere, adding to the 421 parts per million (ppm) recorded in 2022, warming the Earth and melting the glaciers. </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{218}\" paraid=\"1921080659\"> <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{222}\" paraid=\"151974625\"><strong>A Century of Concerns </strong><br /> <br /> “An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature,” wrote Eunice Foote in 1856. Her research is the first known to have demonstrated the existence of greenhouse gases. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide levels were consistently around 280 ppm for about 6,000 years. <br />  <br /> “The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas,” is releasing carbon dioxide and warming the climate, announced a 1965 report from the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. These changes “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings,” the Johnson report cautioned. <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{234}\" paraid=\"1020188572\">“It is becoming increasingly clear that we should anticipate substantial climate change during the next several decades as a result of man’s impact on the composition of the atmosphere.” That was the warning from NASA scientist, Dr. James Hansen to Congress in March, 1982. <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{250}\" paraid=\"971038253\">The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached 421 parts per million (ppm) in 2022, the highest concentration in human history. “We have known about this for half a century, and have failed to do anything meaningful about it,” said senior NOAA scientist, Pieter Tans.<br />  </p> <hr /> <p paraeid=\"{dac5a160-a862-438c-9b18-4e884c01fe1a}{250}\" paraid=\"971038253\"><br /> <br /> <strong>Solutions & Benefits</strong><br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{184}\" paraid=\"2118420953\">How did you get here? It’s likely that burning fossil fuels was your only choice for traveling to Logan Pass. That is how it’s been for most visitors since Going-to-the-Sun Road first opened in 1933. For over a century, fossil fuels have taken us anywhere we wanted to go.</p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{190}\" paraid=\"231760022\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{194}\" paraid=\"1123800208\">Though unintended, burning these fuels releases greenhouse gases that warm the climate. Limiting this warming requires shifting away from fossil fuels. Besides mitigating climate change, there are many other benefits to this transition.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{200}\" paraid=\"1440137662\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{204}\" paraid=\"1875596129\">Electric vehicles and appliances powered by renewable energy are more efficient, quieter, and safer. Fossil fuels may have been your only choice today, but alternatives—and their side benefits—are quickly becoming widespread.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{210}\" paraid=\"124154471\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{214}\" paraid=\"1817486045\">For these reasons and more, Glacier National Park has already begun an effort to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, lowering its greenhouse gas emissions. From remote areas like Polebridge and Goat Haunt to busy hubs like the Apgar Visitor Center and park headquarters, Glacier is transitioning to renewable sources of energy.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{220}\" paraid=\"117018904\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{f268db82-7394-4eae-8044-bbb3abc9eb29}{224}\" paraid=\"772085794\">The Logan Pass Visitor Center showcases these efforts. Open during the sunny summer months, this area obtains all of its electricity from solar panels—a model of sustainability. </p>",

At the end of August, they go into a special type of sleep called hibernation. From September through May, they snooze underground. Would you like to sleep through the whole school year? To survive that long without eating, they need lots of fat, so they spend the summer gorging themselves on plants. </p> <p paraeid=\"{eeb8c21c-2cd3-4561-8f22-35e9279467a8}{119}\" paraid=\"1574642640\">Marmots spend their whole lives in the alpine. They live in boulder fields, called talus, or in rocky meadows. They are skilled burrowers that spend most of their lives (80%) underground. During the summer, marmots use their burrows to raise their young, and to escape from predators. In winter, the deep snow that piles up over their burrows is important because it’s like a white blanket, keeping the ground warmer when the air temperatures above the snow get super cold. A low snow year means a “thinner blanket” for keeping the marmot’s burrow from freezing. Every super power has a weakness, and for the marmot it is being able to put on enough fat during the short summers to survive their long hibernation. Young marmots can lose half of their body weight during hibernation! Not to mention that while they are sound asleep underground in winter, they can become easy prey to a hungry, super-exploring wolverine. The adventures of this super sleeper will continue to be played out here in Glacier National Park.<br /> <br /> <strong>Super Reaper (Pika) </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{eeb8c21c-2cd3-4561-8f22-35e9279467a8}{141}\" paraid=\"308543899\"><em>Did You Know?</em> Pikas cut and gather grass and wildflowers all summer. These small-but-mighty super reapers store grass and flowers in large piles, to eat during the long winter. One 5-ounce pika can reap 30 pounds of food each summer. That’s 100 times its body weight! If you had a super-reaping power, which food would you store up? <br /> <br /> These super reapers require a cold climate. Pikas have difficulty keeping their bodies from over-heating if it gets too warm outside. Temperatures can reach higher than 90 degrees where they live in their alpine habitats. As their climate gets warmer each year, it may become too warm for them, and they may disappear. Glacier National Park researchers and citizen scientists monitor these super reapers to help understand more about how they survive as climate changes the way they live.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Two panels stand upright along a trail overlooking the sub-alpine meadow in Logan Pass. One panel is titled \"Super Sleeper,\" and the other is \"Super Reaper.\" The title of this panel is Super Sleepers. All of the content and illustrations are in the format of an action style comic. There are two illustrations, one depicting the spring and summer seasons and the other reflecting the transition into the winter season. In an artistic comic book style, this panel illustrates the marmot’s special ability to sleep all winter while living in the sub alpine ecosystem of Logan Pass. On the left there is a summer and spring season illustration. An image of a marmot appears sitting on a rock with flowers around it, and mountains and trees are in the distance. A thought bubble appears above the marmot and it says to itself, “What a life! I get to spend all summer eating and then hibernate all winter. Ahhhh.” A small image of a squirrel appears to the right of the marmot and it is vigorously eating flowers. A thought bubble appears above the squirrel’s head and it says to itself, “I’m with her. I like to sleep all winter, too. I must get fat. (Much munch munch). To the right of the summer and spring illustration is the winter rendering depicting how marmots hibernate together in their underground dens. Above the comfortably sleeping marmot’s den is a thick layer of snow. The image conveys how the marmots live in relative comfort while hibernating during a harsh winter. At the bottom of the panel the words “Did You Know?” appear and to the right additional information is provided. The title of this panel is Super Reaper. All of the content and illustrations are in the format of an action style comic. There are three illustrations, each reflect the spring, summer, and winter seasons as the pika prepares for the long winter. In an artistic comic book style, this panel illustrates the pika’s special super reaping powers as it strives order to collect enough food for winter survival while living in the sub alpine ecosystem of Logan Pass. On the left there is an image of a pika standing on a rock during the spring collecting grass with its mouth. The image appears to be a transition from winter to early spring as there appears to be snow still on the ground. There is a thought bubble above the pika’s head and it says to itself, “so much to do, so little time. I’ve got to harvest lots of plants for winter.” The second image to the right is based on summer. With the sun shining high in the sky, the pika stands on a mountain of rocks with a huge pile of grass in the background and some at its feet. A speech bubble appears above the Pika’s head. With its head held high the pika exclaims, “Yea! I did it.” In the distance and northward on the rocks a ground squirrel seems slightly envious. A speech bubble appears above its head and it complements the pika by saying “Nice-size hay pile.” The third image on the right depicts the pika resting in its burrow as snow piles above the rocks and lining of hay. The pika leisurely chews a piece of grass. A thought bubble appears above the pika’s head and it says to itself, “let it snow.” At the top of the image is another image of the ground squirrel in its burrow. It’s is curled up and cozy with its eyes closed and reflecting on the hardworking pika. A thought bubble appears above the ground squirrel’s head and it comments, “just watching pika made me tired.” Then it “ZZZZZZZ.” Drifts off to sleep. At the bottom of the panel the words “Did You Know?” appear and to the right additional information is provided.",

It’s almost like they can be invisible. They get two sets of feathers every year: a brown set for summer and a white set for winter. That way, they can be camouflaged year-round. The super hiding power of their feathers helps to keep them from being eaten by predators. <br /> <br /> With their super hiding powers, you may hear ptarmigan before you see them. One of this super power’s weaknesses is that it can be very talkative when it’s with ptarmigan friends. They blow their own cover! Ptarmigan change color when they sense the shorter days and colder temperatures of winter coming. The ptarmigan’s invisibility cloak of white feathers won’t help it if it rains in winter instead of snows. The ground will be brown and the ptarmigan will have turned white. That makes it easy for one of their arch enemy predators to find them! Like the super reaper pika, ptarmigan have lived so long in the cold that their bodies can’t get rid of heat when it gets too hot. Ptarmigan need snow banks to keep cool by and little trickles of water nearby throughout the summer. Protected places like Glacier National Park are providing clues to the ability of animals like the super hider ptarmigan to change with a changing climate.</p> <p paraeid=\"{738141d4-1d24-4689-b043-567a9136fd96}{102}\" paraid=\"445886715\"><br /> <strong>Super Seekers (Weasel) </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{738141d4-1d24-4689-b043-567a9136fd96}{118}\" paraid=\"1888662686\"><em>Did You Know? </em>Weasels are super seekers. Their fur changes from brown in the summer to white in the winter, so they blend in with the background all year long. Their long, sleek bodies are low to the ground, allowing them to sneak up on prey long before being seen. Small mammals and birds need to be on the alert to avoid these super seekers.  <br /> <br /> This super power’s weakness, like the ptarmigan’s, may be to change color and be white when it hasn’t yet snowed. Then they would also be more visible to other predators looking to eat them. That would be a good thing for the other predator! For the weasel, their super seeking power wouldn’t work as well if they weren’t camouflaged. It would be a lot harder to sneak up on its prey. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Two panels stand upright along a trail overlooking the sub-alpine meadow in Logan Pass. One panel is titled \"Super Hiders,\" and the other is \"Super Seeker.\" The title of this panel is Super Hiders. All of the content and illustrations are in the format of an action style comic. There are two illustrations, one reflecting the transition into the winter season and the other depicting the spring and summer seasons. In an artistic comic book style, this panel illustrates the ptarmigan’s special ability to blend in to its surroundings, remaining hidden and safe from predators while living in the Sub Alpine ecosystem of Logan Pass. On the left there is an image of two ptarmigan. One ptarmigan is completely white standing on thick white snow and blending in. The other ptarmigan is only partially white and partially brown standing within a mixture of newly fallen snow and still visible brown rocks and earth. A comment bubble appears above the all-white ptarmigan’s head and it says to the other “Come on over; the snow is great! A comment bubble appears above the ptarmigan with mixed colors and it replies, “Not yet. I’m still changing into my winter feathers.” At this point in their color transformations, both ptarmigan are blended into their respective environments. To the right of the winter illustration is the summer & spring rendering depicting a completely brown ptarmigan standing confidently, and camouflaged within brown rocks and earth. A comment bubble appears above its head and it boasts to itself “I really blend in. I’m almost invisible! Below this image is an illustration of a ground squirrel standing upright, looking into the distance for the bird he saw moments ago. A comment bubble opens next to the ground squirrel and it exclaims “Hey! Where did that bird go?” At the bottom of the panel the words “Did You Know?” appear and to the right additional information is provided. The title of this panel is Super Seekers. All of the content and illustrations are in the format of an action style comic. There are two illustrations, one reflecting the winter season and the other depicting the spring and summer seasons. In an artistic comic book style, this panel illustrates the weasel’s special ability to blend in and sneak up on prey while living in the Sub Alpine ecosystem of Logan Pass. On the left there is an image of a white weasel blending in with the white snow during the winter. The weasel appears to be scanning the snow for a potential meal and staring at two objects in the distance. To the right of the white weasel and a short distance away, lie two all-white Ptarmigan. All three of these characters notice each other but are having trouble identifying what one another are because they each blend into the snow so well. The only noticeable features these creatures have that stand out from the snow are the black tip on the weasel’s tail, and the red stripes above the Ptarmigan’s eyes. A thought bubble appears above weasels head as it says to itself “HMMMM. What are those red dots over there?” A comment bubble appears above one of the ptarmigan’s head as it says to the other, “Hey is that what I think it is?” A thought bubble appears near the other Ptarmigan’s head as it says to itself, “what are you looking at? I don’t see anything.” To the right of the winter illustration is the summer & spring rendering depicting the same weasel with brown fur blending in with the brown rocks and earth and sneaking up on a ground squirrel. The ground squirrel is obviously shocked. The comment bubble above its head reads” Yikes! How did he get so close?” From behind a rock, and poised to attack lies the brown weasel. The thought bubble above his head reads, “Tee Hee Hee, He didn’t even see me sneak up. At the bottom of the panel the words “Did You Know?” appear and to the right additional information is provided.",

Their huge, curved horns grow bigger each year and can weigh over 30 pounds. They also have extra-thick skulls. It’s like they wear super-protective helmets. They use their power each fall during contests for females. The strongest head-banger wins. <br /> <br /> Bighorn sheep need wide, open spaces, unobstructed by trees. They want to be able to see long distances so they have lots of time to get away from their predators. As the climate warms, and the alpine meadows in Glacier National Park are filled with trees, sheep will have less open space. Sheep populations can also be weakened by disease. They are social animals, so when a disease strikes one, it strikes them all. Protected places like Glacier National Park provide important year round habitat for these super head bangers.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3115bb90-04cd-4e06-86d3-dfe500aa6358}{26}\" paraid=\"80042767\"><strong>Cliff Hangers (Mountain Goat) </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{3115bb90-04cd-4e06-86d3-dfe500aa6358}{44}\" paraid=\"1705219234\"><em>Did You Know?</em> Mountain goats have super climbing powers. They have split hooves with two toes that spread wide to help them balance. They also have a rough concave pad on the bottom of each tow that helps them grip steep cliffs. <br /> <br /> Although they are super climbers, the steep areas they live in are also places with lots of avalanches. When those huge slabs of snow slide down the mountainside, mountain goats can be caught in their destructive paths. Also, in order to live in these high peaks, goats have warm thick coats to survive the cold temperatures in the winter. They shed these coats in summer but still need snowfields and shaded places to stay cool in as summer temperatures heat up. Glacier National Park researchers and citizen scientists are keeping tabs on these super climbers to help understand more about them.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Two standing exhibits are along a trail The title of this panel is head Bangers. All of the content and illustrations are in the format of an action style comic. In an artistic comic book style, this panel illustrates the male big horn sheep’s natural ability to use the special strength of their heads and horns to clash with one another while living in the sub alpine ecosystem of Logan Pass. The word KA-BOOM!!! Is written across the page. On the right there is an illustration of a ground squirrel as it emerges from a burrow of rocks and grasses, exhausted, yawning and rubbing its eye. A speech bubble appears above its head and reads, “what’s all that noise? It’s November and I’m trying to sleep.” KA-BOOM!!! In the center of the page there is an illustration of a sub alpine meadow covered with snow. In the distance there are mountains and trees. Two male bighorn of similar size are clashing together. KA-BOOM! To the left of the male sheep and a short distance away there is a female big horn sheep gracefully eating a mouthful of grass. A thought bubble appears above her head and reads, “Whoa! I can’t believe they don’t crack their skulls open when they fight over me like that!” KA_BOOM! To the right and below the image of the ground squirrel is an image of a male bighorn sheep with a large sized chip missing from his right horn. Besides that minor cosmetic blemish, he appears to be fine. At the bottom of the panel the words “Did You Know?” appear and to the right additional information is provided. The title of this panel is Cliff Hangers. All of the content and illustrations are in the format of an action style comic. In an artistic comic book style, this panel illustrates the goat’s special ability to climb almost anywhere while living in the sub alpine ecosystem of Logan Pass. On the right there is an illustration of a newborn goat climbing on a small cliff. In the distance there are mountains and tree tops visible. The small goat does not seem to be nervous as it easily balances itself on a cliff where most animals would not dare go. A speech bubble appears above the little goat’s head and it exclaims, “look ma, I’m climbing just like you.” Several feet below the cliff the mother goat watches her child closely. A speech bubble appears beside her and she responds proudly, “Good job, kiddo! Your older brother didn’t climb that cliff until he was a week old.” An image appears on the right hand side and depicts the small goat imagining itself as a superhero. It’s wearing a yellow cape that reads “super kid” across the back. On the left side of the panel there is a ground squirrel standing upright appearing to be shocked while observing the little goat balancing itself on the cliff. A speech bubble appears above the ground squirrel’s head and it reads, “Wow! How did that little guy get way up there?” At the bottom of the panel the words “Did You Know?” appear and to the right additional information is provided.",

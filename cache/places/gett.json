The town and outlying areas were devastated by this monumental man-made disaster. It would be this immense loss of life that led to the creation of a new cemetery and President Lincoln’s trip to Gettysburg where he would give the Gettysburg Address.",

    "bodyText": "This line of monuments marks the positions of Union infantry of General John Gibbon’s 2nd Division, 2nd Corps, and General Abner Doubleday’s 3rd Division, 1st Corps, on July 3. Each Union army corps had adopted a patch which the men generally wore on their hats. The symbol for the 2nd Corps was a trefoil. This corps occupied Cemetery Ridge on July 2 and July 3 which is why you will see many trefoils on monuments along the ridge.<br /> <br /> One of the more unique monuments along this line honors the 20th Massachusetts Infantry. The 20<sup>th</sup> had the nickname “The Harvard Regiment,” because a number of their officers were graduates of Harvard College. The regiment’s colonel was Paul Joseph Revere, the grandson of Paul Revere. He was killed by artillery fire on the afternoon of July 2. Among its lieutenants was Sumner Paine, a great grandson of a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Paine was killed during the repulse of Pickett’s Charge. The monument consists of a 30-ton pebbledconglomerate rock known as “Roxbury puddingstone,” named for the town of Roxbury, Massachusetts. The idea for the monument came from some members of the regiment from Roxbury who, as children, had played on such boulders. In 1983, the “Roxbury puddingstone” became the official rock of the state of Massachusetts.<br /> <br /> The men of the 20th and the regiments around them endured the artillery bombardment before Pickett’s Charge as best they could. On the night of July 2, with a single shovel shared by the men, the regiment dug what one described as “a slight rifle-pit, a foot deep and a foot high.” This afforded the men some shelter from the artillery fire, but since most of the Confederate shells were directed at the Union artillery or overshot the ridge, losses were light. When the Confederate infantry advanced, the Union soldiers allowed them to come close before opening fire. Captain Henry Abbott, serving with the 20th, described the fighting in the after-action report of his regiment:<br /> <br /> “<i>After the cessation of the enemy’s artillery fire, their infantry advanced in large force. The men were kept lying on their bellies, without firing a shot, until orders to fire came from Colonel Hall, commanding the brigade, the enemy having got within 3 or 4 rods of us [15 to 20 yards], when the regiment rose up and delivered two or three volleys, which broke the rebel regiment opposite us entirely to pieces, leaving only scattered groups.</i>”<br /> <br /> Another soldier in the 20<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts:<br /> <br /> “<i>From the moment that the men of the Twentieth commenced firing, the smoke was so thick that little could be seen, but there was no trouble in making it effective, for not less than three thousand men formed a vast crowd in front. The noise and turmoil were such that commands could not be heard, and every one fought in his own way</i>.”<br /> <br /> Although the men along this part of the Union line checked the Confederate infantry in their front, the Confederates to the right had greater success and managed to pierce the Union line. Our next stops will take us to this area.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "The 69th Pennsylvania was a typical infantry regiment. The regiment was the basic building block of Civil War armies. Composed of ten companies of 100 men each, a full-strength regiment contained 1,000 officers and men. But disease, battle casualties, desertions, and men detailed to support and logistical duties reduced the strength of units in the field so that by the time of the Battle of Gettysburg, the average regiment in either army contained slightly over 300 men.<br /> <br /> The 69th had 26 officers and 258 enlisted men equipped for duty when they first went intoaction on July 2. By the end of the battle, the regiment had 40 killed or mortally wounded,80 wounded, and 17 captured: nearly one-half its strength.<br /> <br /> This monument to the 69th, which was dedicated in 1887, is unique in that it is the only regimental monument on the field to include markers for each of the ten companies in the regiment. The company markers are connected to each other by a chain to symbolize that the 69th’s line bent, but did not break, during Pickett’s Charge. On top of each company marker you will see letters and the number 69. This is an abbreviation for each company, such as Company H, 69th Pennsylvania. The company markers can give you a sense of the frontage a Civil War regiment presented in battle. The soldiers fought in a line of battle, meaning the men formed in two ranks nearly shoulder to shoulder. Sergeants and lieutenants spread across the rear of the two rank lines as “file closers.” Their job was to maintain order, fill gaps in the ranks, and prevent men from running away. The purpose for the close order tactics was to mass firepower and enable the commander to control his men more easily.<br /> <br /> The fighting along the front of the 69th was at very close range. Company F was overrun in the fighting and every man was killed, wounded or captured. Company D briefly engaged in hand-to-hand combat that some survivors said prevented the rest of the regiment from being outflanked and destroyed. One member of the 69th related how the Confederates seemed to be “coming in all around us, but how they fi red without killing all our men I do not know.”",

During Pickett’s Charge, the 72nd Pennsylvania was initially held in reserve behind Cemetery Ridge. When the Confederates drove the 71st Pennsylvania from the Angle, the 72nd advanced to the crest of the ridge (about where Hancock Avenue runs today) where they came under heavy fire from Confederate soldiers behind the stone wall.<br /> <br /> The regiment remained in this position throughout the most severe part of the engagement and suffered heavy losses: 44 killed and 146 wounded. When Confederate resistance began to collapse, the regiment, along with others who had rushed to this area, advanced to the wall and recaptured the original Union position.<br /> <br /> In 1888, the veterans of the 72nd requested permission to place a monument to their regiment near the stone wall where they had advanced on July 3. Their request was denied because policy dictated that all regiments place their original monuments where they had stood in the general line of battle of the army. That position for the 72nd was near where Hancock Avenue runs today. The veterans of the 72nd objected to this position and eventually carried their case to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which, despite strong testimony against the 72nd’s claims, ruled in their favor and the monument was erected.",

    "bodyText": "Abraham Brian’s property was on the edge of Ziegler’s Grove, an oak grove that covered about 2.5 acres in 1863, and served as cover for Battery I, 5th US Artillery, and for elements of Hays’ infantry during the battle.<br /> <br /> Brian’s experience offers some sense of the battle’s impact on the civilians living on the battlefield. Brian was born in Maryland in 1804, moved to Gettysburg around 1840, and purchased twelve acres here in 1857. He usually kept at least one or two horses and cows, grew wheat, barley, and hay, and kept some of his land in meadows and orchards.<br /> <br /> Abraham Brian, his wife Elizabeth, and their five children were not living in the house at the time of the battle. As members of the local African American community, the family left the Gettysburg area upon news of the Confederate invasion, perhaps joining the exodus to Lancaster County. During the battle General Hays reportedly used the Brian house as his headquarters.<br /> <br /> When the family returned after the battle, they found the house and barn had been damaged by artillery and small arms fire. The outside bake oven was gone. Brian lost his corn, wheat, oats, orchard, garden vegetables, and farm animals. He also lost 194 panels of his post and rail and worm fencing, and a stone fence had been torn down and removed for defenses. He eventually submitted a claim to the government for damages in the amount of $575. Damages caused by the battle were not covered, and Brian only received $15 for the 1.5 tons of hay used by Federal cavalry to feed their horses. Many farmers received no compensation for damages. Brian repaired the damage to his buildings and continued to farm until 1868 when he sold his farm. The family moved into the town of Gettysburg, and Abraham Brian worked as hostler at a hotel.<br /> <br /> The expereinces of the Brian family reflected both the determination and resilience of Gettysburg’s civilians who, in the weeks after the battle, struggled to recover from the damage it caused and to restore some normalcy to their lives.<br />   <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gett/learn/photosmultimedia/abraham-brian-house-3d.htm\">Abraham Brian House 3D Tour</a></h4> <p>Explore the Abraham Brian House in this 3D Virtual Tour. </p>",

    "bodyText": "<blockquote> <p>\"If you want to see a good time, 'jine the cavalry!\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The role of the cavalry at the beginning of the Civil War was very limited. The cavalry of both armies were employed for patrolling and scouting, guarding supply trains and railroads, and providing escorts to generals. They were only used in battle as shock troops, a tactic dating back to the Romans. A favorite jibe from the infantry was “Did you ever see a dead cavalryman?” The foot soldiers believed the cavalry to be “dandies on horseback” who never saw much fighting and always had the easy life. Certainly, the dash and spirit of the more flamboyant cavalry leaders provided the newspapers with many stories of harrowing rides and gallant duels in the saddle.<br /> <br /> Confederate troopers commanded by Major General J.E.B. Stuart had the grandest reputations of all cavalrymen: ready to ride on a raid at a moment’s notice or rush to the front to do battle just as the tide was beginning to turn. Of course, truth was very different from the romantic descriptions of newspapermen. Soldiering on horseback was a hard life with plenty of danger. The cavalry’s military role had dramatically changed by 1863 and the armies were making use of their horse soldiers in combat situations. Commanders utilized cavalry as advance scouts and as a mobile fighting force. These new strategies culminated in the largest cavalry battle of the war fought on June 9, 1863 at Brandy Station, Virginia.<br /> <br /> Brandy Station was the opening clash of the Gettysburg Campaign.<br /> <br /> Federal troopers of Brig. Gen. John Buford’s First Cavalry Division opened the Battle of Gettysburg against Confederate infantry of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth’s Division on July 1. The cavalrymen were limited by their numbers and the moderate range of the carbines they carried, but were able to delay the Confederate advance for two hours until Federal infantry arrived. While the armies did battle around Gettysburg, cavalry units skirmished in Hunterstown, Pennsylvania, and on several roads east of town.<br /> <br /> Confederate cavalrymen traveled lighter than their Union counterparts and were not usually armed with the more modern carbines. Short, muzzle-loading carbines were more common in Confederate regiments, including imports from England. Some Confederate troopers preferred to leave their sabers behind and carried extra pistols instead of sabers, for close work. Confederate arsenals attempted to mass-produce breech loading carbines, even making copies of Union carbines made by the Sharps Rifle Company. Attempts at mass production of the weapon failed and Confederate cavalrymen relied upon a varied stock of captured and imported arms.<br /> <br /> On July 3, 1863, in an effort to protect the Confederate left flank, Confederate Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart led his Cavalry troops from near Hunterstown to a position near the York Road. The area today known as East Cavalry Field.<br /> <br /> On the morning of July 3, this ground was occupied by a brigade of four Michigan regiments and a battery of horse artillery under the command of newly promoted Brig. Gen. George A. Custer. After a battle at Hunterstown the previous evening, Custer had been ordered to this position to protectthe right flank of the Union army at Gettysburg and secure the important intersection of the Low Dutch and Hanover Roads just off to your right. Custer’s four regiments were soon reinforced by the arrival of Brig. Gen. David M. Gregg’s Second Cavalry Division, which took position on Custer’s left along the Hanover Road.<br /> <br /> Around noon, Gregg received word from Maj. Gen. George G. Meade that Stuart was moving towards the Union right flank with a large force of cavalry with the intention of attacking the rear of the army.<br /> <br /> At the same time, Custer received an order directing him to rejoin his division (Third Cavalry Division) on the Union left near the Round Tops.<br /> <br /> With this vital intersection being vacated by Custer, Gregg moved Col. John B. McIntosh’s four regiments forward to occupy the crossroads. McIntosh soon ordered the 1st NJ Cavalry Regiment and the 3rd PA Cavalry to a wooded area around the Lott Farm, the white barn about one-half mile to your front, to watch for Stuart’s arrival. It was about 1 pm.</p>",

    "bodyText": "This plaque is one of many dotted throughout the cemetery that contains lines from the poem, \"Bivouac of the Dead.\"<br /> <br /> It is easy to forget that each grave represents not only a victim of war, but also the unseen victims at home—wives, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and children, who all mourned the passing of a loved one. While over 10,000 died at Gettysburg alone, during the four years of the Civil War, over 720,000 Americans perished.<br /> <br /> The graves are arranged in a wide semi-circle that radiate out from the Soldiers’ National Monument which marks the center of the cemetery. The burials were organized around state sections, divided into an inner ring (for smaller states) and outer ring (for larger states). This design was created by William Saunders, a famed landscape gardener (and later one of the founders of the National Grange), thus “the position of each lot, and indeed of each interment, is relatively of equal importance.” The evenness and equality of the gravestones, where men of differing rank and position rest side-by-side, contrasts sharply with the jumbling diversity visible in the Evergreen Cemetery. The “simple grandeur” of William Saunders’ cemetery plan speaks to the underlying theme of equality in Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address; and is an eloquent reminder of the ultimate goal of the struggle, and of the costs necessary to achieve it.<br /> <br /> There are three types of stones that make up the state sections and individual graves. Larger grey stones serve as state section markers and also indicate the number of fallen from each state. Long, rectangular granite stones, which are set nearly at ground level, serve as gravestones for the remains of soldiers buried in the state sections, and mostly are marked by names. Lastly, you will also see hundreds of small marble squares bearing only numbers. This is one of three such sections in the Civil-War portion of the cemetery, all of whom are UNKNOWN.<br /> <br /> As there were no government “dog-tags” issued to soldiers during the war, identification of the dead was usually via friends, or from personal effects or letters that might be found on the body. Upon examination, sometimes a soldier was determined to be ‘partially unknown.’ If their home state could be determined, the dead soldier was placed within the proper state section, and the word UNKNOWN engraved upon his flat headstone. If, however, the soldier’s home state was not known, he was laid in one of the UNKNOWN sections, his remains marked only by a number. Some 979 unknowns were buried in this way. Of these, twenty men could be identified by name, but not by state affiliation, and therefore were buried as UKNOWN.<br /> <br /> In addition to the attempts at identification, each soldier received a proper reburial, with the remains being placed in a pine coffin which was then buried to a depth of four feet. The reburials were not completed until March 1864, nearly five months after the work had begun. A few Confederate soldiers were mistakenly interred in the cemetery alongside their former foes. The remainder of the Confederate dead remained buried on the battlefield. Between seven to ten years after the battle, these Confederate remains, over 3,200 altogether, were returned home to four primary locations – Richmond, Virginia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and Charleston, South Carolina.",

    "bodyText": "This wayside exhibit marks the focal point of the Gettysburg Cyclorama Painting. In the spring of 1882, French artist Paul D. Philippoteaux visited the battlefield for the purpose of painting a cyclorama of the Battle of Gettysburg. The subject of the battle selected for the painting was Pickett’s Charge. Philippoteaux hired William Tipton, a local photographer, to shoot a series of landscape photographs from this location. Since the perspective of the viewer in the painting would be that of someone looking down upon the action, they built an elevated platform near this spot for Tipton to take the landscape series. Philippoteaux then used these images to faithfully reproduce the Gettysburg landscape as it existed during his visit there, which had changed little since July 1863.<br /> <br /> From this point it is possible to have a closer look at the reproduction limbers and caissons that were used to move artillery pieces and haul ammunition. These vehicles represent the equipment of Battery A, 4th U.S. Artillery, which was positioned in this area on July 2 and July 3.",

The museum features six galleries, including two rooms that have been restored to their 1863 appearance: Wills' office, where he received letters from families looking for loved ones after the battle and began planning for a cemetery and its dedication; and the bedroom where Lincoln stayed and prepared the Gettysburg Address.</p> <h4><br /> The David Wills Story</h4> <p>Wills attended Pennsylvania (now Gettysburg) College, and by 1854 was an attorney and superintendent of Adams County’s schools. Two years later he married Catherine Jane “Jennie” Smyser, and by the summer of 1863 had three children. Wills achieved a variety of accomplishments, such as being appointed president of the Gettysburg Borough Council in 1872, and becoming an Adams County Judge two years later. He also served on numerous boards of directors, including that of the Bank of Gettysburg and the Gettysburg Railroad Company.<br /> <br /> The Civil War came to the doorstep of the Wills home in 1863. Confederate soldiers first came to Gettysburg in search of supplies on June 26. During the Confederate occupation of the town, Wills saw, “a group of rebels with an axe break open the store door,” of one of his tenants. Local citizens huddled in his cellar. After the battle the Wills home filled quickly with wounded and dying soldiers. Local women acting as nurses tended to these men, and the U.S. Sanitary Commission (an early version of the American Red Cross) established a temporary warehouse here. The U.S. Provost Marshall used the home as headquarters, and Gettysburg’s leading citizens met here to make plans for proper burial of the dead.</p> <h4><br /> The President in Gettysburg</h4> <p>As many as 20,000 people converged upon Gettysburg to attend the dedication of the Soldiers’ National Cemetery and to catch a glimpse of visiting dignitaries.<br /> <br /> November 18, 1863: President Lincoln arrived in Gettysburg on the evening of November 18 and was escorted to the Wills home. The galleries on the second floor follow the events of Lincoln’s visit through his immortal address on November 19. You will hear the story of how Gettysburg managed the vast number of visitors and how David and Catherine accomodated the distinguished guests who spent the night at their home. You will stand in the bedroom where Lincoln finished revising the Gettysburg Address and learn why this speech continues to endure.<br /> <br /> November 19, 1863: By 10:00 am dignitaries were assembled outside of the Wills home for the procession to the new Soldiers’ National Cemetery. The ceremony began with music and an invocation. Edward Everett’s two-hour oration was followed by a funeral dirge, and then the President arose to deliver his, “few appropriate remarks.” He spoke for about two minutes. The brevity of Lincoln’s speech surprised many, but his words were long remembered.<br /> <br /> As the death toll mounted during the first two years of the war, many wondered whether any cause was worth the awful price. The Gettysburg Address was Lincoln’s effort to define and defend the war’s objectives and the need to see them through — whatever the cost. The war, he said, was a test of whether a nation, “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,” could survive and remain true to its founding ideals.</p> <h4><br /> Visiting the David Wills House</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gett/planyourvisit/david-wills-house.htm\">Check the opening hours and seasons</a> to see if the David Wills House is open during your visit..</p> <ul> <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Park at the Gettysburg Municipal Parking Garage on Race Horse Alley or take the <a href=\"https://www.rabbittransit.org/schedules/gettysburg/\">Freedom Transit Shuttle</a> from the Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center.</li> </ul> <h4><br /> Explore the Daivd Wills House Virtually </h4> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/gett/learn/photosmultimedia/david-wills-house-3d.htm\">Take a virtual tour of the David Wills House!</a>",

Union troops positioned themselves along the park's ridges and hills, which provided excellent vantage points. In turn, Confederate troops moved across the cleared valleys and lowlands in an effort to drive the Union troops off Cemetery Ridge, Culp's Hill, Little Round Top, and Big Round Top.<br /> <br /> The boulders scattered across the landscape and also the rocks of Devil's Den, provided cover and strategic defensive positions for the soldiers. Thin soil on many of the sides and tops of hills also made it almost impossible for Union soldiers to entrench themselves. The resistant bedrock was so close to the surface on these hills that the troops were unable to dig in. They had to rely on existing stonewalls, scattered boulders, and outcrops of rock for protection. Because of the Union army's inability to entrench its position, it suffered heavy losses of 23,000 men, while the attacking Confederates lost a little more than 28,000.<br /> <br /> Approximately 180 million years ago during the late Triassic Period, the Gettysburg Formation comprising sandstone, siltstone, and shale was deposited in a large carved-out basin in the Gettysburg area. These lowlands were broken by hills and ridges that were formed as a result of geologic activity when a dense 2,000-foot thick slab of igneous (molten) rock called the Gettysburg Sill and also two 50-foot dikes were thrust into the Gettysburg Formation. One of the dikes underlies Seminary Ridge in a north to south orientation while the other parallels the ridge to the west. Sills are responsible for the topographically-high areas of the Round Tops, Culp's Hill, and Cemetery Ridge and Hill.<br /> <br /> The intrusion dikes are composed of very fine-grained, dense diabase rock very resistant to weathering. The composition of these rocks indicates that the molten masses cooled very rapidly. The Gettysburg Sill is coarse-grained diabase, an igneous rock otherwise known as granite. The Sill also contains a large amount of feldspar, which is prone to weathering. The forces of weathering are evident when observing the large round boulders of Devil's Den formed from diabase outcrops.</p>",

At first I thought that it was either to relieve or arrest me, and promptly replied to him, that my conscience was clear, void of offense towards any man; I was prepared for his bad news. He then handed me a communication to read; which I found was an order relieving Hooker from the command and assigning me to it.\"</p> <p style=\"text-align: right;\">-Major General George Meade to his wife, June 29, 1863</p> </blockquote> <p>The equestrian statue of United States General George Gordon Meade, mounted on his favorite horse, “Old Baldy,” depicts the “quiet, resourceful commander” of the Army of the Potomac. A West Point graduate and career soldier, President Lincoln placed Meade in command of the Army of the Potomac only three days before the Battle of Gettysburg. An experienced soldier and highly respected in the army, he was also known for his sometimes explosive temper which earned him the nickname “old snapping turtle.”</p> <p>To the right of General Meade’s monument is the large domed Pennsylvania Monument. Beyond and to the south (right if looking from the Meade Equestrian Statue) are Little Round Top and Big Round Top. Across the road and to the west is a field that stretches to a tree line. This tree line is Seminary Ridge. Part of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia’s front lines were located on Seminary Ridge from late in the day on July 1 through July 4. The town of Gettysburg is located to the north. Cemetery Hill, a key position in the US lines, is marked by the tall evergreen trees to the northeast of the statue. This is the location of the local Evergreen Cemetery and the Soldiers’ National Cemetery. The far right flank of the Federal army was located on Culp’s Hill, just visible over the cannons of Turnbull’s battery.</p>",

In 1887, the iron fence was built to protect the trees from souvenir hunters. None of the trees inside the fence today date to 1863. The High Water Mark of the Rebellion Monument was erected in 1892 to honor the commands of both armies that participated in the July 3 “Longstreet’s Assault,” which today is more popularly known as Pickett’s Charge. The monument was designed by John B. Bachelder, the first historian of the battlefield.<br /> <br /> The monument to Captain Andrew Cowan’s 1st New York Artillery is to your left as you facethe High Water Mark Monument. During the Confederate attack on July 3, Cowan’s gunspreserved the Union line at this point by fi ring double rounds of canister (like giant shotguncharges) at the oncoming Confederates who broke through a gap in the infantry line.<br /> <br /> Behind you on the east side of Hancock Avenue stands one of the more unusual monumentson the battlefield. The 42nd New York Infantry monument has the bronze sculpture of a Native-American as its main feature. The regiment, also known as the “Tammany Regiment,” was raised in New York City in June 1861, under the sponsorship of Tammany Hall and the Union Defense Committee. Tammany Hall was a powerful political machine that dominated New York City politics from the 1790’s to the 1960’s. It was named for Tamanend, a peace-loving chief of the Lenni-Lenape nation in the Delaware Valley, and a friend of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania. Tamanend was reputed to be a chief of great bravery, skill and courage and, for this reason, was chosen by the survivors of the 42<sup>nd</sup> to symbolize both the political origin of the regiment and its courage and fighting ability.<br /> <br /> One of the speakers at the dedication of this monument was General Ely S. Parker ofNew York. Parker had served as General Ulysses S. Grant’s military secretary and draftedthe terms of surrender at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. Parker was also asachem, or chief, of the Seneca tribe and the first Native-American to head the Department of Indian Affairs.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Jimmie Pickett, the son of Captain George Pickett, the first commanding officer of American Camp, and his second wife, a young Haida woman whose family was working near Camp Semiahmoo was born in this house, the oldest home in Bellingham. Pickett met his wife during his service as commanding officer at Fort Bellingham. Mrs. Pickett died within a year of Jimmie’s birth on New Year’s Eve, 1857 and Captain Pickett left the Pacific Northwest in 1861 to serve in the Confederate military during the Civil War. Jimmie Pickett was raised near Shelton on Hammersley Inlet by loving foster parents Catherine and Aaron Collins who nurtured his artistic talents. After Aaron died, Catherine re-married and her second husband William Walter continued to mentor the artistic prodigy and supported his further education.<br /> <br /> Pickett’s artistry had attracted notice since his childhood. Visitors regularly came to the farm he grew up on to see the early paintings which he made on the planks of the barn. Displays of his earliest paintings gained notoriety and garnered artistic prizes. As a young adult, Pickett taught art classes at the Union Academy in Olympia which he attended and created commercial artworks such as etchings and engravings for the publisher of Oregon county histories and The Oregonian newspaper. He also regularly stayed in touch with his family back East, including his father and his stepmother after his father’s death.<br /> <br /> Pickett’s time at the San Francisco Art Institute was eventful but also difficult. During his time there, he met his half-brother, George Pickett, Jr. but their meeting did not go well. Historical sources are murky about the specifics of this family encounter but it is believed that race—specifically Jimmie’s indigenous ancestry and near-identical appearance—caused a lasting rift with his younger brother who seems not to have known that his half-brother was half-indigenous. Pickett also felt that the formal artistic training of the only professional art school on the West Coast—was too slow for him and that it was not a good use of his artistic talents. He dropped out of school after five months and moved back to Portland, where he took on students and became both a fine and commercial artist.<br /> <br /> Pickett died of typhoid complicated by tuberculosis at the young age of 31. In Portland, he was part of the staff at The Oregonian, where he worked as a regular illustrator. Pickett also produced sketches and engravings of cityscapes and highly admired oil paintings. Though he died young, he was beloved by his Portland art community friends who said of him in an obituary: “His life seems as a picture of magnificent conception laid away half finished As a beautiful poem half written, or a sweet sad song whose melody is shattered just as we begin to be enchanted by its music. James Pickett will ever live in the memory of those who knew him best as one of the truest, purest, manliest of men, as well as one of the rarest geniuses this Northwest has ever produced.”</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h4>The Battle's Aftermath and Creation of the Cemetery</h4> The Lincoln Address Memorial is unique: it commemorates the speech Lincoln gave here and not the man himself. Thus, it is one of the few memorials in the world dedicated to honor a speech. The bronze bust of Lincoln, by sculptor Henry Bush-Brown, reveals the heavy toll the war and the nation’s suffering had upon him. Inscribed in bronze on the right is the Gettysburg Address. On the left is the letter Lincoln received inviting him to speak at Gettysburg.<br /> <br /> The recovery efforts began almost immediately following the battle. While relief for the wounded began to trickle in, the dead were hastily buried in shallow graves across the battlefield within one week of the battle. These crude graves were seen as a temporary solution for the disposal of the dead, and were completed quickly for fear that an epidemic might spread in the hot, humid summer conditions. The markings of these burials were also very rough and temporary, typically a wooden board with the soldier’s name written in pencil, placed at the head of his grave. Not surprisingly, many of these identifications were lost when exposed to the weather and other elements. It would be the effort to give these men proper and permanent burials that eventually led to the creation of the Gettysburg National Cemetery.<br /> <br /> A committee was formed, consisting of representatives from all of the loyal states who lost soldiers here. Headed by David Wills, a Gettysburg attorney and the Pennsylvania state agent, the committee decided upon a plan to create a common burial ground for the Union dead. The natural eminence of this hill, coupled with its importance to the Union victory, led the committee to select this 17 acre site as the location for the new soldiers’ cemetery. The land was purchased and the reburial of the Union soldiers began on October 27.<br /> <br /> While this work got underway, Wills and the committee began to plan a suitable dedication ceremony for the new cemetery. They invited Edward Everett of Massachusetts to deliver the main oration. A former governor, congressman, senator and secretary of state, Everett was also one of the most famous orators of the day. While Abraham Lincoln was also invited, his role in the ceremony was to be a secondary one; David Wills’ invitation contains perhaps the key to the brevity of the Gettysburg Address, asking the President to deliver, “…a few appropriate remarks.\"",

    "bodyText": "<p>This was the home of the 52-year-old widow Lydia Leister and her four children in 1863. They left the house on July 1 after being warned it was likely there would be fighting in the area. General George G. Meade, commanding the 90,000-man Unites States Army of the Potomac, established his headquarters here early on July 2. The location was central to all parts of his army’s front lines, and therefor made an ideal location for a headquarters. As an army headquarters, this was a busy place during the battle. There were numerous couriers and staff officers coming and going, cavalry and infantry headquarters guards, and a provost guard, which served as military police.<br /> <br /> Late in the night on July 2, General Meade met with twelve of his senior generals in the main room of the house to discuss the day’s fighting and the plans for July 3. All agreed to “stay and fight it out” in the position the army then occupied. From the porch, this room is to the right. The furnishings currently in the room are reproductions of what was there at the time. Some of the original furniture of this room is on display in the Museum.<br /> <br /> On July 3, the Confederates shelled Cemetery Ridge for nearly two hours before Pickett’s Charge. Many shells overshot the ridge and a number struck the Leister house and farmyard. As a result General Meade evacuated to a new headquarters. Captain George Meade Jr., the general’s son, described the scene here at the house:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"<em>One shell burst in the yard among the staff horses tied to the fence, another tore up the steps of the house, another carried away the supports of the porch, one passed through the door, another through the garret, and a solid shot barely grazing the commanding general, as he stood in the open doorway, buried itself in the box by the door at his side.</em>\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Federal army used the house and barn as an aid station and assembly point for evacuating wounded to field hospitals after Pickett’s Charge. Both buildings and the rest of the small farm suffered considerable damage because of the battle. However, Mrs. Leister had the buildings repaired and managed to recover her losses. She continued to live here until 1888 when she moved into Gettysburg due to poor health.</p>",

Meade made his headquarters during the Battle of Gettysburg. Late in the evening of July 2, Meade held a council of war in this house to decide if the Union army should stay and hold their hard-fought high ground or abandon their position. The council of war decided to stay. Late in the afternoon of July 3, Confederate batteries concentrated their missiles on the center of Cemetery Ridge in an attempt to soften up the Union position. Unbeknownst to the Confederate artillerymen, their rounds overshot their intended targets and began to land around Meade’s headquarters causing substantial damage.

As the compact lines of horsemen crossed these fields heading for the Union positions along the Hanover Road (Stop 1), they were attacked on 3 sides by McIntosh’s and Custer’s 3,200 men.<br /> <br /> As you face the Michigan Cavalry Brigade monument, the Union cavalry charged into the Confederates from your left front and right and broke their formations in bloody hand-to-hand combat. Unable to withstand these furious attacks upon their front and flanks, the Confederates soon retreated to Cress Ridge. The heaviest fighting of the day was over.<br /> <br /> A Union officer recalled, “As the charge was ordered the speed increased, every horse on the jump, every man yelling like a demon. As the opposing columns drew nearer and nearer, each with perfect alignment, every man gathered his horse well under him and gripped his weapon the tighter.” A Confederate officer in Lee’s Brigade described the fighting as “hand to hand, blow for blow, cut for cut, an oath for oath, it seemed as if the very furies from the infernal regions were turned loose on each other.”<br /> <br /> Several hundred yards to your left front across the tour road is the Gregg Cavalry Shaft erected in 1884. It is the only monument that commemorates the services of both Union and Confederate cavalry at Gettysburg.<br /> <br /> After almost 2 hours of continuous fighting the contest for the Lott and Rummel Farms had been decided. Stuart fell back onto Cress Ridge and remained there until nightfall. Gregg, although outnumbered, was able to stubbornly resist the best of the Southern cavalry and protect the Union flank.<br /> <br /> The Union had 254 casualties, the Confederates lost 450. July 3, 1863 had proven the Cavalry could win victories.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "<p>This is the final resting place for more than 3,500 United States soldiers killed at Gettysburg. Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address at the cemetery’s dedication on November 19, 1863.</p> <h4><br /> About the Soldiers' National Cemetery</h4> <p>Three days of fighting at Gettysburg took a horrible toll on both armies: roughly 10,000 soldiers killed or mortally wounded, 30,000 injured, and 10,000 captured or missing. After the battle, bodies lay scattered throughout Gettysburg’s farmlands. The dead were hastily buried in shallow graves on the battlefield, crudely identified by pencil writing on wooden boards. As weeks passed rain and wind eroded the impromptu graves. In response, Gettysburg’s citizens called for the creation of a soldiers’ cemetery for the proper burial of the Federal dead. The site chosen encompassed the hill from which the Federal center repulsed Pickett’s Charge during the battle. The reburial process began on October 27, 1863.<br /> <br /> Confederate burials did not receive placement in the national cemetery. Efforts in the 1870s by Confederate veterans' societies eventually relocated 3,200 Confederate remains to cemeteries to the South.<br /> <br /> A few weeks after the burial process started, a dedication ceremony was held at the yet to be completed Soldiers' National Cemetery. The cemetery committee chose Massachusetts statesman and orator Edward Everett to deliver the main speech. The committee asked President Abraham Lincoln to deliver “a few appropriate remarks.” At the November 19 ceremony, Everett spoke for two hours on the causes of war and the events that led to the Battle of Gettysburg. After his remarks, Lincoln rose and spoke for two minutes; his brief speech today is known as the “Gettysburg Address.” His speech honored the men who fought at Gettysburg and invoked their sacrifice as a cause to continue fighting for the preservation of the United States.<br /> <br /> Landscape architect William Saunders designed the cemetery as a wide semi-circle, radiating from a central point to be decorated with a grand monument. The cemetery’s sections were divided by state; smaller states closest to the monument and larger states along the outer portions. Reinterments continued through March 1864. The Soldiers' National Monument, at the center of the circle, was dedicated on July 1, 1869. Numerous other monuments dot the cemetery’s landscape, including a memorial to the soldiers of New York and a monument to President Lincoln.<br /> <br /> By 1872, construction of the cemetery was complete, and administration of the national cemetery transferred to the Federal Government.</p> <h4><br /> From the Civil War to Today </h4> <p>Between 1898 and 1968, the government added sections to accommodate the graves of veterans from the Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The cemetery’s annex is located due north of the historic original 17-acre property. Today, more than 6,000 veterans lay at rest in the Gettysburg National Cemetery.</p> <h4><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/media/video/view.htm?id=00DE3FAF-FE9C-3421-264DEB05FD44D6AF\">Watch the Virtual Tour</a></h4> <p>Explore the National Cemetery in video through this Virtual Tour.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h4><strong>The Dedication of the Cemetery, the Gettysburg Address, and the Soldiers' National Monument</strong></h4> <br /> The Soldiers’ National Monument, long misidentified as the spot from which Lincoln spoke, honors the fallen soldiers. The figures of War (the soldier), Clio, the Muse of History (represented by the woman writing upon the tablet), Plenty (woman holding a sheaf of wheat) and Peace (the mechanic) surmount the base, while the figure of Liberty mourning her dead appears on the pedestal. It was actually on the crown of this hill, a short distance on the other side of the iron fence and inside the Evergreen Cemetery, where President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address to a crowd of some 15,000 people.<br /> <br /> <strong>3D models</strong> of the entire Soldiers' National Monument, including all five of the statues, is available on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hdp/exhibits/gettysburg_monument.htm\">National Park Service, Heritage Documentation Programs website</a>.<br /> <br /> The cemetery was officially dedicated on November 19, 1863 “by appropriate and imposing ceremonies,” which included the deliverance of Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, following Mr. Everett’s sweeping and eloquent two-hour oration. As Lincoln composed his most famous speech in the days leading up the ceremony, both in the White House in Washington, D.C. and at David Will’s home the night before, he well understood the difficult task before him.<br /> Facing bitter and mounting opposition to his emancipation policy and the war itself, the President saw his remarks at Gettysburg as an opportunity to help define for the nation what was at stake in the war and why a Union victory was crucial. He also understood the grief that many felt who had lost sons, fathers and friends in the battle. He struggled with his own personal bereavement, having recently suffered the death of his much-loved 11 year-old son “Willie” in 1862. He hoped his brief remarks might impart a deeper meaning to the nation’s enormous sacrifice.<br /> <br /> President Lincoln’s address that afternoon lasted only about two minutes. Afterward, Edward Everett wrote the President, “I should be glad, if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes.”<br /> <br /> In his address Lincoln attempted to make the nation realize the significance of the war, for he saw it not only as the great test of whether democracy could survive (“a great civil war, testing whether…any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure”), but also as an opportunity to redeem the ultimate goal of the founding fathers (“…that all men are created equal”). Thus, the Gettysburg Address was actually Lincoln’s attempt to rededicate the nation to finishing the war (“to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us”), and also to define its larger meaning, (“that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom….”).<br /> <br /> Together the monuments like this one, markers, memorials, and individual graves contained within the ground of the Gettysburg National Cemetery serve as a reminder of the devotion to country and the sacrifice Americans have given, and may be called on to give, to ensure the freedoms we enjoy today.<br /> <br /> The Gettysburg National Cemetery, and Annex, closed to new interments in 1972.",

    "bodyText": "<p>This area, encompassed by the stone wall running south and the wall extending east, became known after the Battle of Gettysburg as the Angle. The stone wall at the Angle is the remnant of a wall that was built by the local farmers before the battle and was originally two to three feet high. Federal soldiers used this wall for protection from Confederate fire.<br /> <br /> On July 3, Confederate troops advanced up to the wall in front of where the 71st Pennsylvania Monument stands today. (The 71<sup>st</sup> Pennsylvania Regiment was also called the California Regiment because it was initially funded and led by westerners who wanted their state represented in the eastern army.)  The advancing Confederates drove back the men of the regiment positioned here.<br /> <br /> The Confederates initially took cover behind the wall and fired upon the nearby Federal troops. Shortly thereafter, about 200 Confederates followed Brigadier General Lewis A. Armistead over the wall to exploit the break in the Federal line. Armistead fell mortally wounded a short distance inside the Federal line, and the men with him were either shot down by converging fire or forced to fall back to the cover of the wall. A monument marking the approximate spot that Armistead fell is located immediately in front and to the right of the guns of Cushing’s battery.<br /> <br /> Lieutenant George W. Finley, of the 56th Virginia Infantry, was among the Confederate soldiers who reached the wall here and he recalled the final moments of the fighting:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The bullets seemed to come from front and both flanks, and I saw we could not hold the fence any longer. I looked back over the field to see the chances of withdrawing. The men who had begun to fall back seemed to be dropping as they ran, like leaves, and in a very few moments the number on the ground was four or five times as great, apparently, as when I had looked before. It seemed foolhardy to attempt to get back.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Finley and many others surrendered. In less than one hour, the United States soldiers defending Cemetery Ridge repulsed Pickett’s Charge. Of the nearly 13,000 Confederates who participated in the attack, approximately 5,500 men were killed, wounded, or captured. Federal losses totaled nearly 1,700 men.The Federal repulse of Pickett’s Charge on July 3 represented the end of the Battle of Gettysburg. While the Confederate army remained in position along Seminary Ridge all day on July 4, they would not make another major assault. That night, the Confederates began retreating from the battlefield. The Army of the Potomac followed on July 5 and July 6. The war moved south.<br /> <br /> Two soldiers who fought here aptly summarized the events of July 3 in letters home shortly after the battle. Confederate Lieutenant John T. James, of Pickett’s Division, wrote of his unit’s famous attack, “We gained nothing but glory, and lost our bravest men.” US General Alexander Webb, who commanded the Union infantry defending the angle, wrote to his wife; “You must recollect that [at] Gettysburg the fate of a country depended upon individuals.”</p>",

    "bodyText": "These guns represent the position of Lieutenant John G. Turnbull’s Battery F & K, 3rd U.S. Artillery late on the afternoon of July 3.<br /> <br /> There were 655 artillery pieces used during the battle. The artillery in both armies was organized into batteries of four to six cannon each. There were two basic types of cannon used: smoothbore guns, such as the guns in Turnbull’s battery, and rifled guns. The tubes of smoothbore cannon are bronze and can be easily identified on the battlefield since the bronze has developed a green patina.<br /> <br /> Rifled gun tubes are made of iron and painted black. The smoothbores of Turnbull’s battery could fire a shell approximately one mile, which means a gun located here could fire at a target along Seminary Ridge to the west. Rifled guns could fire nearly two miles.<br /> <br /> Artillery was moved by wheeled vehicles called limbers. The limbers, which are pulled by a team of horses, can be seen in the photograph and you will see examples on the field later in the tour. The vehicles in the back right of the photograph are called caissons. These carried additional ammunition for each gun.<br /> <br /> Before the Confederate infantry advanced during Pickett’s Charge on July 3, nearly 150 Confederate cannon bombarded Cemetery Ridge for almost two hours. Between 80 to 100 Union guns responded, and one of the greatest cannonades of the war ensued.<br />   <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"<i>Who can describe such a conflict as is raging around us!</i><i>To say that it was like a summer storm, with the crash of</i><i>thunder, the glare of lightning, the shrieking of the wind,</i><i>and the clatter of hailstones, would be weak. The thunder</i><i>and lightning of these two hundred and fifty guns and</i><i>their shells, whose smoke darkens the sky, are incessant, all</i><i>pervading, in the air above our heads, on the ground at our</i><i>feet – remote, near, deafening, ear piercing, astounding; and</i><i>these hailstones are massy iron charged with exploding fi re.\"</i>- Lieutenant Frank Haskell, Army of the Potomac (U.S.)</div>",

The sign is titled across the top: <br />Wolf Trap National Park<br />for the Performing Arts <br />The left side of the sign features a map of the Wolf Trap grounds. A large red building at the northern top of the map is labeled Filene Center. The Box Office is to the south and U.S. Park Police are to the right. National Park Service Administration sits to the southwest of the Filene Center, and Ovations Restaurant is located further to the southwest. Meadow Pavilion and Theater in the Woods are set on the west side of the map. <br />Text along the right side of the sign reads: <br />Welcome to the first National Park for the Performing Arts! Since 1971, Wolf Trap audiences have been enjoying a diverse array of performances. <br />Operated through a fruitful partnership between the National Park Service and the Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts, the Filene Center stages nearly 100 world-class performances annually from late May to early September. <br />Filene Center performances are just the beginning of what Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts has to offer. Activities include children's performances at the Theater-in-the-Woods, Master Classes, Pre-Performance Previews, backstage tours, an annual Holiday Sing-a-Long, and Interpretive Programs led by National Park Rangers. <br />The National Park Service cares for special places saved by the American people so that all may experience our heritage. <br />Cart rides before each evening performance are made possible by dedicated volunteers. <br />To the right of the wayside a walkway leads northeast about one hundred feet through a one hundred-foot-long pedestrian tunnel under Trap Road before continuing north toward the Filene Center. <br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(350 words) <br />Wolf Trap Run is a small river that flows from east to west across the northern end of Wolf Trap National Park. From the southeast corner of the West Parking Lot, proceed east through the pedestrian tunnel and continue uphill one hundred fifty feet. Turn right and travel one hundred feet. Turn left and proceed east along Trap Road four hundred seventy-five feet. Continue east along the pedestrian Wolf Trap Track path about five hundred feet as it winds downhill into an open grass field. The Meadow Kiosk will be on your right. Continue another fifty feet. Set over a wood railing on the left is a two by three-foot wayside. A wood bridge carries over a small creek twenty feet to the east. <br />The faded sign is titled across the top: <br />Wolf Trap Run <br />Text written across the top of an image of a wolf standing in snow in the woods reads: <br />The stream before you called Wolf Trap Run flows through a wooded part of the park that once resonated with occasional wolf howls. Unfortunately wolves native to Virginia were seen as competition for wild game and a threat to pioneer farm animals. The local government offered a reward to hunters who would trap and kill the wolves. By 1739 wolves were rarely seen in this area. <br />Text below between faded images of a family picnicking and a seated concert crowd reads: <br />The National Park Service protects these peaceful woods today because of the generosity of Catherine Filene Shouse. Her appreciation for the beauty of this land coupled with her love for the performing arts led to the creation of Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts. In addition to hosting musicians and artists, the park offers its visitors a wonderful natural area to explore and enjoy. <br />To the right is an image of a group of people walking along a trail through the woods. <br />The right side of the sign is titled above: <br />Washington Region of Chesapeake Bay Watershed <br />Below is a map of the Washington, DC area, Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay to the right. <br />END OF DESCRIPTION <br />",

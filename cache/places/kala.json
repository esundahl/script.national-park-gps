The hall would also host celebrity entertainers for decades. During events, strict rules segregated Hansen's patients from non-patients. These rules required non-patients to sit only in the upper balcony seats and to enter from separate entrances.<br /> <br /> The many celebrity entertainers that appeared in Paschoal Hall included Shirley Temple, John Wayne, Irving Berlin, the von Trapp Family Singers, and Hawai'i's own Don Ho. Paul Robeson, the world-renowned actor, singer, and advocate of racial equality, performed here in 1948. He noted that at Kalaupapa, he sang for \"the most inspiring audience [he'd] ever had.\"",

    "audioDescription": "Bay View Home is a large complex of buildings that all share a front covered walkway. The complex is located west of Puahi St, east and north of Bayview Loop and south of Damien Street. A large lawn surrounds the property both in the front and in the back. Paved walkways stretch out from some of the entrances to other buildings and streets. The north and south side of the building complex have a wheelchair accessible ramp that leads to the covered walkways. The covered walkway looks a bit like a patio or porch space, but is narrow and long and there is not much seating available along it. In the lawn in front and behind the complex, there are a few trees including a mango tree, palm tree, and an avocado tree. From the Bay View walkway, one can see both the ocean and the pali. The complex is made of wood in the general Hawaiian plantation architectural style and the roof is shingled.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Father Damien was born January 3, 1840, as Joseph de Veuster in Tremelo, Belgium. At the age of 19, he entered the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Louvain. Upon entering the congregation, he chose to take on the name Damien. When his older brother fell ill and could no longer serve in Hawaii, Damien volunteered to take his place. He arrived in Hawaiʻi on March 19, 1864.</p> <p>He volunteered to care for people inflicted with Hansen’s disease at Kalaupapa in 1873. After a short time, he wrote to his Bishop, stating he wanted to devote his life to helping the patients of Kalawao. During his stay in the settlement, he helped dress sores and build churches, homes, and coffins. He also organized schools and farms.</p> <p>By 1884, Father Damien contracted the disease, and five years later he passed away on August 15, 1889. His body was exhumed in 1936 to be sent back to his homeland in Belgium. Father Damien was canonized as a saint in the Catholic Church on October 11, 2009, and is now Saint Damien. A relic of St. Damien was sent back to Kalaupapa and was interred in his original resting place next to St. Philomena’s Church.</p> <p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kala/learn/historyculture/damien.htm\">Father Damien</a>. </p>",

Vegetation like Christmasberry, lantana, and java plum, covered grave sites. Park rangers initiated various grave marker preservation projects to preserve the integrity of the grave markers that dot the cemetery grounds. Thanks to the efforts of park rangers, Kahaloko has been nearly cleared of the dense vegetation that impeded access and damaged the grave sites.</p>",

The lower trailhead is located near the coastline on the Kalaupapa Peninsula and should not be confused with the upper trailhead.</p> <h3>A Trail of Isolation</h3> <p>Pali means cliff, and the steep cliff faces around the Pali Trail highlight why Kalaupapa was originally chosen as a place to isolate people with Hansen's disease. The pali around Kalaupapa are the tallest sea cliffs in the world, and they cut the peninsula off from the rest of the island. Rough seas surround the other sides of the peninsula. These barriers create natural isolation for those living in Kalaupapa, and the Pali Trail is the only way into Kalaupapa over land.</p> <p>The Pali Trail was constructed in the late 1800s to bring mail, cattle, and supplies to the settlement. A padlocked gate wrapped with barbed wire and armed watchmen were placed at the top of the trail to prevent patients from trying to escape.</p> <h3>David Kupele</h3> <p>In the early 1900s, mail was delivered to and from the settlement by mule four times per week. A patient named <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kala/learn/historyculture/davidkupele.htm\">David Kupele</a> rode the mule up and down the trail, sometimes three or four times a day. Kupele had to ring a bell attached to a wire when he reached the gate. The watchman would send a key down the wire so Kupele could unlock the gate and drop the mail off. He described it as letting himself in and out of prison. The watchman and gate were removed when a cure for the disease was found in the 1940s. Kupele never thought he would live to see that day.</p> <h3>The Trail Today</h3> <p>Today staff use the trail to get in and out of the settlement. It is also used by hikers, visitors, religious pilgrims, and guides, including the world-famous Molokai mules. Supplies and mail are now brought into the settlement via plane or on an annual barge. If you are interested in hiking the trail but live outside the settlement, you'll need to book a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kala/planyourvisit/guidedtours.htm\">guided tour</a>. Hikers are not permitted into the settlement without a permit.</p>",

Yet by 1900, hundreds of vessels annually passed through the channel between O‘ahu and the north side of Moloka‘i—and by the Hansen's disease settlement. A permanent light station was needed for maritime navigation.</p> <p>Just before sunset on September 9, 1909, lighthouse keeper James Keanu started up the light with its special Fresnel lens. The lens was a rare and huge crystal-like glass lens that spun on a bath of mercury. It was a solitary light more than 200 feet above sea level. It beckoned to the rough seas surrounding the Kalaupapa Peninsula for the first time. It was the brightest light in the Pacific and flashed twenty-one miles to sea. To the settlement’s patients, just two miles away, the light rhythmically sweeping over the pali (cliffs) was a part of their lives. Former patient Richard Marks once commented, “They talk about the statue of liberty, well, this light was the first thing that hundreds of thousands of immigrants to Hawai‘i saw when they came here… That light has been very special to the people here…. It has been here longer than any living person has. You could always look out and see it sweeping across the cliff… It is the Kalaupapa Light.”</p> <p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kala/learn/historyculture/lighthouse.htm\">the Moloka‘i Light here</a>. </p>",

From a very young age, Barbara knew she wanted to enter a convent and dedicate her life to God. After the death of her father in 1862, she did just that. She entered the Sisters of St. Francis in Syracuse, New York, and a year later, she professed her vow to God and became a sister. She taught and served as principal at various Parish schools and helped open two general hospitals in New York.</p> <p>In 1883 she received a call to help Hansen's disease patients in Hawaii. Within her first year, she helped to establish the Malulani Hospital on the island of Maui. In November of 1888, she and a few other sisters went to serve in Kalaupapa.

Catholic, Protestant, Mormon, Chinese, Americans of Japanese Ancestry, and Hawaiian sections of the cemetery are clearly delineated by groupings of grave markers with Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, and English inscriptions. In total, there are approximately 1,000 people buried here, which only represents about 15% of all the burials on the Kalaupapa peninsula.</p> <p>A large number of grave markers and rock walls in the Papaloa Cemetery were destroyed by a tsunami in 1946. In the 1900s, fences were built around the cemetery to prevent cattle from damaging graves.</p> <p>Today, Papaloa continues to be an active burial ground. Several types of grave markers reveal the changing tastes and styles from the late 19th century to the early 2000s. Many of the more recent graves have draped na lei, plastic flower bunches, and other mementos.

It was remodeled in 1935-1936 to include the installation of walkways, curbs, and the improvements of the grounds. In 1958, it was named in honor of Manuel Gomes Paschoal, a territorial legislator who championed Kalaupapa's residents' rights, privileges, and welfare. Eventually, the building went through a major restoration project from 2008-2012.</p> <p>The many celebrity entertainers that appeared in Paschoal Hall included Shirley Temple, John Wayne, Irving Berlin, the von Trapp Family Singers, and Hawai'i's own Don Ho. Paul Robeson, the world-renowned actor, singer, and advocate of racial equality, performed here in 1948. He noted that at Kalaupapa, he sang for \"the most inspiring audience [he'd] ever had.\"</p> <p>Visitors are welcome to explore the exhibits inside the building.</p>",

A post office allowed some patients to keep a connection to their families and communities beyond the settlement. Before the current post office was built in 1934, another building existed called the Kalawao U.S. Post Office. Today the post office is still frequently used and remains an important resource for residents as the only way to regularly ship items into the settlement. For many visitors, a highlight is to mail postcards from the settlement so they can have the cancellation stamp indicating Kalaupapa.</p> <h3>Mail Fumigation</h3> <p>Before the cure for Hansen's disease, the Board of Health had a strict protocol for handling the mail going in and out of the settlement. Outgoing mail had all four corners cut off. Letters were placed on a screen inside a sealed box. Under the screen was a cup of potassium permanganate to which formaldehyde was added. The operator quickly closed the lid to form an air-tight seal. The mail was left in the box for 18 hours. This fumigation process went on for years but was never shown to be effective in 'decontaminating' mail. Eventually, this practice ended.</p>",

Three years later, in 1871, a church building was erected and named \"Siloama\" for the healing spring of Siloam where Jesus healed a blind man.</p> <p>The church has undergone several restorations. In 1938 the first restoration efforts on the church began. The effort was led by Reverend Alice Kahokuoluna and members of Kaanaana Hou Church in Kalaupapa. During the restoration, Reverend Kahokuoluna discovered a vault beneath the building. It held an old church register book along with a minute-book documenting the early history of Siloama.</p> <p>In 1966, the church was reconstructed. During that time, a bronze time capsule was placed in one of the church's cornerstones by members of its small congregation, to be opened in 50 years. In 2012 the time capsule was opened and found to contain a Hawaiian bible and several other documents. On July 17, 2013, members of Kaanaana Hou church (the predecessor to Siloama and based in the Kalaupapa settlement), the National Park Service, and other outside entities, witnessed the replacement of a time capsule within one of the church's cornerstones.</p>",

Immediately, he and some patient helpers began to improve upon the small wooden chapel.</p> <p>A small wooden building was used for Catholic church services when Father Damien arrived at Kalawao in 1873. This chapel had been built the year before by Brother Victorin Bertrant. By 1877, Father Damien had expanded the church and added a bell tower. In 1888 a storm destroyed the steeple. With the help of Brother Joseph Dutton, the church repaired and expanded with the stone-reinforced façade that still stands. Father Damien died in 1889, a few months before the church's completion.</p> <p>Today, St. Philomena Church is one of only a few remaining structures on the Kalawao side of the Kalaupapa peninsula.

Families that previously had to take the long boat ride to Kalaupapa, or hike the steep trail, could now visit more easily. For some patients, Kalaupapa airport was the point of departure for travel throughout the world. The airport also allowed for faster mail service and opportunities for celebrity guests to visit the settlement. <br />  <br /> Currently, only one airline offers scheduled flights in and out of Kalaupapa. However, other small charter planes also land at Kalaupapa airport. It also provides a form of entertainment for residents. On certain days, usually during the winter, the airport is a nice spot to view large waves that hit the shore. It also is one of the few places on the peninsula where cell service may be available, though it is not guaranteed. <br /> <br /> All visitors now arrive at the settlement either by aircraft or by hiking the trail. Boats are no longer allowed to dock along the peninsula without a special use permit. ",

The airport itself is open-air on one side facing the runway and three walls. It's only one main room with four bathrooms in the back. There is seating available for waiting passengers.",

The service station was planned to be twelve by sixteen feet and have a gas pump, a compressor, and lubricating oil tanks. The floor is concrete, the walls are constructed from painted concrete tiles, and the roofing is fireproof.</p> <p>Once it was finished in 1934, the people of the settlement were allowed to fill their vehicles at their very own gas station. During the first year of operation, gas was 13 cents a gallon. People were allowed to purchase gas every day except Saturdays and Sundays. Eventually, people were only allowed to buy gas twice a week, which eventually turned into once a week.</p> <p>The gas station still operates today. Gasoline arrives on the annual barge in tankers. The price of gas is fixed throughout the year and is based on the purchase price of gas in O'ahu. People are allowed ~6 gallons each week and can only purchase gas at certain times on certain days of the week.</p>",

Today, an annual barge brings in large and heavy items, including vehicles, that cannot be brought in by mule or small plane. </p> <p>Kalaupapa's steep cliffs and treacherous coastline have always made obtaining supplies difficult. Even today, people at Kalaupapa hold on to items that would be discarded elsewhere in the hopes that they can be used one day.</p> <p>In the early years, small boats ferried food, supplies, and new patients from ships anchored offshore to this pier. The surf made loading and unloading difficult, but not as difficult as the original pier in Kalawao. The waves are often larger, and the weather is more inclement in Kalawao, and people would risk their lives just to get to shore. </p> <p>The Kalaupapa landing dock was completed in 1931, and breakwater stones were put in place. At that time, patients and kōkua were not allowed in areas around the boat landing. Iron post fences with steel cables were built to mark off-limits areas. Construction was finished by mid-July of 1932. In 2007, the National Park Service rebuilt the landing.</p> <p>Today, the ship lands once a year to deliver much of the settlement's supplies. New vehicles, fuel, building materials, and bulk goods are unloaded here on \"Barge Day,\" which is now an essential and exciting part of Kalaupapa life. One patient-resident described Barge Day as \"the number one day, the big day everybody waits for... [the community's] Christmas wishes come true in September</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Kalaupapa's residents cherished family visits. However, strict rules prohibited physical contact, and visitors were not allowed to touch their loved ones.</p> <p>The Visitors Quarters Complex includes the Longhouse and the Visitor Quarters building where visitors could stay overnight. Patients met their visitors in the Longhouse, the small and narrow structure. A heavy wire fence surrounded the Visitor Quarters Complex and ran down the center of the Longhouse, separating the patients from their loved ones. Visitors could not leave the compound without a police escort. In the words of one Kalaupapa resident, \"the visitors were almost like prisoners.\"</p> <p>The fence was finally removed in 1947. Still, many settlement rules, such as a requirement that outgoing mail is fumigated, persisted well into the 1960s. Visitors Quarters is still used to house residents' visitors today.</p>",

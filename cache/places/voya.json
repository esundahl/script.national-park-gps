    "bodyText": "<p>The Ellsworth Rock Gardens have been known as the “Showplace of Lake Kabetogama” since the 1940s. Jack Ellsworth, the garden’s creator and a self-taught artist, used natural elements of the native northern Minnesota landscape as his artistic media, creating an original and distinctive art environment on the north shore of Kabetogama Lake. <br /> <br /> Over a period of roughly twenty years, Ellsworth, a carpenter from Chicago, used art and engineering to create a complex, terraced garden on a prominent rock outcrop. Ellsworth constructed 62 terraced flower beds on the outcrop, which he filled with more than 13,000 lilies and other flower varieties. He then accented his garden landscape with over 200 abstract rock sculptures that have been compared to the work of modern sculptors like Noguchi and Brancusi. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness and magnitude of Mr. Ellsworth’s creation and the garden’s importance as a recreational destination since the 1940s establish its significance. The gardens are eligible for the National Register for Historic Places and are the most popular day use destination in Voyageurs National Park. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Ellsworth Rock Gardens are only accessible by water. A 4 mile boat ride will lead you to the large dock for the site. The dock leads to an accessible pathway that winds its way to the restroom building. The loop near the restroom building is lined with interpretive signage with the history of the site. From the restroom you have a full view of the rock gardens. Historically, the gardens had the appearance of being carved out of the forested wilderness. This boundary between the gardens and forest is one of the primary features of the site. The forest provides a distinct, impenetrable wall, creating a dark, dense backdrop for views within the gardens. A few native spruce or pine trees were left within the gardens, but were \"limbed-up\" approximately 20 feet to create a vertical focal point, rather than a visual barrier. A solitary red pine, approximately 70 feet tall and with branches only at the top, functioned as a distinctive visual landmark at the top and back of the space. This tree was removed in 2004 because of its deteriorated condition. Other tall pines will be allowed to grow in this area to maintain the sense of verticality. The irregular shape of the rock outcropping inspired the garden's organic form, and influenced its overall spatial organization. The topography of the site creates a series of flat planes: the lake, stepping up to the mown lawn surrounded by grassy meadow, followed by the uneven, steeply sloped rock outcropping, leading to the level summit area. The open meadow at the base of the outcropping provided a sense of arrival for visitors arriving from Ellsworth's dock on Kabetogama Lake, and provided a space for viewing the main features of the gardens. The forest that surrounded the outcropping and the meadow established a distinct vertical edge. This forest \"wall\" functioned as visual boundary and established a sense of enclosure to create an impression that the gardens had been carved out of nature. The inherent qualities of water, rock and forest remain unchanged.",

Visitors are welcome to enjoy a shore lunch while immersing themselves in Voyageurs’ fishing history. Peek into the ice house, relax, watch for birds, and enjoy Harry Oveson’s life on Rainy Lake. <br /> <br /> Harry Oveson was born in 1906 in Roseau, Minnesota and moved with his family, in 1921, to International Falls. In his youth, he worked at many different jobs; from his father’s bait and tackle shop to the local lumber mill. During the Great Depression, Harry engaged in train hopping to travel across America. During World War II, Harry served in the U.S. Army stationed in Alaska. In 1959, he settled on Rainy Lake to build his fish camp.<br /> <br /> In a typical day, Harry would rise before dawn and often see the sun come up from his front window. By 6:00 am he headed out on his 16-foot Alumacraft boat to lift his nets, remove the fish, and reset the nets for the next morning’s catch. At 10:00 am he would be back at the fish house to prepare and pack the fish. He removed the entrails of the whitefish, but the walleye could be packed whole. His catch of the day would be packaged in fish boxes and put on crushed ice for transport. A good day’s catch would produce around 300 lbs. of whitefish and 50 lbs. of walleye. As a bachelor, he was content with his dog Goofball and the various birds that frequented his North Woods haven. Quiet evenings and dark skys made for excellent reading and star gazing, two of Harry’s other interests.</p>",

This site provides park visitors a dock, picnic tables, and a privy. The historic boathouse, cabins, ice house, and root cellar are open for exploration. The pilings for the trestles and railroad grade can also be seen.</p> <h4>History</h4>   <p><em>The Logging Era<br /> Camp 75</em><br /> <br /> In 1905 Edward Hines and the Weyerhaeuser family pooled their resources to create the Virginia and Rainy Lake Lumber Company. The flag ship of the company was its sawmill in Virginia, Minnesota, which could process one million board feet of lumber a day.<br /> <br /> To transport logs to the sawmill before the days of modern logging technology, logs had to be floated down rivers and winched across lakes in giant booms by amphibious boats called gators. Hoist Bay, home of the Virginia and Rainy Lake Logging Camp 75, was one of these destinations.<br /> <br /> At Hoist Bay, a hoist machine lifted the logs out of the water and placed them on empty train cars for transportation. Pictured below is the railroad trestle and hoist built across the water. The train then transported the logs to Virginia, Minnesota to be cut into boards.<br /> <br /> Between 1913 and 1929 the camp in Hoist Bay operated for 16 years. In its lifetime, 13.5 million board feet of lumber entered its waters. By 1929 most of the white and red pine stands were cut; Camp 75 was shut down and dismantled, ending one part of the Hoist Bay story.<br /> <br /> <em>The Recreation Era<br /> Monson's Resort</em><br /> <br /> The Hoist Bay area lay dormant for almost 10 years, changing ownership 50 times, until 1939 when Ted and Fern Monson purchased the land, starting a new chapter in its history.<br /> <br /> When the Monsons arrived, there were few reminders of the previous logging era. The only remnants included the railroad trestle, an old root cellar, and a garbage dump.<br /> <br /> Between 1939 and 1945 the Monsons built 4 cabins; each cabin had 4 bedrooms, a kitchen, and a living room. Modern amenities such as indoor bathrooms and electricity were added in the 1950s.<br /> <br /> In all, the Monsons built 14 buildings that were enjoyed by summer visitors, and they catered to their guests’ needs for 35 years only closing for 3 years during World War 2.<br /> <br /> Ted and Fern decided to sell the resort in 1973, and in 1978 the Hoist Bay land was acquired by the National Park Service. It was designated a point of interest for visitors, and a new chapter in the history of Hoist Bay began.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Hoist Bay is only accessible by water. Upon arriving into the bay, wood can be seen sticking up from out of the water from what was previously a railroad trestle. A boat dock is located to lead to a grouping of white buildings that once served as resort cabins. To the left of all the cabins near the woods is a wooden building that once was an ice house, where ice was stored before refrigeration.",

They camped nearby without tents and nervously awaited the dawn.<br /> <br /> Morgan was a frontiersman, a teamster by trade, experienced at fighting Indians, and a genius at leading men in battle. When at age 45 he took command of Nathanael Greene’s light troops in 1780, he was well-known for his military abilities, having fought with distinction at Quebec in 1775 and at Saratoga in 1777. After Morgan left the army in February 1781 due to illness, Greene remarked: “Great generals are scarce—there are few Morgans to be found.”   ",

    "bodyText": "This is the initial deployment location for the British. At the start of the battle Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton ordered a detachment of cavalry forward to scatter the American skirmishers. While the Green-uniformed British Legion, Americans loyal to the king, awaited the order to advance. Tarleton gave the order to fix bayonets and sweep the militia off the field.<br /> <br /> Nearby, as the battle ends, retreating British officers of the 17th Light Dragoons clashed with pursuing American horsemen led by Lt. Col. William Washington. He quickly outpaced his troops, broke his weapon at the hilt when he got into a sword fight with a British officer. According to legend, Washington's young servant rode up just in time, saving his life by shooting the attacking British officer.<br /> <br /> It is this account that probably inspired the artist William Ranney in 1845 to paint this vigorous battle scene. Washington and Tarleton raise their swords in the center while Washington's servant boy levels his pistol at a dragoon officer.<br /> <br /> Tarleton had a reputation as being ruthless and fearless in battle. An offspring of British gentry, he purchased his commission in the British Army, and at 21 became an officer of dragoons. He volunteered to fight in America, serving with distinction in the north. In his mid-20s Tarleton became commander of the British Legion, a mobile force of cavalry and infantry. American propagandists vilified him. Decades after the war American writers called him “Bloody Tarleton.”  <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "From the earliest days of settlement through the 1800s, log cabins such as this one provided homes for yeoman (rural middleclass) farmers in the South Carolina backcountry. Typically built with the help of neighbors as a one-bedroom structure, owners added onto their homes as their families grew.<br /> <br /> <b>The Scruggs Family</b><br /> <br /> Robert Scruggs, the builder of this cabin, was born just across the state line in North Carolina in 1800. Around 1805, his family moved to South Carolina near the Cowpens Battlefield and began farming. In the mid-1820s, he married Catharine Connel, and to help the couple establish a household, Robert’s father, Richard Scruggs II, gave them 200 acres of land. Around 1828, they built their home, and began the hard work of clearing, planting, and harvesting. The Scruggs family raised horses, mules, hogs, cattle, and sheep, and planted grain (corn, wheat, rye, and oats) to feed the livestock. In addition, they had a fruit orchard and grew peas, beans, and potatoes. They churned butter for their consumption and for sale. Although the farm was the main source of income for Robert Scruggs, he also ran a country store, which stood on the other side of the Green River Road, in front of this cabin.<br /> <br /> The couple had eleven children, and as the family grew, they added rooms onto the house and covered the log walls with paneling. In doing so, they preserved the original walls of the cabin within the additions. Robert Scruggs died in 1890 at the age of ninety, and Catharine died less than two years later at the age of eighty-seven. The cabin remained in the family until the mid-1970s, when the National Park Service purchased the property from their granddaughter, Rosa.<br /> <br /> <b>Restoration</b><br /> <br /> In the Southeast, many organizations preserve plantation structures. Although wealthy planters were influential people on the coast, it was yeoman famers such as Robert Scruggs who were influential in the Carolina backcountry. Therefore, the National Park Service chose to preserve and protect his house, so that this type of 19<sup>th</sup> century yeoman farmhouse architecture would not totally disappear.<br /> <br /> To return the house to its 1828 appearance, the National Park Service removed the additions and modern improvements, repairing the chimney and replacing the porches, the chinking between the logs, and the modern shingles. Today, the house, in its original location along the Green River Road at Cowpens National Battlefield, serves as an example of typical 1830s era backcountry homestead.<br /> <br /> The reproduction furnishings in the cabin are indicative of the meager belongings that were typical of the early to mid-nineteenth century.<br /> <br /> <b>The First Visitors to the Battlefield</b><br /> <br /> Throughout the years, people have taken trips to the site of the Cowpens battle to honor the men who fought here and to study the terrain.<br /> <br /> On January 11, 1849, Benson Lossing, a noted engraver and author, who was best known for his Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution, stopped at the Scruggs house and asked directions to the site of the Cowpens battle. Arriving at the house about 4:00 p.m., Lossing wrote, “The battle ended with a quarter of a mile of Scruggs’s, where is now a cleared field, on the northeast side of the Mill-Gap [Green River] Road, in the center of which was a log-house, as seen in the annexed engraving. The field was covered with blasted pines, stumps, and stocks [sic] of Indian corn, and had almost dreary appearance.”<br /> <br /> In 1898, a reporter from the Gaffney Ledger, reacting to interest generated by the proposal to create a National Military Park at the Cowpens battleground, stopped at the house, visited with the family, and went with them to see the battlefield.<br /> <br /> Thirty years later, in response to a request by Congressman William F. Stevenson, who was trying to pass another bill to create a national military park at the site of the Cowpens battle, Lieutenant Colonel H.L. Landers of the Army War College surveyed the battlefield. In the process, he visited with the Scruggs family and took a picture of their house, which he published in his Historical Statements Concerning the Battle of Kings Mountain and the Battle of Cowpens, South Carolina.<br /> <br /> Up until the National Park Service acquired the property in the 1970s, students of the battle would stop at the house to get directions to the battlefield and to discuss the battle. Therefore, the Robert Scruggs House became the unofficial first Visitor Center of Cowpens National Battlefield.<br /> <br /> As you reflect on the life and times of the Robert Scruggs family, take a few minutes to think about the pioneer spirit of the people of the Carolina backcountry and of those who fought for our freedom.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Washington Light Infantry built this monument in 1856, several years before the Civil War. At first glance, the monument is not very impressive. However, this type of design typified Revolutionary War monuments of the era. Before the Civil War, the nation commemorated few battlefields with monuments, and most of these were in the North (such as Bunker Hill). Many southern sites remained agricultural land and the battlefields became forgotten. This monument is significant in that it represents one of the few such examples of the time period to memorialize a Revolutionary War battlefield in the South.</p>   <h3><strong>It All Started because of a Flag</strong></h3> <p>The monument’s story starts in 1807 with the founding of the Washington Light Infantry, a South Carolina militia group based in Charleston. From its inception, the Washington Light Infantry participated as a unit in every major war involving the United States until 1919, when the group become part of the SC National Guard.<br /> <br /> Originally, the militia was named in honor of George Washington, but in 1827 they became more associated with his cousin, cavalry commander Col. William Washington. That year, Colonel William Washington’s widow donated the group her late husband’s Eutaw flag. Colonel Washington had flown this homemade flag throughout the Southern Campaign of the Revolution.<br /> <br /> During the 1850s, the country as a whole was in a great deal of turmoil. The problems climaxed with the division in Kansas, as settlers in the region waged bloody battles over the issue of slavery. As this controversy continued, friction developed not only throughout the country, but within the Washington Light Infantry as well. The commanders of the unit decided they needed a common project to unify their group. The 75th anniversary of the Battle of Cowpens was coming up, and Captain Lewis Hatch decided this was the perfect opportunity. Cowpens was arguably the most important battle involving Colonel Washington, so the Washington Light Infantry decided to focus their efforts on building a monument to honor its memory.</p>   <h4><strong>Construction and Dedication</strong></h4> <p>After contacting the citizens of Spartanburg, SC, the Washington Light Infantry proceeded to the Cowpens Battlefield in April of 1856 to build this monument. They travelled to Laurens, SC by train. From Laurens they marched over 100 miles to Spartanburg. On April 21, after a few days of events in town, the men arrived at the site of the Battle of Cowpens. After surveying the field, the group determined, as best they could, the location where Tarleton’s Dragoons first clashed with Washington’s Cavalry. On this spot, the men decided to erect the monument. After two days it was complete. The finished product consisted of an octagonal base with shell and sand from Sullivans Island and an iron shaft, all capped by a ball with a golden eagle on top. Relics were placed inside the base, including a bottle of water from Eutaw Springs (another important battle involving Col. Washington), a brick from a house near the Eutaw Springs battleground, an account of the Battle of Cowpens, and a roster of the Washington Light Infantry members involved in constructing the monument.<br /> With locals and others looking on, the monument was dedicated with speeches and a cannon salute by the Cowpens Light Artillery. Captain Hatch gave one of the speeches, telling the crowd he hoped this monument would renew the spirit of the revolution and help prevent a future war from taking place.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Washington Light Infantry built this monument in 1856, several years before the Civil War. At first glance, the monument is not very impressive. However, this type of design typified Revolutionary War monuments of the era. Before the Civil War, the nation commemorated few battlefields with monuments, and most of these were in the North (such as Bunker Hill). Many southern sites remained agricultural land and the battlefields became forgotten. This monument is significant in that it represents one of the few such examples of the time period to memorialize a Revolutionary War battlefield in the South.</p> <br />   <h3><strong>It All Started because of a Flag</strong></h3> <p>The monument’s story starts in 1807 with the founding of the Washington Light Infantry, a South Carolina miltia group based in Charleston. From its inception, the Washington Light Infantry participated as a unit in every major war involving the United States until 1919, when the group become part of the SC National Guard.<br /> <br /> Originally, the militia was named in honor of George Washington, but in 1827 they became more associated with his cousin, cavalry commander Col. William Washington. That year, Colonel William Washington’s widow donated the group her late husband’s Eutaw flag. Colonel Washington had flown this homemade fl ag throughout the Southern Campaign of the Revolution.<br /> <br /> During the 1850s, the country as a whole was in a great deal of turmoil. The problems climaxed with the division in Kansas, as settlers in the region waged bloody battles over the issue of slavery. As this controversy continued, friction developed not only throughout the country, but within the Washington Light Infantry as well. The commanders of the unit decided they needed a common project to unify their group. The 75th anniversary of the Battle of Cowpens was coming up and Captain Lewis Hatch decided this was the perfect opportunity. Cowpens was arguably the most important battle involving Colonel Washington, so the Washington Light Infantry decided to focus their eff orts on building a monument to honor its memory.</p> <br />   <h4><strong>Construction and Dedication</strong></h4> <p>After contacting the citizens of Spartanburg, SC, the Washington Light Infantry proceeded to the Cowpens Battlefield in April of 1856 to build this monument. They travelled to Laurens, SC by train. From Laurens they marched over 100 miles to Spartanburg. On April 21, after a few days of events in town, the men arrived at the site of the Battle of Cowpens. After surveying the field, the group determined, as best they could, the location where Tarleton’s Dragoons first clashed with Washington’s Cavalry. On this spot, the men decided to erect the monument. After two days it was complete. The finished product consisted of an octagonal base with shell and sand from Sullivans Island and an iron shaft, all capped by a ball with a golden eagle on top. Relics were placed inside the base, including a bottle of water from Eutaw Springs (another important battle involving Col. Washington), a brick from a house near the Eutaw Springs battleground, an account of the Battle of Cowpens, and a roster of the Washington Light Infantry members involved in constructing the monument.<br /> With locals and others looking on, the monument was dedicated with speeches and a cannon salute by the Cowpens Light Artillery. Captain Hatch gave one of the speeches, telling the crowd he hoped this monument would renew the spirit of the revolution and help prevent a future war from taking place. However, local citizens saw things differently. To many, the monument signified Southern independence, the ability of those in the South to throw off the chains of tyranny. In fact, a month after South Carolina seceded, many local residents rallied around the monument to show their support for the Confederacy.</p> <br />   <h4><b>A Century of Neglect</b></h4> <p>At the time of construction, the monument stood on private property. To preserve the land, a group of Spartanburg women decided to raise funds to purchase a one-acre tract around the monument. Through a series of fundraisers and bake sales, the women purchased the deed in July 1856. A group of local men subsequently erected an iron fence around the monument. With these last improvements, the battleground’s first commemorative effort was completed.<br /> <br /> Since that time, the monument has suffered several attacks of vandalism. One of these incidents resulted in the theft of the golden eagle. With the creation of Cowpens National Battlefield in 1972, the National Park Service began preserving the battlefield as well as the other historical structures onsite, including the Washington Light Infantry Monument. In 1980, repairs were made to restore the monument to its original state (minus the golden eagle, of course). The National Park Service is dedicated to preserving the monument as it reflects the earliest commemorative efforts on this battlefield and in the South.</p>",

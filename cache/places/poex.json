For a short time, the company had a “virtual monopoly of the army freighting business in the west and southwest.”<a href=\"#3\">[3]</a> <br /> <br /> The 300-acre farmstead was dissected by the westernmost US border, making part of the property outside US jurisdiction and, thus, untaxable. The company’s barns, mule sheds, grazing lands, wagon and blacksmith shops, and other business-related entities were located on the portion of property located in the Kansas Territory.<a href=\"#4\">[4]</a> A caravan camp was used to load the heavy freight wagons which would travel the trails.<a href=\"#5\">[5]</a> <br /> <br /> The home was built in 1856, most likely using the labor of enslaved people.<a href=\"#6\">[6]</a>  The “T” shaped floorplan with recessed front porch makes it a unique iteration of the Greek revival style in Kansas City.<a href=\"#7\">[7]</a>  Today, it is one of the oldest buildings in Kansas City, as one of only 4 pre-Civil War buildings left standing.<a href=\"#8\">[8]</a> Though the house remains, many of the other original structures are gone and the land has been divided into distinct plots. Among the lost structures were living quarters for the 16-17 people enslaved by the Majors’.<a href=\"#9\">[9] </a><br /> <br /> In 1930 Louisa P. Johnston, Majors’s great grand-daughter, travelled to visit her ancestral home and found the house abandoned. She bought the house in 1932 and, for the next forty years, worked to preserve the property. In 1984 the Alexanders Majors House Museum was opened to the public for tours and events. In 2010 the house partnered with the John Wornall House and Museum to create one nonprofit dedicated to preserving both properties.  </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(8201 State Line Road (east side of road near 85th Street), Kansas City)<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.wornallmajors.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <br /> <br />   <div> <p id=\"ftn1\"><em><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Marc Simmons, Following the Santa Fe Trail: A Guide for Modern Travelers (Santa Fe, NM: Ancient City Press, 1984), p. 61.</em></p> <p><em><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Martha Kusiak, “Alexander Majors House,” National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form.

    "bodyText": "<p>Before Broad Hollow, wagons followed Dixie Hollow, the ravine to the right side of today’s paved road. The hollow bristled with brush and its boulder-choked bottom was too narrow for wagons to pass. The Donner-Reed wagon party grubbed a dangerous sideling trail along the sloping bank before dropping, exhausted, into their first camp beyond the Weber River. Mormon pioneers improved the rough track, but despite their efforts, many wagons over the years tumbled sideways off the trail. Dixie Hollow narrows and becomes impassable to wagons.<br /> <br /> Broad Hollow, which drains into Dixie Hollow near the Donner-Reed campsite of August 11, provided a detour around the Dixie Hollow chokepoint. The pioneers veered northwest up Broad Hollow, turned west across a wide bench, and then dropped south again to East Canyon Creek and through today’s East Canyon State Park.<br /> <br /> A monument marks the location where pioneers turned west. Some researchers think the two-track to the right of the monument may be the original trail alignment, but it might be a more recent ranch road. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Southwest of Henefer, Utah)</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "audioDescription": "Chimney Rock National Historic Site. 231 words<br /><br />The visitor center here consists of a long, central rectangular building with its peak in front and it long axis running away from you as you approach up the wide sidewalk. Two wings stair-step off the right side and a longer, flatter wing extends to the left. The entrance is reached by moving under an open wooden-truss supported by six sandstone pillars, three on each side. A small sign at the edge of the sidewalk warns of rattlesnakes in the area. Please stay on sidewalks.<br /><br />Entering through the double doors you will be in an open hallway that extends to the rear of the building where another set of doors exits to a patio with seating. The information desk is about halfway down the 40-foot hallway on your left. The gift shop may be found by turning to the left just before you reach the desk. An exhibit area is found on the right side of the hallway.<br /><br />Chimney Rock itself is behind on the far side of fenced pasture land where cattle may be grazing. Towering over the surrounding landscape, it may be easily seen both from the parking lot and from the patio behind the visitor center. The formation is shaped like a large cone, wide at its base, and topped with a narrow finger of rock projecting upwards like a steeple.",

I was prepared for a fight, but the stillness of the night and the howling of the wolves and coyotes made cold chills run through me at times.\"  Pony Bob Haslam, on his ride from Cold Springs to Sand Springs (Nevada) in May 1860.</p> </blockquote> <p>Accounts mention numerous Pony riders who were killed during the outbreak of the Pyramid Lake War with the Paiutes in 1860, but multiple sources may be referring to the same unnamed rider and some stories were clearly made up. So far, only three rider fatalities at the hands of warriors are securely documented including that of a Hispanic rider. The Hispanic rider was Jose Zowgaltz, who was ambushed as he crossed the thick aspen bottoms of Edwards Creek. Zowgaltz galloped to Cold Springs Station, south of the ambush site. Suffering a mortal abdominal wound, he slipped bleeding from his saddle upon entering the station and soon died. The rider's death was recorded by assistant station keeper J.G. Kelley, who had to ride Zowgaltz's return relay two days later. Kelley raced his pony through the leafy green tunnel of aspens \"like a streak of greased lightning\" and once clear, paused to look back. The bushes along the trail trembled suspiciously; Kelley suspected they concealed warriors who had been unable to get a clear shot at him.<br /> <br /> Intact, standing ruins of the Cold Springs Pony Express Station where Jose Zowgaltz died still remain. Viewing the site requires a two-mile round-trip hike on loose dirt through open sagebrush plains (where one is exposed to the elements) starting from Cold Springs Day-Use Area.

At the edge of the gravel pullout is a Nebraska Historical Marker that reads, \"Courthouse and Jail Rocks are two of the most famous landmarks of westward migration. Nearby passed the Oregon-California Trail, the Mormon Trail, the Pony Express Trail, and the Sidney-Deadwood Trail. The rocks were vanguards of unforgettable scenic wonders that travelers would encounter farther west, including Chimney Rock's curious spire and the rugged heights of Scott's Bluffs.<br /><br />\"Hundreds of overland emigrants mentioned Courthouse Rock in their diaries. Often called a 'castle' or 'solitary tower,' the name Courthouse was first used in 1837. One 1845 traveler described the rock as â€˜resembling the ruins of an old castle [which] rises abruptly from the plain... It is difficult to look upon it and not believe that art had something to do with its construction. The voyagers have called it the Courthouse; but it looks infinitely more like the Capitol.'<br /><br />\"Courthouse and Jail Rocks, rising some 400 feet above the North Platte Valley, are erosional remnants composed of clay, sandstone, and volcanic ash. The rocks are listed in the National Register of Historic Places and in the Nebraska Natural Areas Register.\"<br /><br />Looking westward, past the sign, the two formations can be seen rising out of the surrounding pasture land. Courthouse Rock, on the right, is larger, looming over the prairie like a squat cylinder with a smaller circular layer sitting on top. Jail Rock, on the left, is the same height but only about one-third as wide. It is also cylindrical, but has more sloping sides.",

For the Mormon militia, this seemed a strategic location to stop or delay approaching federal troops. Defensive Breastworks (Echo Canyon) positioned along the rim of the cliff to the right are barely visible in several places from the canyon floor. Mormon militiamen, fearing an attack on Salt Lake City by the U.S. Army, built the low rubble walls above the emigrant road in 1857. The breastworks would protect the defenders as they fired down on approaching federal troops. Because they are made of local sandstone from the cliffs and were meant to be unobtrusive, the structures can be difficult to see.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Echo Canyon, Utah)</p> <p>Pull into a turnout on the right side of the road to view a large wooden sign that describes the Mormon defense preparations in Echo Canyon. Continue to the next turnout, 1/4 mile beyond, and pause at Summit County’s brown tour sign No. 7 for Billboard Bluff. From the turnout, look up at the base of the cliff face to see 19th century roadside advertisements painted directly onto the rock. (These are unassociated with the Utah War.)<br /> <br /> Travel 1/10 mile, watching for brown Summit County tour sign No. 6 on the left. From the tour-stop sign, face the cliff to the right of the road and look along the rim to see a low stone wall. Then turn and look east across the freeway to the bluffs on the opposite side of the canyon. Just below the alignment of telephone poles that crosses the slope, a faint horizontal line in the earth is sometimes visible, depending on the quality of the light and vegetation. The line is what remains of a defensive trench dug by the Mormon militia. Approaching federal troops were to be caught in crossfire from between the cliff-top breastworks and the entrenchment.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

On your right a granite ridge extends across the view. Near the right end a deep, broken-V-shaped notch can be seen, slightly wider than it is deep. The left side of the notch slants steeply toward the unseen river below. The right side of the notch descends vertically about halfway through the ridge, then slopes to the left. Text on a wayside sign tells us that the notch is called Devil's Gate, a 370-foot high, 1,500 feet-long fissure carved over the centuries by the Sweetwater River.<br /><br />To the right of the notch, the granite slopes down gradually to a pass where a small road winds its way.<br /><br />A half dozen wayside signs are spaced along the paved walkway. They cover topics such as the trails that passed this way, and local landmarks such as Martin's Cove, where Mormon emigrants sheltered from a winter storm, and Sun Ranch. One sign, titled \"A Tribute to Hardship,\" discusses the deaths along the trail, many caused by cholera. It mentions that up on this ridge, safe from the wagon trails below, are over 20 known American Indian and emigrant graves.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Donner HIll hammered yet another nail into the Donner-Reed coffin. For 12 days the emigrants had gnawed a track through the rugged Wasatch wilderness, and now, at the very edge of the Salt Lake Valley, limestone outcrops and dense willows blocked their exit from the mouth of Emigration Canyon. The discouraged travelers pulled to the left out of the creek bottom and up the 200-foot-high ridge that thereafter would bear their name. The effort nearly used up the strength of their oxen. The next year Brigham Young’s vanguard pioneer party, having more men for the labor, opened a road through the blockage, avoiding the hill climb, in just 4 hours’ time. The current roadbed approximates their route.<br /> <br /> Today, Emigration Canyon is widened and the top of Donner Hill has been leveled to make room for residential development. But the hill is still impressive and Emigration Creek, edged by willow and scrub oak, still runs along the south side of Emigration Canyon Road. Visitors can easily envision how this spot looked in 1846-47.<br /> <br /> The evening of their arrival on July 22, the Donner-Reed Party encamped a short distance beyond the hilltop with the broad Salt Lake Valley stretched at their feet. A grassy park along the ridge, adjacent to Crestview Drive, is named Donner Park in commemoration of that campsite. The next day the emigrants descended the ridge and traveled across the valley to the Jordan River. From there, the Donner Reed Party continued along the south shore of the Great Salt Lake.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Emigration Canyon, near Rotary Glen Park)</p> <p>On the right at odometer mile 20 is another small sign for Donner Hill. A stone monument commemorating Donner Hill is on the left where the road curves to the south. At that location the hill is in front of you, easy to see, with a condominium at the top. Use caution when crossing the oncoming lane to enter or leave the widened road shoulder at the monument. Then continue down Emigration Canyon Road around the S-curve. If traffic permits, turn left at odometer mile 20.6 into an unmarked entrance for Rotary Glen Park. If you miss the entrance, turn left onto the next paved road, Crestview Drive, and turn around at a safe location to return to the intersection. Turn right and make an immediate right turn into Rotary Glen Park. Now go left across the parking lot and follow the dirt access road to the east. End at a gravel parking lot.<br /> <br /> Look across the small reservoir toward Donner Hill, the ridge to the northeast. The emigrants ascended the ridge on the north side of the condominiums. From this vantage, the steepness of the climb is evident. Take the opportunity here or at the picnic area to the west to explore Emigration Creek.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Pony Express Wyoming No. 15 Contract Station <br /> (North Platte</strong>/Platte Bridge/Casper<strong>)</strong><br /> In 1859, Louis Guinard built a trading post and a bridge near the point where the Mormon Pioneer Company crossed the North Platte River in 1847.This station was used as an overnight stage stop, where Richard Burton spent the night on August 16, 1860.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Our station lay near the upper crossing or second bridge, a short distance from the town. It was also built of timber at an expense of $40,000 about a year ago by Louis Guenot. . . . It was impossible to touch the squaw's supper: the tin cans that contained the coffee were slippery with grease, and the bacon looked as if it had been dressed side-by-side with 'boyaux'.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The Pony Express also established a station at this complex. Pony riders crossed the North Platte River on Guinard's Bridge, but the route stayed close to the north bank of the river until reaching Red Buttes Crossing, where another Pony Express station was located. In 1862, Lt. Col. William O. Collins sent one company of the 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry to protect the telegraph line at \"Guinard's Bridge.\" The soldiers moved into Guinard's station complex, and named the garrison \"Platte Bridge Station.\"<br /> <br /> The post was renamed in honor of Lieutenant Caspar Collins after his death in the Battle of Platte Bridge in 1865. The fort continued to protect emigrant trails and the transcontinental telegraph line until it closed in 1867. All salvageable materials were transferred and used to build Fort Fetterman.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (4001 Fort Caspar Rd, Casper, Wyoming)</p> <p>A 1936 reconstruction of the fort is furnished as it was in 1865. Fort Caspar Museum is operated by the City of Casper.

    "audioDescription": "Fort Kearny State Historical Park. 402 words<br /><br />The park is an area of mowed lawns dotted with tall trees surrounded by flat crop land. A wide sidewalk leads from the parking lot to the visitor center, a low building with two wings extending back at a 30-degree angle on either side of the central lobby area. The walls are made of tan bricks with red-brown wood trim. Medium gray shingles cover the gently sloped roof. A short ramp with railings leads up to the front door.<br /><br />Restrooms are housed in a separate building to the right of the visitor center, at the end of the parking lot.<br /><br />As you enter the visitor center, the six-sided information desk lies directly in front of you, in the middle of the room. To the left is a small gift shop area with doorways that leading into exhibit areas in the adjoining room. Another door at the rear of the lobby, behind the information desk, leads out into the grounds.<br /><br />Behind the visitor center, the sidewalk passes a wagon with a canvas cover off to the right, then curves to the left and enters a reconstructed blacksmith and carpenter shop. The building is long and low, its walls made of rectangular blocks of grayish-tan sod. The roof is formed by wooden poles laid on crossbeams and covered with soil where grasses and other plants grow.<br /><br />Behind the blacksmith/carpenter shop the sidewalk leads to a grassy area where short cement posts mark the locations of buildings that have not been reconstructed. Faded wayside signs identify the various structures.<br /><br />To the left of the blacksmith/carpenter shop is a reconstructed fort surrounded by a palisade made of upright logs set in the ground topped with sharpened ends. Just to the rear and slightly to the left of the blacksmith/carpenter shop is another wagon, this one without any covering. A sidewalk to the left of the shop leads back towards the parking lot. Along this sidewalk is a tall metal sign which is a Nebraska Historical Marker. The sign outlines the history of Fort Kearny from the first post established in 1848, through its service as a waystation along the Oregon and California Trails and home station for the Pony Express, until it was discontinued as a military post in 1871, two years after the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. The site is on the National Register of Historic Places.",

    "audioDescription": "Fort Laramie National Historic Site. 394 words<br /><br />From the parking lot, a long sidewalk winds north towards the middle of the fort area to the visitor. On either side are some buildings that have been restored and others that exist only as foundations or ruins. Most of the structures are of concrete or adobe and tan in color with gray shingle roofs. Other buildings are wood frame and painted white.<br /><br />Along the sidewalk are a couple of wayside signs with information about the park and the surrounding area. About halfway to the visitor center is a tall stone monument with multiple plaques on its sides commemorating the Pony Express and Transcontinental Telegraph and identifying Fort Laramie as being on the National Register of Historic Places. On front a stone marker reads, \"Fort Laramie, a military post on the Oregon Trail, June 16, 1849 to March 2, 1890. This monument is erected by the state of Wyoming and a few interested residents, 1913.\"<br /><br />The walkway then crosses a dirt road and continues on over the lawn, crossing a shallow ditch over a short wooded bridge. A small sign in front of the visitor center building reads, \"Commissary Storehouse. This building was completed in 1884. It was built as a commissary storage facility. As such, it would have been primarily divided into two large storerooms: one for meat and one for flour, rice and beans. Three or four smaller rooms would have been used as offices, an â€˜issue room' and a storage room for canned goods. This building also had a partial cellar with a trap door for use with a hand-operated elevator. Rations and other official army food items were issued from this building. A commissary officer and sergeant ran the operation.\"<br /><br />The entrance is located about 30 feet from the right end of the building. The small wooden porch in front of the door may be reached by a set of 5 stairs on the right side or by a ramp that zig-zags up on the left side. At the right end of the building a small sign indicates that restrooms are located in the rear of the building.<br /><br />As you enter the building, the information desk is straight ahead of you against the opposite wall. Bookcases and shelving to your left form the gift shop. On the right side is an exhibit area.",

The Donner-Reed Party was the third emigrant wagon party to pass through the canyon.<br /> <br /> Today Echo Canyon is still a busy transportation corridor, occupied by I-80, the Union Pacific Railroad, a segment of the Old Lincoln Highway (the nation’s first coast-to-coast automobile highway), and modern communications and utility lines. More than 160 years of development have altered the canyon, but fascinating traces of 19th century uses still are visible.<br /> <br /> As you enter I-80, look ahead and to the right toward the bare rampart of Castle Rock, an emigrant landmark near the head of Echo Canyon. The Mormon pioneer company headed by Brigham Young, who had taken ill with a tickborne infection, camped near here on July 14, 1847. The combined California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express Trail ran between the two modern railroad grades, and a Pony Express and stage station once stood on the grounds of the “old automobile graveyard” that is visible from the freeway. <strong>The site is on private property, not open to the public.</strong></p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (between Wahsatch and Echo, UT; Westbound I-80 enters Echo Canyon between mileposts 188 and 187 southwest of Wahsatch.)</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

On a knoll a short distance from the river, Marshall built his base of operations. He then constructed a rope ferry across the river and charged up to $5.00 per wagon to use it. The ferry was very popular- at times, thousands of emigrants would be camped here, waiting for days for their turn to cross.

    "audioDescription": "Historic Trails Park (Marshall's Ferry). 390 words<br /><br />This small park has a dirt road that runs in a loop around a central grassy area with several large trees. At the front of this area is a large stone sign that reads, \"Historic Trails Park.\" On the left end of the sign is a metal plaque with \"Marshall Ferry\" in raised lettering and a relief carving of a ferry boat. On the other end of the sign is another plaque recognizing donors to the park. At the far end of the loop, on the right side of the road are more stone markers and a replica ferry boat. All of the stone markers have metal plaques with raised lettering. The first one, which is on the right side of the ferry replica, tells us the history of the site.<br /><br />The ferry boat is a low platform built of wood with short, hinged ramps leading up either end. The other sides are edged with a simple wood railing. On the far side is mounted a large wheel which controls a heavy rope. The rope loops from the wheel to either end of the ferry then out to a sliding pully which runs on a rope running parallel to the ferry and tied to trees on either end.<br /><br />To the left of the ferry is another stone marker which discusses the rope ferry and how it worked. Travelers paid up to $5 per wagon and 25 cents per head of livestock. The original ferry was located 1200 feet northwest of here from 1851 until 1864 when a bridge was built.<br /><br />Further to the left is a semi-circular pavement edged with 7 large stone markers. The plaque on the largest one in the center has a map of the western United States with the routes of a variety of trails fanning out from the Kansas-Missouri border, listed as California NHT, Oregon NHT, St. Joe Road, Military Road, Mormon NHT, Pony Express NHT, Overland Stage and Otoe-Missouria.<br /><br />The three markers to the right of center have plaques that discuss the Founders - Frank Marshall who established a trading post and ferry here - and the Otoe-Missouria Trail, the California trail, the Overland Stage and the Oregon Trail. On the left of center the markers cover the Pony Express, the Military Road, the Mormon Trail, St. Joe Road and Alcove Spring.",

The first wagons, belonging to the Donner-Reed Party, crossed this divide in 1846, followed in 1847 by Brigham Young's vanguard party of Mormon pioneers. Imagine those emigrants' despair upon reaching this spot and seeing the jagged, blue-gray peaks of the Wasatch Mountains on the horizon ahead. From here, both wagon companies had to grub a rough track over divides and mountains and down a series of willow-packed canyons and creek bottoms in order to reach the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. The effort cost the Donner-Reed party 13 days, one of a series of troubles that caused the group to be trapped by blizzards in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Utah Highway 65, about 5.5 miles southwest of Henefer, Utah)<br /> Hastings Cutoff and Mormon Trail Wagon Ruts at Hogsback Summit (southwest of Henefer), marked by white fiberglass trail posts, are clearly visible along the right side of the road beyond the fence line at the Summit and Morgan County boundary. Just ahead at Hogsback Summit, the pioneers looked west and saw a discouraging jumble of mountains. An interpretive sign at the turnout tells the story.<br /> <br /> Look for the swales on the right near the Morgan County sign at odometer reading 5.7 miles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit</strong></p> <p>\"40 Miles to Fort Bridger\"</p> <p>\"The country west looks rough and mountainous,\" wrote William Clayton, describing this panorama of the Wasatch Mountains. Modern historians have dubbed this summit \"Heartbreak Ridge\" to describe the feelings of many early Mormon Pioneers who crested this ridge. After months on the trail, traveling over 1,200 weary miles, it was heart- wrenching to discover that the most difficult part of the journey still lay ahead. Some people must have broken down and wept. Others gritted their teeth with determination and moved southwest down off Hogsback Summit to challenge the mountains and canyons that lay ahead.</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“...arrived [July 19] on the suummit of the dividing ridge and put a guide hard up, \"80 miles to Fort Bridger\"... The descent is not very steep but exceedingly dangerous to wagons being mostly on the side hill over large cobble stones, causing the wagons to slide very badly.” -William Clayton</i></p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express Trail</a></h2>",

In addition to living quarters for the Hollenberg family, the building served as a neighborhood grocery store, a tavern, and an unofficial post-office. Emigrants were able to obtain provisions at the ranch. Three years later, it became a Pony Express home station and later a stage station.<br /> <br /> Dr. C.M. Clark reached Cottonwood Creek in 1860 and found \"a small stream which is dry during the summer months. The approach to it is winding and steep, and as the bed of the stream contains several large stones at the ford, some care is necessary in driving. There are two good springs here, but no wood.

    "audioDescription": "Homestead National Historical Park. 418 words<br /><br />The visitor center here at Homestead is reached by a broad sidewalk that runs parallel to the right side of the parking lot. Looking down the sidewalk we see the one-story, red-brick building. The front of the lobby area on the right is all glass. The flat roof slants up gradually to the right side, then slopes up steeply to a point at the right rear of the building. White lettering on the wall to the left of the entrance reads, \"Homestead National Historical Park, Heritage Center.\"<br /><br />To the right of the entrance, a textured cement wall stained an earthen-tan color extends towards us along the sidewalk. On the other side of the sidewalk are several benches. <br /><br />To the left of the building a sidewalk winds out to a one-room log cabin and displays of old farm equipment.<br /><br />Before reaching the end of the wall are several signs. One covers park regulations. Another tells us that a cell phone audio tour is available by dialing 402-715-9527. A third sign is titled \"Walk in Their Shoes\" and shows a black white photograph of a man following a plow pulled by a team of mules. It reads, \"What was it like to be a homesteader? To get an idea, take a walk. The flags around the parking lot enclose an acre. It may not seem huge. But plowing an acre meant walking about 10 miles. Over uneven soil. Driving a team of oxen. In sun or rain. Walk that acre. Then multiply it by 160, the size of a typical homestead.\"<br /><br />As you reach the end of the wall, another wayside sign shows a map of the United States with all the homestead states identified. The only states without homesteading were those on the eastern seaboard, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas and Hawaii. Text on the sign tells us that the Homestead Act of 1862 offered people 160 acres of free land if they were willing to live on it, farm it and build a home. The map shows the 30 homesteading states in which the government gave away 270 million acres.<br /><br />Metal cutouts of the 30 homestead states are mounted on the wall, each with a square cutout that represents the proportion of homestead land in that state. Feel free to touch.<br /><br />As you enter the center, there is a sign-in book at the right side of the foyer. Inside, the information desk is to your left and the gift shop is to your right.",

    "audioDescription": "Independence Rock State Historic Site. 408 words<br /><br />Parking for Independence Rock is at a rest area on the side of the highway. The large gray granite mound can be seen across the rangeland surrounding it. Cement sidewalks lead past the restroom and other buildings to a large stone marker with a metal relief sculpture of a wagon and ox team. Feel free to stop and touch. From there, the entrance to the fields around Independence Rock is just across a paved access drive.<br /><br />The covered entrance is made of tan brickwork, with metal fencing on the back side. There are a couple of wayside signs here that show a map of the trails that encircle the rock and that ask visitors to be respectful of the area. There is also a warning that rattlesnakes live in this area.<br /><br />To reach the rock itself, proceed through the pass-through in the fence and follow the cement side walk across the grassy prairieland. Other signs along the walk describe the Sweetwater River Valley, discuss the geology of the granite outcrops in the valley, and provide information on the historic trails that passed this way, naming the rock, hardships along the trail, history of the area in the last 150 years, and the signatures that were carved in the rock. From the signs, we learn that this mass of granite is 700 feet wide, 1,900 feet long and 136 feet high.<br /><br />Swales from the wagon ruts can also be seen through the pasture, the most prominent one being crossed by a wooden foot bridge.<br /><br />The sidewalk ends at a metal gate close to the base of the rock. Once through the gate there are benches along the fence to the left. The sidewalk continues up to the base of the rock itself then continues in either direction around the base. The cement will change to gravel and then to dirt if you continue to follow the trail. From the path around the rock it is easy to feel the rock or even to climb the steep slope; however there are no fixed paths to the top of the rock. At the end of the rock to the left there is one section that is protected by a metal fence. Here there are carvings in the stone and a group of metal memorial plaques and other markers, including one that identifies the rock as being \"Wyoming Place number 1 on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",

    "bodyText": "<p>Mitchell Pass is a gap between Scotts Bluff and South Bluff. In 1850, a wagon road was built through what was then called \"Devil's Gap\", and it became the primary route for emigrants (pioneers heading west), soldiers, Pony Express riders and the Transcontinental telegraph. Prior to 1851, emigrants would have used <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/robidoux-pass.htm\">Robidoux Pass</a> to bypass Scotts Bluff. <br /> <br /> In 1851, William Lobenstine wrote in his journal:</p> <p><em>\"The rock itself is separated nearly at it's middle, having a pass here fifty to sixty feet wide, ascending at both sides perpendicular to a height of three to four hundred feet.</em></p> <p><em>The passage through here was only made possible in 1851 and is now preferred by nearly all emigrants, cutting off a piece of eight miles from the old road.\"</em></p> <p>Mitchell Pass was named for nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-mitchell-site.htm\">Fort Mitchell</a>, which was named after United States Brigadier General Robert B. Mitchell. <br /> <br /> Today, visitors to Scotts Bluff National Monument can walk through Mitchell Pass on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/oregon-trail-pathway.htm\">Oregon Trail Pathway</a>, a half-mile long hiking trail. </p>",

    "audioDescription": "National Historic Trails Interpretive Center. 322 words<br /><br />Seen from the parking lot, the building is a low, one-story, circular structure, almost blending in with the prairie vegetation surrounding it. A series of shiny, royal-blue wall segments stair-step out from the center of the building and extend to the left. The sidewalk leads to the left, then curves back to the right, around the blue wall to reach the front of the building. Along the left edge of the sidewalk are four tall panels, one for each of the trails commemorated here: the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, the Pony Express Trail and the Mormon Trail, each associated with a different color, which is then echoed in bricks placed in the sidewalk along with flat stones engraved with quotes from emigrants.<br /><br />At the front of the building, a large triangular patio extends to the left, dotted with stone benches. To reach the entrance, follow the rough stone wall on the right side of the walkway. This wall then becomes a tunnel, with a dark green wall on the left and topped with a covering supported by semi-circular metal beams, echoing the shape of a covered wagon. Spaced randomly in the stone wall are larger stones with images of prominent geographical features along the trails, such as Chimney Rock, Natural Bridge, Laramie Peak and Fort Laramie.<br /><br />Entering the front doors brings you into a large, open lobby space. In the middle of this space is a welcome kiosk with a map of the facility. The exhibit space may be reached through an opening in the wall beyond the kiosk or by following the curving hallway to the right. Restrooms are also along the right-hand hallway.<br /><br />The information desk is off to the left of the kiosk. From the desk, the gift shop will be to your left. To your right at that point is stone wall with names of donors carved into the blocks.",

    "audioDescription": "North Platte River Crossing. 431 words<br /><br />This historic bridge lies just east of the modern highway bridge. This one-lane bridge has three spans, each a low arch about 15 feet high, made of iron, now rusty-brown in color. There are \"I\" beam piers at the beginning and end of each arch. The flooring is formed by broad planking, now a weathered gray. The bridge is much longer than the current width of the river. Only the northern span still has water underneath.<br /><br />At the southern end of the bridge, at the edge of the dirt parking lot, is a wayside sign titled, \"Spanning a Century: End of an Era.\" A historic photograph on the sign shows the bridge in 1877 when the water stretched from end to end of the bridge. Text reads in part, \"Once broad and turbulent, the North Platte River posed a formidable obstacle to 19th century travelers. High water made it nearly impossible to cross the river for several month each year. The crossing became less dangerous by 1850 when ferry service was established to meet the growing volume of military and emigrant traffic.\" It goes on to tell us that after the Great Sioux Reservation was established in 1868, huge amount of supplies were needed to be transported to supply the Indian agencies, leading Congress to fund construction of a bridge. Text at the bottom of the sign reads, \"The King Iron Bridge Company built bridges with speed and efficiency by standardizing the manufacturing process and maintaining stockpiles of prefabricated parts. The triple-span Fort Laramie Bridge was constructed between August 1875 and February 1876 for $15,000. Rubble-filled log ice breakers protect the unique I-beam piers supporting the bridge. Spanning 400 feet, this bridge is the best-preserved King paten tubular bowstring iron bridge still in existence.\"<br /><br />To the right of the bridge, a trail leads down to the water's edge, then proceeds eastward along the bank. Another wayside sign by the river tells of initial skirmishes between the military and the Lakota Sioux, the beginnings of the Northern Plains Indian wars, which finally ended in 1890 at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.<br /><br />At the northern end of the bridge are 2 markers. One identifies the bridge as a Wyoming Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The other marker, protected by a metal rail fence, reads, \"Old Army Bridge over the Platte River, erected in 1875. This bridge was a vital link between Cheyenne, Fort Laramie and the military outposts, Indian agencies and gold fields of the Black Hills Dakota Regions. Placed by the Historical Landmark Commission of Wyoming, July 1951.\"",

    "audioDescription": "O'Fallon's Bluff at Sutherland Rest Area. 365 words<br /><br />From the parking area at this rest stop, a sidewalk leads around the rest room building on the right side, loops behind it, then turns right, away from the building, out to where swales can be seen running roughly parallel to the highway. About halfway out a small loop to the left passes a low brick wall with a sign on top. The metal sign, which has raised lettering, is titled \"The Great Platte River Road.\" It reads in part, \"This is the Platte River Valley, Americas great road west. It provided a natural pathway for westward expansion across the continent during the nineteenth century. Here passed the Oregon Trail, following the South Platte River along much the same route as the highway over which you now travel. Beginning in 1841, nearly 250,000 travelers crossed the plains to Oregon and California over this important overland route. Here at O'Fallon's Bluffs, the wagon trains faced one of the most difficult and dangerous spots on the trail. The Platte River cut directly against the bluff, making it necessary to travel the narrow roadway over O'Fallon's Bluffs.\"<br /><br /> A stone bench is on a low wall at the right side of this loop. <br /><br />At the far end of the sidewalk is another sign with raised lettering. This one is titled, \"Crossing the Overland Trail.\" It reads in part, \"Beneath this platform, evidence of the great westward migration still remains. These shallow depressions were once deep ruts created by thousands of hooves, shoes and wheels. The Overland Trail is often visualized as a single, well-defined roadway. However, except in narrow spots such as this, the actual route through the Platte Valley during any given year varied considerably, depending upon such factors as soil conditions and the availability of grass for the animals.\"<br /><br />Looking both right and left from this sign you can see shallow swales coming up the slope from the left. Large iron wagon-wheel shapes have been mounted in several places to clearly mark the shallow depressions in the grassy slope. Two sets of four wheels are off to your left and two more sets are off to the right.",

Before 1851, pioneers used Robidoux Pass since the badlands between the river and the bluff made travel impossible. Nine miles south of Scotts Bluff, the pass offered a spring and a trading post operated by the Robidoux brothers.</p>   <p>In 1851, Mitchell Pass was opened and became the main route for the emigrants (pioneers heading west).<br /> <br /> In 1851, William Lobenstine wrote in his journal:</p> <p><em>\"The rock itself is separated nearly at it's middle, having a pass here fifty to sixty feet wide, ascending at both sides perpendicular to a height of three to four hundred feet.</em></p> <p><em>The passage through here was only made possible in 1851 and is now preferred by nearly all emigrants, cutting off a piece of eight miles from the old road.\"</em></p> <p>Mitchell Pass, known during the 1850's as \"Devil's Gap\" became the principle route of the military, pony express and the telegraph. Mitchell Pass was named after United States Brigadier General Robert B. Mitchell.</p> <p>The covered wagons in front of the Scotts Bluff National Monument administrative building mark the start of the Oregon Trail Pathway. The smaller Studebaker and Murphy wagons were the mode of transportation for families. The larger Conestoga wagon was not often used on the Oregon Trail, but was used to haul freight. Living history demonstrations occur at the Murphy wagon during the summer.</p> <p>When the trail surface changes from asphalt to dirt, you are walking \"on\" the actual Oregon Trail. Today, after over 150 years of erosion of the soft rocks, individual wheel ruts are not visible. What is visible is called a \"swale,\" which is a deep roadbed that was created by wagons traveling single file through Mitchell Pass.</p> <p>After crossing Mitchell Pass, the trail becomes paved again, and the Oregon Trail's path is marked by wooden posts in the trail's center. Near the end of the hiking trail is the site where William Henry Jackson camped and sketched while working as a bullwhacker on a wagon train in 1866.</p>",

Eisenhower agreed to be the honorary Chairman of the organization. Waddell F. Smith, grandson of one of the Pony Express' founders William Bradford Waddell, was elected President of the Centennial Association. <br /> <br /> The National Pony Express Centennial Association organized a re-ride of the route of the Pony Express, with 500 riders traveling both directions between Sacramento and St. Joseph from July 19th through 28th of 1960. President Eisenhower sent letters in the mochila to each of the governors in the eight trail states. A special commemorative stamp was issued and placed on these envelopes. These stamps carried the date of July 19, 1960, the starting date of the re-ride and had a special cancellation stating Russell, Majors and Waddell as founders, owners and operators.<br /> <br /> Besides the commemorative re-ride, commemorative letters and envelopes were carried across the trail. The U.S. Mint created two large Centennial Medals, a Founders Medal, and a Termination Medal. One thousand Colt Special Edition Centennial Revolvers were produced and sold to riders. The remaining funds were used to mark trail sites with memorials like the one found here, just outside the entrance to the Scotts Bluff National Monument Visitor Center. ",

The right margin vertically reads \"1960 - 1961\". In the upper left-hand corner, there are images of the heads of the three founders that are labeled \"Russell, Majors, Waddell.\" To the right of the three heads text reads \"Founders, owners, operators.\" In the upper right-hand corner, there is an image of a man on horseback. Text reads \"120 celebrated riders rode 670,000 miles with only one rider killed by Indians, one schedule not completed, and one mail lost.\" A map below two images shows important landmarks on the Pony Express Trail. Labeled, left to right are: Sacramento, California; Fridays Station, Nevada; Salt Lake City, Utah; Fort Laramie, Wyoming; Julesburg, Colorado; Fort Kearney, Nebraska; Marysville, Kansas; and St. Joseph, Missouri. Text at the bottom reads \"National Pony Express Centennial Assn. Dwight D. Eisenhower - Chairman, Waddell R. Smith - President, Conrad L. Wirth - Director at Large, Paul Henderson - Director.\" A circular metal plague measuring 17 inches in diameter is located to the right of the large rectangular plaque. Around the perimeter of the plaque is text that reads \"National Pony Express Centennial Association, Trail Marker, 1860-61, 1960-61.\" Inside the perimeter text at the top is an image of a rider on horseback, over a map with the label of \"Sacramento\" on the left and \"St. Joseph\" on the right. Below the map are the images of the heads of three men. They are labeled left to right \"Russell, Majors, Waddell.\" Below the image is text that reads \"Founders, Owners, Operators, Pony Express.\" A third metal plaque is located on a vertically angled section of the monument. It measures 24 inches wide by 17 inches tall. It is titled \"The Pony Express\" with the image of a rider on horseback. Below the image is text that reads \"The Pony Express passed here 1860 - 1861. \"Scott's Bluffs Station\" was located 2 1/2 miles northwest of Mitchell Pass, near the site of the later Fort Mitchell. There were other stations at Courthouse Rock, Chimney Rock, Ficklin's Springs, and Horse Creek. U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service.\"",

    "bodyText": "<p>More than 1,800 miles in 10 days! From St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California the Pony Express could deliver a letter faster than ever before.<br /> In operation for only 18 months between April 1860 and October 1861, the Pony Express nevertheless has become synonymous with the Old West. In the era before electronic communication, the Pony Express was the thread that tied East to West.</p> <p>As a result of the 1849 Gold Rush, the 1847 Mormon exodus to Utah and the thousands who moved west on the Oregon Trail starting in the 1840s, the need for a fast mail service beyond the Rocky Mountains became obvious. This need was partially filled by outfits such as the Butterfield Overland Mail Service starting in 1857 and private carriers in following years.</p> <p>But when postmaster general Joseph Holt scaled back overland mail service to California and the central region of the country in 1858, an even greater need for mail arose. The creation of the Leavenworth & Pike's Peak Express Company by William H. Russell, Alexander Majors and William B. Waddell became the answer. It was later known as the Pony Express.</p> <aside> <blockquote> <p><strong>Ad in the Sacramento Union, March 19, 1860</strong></p> <p>\"Men Wanted\"<br /> The undersigned wishes to hire ten or a dozen men, familiar with the management of horses, as hostlers, or riders on the Overland Express Route via Salt Lake City. Wages $50 per month and found.</p> </blockquote> </aside>   <p>On June 16, 1860, about ten weeks after the Pony Express began operations, Congress authorized the a bill instructing the Secretary of the Treasury to subsidize the building of a transcontinental telegraph line to connect the Missouri River and the Pacific Coast.</p> <p>The passage of the bill resulted in the incorporation of the Overland Telegraph Company of California and the Pacific Telegraph Company of Nebraska. While the lines were under construction the Pony Express operated as usual. Letters and newspapers were carried the entire length of the line from St. Joseph to Sacramento, but telegrams were carried only between the rapidly advancing wire ends.</p> <p>On October 26, 1861, San Francisco was in direct contact with New York City. On that day the Pony Express was officially terminated, but it was not until November that the last letters completed their journey over the route.<br /> Most of the original trail has been obliterated either by time or human activities. Along many segments, the trail's actual route and exact length are matters of conjecture. In the western states, the majority of the trail has been converted, over the years, to double track dirt roads. Short pristine segments, believed to be traces of the original trail, can be seen only in Utah and California. However, approximately 120 historic sites may eventually be available to the public, including 50 existing Pony Express stations or station ruins.</p> <p><br /> <strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2>",

    "audioDescription": "The post trader store is a double-gabled building that has three major sections. The oldest, closest to Burt House, is an adobe shop and showroom for wares. The original adobe is mostly encased in lime-grout cement. North of this is a stone addition which houses the post office and telegraph station. The western addition is completely made of lime-grout cement and has multiple doors to access the warehouse and bar rooms.",

    "audioDescription": "Rattlesnake Pass. 250 words<br /><br />A narrow, abandoned, broken paved road goes through the pass here south of Devil's Gate, curving around the end of a granite ridge on the north side. Some of the boulders are close to the edge of the road and emigrant inscriptions can be seen carved in the rock. On the south side of the road is a pioneer grave enclosed by a metal fence. One large stone sits at the end with carvings on it and the grave itself is piled with stones. At the west end of the enclosure is a wooden post with a crosspiece, forming a rough cross. At the other end a sign tells us that the grave of Frederick Richard Fulkerson was noted by forty-niner J.G. Bluff on July 26, 1849, as he traveled through what he termed \"Pass of the Rattlesnake Mountain to the left of Devil's Gate.\" The survival of the large granite boulder used as the Fulkerson headstone and the sketch made by Bluff allows us to locate this grave precisely. It goes on to tell us that the current carving on the boulder, which reads, T.P. Baker, 1864, is believed to be the graffiti of a passing traveler. Baker, whoever he was, left another, nearly identical, inscription on a rock face a half-mile farther on at the bank of the river.<br /><br />Looking both ways through the pass from the graveside, you can see the narrow, white post markers indicating the historic trace of the Oregon Trail.",

    "audioDescription": "Register Cliff Historic Site. 433 words<br /><br />The parking lot here sits parallel to the cliff, which stands about 30 feet high and extends in both directions. The vertical cliff face has clear horizontal layers, some thick and a couple in pinkish tan very thin. In places the mud nests of cliff swallows are clustered. <br /><br />A gravel path runs along the foot of the cliff. Going right, it leads past a pioneer cemetery surround by a stone wall topped with the palings. Old broken gravestones can be seen through the fence. At the far end of the cemetery is a small building housing restrooms. <br /><br />To the left, the path extends to the end of the cliff and then follows as it curves away from us. At the point where the path reaches the far end of the parking lot, there is a large brown sign discussing the cliff markings on the left. It tells us that, although now eroded, dates as early as 1829 and even one from 1797, were once visible and judged to be authentic. At one time Indian pictographs and petroglyphs were also visible.<br /><br />A few yards farther on the right side of the path is a covered kiosk with three large signs. They are titled \"Trail Register,\" \"Register Cliff State Historic Site,\" and \"Homesteaders.\" The last sign explains that a short tunnel blasted out of the base of the cliff, visible to the right of the sign with its entrance protected by a fence, was used as a root cellar by local settlers.<br /><br />Close by is a stone slab monument with two metal plaques on its face. The one on top, about 3 feet up, is circular with a relief carving of a covered wagon and a team of oxen and reads, \"Oregon Trail Memorial.\" Feel free to touch. Below that is another plaque which reads, \"Dedicated to the pioneers of Wyoming. Register Cliff, acquired by the State of Wyoming through gift of the Henry Frederick family, 1932.\"<br /><br />Farther down the path, where the cliff face begins to curve away from you, a side path leads closer to the base of the cliff to a chain-link fence which protects this section of the cliff. Here are some of the oldest carvings, both large and small. Dates easily seen range from 1852 and 1859 to 1928. From this area, a narrow rock trail leads back closer to the cliff base up a small rise to a small lookout with a bench.<br /><br />The main path continues around the end of the cliff where additional carvings, still protected by the metal fencing, can be seen.",

    "bodyText": "<blockquote> <p>“The water near this vile hole was thick and stale with sulphury salts: it blistered even the hands. The station-house was no unfit object in such a scene, roofless and chairless, filthy and squalid, with a smoky fire in one corner, and a table in the centre of an impure floor, the walls open to every wind, and the interior full of dust.\" - Sir Richard Burton, 1862</p> </blockquote>   <p>No two Pony Express stations are identical. They were built in a variety of ways using the resources found at each station's location. To know what one now in ruin used to look like, two items are used- descriptions written when the building was intact and items discovered during archeological surveys. Having both provides the best guess about a station's appearance and the activities of the people who lived in them.<br /> <br /> Sir Richard Burton, traveling by stagecoach, visited Sand Springs Station in 1862. The above quote is his description of the station. In the years afterwards, Sand Springs was buried by the sand. It was not re-discovered until 1976, when an archeological team found the ruins. The team surveyed the station as they unburied it and discovered numerous artifacts. But overall, the items did not sync with Burton's description. And the ruins did not match records showing Sand Springs was a Pony Express relay station- the building is twice the size of the average one!<br /> <br /> The mystery was answered when the 1976 survey items were evaluated. One discovery was the ruins seen today are for a building that was constructed in three different phases. Importantly, a close look at room #4 reveals it is not attached to the structure- it was added after the original station was built. This room is half of the building; when added, it created a building twice the size of the Pony Express relay station. The survey also found telegraph insulators, resister wire, ox shoes, wagon parts, and a ceramic item made in 1896. Together, they solve the Sand Spring's mystery. The ruins are from a Pony Express relay station, and from an overland stage station, a telegraph station, and the home and corral of two prospectors. 50 years of history in remote western Nevada is found in the ruins.<br /> <br /> Sand Springs Station is a National Park Service Vanishing Treasure. When visiting, please respect the site and do not climb on or disturb the ruins. Only with your help can the station be preserved and future visitors given the opportunity to experience it as you have experienced it.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Sand Springs Station site is located at the entrance to Sand Mountain Recreation Area; travel 26 miles east of Fallon, NV on U.S. Route 50. Sand Mountain Recreation Area will be on your left. Turn onto its entrance road and follow signs to Sands Spring Pony Express Station.)<br /> <br /> <strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> Sand Springs Station has a dirt and gravel parking lot, a short walking path to the ruins, and wayside exhibit signs that tell the story.

At first, emigrants had to take a detour south and use Robidoux Pass, a natural gateway, to get through the bluffs. This mostly stopped in 1850 when a new route was opened at Mitchell Pass. Located close to the North Platte River, this route saved emigrants nearly 15 miles of travel. The route, though, was narrow, due to the land's geography. As such, more than 300,000 emigrants, and their wagons and livestock, had to travel on the same strip of land. Eventually, deep ruts formed as a result of this traffic. These ruts are still visible today and are now a part of Scotts Bluff National Monument. A section of them has been developed into a walking trail with interpretive waysides.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>In 1845, General Philip St. George Cooke marveled at the strange formation that rose before him.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Looming afar over river and plain was 'Scott's Bluff,' a Nebraska Gibralter; surmounted by a colossal fortress and a royal castle, it jutted on the water. . . . This morning marched three miles still nearer to that mysterious mountain . . . without being disenchanted of its colossal ruins and phantom occupants.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Three miles west of Gering, Nebraska on Old Oregon Trail (Highway 92 West))</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/oregon-trail-pathway.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",
    "audioDescription": "To reach the walking trail, cross the access road at the left of the visitor center. The sidewalk on the other side leads back to the left towards the highway and then turns right to parallel the highway. Once past the curve, there are four reproductions of different style emigrant vehicles along the right side of the sidewalk as well as several wayside signs. Please feel free to touch any of the vehicles. To the left, on the other side of the road are more bluffs, layered in tan and brown. A cylindrical feature sits on top of the bluff nearest to the road.<br /><br />The first emigrant vehicle along the sidewalk, located about where the surface changes from smooth cement to a rougher aggregate, is a handcart. It has a small, square structure sitting directly over the two large wagon wheels with simple poles and a crosspiece extending in front for pulling it.<br /><br />A wayside sign near the handcart asks which route would you take? Before 1851, many emigrants took a long detour to the south through Robidoux Pass. Later a one-wagon wide trail was created through the ravines of these bluffs here at Mitchell Pass.<br /><br />Next is a common wagon, green in color with off-white canvas stretched on the overhead hoops. The rear wheels are larger than those in the front. The next wagon is very similar, this one painted white.<br /><br />The final wagon is larger, painted pale blue. The wagon bottom is slightly curved to the middle and the front and rear ends are angled outward. This one has a team of model oxen in front, wearing wooden yokes with chains running back to the tongue of the wagon.<br /><br />Past the last wagon, the sidewalk changes to a dirt and gravel path. A wayside sign here tells us that traffic went both ways through the pass. Fur traders traveled both directions, but some of the emigrants gave up and turned back eastward. Others returned to bring other family members out west. Traders drove massive freight wagons in both directions and Army units rode both ways as they patrolled the route.<br /><br />The trail continues around the base of Scotts Bluff, the flat end rising high above you on the right. Meadow vegetation lines the path along with earthen and rocky outcroppings. The path may be rough and uneven in places. More waysides at the end of the trail talk about how emigrants might get assistance along the trail and one shows a painting by William Henry Jackson that depicts the view of the trail looking back eastward through the pass, matching the current location of the sign.",

    "audioDescription": "South Pass. 401 words<br /><br />There is a wayside sign here at the intersection of a rough dirt track and the main gravel road. The land stretches away in all directions, sagebrush-covered prairie as far as the eye can see. Cement posts, one to the east along the dirt road and one to the west, mark the path of the Oregon Trail. To the north a distant mountain range can be seen. To the west is the slanted end of a butte, which extends away to the south. Another butte is visible in the distant south.<br /><br />The sign at the intersection reads, \"To the south stand the Oregon Buttes, a major trail landmark. The name is significant because the buttes were roughly the beginning of the Oregon Territory and also helped keep emigrants encouraged, even though there were still hundreds of miles of rough going ahead. Today the Oregon Buttes are an Area of Critical Environmental Concern because of their cultural significance and important wildlife values. <br /><br />\"About twelve miles to the southwest of Oregon Buttes is the Tri-Territory site. This site is the location where the Oregon Territory, Mexican Territory and Louisiana Purchase had a common border. The large landmark, just to the south of where you are standing, is Pacific Butte. The great height and mass of the butte, combined with a ridge to the north paralleling the emigrant trails, helps to create a visual channel through which travelers migrated on their way through South Pass.\"<br /><br />Following the dirt road to the west leads to another wayside sign and a fenced area with two stone markers. Parallel wagon swales are barely discernable through the sagebrush on both sides of the road. The sign tells us the South Pass was first discovered in 1812. Bonneville took the first wagons over the pass in 1832 and Fremont widely publicized the route after his expedition in 1842. Thousands of Mormons, future Oregonians and Californians would use the trail in the following twenty years.<br /><br />The two stone markers are on the north side of the dirt road. The larger one is a five-foot tall rock slab, reddish-tan in color, roughly rectangular with carved lettering that reads, \"Old Oregon Trail, 1843-57.\" The other stone slab marker is about 3 feet tall and is charcoal gray. It reads, \"Narcissa Prentiss Whitman, Eliza Hart Spalding, First white women to cross this pass, July 4, 1836.\"",

Nevertheless, crossing the Continental Divide into 'Oregon Country' was a task for all westward-bound travelers and many described their feelings about the event. In 1852 Lucy Rutledge Cooke, a young woman with 'California Fever' wrote, 'This morn we arrived at the South Pass after which all rivers we see will be running to the Pacific.'\"",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Split Rock</b> is a \"gun sight\" notched landform that rises 1000 feet above the sagebrush plains. It was visible to emigrants for two days or more as they approached, and then, left it behind. Some of the emigrants found the landform to be a useful navigational tool, since it guided them directly to South Pass. The Bureau of Land Management has developed an interpretive site on the south side of Split Rock. A short hiking trail, with interpretive panels regarding the area and its history, leads to an overlook of Split Rock. A second highway turn-out a few miles west offers a good (although reversed) view of the \"split\" in the rock. </p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\"[Y]esterday,\" Joseph Middleton wrote in 1849, \"from the time we started we steered to this cliff with a steadiness that was astonishing, never deviating from it more than the needle does from the north pole, excepting once for a short time-I think this cleft or rent or chasm is very conspicuously seen from the Devil's Gate, which I think is 11 miles from here; and I think it is still at least 6 or 8 miles ahead. ...\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (east of Jeffrey City, Wyoming)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/split-rock-interpretive-site\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",
    "audioDescription": "Split Rock. 232 words<br /><br />From the parking lot a paved trail leads out on the flat ridge top to a spot overlooking the flat meadows below. The low vegetation consists primarily of grasses and sagebrush. On the other side of the narrow valley are granite ridges and outcroppings. Several wayside signs are located along the path. <br /><br />One tells us that Split Rock was a well-known trail landmark and navigation aid. Emigrants were guided by the rock for an entire day's travel from the east and it remained in view behind them for another two days. Travel time from here to South Pass was about 6 days. The granite rocks seen in front of you are the side view of Split Rock. Photographs on the sign show the view of the notch from the trail, which passes east of this location. One picture shows a pair of ruts running away from you into the distance. At the upper right is a flat-topped granite hill. On the left side of the flat ridge, is a notch, almost a perfect \"V\" shape.<br /><br />Other signs discuss the Pony Express, wild horses in the west, and the westward trails. Along the trail near the parking lot is a small stone marker with a panel indicating that Split Rock in on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /><br />Restrooms are located at the other end of the parking lot.",

Soon, towns formed along the Trail in several locations and they used the Oregon Trail for local transportation.<br /> <br /> As time passed in this part of Nebraska, trains replaced wagons and parts of the Oregon Trail became a railroad.

    "audioDescription": "The Archway. 382 words<br /><br />From the parking lot the arched building can be seen extending over the Interstate highway with squat, square towers at either end. The entrance building extends out in front of the tower, with wings on either side. The building is made of large, horizontal logs with light-colored caulking. Broad stone pillars anchor the corners of the lobby and of the wings. The structure is covered with a green metal roof. On top of each of the towers is a gleaming metal sculpture of a leaping horse with huge, fan-shaped wings. <br /><br />Between the building and the parking lot is a fort structure containing a maze. Continuing past that is a large sculpture of a bison by Nebraska artist Gary Ginther. Feel free to touch. In front of the entrance is another sculpture, this one surrounded by a chain fence. The sculpture is of two boys on horseback in full gallop, their bodies pinned together by an arrow. A nearby sign tells us that this work was commissioned by Fred A. Bosselman and sculpted by David L. Biehl in 2011. Titled \"A Narrow Escape,\" it depicts the Martin brothers running from an Indian attack. Both boys survived.<br /><br />In front of the sculpture a circular garden surrounds a flagpole. There are benches along the sidewalk around the garden area. Beyond that, on the other side of the entrance road, is an iron foot bridge over a narrow lake. There are more exhibits and a walking path on the other side.<br /><br />At the right end of the building is an old sign for the Hammer Motel. A wayside sign along the sidewalk there tells us about the Lincoln Highway, an ambitious project to create a highway from coast to coast in the early 1900s. The Hammer Motel was one of the motels that grew up along the highway.<br /><br />The building entrance leads into a large two-story lobby paved with flagstones. To the left is a dining area. Directly ahead is an escalator leading up to the exhibits in the arch itself. Costumed docents are stationed there to take tickets and provide information. To the right is a large gift shop where tickets may be purchased. There are benches along the wall on either side of the entrance doors.",

Mormon tradition holds that when Brigham Young first gazed on the valley from this vicinity on July 24, 1847, he experienced a heavenly vision that led him to declare, “It is enough. This is the right place.” Inside the 450-acre park is the National Pony Express Monument with a replica Pony Express station, a dramatic Avard Fairbanks sculpture of a relay rider changing horses, and several interpretive wayside exhibits. Statuary Walk east of the Pony Express monument includes other sculptures and the 60-foot high This Is the Place Monument, with bronze figures of Brigham Young and other early church leaders.<br /> <br /> Around the monument base are <em>bas relief </em>depictions of significant figures in Utah history. Beyond the nearby visitor center is Heritage Village, a reconstructed village of original pioneer-era buildings where costumed docents and historical interpreters share history and demonstrate early crafts and trades. Young visitors can ride ponies and trains, make crafts, and pet farm animals here.<br /> <br /> This Is the Place Heritage Park, near the location where Brigham Young first surveyed the valley in July 1847, represents the Mormon arrival. But as the City of the Saints grew from a rustic frontier village to a bustling territorial capital, many California-bound travelers paused here for a layover to rest, re-supply, or spend the winter — or, as in the case of English adventurer Sir Richard Burton, to satisfy their curiosity about Brigham Young and the Mormons.

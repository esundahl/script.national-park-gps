    "audioDescription": "A. Burton: Fine Watch Repairing, exterior and interior. This narrow, single floor structure is sided in cream-colored painted vertical wood panels. A single doorway stands just to the right of a 5 foot by 7 foot window and a 6-paned window is mounted above the door. Together, the window and door make up almost the entire width of the front wall. Just above the door hangs a white sign outlined in blue. A drawing of a pocket watch is in the center of the sign and the words \"A. Burton, Fine Repairing\" are drawn in black. The sign is duplicated on the reverse side. Through the large front window, we see an assortment of watches and clocks. Six pocket watches are suspended on a gold and glass display stand shaped like a small Ferris wheel. We enter the building at the right over two stone steps on to the weathered wooden floor. A wall of Plexiglas to the left and along back prevents visitors from venturing into the workshop but allows for viewing into the small space beyond. A panel mounted on the wall to the right inside the doorway provides more information: A. Burton: Fine Watch Repair. Alfred Burton's watch repair shop probably opened in 1869 as part of a wave of new and reopened businesses in Harpers Ferry after the Civil War. Burton and his sons repaired and sold watches, clocks, jewelry, and spectacles in this building for nearly 50 years. Many objects in this room appear in Burton's ledger, reproduced at right. Archeologists discovered the marbles, inkwell, and slate pencil. Burton descendants donated the ledger, safe, workbench, and watch parts. Below is an 1875 Deed of Trust that provides clues to other shop contents:\"... One Iron Safe, One Show Case, One time Piece Regulator, One Watch Bench, One Watch Pivot Lathe, One American Lathe, One Pair of Silver Smiths Rolls, One foot Lathe, One Pair of Fairbanks Counter Scales... One Set of Watch Tools, One Set of Watch Glass Draws, One case of Small draws for Watch Material.\" On the right of the panel, a tintype portrait of Alfred Burton, September 1865. He has a mid-length beard with no mustache and wears a long dark coat over a dark vest and herringbone pattern pants and holds a cane in his right hand. A caption reads: A Curiosity in the Window: \"Mr. Burton... has a singular sort of mechanical contrivance in his store window, from which hangs half a dozen watches... and this contrivance keeps continually going round at the same solemn, blind horse rate... Citizens are beginning to complain of this; they say that it is having a bad effect on the brain of people who are obliged to look into the window.\" Spirit of Jefferson (a Charles Town newspaper), November 5, 1878. Looking into the workspace to the left, near the front window is a wood workbench covered with an assortment of hand-tools and small tins. Along the wall across from you, clocks of varied size, shapes, and styles adorn the shelves. And in the center of the floor, a countertop holds glass display cases filled with ornamental watch chains and jewelry and an array of pocketwatches. In the back-right corner of the room stands a round woodstove.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Extensive historical research indicates that these stone house ruins are the remains of a home built by John Hall Allstadt, son of Jacob Allstadt. The park seeks to confirm, however, if this house was built before the Civil War, or afterwards. The building was Greek Revival in style, which gained popularity before the Civil War. builders in the Shenandoah Valley were conservative in nature, and continued building styles after they became somewhat outdated. Therefore, a suitable construction date for the extant ruins, according to this evidence, could be circa 1872-1875.</p> <p>Whatever the exact construction date for the John H. Allstadt House, it is clear that Mr. Allstadt and his wife lived out the remainder of their days there. After passing through the family, the house then was used for housing the tenants of the Standard Farm until it was abandoned at an unknown date. In 1986, a fire destroyed the building’s interior and part of its exterior.</p>",

Mather Training Center at 51 Mather Place, formerly the home of Storer College's Anthony Hall. The front of the building faces east, toward the Harpers Ferry gap. At the back of the building is a parking lot for employees and visitors as well as a wheelchair accessible entrance to the building. The long three-story red brick building is built upon a three foot tall stone foundation. The middle section of the building rises to a point in the center with a round window in the gable above the second floor. Five tall Palladian windows line the second story. At the center of the first floor, a white portico stands upon a three-foot tall porch and frames a single white door with sidelights. Two 5 foot tall stone-capped windows are on either side. There is no walkway to the center door and this entrance is locked. A 30 foot tall flag pole is mounted in the ground just to the right of the middle entrance. The building extends on the left and right into non-gabled two-story tall wings, each with doorways framed under raised porticos. Along each wing, three shutter-framed windows line the second floor and a 3 foot tall, shutter-framed window is on either side of the porticos. Paved sidewalks extend from the brick pathway to either wing. Each porch has 6 steps up with a handrail along the right side but no railing around the porch. In front of the left wing, along the right side of the sidewalk, is an 9 foot wide stone with a bronze Stephen Tyng Mather plaque mounted on the face. The plaque features a profile of Mather under the dates July 4, 1867 - Jan 22, 1930. The plaque reads: He laid the foundation of the National Park Service, defining and establishing the policies under which its areas shall be developed and conserved unimpaired for future generations. There will never come an end to the good that he has done. During operating hours, the left-hand door is often locked to outside access but the right-hand entryway leads to a reception desk just inside to the left.",

The plaque reads: The American Institute of Certified Planners has designated The Appalachian Trail as a National Planning Landmark and Benton MacKaye as a National Planning Pioneer. Conceived by Benton MacKaye in 1921 as a walking trail from New England to Georgia, the Appalachian Trail was a pioneering invention in regional interconnection. MacKay's work in regional planning theory and practice also laid the foundations for the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Rural Resettlement Administration programs of the 1930s, and the Civilian Conservation Corps. The National Trails System Act of 1968 made the Appalachian Trail the spinal cord of a fourteen-state greenway and the premier component of a national system of scenic and historic trails.

    "bodyText": "<p>The United States Armory at Harpers Ferry produced more than 600,000 military rifles and muskets in a 60 year period, spanning from Thomas Jefferson's presidency to the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln.<br /> <br /> The United States Armory was the main reason Meriwether Lewis came to Harpers Ferry. Lewis needed dependable weapons and supplies from the armory to succeed on his mission. The quality of the armorers' handiwork would also mean the difference between life and death for Lewis and his men. In 1803, the armory consisted of ten buildings just upstream and underneath the existing railroad embankment.<br /> <br /> Weapons produced at the armory were the target of John Brown's Raid in October, 1859. Brown intended to use firearms seized at Harpers Ferry to commence a war to end slavery. Brown failed in his attempt because he never escaped from Harpers Ferry. After 36 hours of holding the armory, Brown was captured by U.S. Marines commanded by Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee, assisted by Lt. J.E.B. Stuart, in the armory Fire Engine House. Sixteen months following Brown's raid, Civil War erupted.<br /> <br /> At the beginning of the Civil War, the Virginia militia advanced upon Harpers Ferry to seize the musket and rifle factories. The United States troops, who were guarding the armory, discovered themselves outnumbered by the encroaching Virginia militia and Lt. Roger Jones ordered the Musket Factory to be set on fire at 10 p.m. on April 18, 1861. Local citizens and the Virginia militia rapidly doused the flames before much damage could be done in order to save the armory.<br /> <br /> The armory machinery was then dismantled by the militia and moved south during the first weeks of May 1861 with Col. Thomas Jonathan Jackson supervising. Machinery from the factories ended up in Richmond, Virginia and Fayetteville, North Carolina to aid the Confederacy. Many of the Harpers Ferry armory employees relocated further south to manufacture weapons for the new Confederacy. The armory was the economic life of the town and when the armory jobs moved south, Harpers Ferry lost businesses. Many civilians in Harpers Ferry left the area, and the town became \"a ghost of its former self.\"<br /> <br /> The Confederates abandoned Harpers Ferry on June 14, 1861 when garrison commander Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston ordered the armory buildings destroyed. All that was left of the Musket Factory was the brick walls, which were entangled with twisted and melted metal. Just two short weeks later, the Rifle Factory also was destroyed and the mighty industry of Harpers Ferry now was a silent ghostly ruin.<br /> <br /> Nine months later, in March 1862, the armory ruins were restored by the Union Army who occupied Harpers Ferry. The Union army was launching its first full-scale invasion of the Shenandoah Valley and the former Musket Factory buildings were re-roofed to be transformed into a quartermaster and commissary depot. Supplies were brought in through the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and were then shipped further south to the army operating in the Shenandoah Valley. The Union continued to utilize the armory for this purpose until the end of the war.<br /> <br /> The Armory was threatened by several Confederate advances, which resulted in repeated destructions of the Union armory supply depot. The first attack on the Union controlled Armory was in September 1862, when the Confederates captured Harpers Ferry and removed as much supplies that they possibly could. The Confederates took it one step further and set the Armory on fire on September 18. The Union returned quickly to the destroyed armory to rebuild it but ten months later the armory depot was destroyed again in July, 1863. The Union returned to the ruins, once more, and rebuilt but the Confederates would strike again in July 1864.<br /> <br /> Jubal Early's attack in July 1864 would be the last Confederates disturbance at the depot and the Union would rebuild to use the Armory again. The armory served as the base of operations for Philip Sheridan's 1864 Valley Campaign, which that resulted in the defeat of the Confederate army in the Shenandoah Valley.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/600295.htm#7/28.613/-95.828\">United States Armory Grounds and Potomac Riverfront Cultural Landscape</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Baltimore & Ohio (B & O) railroad bridge was once a majestic wood covered bridge that spanned the Potomac River and carried train traffic on the B & O Railroad for 23 years prior to the outbreak of the Civil War. In 1859, John Brown, a staunch abolitionist, launched a raid across this bridge to capture the United States Armory and start a war to end slavery. Brown failed at his attempt but made a major impact on the Harpers Ferry area. With the secession of Virginia in April, 1861, the bridge became a tenuous connector between the Confederacy and the Union. The bridge was over an important border, the Potomac River, and constantly had to worry about attacks from both sides of the war. During four years of Civil War, the bridge would be built and destroyed nine times - four times by war, five times by floods.<br /> <br /> On June 14, 1861, as the Confederates were leaving Harpers Ferry, Brig. Gen. Joseph Johnston ordered the burning of all bridges on the Potomac under Southern control. The bridges that were destroyed were Point of Rocks, Shepherdstown, and Berlin. The Berlin Bridge is called Brunswick today. The Harpers Ferry region was a dangerous border area for the next eight months, disallowing rebuilding of the bridge. When the Union army occupied Harpers Ferry in February of 1862 and B & O bridge builders accompanied them. A new iron trestle was completed atop the original piers in less than three weeks, which allowed for supplies to be sent to the Union forces in Harpers Ferry and further south.<br /> <br /> The Confederates regained Harpers Ferry on September 15, 1862 but just a few days later they would abandon that post. On September 18, 1862, the bridge was destroyed for a second time by Confederates when they left Harpers Ferry due to the outcome of the Battle of Antietam in Shepherdstown. B & O bridge builders returned with the Union army a few weeks later and had the bridge operational once again by early October.<br /> <br /> The third time the bridge was destroyed was during the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863. This time, the retreating Union forces had destroyed the bridge to ensure the Confederates could not use it to support their invasion into the North. Union forces would reoccupy Harpers Ferry during the third week of July of 1863, following the Confederate retreat from Gettysburg. Once the Confederates had retreated, the B & O bridge builders arrived to rebuild the bridge.<br /> <br /> The fourth and final time the bridge was destroyed occurred during the final invasion of the North in July of 1864. Once Confederate Jubal Early's forces withdrew from Maryland by mid-July, the B & O railroad rebuilt the bridge once more. In the fall of 1864, the Union used the bridge to transport an immense amount of supplies across the Potomac and into the armory depot for use by Philip Sheridan's army during its Valley Campaign. The Valley Campaign conquered the Confederate army in the Shenandoah Valley and the B & O Railroad was the artery of life for Sheridan's army.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Boarding House, exterior and interior hallway. Nestled between the Provost Marshal on the right and the Dry Goods Store on the left is the Boarding House. A sign underneath the 3rd floor window reads \"Stipes Boarding House. Daily and weekly rates.\" Up one stone step and over the wooden threshold, a single brown door provides access to the inside during park operating hours. The door frame is painted dark green and a window above the doorway is painted with the words \"Boarding House.\" A wayside inside the hallway, just to the left of the base of the stairs, features a drawing of Shenandoah Street in 1864 by sketch artist James E. Taylor (courtesy of the Western Reserve Historical Society, Cleveland, Ohio). The Harpers Ferry Military District Headquarters building is at center and, just to the right, is Mrs. Stipes' Boarding House. The Boarding House is depicted as a two-floor building with a portico in front. The panel reads:<br />Keeping the Wolf from the Door. Cornelia Stipes, a Harpers Ferry widow, and her three daughters ran a boarding house in this building during the Civil War. This money kept her family from starving. In the words of her boarder, Civil War sketch artist, James Taylor, \"Mrs. Stipes catered to sojourners at the Ferry... to keep the wolf from the door.\" A doorway just to the right as you enter the Boarding House provides another glimpse into the Provost Marshal's office, from the left side of the room. A locked wooden gate prevents access but we can see a yellow wooden bench placed underneath a window along the far wall and, nearer to us, we see a desk with its various cubbies stuffed with papers and bound ledgers filed on shelves. Continue up the stairs at the back of the entry hall to the second and third floors to see rooms furnished as they would have been while this was an active Boarding House.",

Today, from this location, you can walk beside trenches, take a hike in the woods, or enjoy an incredible vista where you can see most of the park areas from one vantage point. You can drive to this location on your own.<br /> <br /> Bolivar Heights witnessed more battle action than any other location at Harpers Ferry. The first battle of the Civil War at Harpers Ferry occurred at Bolivar Heights on October 16, 1861, exactly two years after the commencement of the John Brown Raid. Alarmed by Union forces in the new Confederacy, especially along the Potomac River, a Confederate force under Col. Turner Ashby struck Union Col. John Geary's men at Bolivar Heights. Many Confederates were angry over the Union seizure of a local flour mill, which provoke some of the fighting but soon after the Confederate attack, Geary held the location and forced a Confederate retreat.<br /> <br /> Confederate Commander Stonewall Jackson's arrival produced the second battle at Bolivar Heights on May 30, 1862 during Jackson's famous Valley Campaign. Jackson had routed all Union soldiers in the Shenandoah Valley, except those at Harpers Ferry. Alarmed at Jackson's successes, Washington reinforced the Union forces at Harpers Ferry by sending Brig. Gen. Rufus B. Saxton to Bolivar Heights to defend the Union position. Jackson attacked Bolivar Heights during a ferocious thunderstorm, but Saxton's position on Camp Hill was held and Jackson retired under the cover of darkness. Siege cannon from the Naval Battery on Maryland Heights plummeted Jackson's men as they advanced across the heights through the town of Bolivar, damaging numerous homes.<br /> <br /> The third time Bolivar Heights witnessed action also involved Stonewall Jackson's men. During the Battle of Harpers Ferry, September 12-15, 1862, Jackson forced a final stand atop Bolivar Heights with the Union forces. Jackson's artillery pummeled the heights from three directions, Maryland Heights, Loudoun Heights, and School House Ridge. On the night of the 14th, he sent Commander A.P. Hill around the southern flank of the heights, which forced the Union garrison to surrender. The formal surrender of nearly 12,700 Union soldiers, the largest capitulation of Union forces during the Civil War, occurred on Bolivar Heights.<br /> <br /> The fourth time Bolivar Heights experienced combat occurred during Confederate General Robert E. Lee's advance toward Gettysburg. Lee sent a column of men to maneuver the Union out of Harpers Ferry, but the Union forcers offered minimal resistance and the Union retreated behind the big guns on Maryland Heights. Bolivar Heights would be blasted from Maryland Heights during the last week of June 1863 and the indiscriminate shelling created havoc in the community, which wrecked civilian homes.<br /> <br /> The fifth and final time Bolivar Heights was a battlefield occurred during Confederate Commander Jubal Early's invasion of the North during the end of June into the first week of July 1864. Early's main column contended with Maryland Heights, north of the Potomac, and sent a detachment of forces to seize Bolivar Heights along with Harpers Ferry from the west. The Union repeated their tactic of the previous year, offering limited resistance on Bolivar Heights, and instead turned toward the siege cannon on Maryland Heights to pulverize the Confederate invaders. Once again, Bolivar Heights and the town suffered extensive damage from bombardment.<br /> <br /> When Bolivar Heights was not a battlefield, it was a campground. Bolivar Heights' gentle, sweeping slopes first were used by Jackson during the spring of 1861. Here Jackson encamped and drilled the 1st Virginia Brigade, which became the famous \"Stonewall\" Brigade. Jackson gained his familiarity with the topography and terrain of Bolivar Heights during this formative period, which enabled him to use this knowledge to his advantage during the Battle of Harpers Ferry in 1862.<br /> <br /> The largest encampment on Bolivar Heights occurred following the Battle of Antietam. The entire 2nd Corps of the Army of the Potomac, numbering nearly 15,000 men, lived on Bolivar Heights for nearly six weeks before departing for the Fredericksburg Campaign during the first week of November 1862. During this time, Professor Thaddeus Lowe raised his gas-filled balloon to observe Confederate movements in the Shenandoah Valley. In addition, the Union troops built extensive earthworks along the length of the ridge, trying to make Bolivar Heights more defensible. Bolivar Heights has a lower elevation than Maryland and Loudoun Heights, which makes it easier to approach through the Shenandoah Valley.<br /> <br /> Bolivar Heights also was the site of the largest corral and wagon yard in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War. During Union Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1864, Sheridan converted Bolivar Heights into a temporary corral for thousands of mules and hundreds of quartermaster wagons, waiting to transport supplies and munitions south. Bolivar Heights also became a temporary graveyard. Hundreds of Union soldiers died at Harpers Ferry from disease and most were buried on Bolivar Heights. These remains were removed after the war and reinterred at the Antietam National Cemetery.</p>",

At the left side of the building, set back a bit from the front wall is a smaller two-story wing with a small closed-in room sided in blue-grey painted wood panels. To the left, across the lawn in front of the Brackett House is the Lockwood House. Six steps up from the road, there is a landing with a lamp post at right and a 2 foot by 1 foot panel at the left, past a break in the hand rail. The panel is mounted just to the right of a low stone wall so be mindful of your step. The panel features a historic photo of the Brackett House in 1908, during its Storer College tenancy.

It hovers over the oldest section of Harpers Ferry, the Lower Town. Camp Hill's oldest feature is the Harper Cemetery, and its most famous landmark is Jefferson Rock. The land was purchased by the federal government as part of the original armory contract. Camp Hill earned its name when soldiers from the U.S. Army encamped atop the knoll during the last years of the 18th century, where they helped with the construction of the armory canal and river dam. Since the government owned the property, the streets were laid out by the government, and many of the original buildings were built, owned, and leased by the government. The most spacious lots on the crest of the hill were reserved for armory officials, which included mansions for the superintendent, the paymaster, and their assistants.<br /> <br /> When the Civil War erupted, these mansions were abandoned, but they soon became buildings for headquarters, bivouacs, and a hospital. The Paymaster's quarters, known today as the Lockwood House, became a hospital and a prison as well. Following the Civil War, the government sold the properties to the trustees of Storer College, and these building served as the original campus. At the end of the war, Freewill Baptist missionaries from Maine utilized the Lockwood House as a school for former slaves, which became Storer College. Three of the mansions still remain the Lockwood House, the Brackett House, and the Morrell House, which still resemble their Civil War appearance.<br /> <br /> Camp Hill served as an encampment for both Union and Confederate troops. In the spring of 1861, the Confederate army occupied the site, but abandoned the position under orders of garrison commander Joseph E. Johnston. Soon afterward, the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry arrived, which were the first Union troops of the Civil War to occupy Camp Hill. Perhaps the most famous regiment to live on Camp Hill was the 22nd New York State Militia. The 22nd New York were from New York City resided here during the summer of 1862. These men were not famous for their fighting, but for their photographs. During their stay, several hundred photos of the men and camp sites were taken upon Camp Hill, providing a glance into life in Harpers Ferry during the Civil War.<br /> <br /> A line of earthwork fortifications ran across the western edge of Camp Hill. These works, constructed in May 1862, ran parallel to Bolivar Heights and helped defend Harpers Ferry against Stonewall Jackson's advance on May 29-30, 1862. The earthworks were improved during the summer of 1862, largely with the assistance of contraband labor, and were engaged during the Battle of Harpers Ferry in September. Once the Confederates hoisted cannons onto nearby Loudoun Heights, the Camp Hill position no longer was tenable. This convinced Union commanders to withdraw from this position during Confederate incursions in the Gettysburg Campaign of 1863 and during Jubal Early's invasion of 1864.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Located along Jackson Street, the Curtis Freewill Baptist Church is a relatively modest red brick structure with a pitched roof built on a white painted stone foundation. A two-story square campanile extends from the right-side corner and is capped by a parapet. White painted slatted vents are on the sides near the top of the tower and, underneath those, mid-way up the tower, are diamond shaped windows. And the main entrance is at the base of the tower on the side perpendicular to Jackson Street, facing Fillmore Street. A metal wheelchair ramp lined with handrails on either side has been installed over the original stone stoop. The double door is painted white with a half-round window above. Just over the arched window is a red stone carved with the words: Curtis Freewill Baptist Church, 1894. Along the wall to the left of the tower are 4 rectangular windows inset with colorful stained-glass squares and names written along the top. The names face the inside so they appear backwards to the outside viewer. Two doors are set into the basement level along this side and uneven stone stairs lead down from the brick walkway. A parking lot is to the left of the church. Along the side facing Jackson Street, underneath the diamond window in the tower is a half-circle window. To the right of the tower are three arch-top windows inset with colorful stained-glass squares and names written along the top. The center window is double the width of the other two windows and is 5 feet tall. It is inset with two crosses and the word \"Morrell\" is visible at the top. To the right of the front stoop is a two-foot tall square brick base with a pentagon-shaped plaque mounted on top. The words on the plaque read: IN MEMORY OF THE BLACK AMERICANS Who Fought Here For Freedom From Human Slavery. June, 1976. Erected by the Association for Study of Afro-American Life and History in cooperation with the AMOCO Foundation, Inc. The grounds, stairs, and pathways around the church are uneven and may have raised borders. There are also trees, lamp posts, and telephone poles about so be mindful while navigating around the property.",

The UDC misrepresented the facts of Shepherd’s life to support the \"faithful slave” narrative in Shepherd’s death. After a decade of effort, they succeeded and set the dedication date of October 10, 1931.<br /> <br /> Storer College’s white president, Henry McDonald, enlisted the college’s African American choir, led by Pearl Tatten, to sing at the dedication. Tatten listened to speakers criticize John Brown, justify the system of slavery, and praise the loyalty and faithfulness of past enslaved people in the South. When the time came for the Storer College Singers to perform, she stood, faced the crowd, and protested: “I am the daughter of a [Union] Connecticut volunteer, who wore the blue, who fought for the freedom of my people, for whom John Brown struck the first blow…We are pushing forward to a larger freedom…in the spirit of the new freedom and rising youth.”</p>",

In pursuance of his duties as an employee of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, he became the first victim of this attempted insurrection. This boulder is erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans as a memorial to Heyward Shepherd, exemplifying the character and faithfulness of thousands of Negroes, who, under many temptations throughout subsequent years of war, so conducted themselves that no stain was left upon a record which is the peculiar heritage of the American people, and an everlasting tribute to both races.\"",

    "audioDescription": "Industry museum is housed in a three-story rectangular white building with balconies on the 2nd and 3rd floors. A green rectangular sign with white lettering reading \"Industry Museum\" hangs above the entrance to the museum. Inside, on the right, nineteenth century industrial machinery for making weaponry is displayed behind wooden railing, including milling machines, spindle drill presses, rifling machines, and barrel-turning lathes. Panels describe the machinery: \"Lock, Stock, and Barrel: The federal armories at Harpers erry and Springfield, Massachusetts, were among the first machine operated industries in the United States. Workers in the armories used many labor saving machines to produce the three major components of the musket: the lock, the stock, and the barrel. This exhibit shows representative examples of machines used in the 1850s. All were driven by water power, transmitted to the machine through pulleys and leather belts.\" \"Stock: The wooden stock of the musket was the first component manufactured by mass production machines. The duplicating lathe, sometimes called a Blanchard lathe for its inventor, quickly turned out walnut stocks identical to the pattern.\" \"Barrel: The barrel of a musket required exacting production techniques. The bore had to be a uniform diameter, and the metal free from flaws. A special type of machine called a barrel-turning lathe smoothed the exterior of the barrel and cut the correct taper from breech to muzzle.\" \"Rifling Machine: With the advent of rifled muskets, twisting grooves were cut inside the barrel with a rifling machine. A bullet fired from a rifled barrel spirals in flight, giving it greater accuracy over long distances.\" On the opposite wall from the entrance, a display shows an iron stove pipe, two barrels, a small basket, and an iron fence. On the left side of the room, a large illustration labeled \"Virginius and Hall's Islands, 1857\" depicts a cluster of buildings along the Shenandoah River from a overlook. To the right of the illustration, a panel labeled Transportation depicts the modes of transportation used by Harpers Ferry residents. To the left of the illustration, two cases show Harpers Ferry products, including cloth.",

The armory affected the everyday lives of its workers, both inside and outside the workplace, until its destruction in 1861 during the opening days of the Civil War. To learn about the armory's efforts on behalf of its workforce, walk this short trail along the Shenandoah River and visit the sites of buildings pictured here.",

    "audioDescription": "A Land Divided. This 3/12 foot by 2 foot angled wayside panel is mounted in the lawn in front of Cook Hall (to your right). Anthony Hall is across the sidewalk behind you and the Harpers Ferry gap is just visible in the distance beyond the trees and homes in front of you. Text on the panel begins with a quote from Abraham Lincoln: \"The struggle of today is not altogether for today - it is for a vast future also.\" Text continues: You are standing near what was once an international border. During the Civil War, the peak to your left ley within the Union state of Maryland. Loudoun Heights to the right was claimed by the Confederate state of Virginia. Slavery divided the nation, and here at Harpers Ferry the two sides clashed over the meaning of freedom. At the center left of the panel is a color illustration of the field in front of Anthony Hall filled with rows of tents and soldiers. Light red rectangular tents are arranged left to right in 8 rows of 12. Lower in the field, arranged perpendicularly in front of the first row of red tents, is a row of 8 larger white buildings with black roofs and chimneys. To the right of the rows of tents and buildings are 11 groups of soldiers. Scattered about the grounds and among a few other buildings on the outskirts are horse-pulled wagons and people walking about or riding horses. A large American flag flies atop a pole at the top right of the scene and a bald eagle holding a banner in its beak fills the sky above Anthony Hall. Written on the banner are the words: Camp 5th New York Heavy Artillery, Camp Hill, Harpers Ferry, VA. The caption tells us: The noise of army camp life once disturbed the quiet field before you. Both the Union and Confederate armies used this clearing as a campground and training field at different times throughout the course of the war. Inset at the center bottom of the panel is a B&W illustration of a man leading a team consisting of a horse, a mule, and a cow pulling an open-top wagon. A soldier is mounted atop the mule and in the bed of the wagon is a group of 7 African American men, women, and children. A caption reads: Refugees from slavery flocked to the Union encampments in Harpers Ferry. Thousands of formerly enslaved people sought the protection of the Union army. Classified by the army as contraband, they faced an uncertain future. The right-half of the wayside is filled with a B&W aerial photo of Harpers Ferry, Camp Hill, and Bolivar in the late 20th century. Harpers Ferry is located near the top, at the juncture of the Potomac (left) and Shenandoah (right) rivers. Maryland Heights is in the background at the left and Loudoun Heights is along the middle right. The NPS Visitor Center and parking area are visible at the lower right of the picture. The caption here tells us: Virginia's secession from the Union divided North from South along the Potomac River. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Harpers Ferry was home to the national armory and passageway for major railroad lines. These assets made it an important prize of war to both sides.",

A quote from \"Stonewall\" Jackson tells us: \"In the afternoon General Hill was ordered to move along the left bank of the Shenandoah, turn the enemy's left, and enter Harper's Ferry... General J.R. Jones was directed to make a demonstration against the enemy's right.\"",

    "audioDescription": "A Union Predicament. This 3 Â½ foot by 2 foot angled wayside panel is oriented with Harpers Ferry gap and the Potomac River between Maryland (left) and Virginia (right) visible straight ahead in the distance. Text on the panel reads; The first large-scale Federal occupation of Harpers Ferry began in February 1862. Despite the destruction of the armory and arsenal the previous year, Harpers Ferry remained important in protecting Union communication and supply lines and in deterring Confederate invasion of the North. At the bottom left is an illustration of rows of troops marching in the foreground with Harpers Ferry visible in the background across the river. The caption: By early September 1862, 14,000 Federal troops occupied Harpers Ferry and vicinity, with more than half encamped on Bolivar Heights. Text continues: The Confederates invaded the North for the first time in September 1862. By September 7, Gen. Robert E. Lee's army had crossed the Potomac River and encamped outside Frederick, Maryland. The large Union force at Harpers Ferry, now located behind the invading Confederates, threatened Southern communication and supply lines. In response, Lee boldly divided his army into four parts, sending three columns to capture or destroy the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry. At the right of the panel is an illustration of the Potomac River running diagonally from the bottom of the panel at the left and almost to the top at the right. The Shenandoah River intersects the Potomac midway from the bottom right. Maryland is noted at left, Virginia is noted at right, and the section of Virginia that is now West Virginia is at the bottom. Red arrows show troop movements. From the top, Lee's troops move from Virginia into Frederick, Maryland. Next, Walker's troops cross the Potomac River at Point of Rocks, Maryland, and in to Harpers Ferry. McLaws' troops advance from Frederick toward Maryland Heights. Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws' Confederate force of 8,000 captured Maryland Heights after a battle there on September 13. And Jackson's troops travel in a U-shape from Frederick, Maryland, cross the Potomac at Williamsport, MD, and advance through Martinsburg, West Virginia, in to Harpers Ferry. Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's Confederate force of 14,000 travelled 51 miles in three days and occupied School House Ridge, Â½ mile west of Bolivar Heights on September 13. After Jackson's column cornered the Federal into an inescapable position on Bolivar Heights, the trap was set. For five hours on Sunday afternoon, September 14, the Confederates fired their artillery from the captured heights. One hapless Federal wrote: \"...this hissing and screeching of shot and shell discharged at us...twas a strange medley for a Sabbath day's worship.\" A quote at the top right from Maj. Gen, John G.

The caption tells us: Architect Ephraim Francis Baldwin designed standardized station layouts for the B&O, offering additional custom options like fancy trimwork and roof bracketing. At the far right of the panel, a series of four photos, stacked top to bottom, depict the train station throughout history. At top is a B&W photo of Harpers Ferry in 1896, as seen from Maryland Heights across the river. The train station is circled in red, nestled between the y-shaped junction of the railroad tracks. Second, a B&W photo dated 1931 shows the train depot at the right of the frame and a crane car to its left. In the background, a crowd gathers to watch a locomotive steaming into town across the bridge from Maryland. Third, a sepia-toned image of the dilapidated station in 2000. The siding is a pale color with dark trim. The station's tower is gone. And fourth is a color photo from 2005 showing a new tower structure being placed on top of the station with a crane. The photo is taken from the walkway onto the train bridge. A blue and yellow engine sits facing us on the right, the pale cream-sided station is on the left.

    "audioDescription": "Burned, Flooded, and Leveled. This 3 ½ foot by 2 foot angled wayside faces the west wall of John Brown's fort. Immediately behind the panel, a rectangular imprint outlined in stone runs perpendicular to Shenandoah Street (at your left). The imprint is filled with mulch and is flush with the ground surrounding it, however the stone foundation surrounding is 6 inches to a foot tall in some sections with ground-level cutouts where windows and doors may have been. Along the left wall, running parallel to Shenandoah Street, remnants of the brick wall are stacked on top of the stone foundation. A greyscale photo of this site in 2009 is featured on the wayside panel. A simple white line drawing outlines the original frame of the arsenal building with 6 windows on the side facing us and a label underneath the lower floor middle window indicating \"You are here.\" Text on the wayside reads: The stone and brick walls in front of you show the outline of the Small Arsenal. The actual foundation of this former weapons storehouse lies below ground. In 1959, National Park Service archaeologists first excavated the foundation - 100 years after John Brown's raid. The 1959 excavation report describes the intensity of the fire that destroyed the building in 1861. The fire \"baked red\" the top layer of clay and left behind \"twisted and partly melted muskets and parts, some of them fused into each other.\" The report suggests that the building's slate roof, brick walls and drafts from the cellar windows created a \"furnace effect\" leaving behind only a shell of the building. Floods swept through the building shell twice before federal troops leveled it. In 2009 National Park Service specialists constructed this partial representation of the small arsenal based on evidence from archeological excavations. In the upper-right corner of the panel is a blueprint-style layout of the 1806 Small Arsenal building. A simple black dotted line over the top half of this blueprint outlines the 1870 structure. The caption tells us: The Foundation and Excavation Plan shows the Small Arsenal areas excavated in 1959. The grey outline shows the footprint of an 1870 building built over the remains of the Small Arsenal. Inset in the lower right is a B&W photo of the excavated foundation corner with a collection of twisted and melted musket parts from the pit stacked nearby.",

The Fourth of July was normally a day of celebration, but not this year- not 1861. In March Roeder buried his wife, Anna Maria; the following month Civil War erupted, Virginia seceded and Harpers Ferry became a war zone- businesses collapsed and the local economy crashed. <br /> <br /> A Union sympathizer, Roeder longed to catch a glimpse of the United States flag flying on the Maryland shore. Venturing out to the Potomac River, he gazed across at the Stars and Stripes, only to be struck down by a ricocheting bullet fired by a Union soldier. He crawled back to this building, his home, where he died. <br /> <br /> Roeder was the first townsperson to die during the war. His home, business and other property were confiscated by the Union Army for use as a military bakery, post office and headquarters. <br /> <br /> His orphaned children abandoned their home, but returned a year later and lived here until 1881. They filed claims with the government for extensive wartime damage to this house and other family property. They were finally approved for compensation of $504.00 in 1906. ",

In addition to his store, it is reported that he carried small pies to the train station to sell to hungry passengers before the days of dining cars. By 1856 Roeder was so successful that he enlarged this structure by one and a half stories, creating much needed space for his business and family of 7 children. Thriving in his adopted homeland, this German baker turned skills from his native country into sumptious treats for his friends, neighbors and community.",

Walk the Murphy Farm trail where W.E.B. DuBois marched for civil rights on the site of a former Civil War battlefield. Discover the story of the 1862 Battle of Harpers Ferry by exploring Bolivar Heights and Schoolhouse Ridge battlefields. </p> <h3>In the Lower Town: Historic Village, Rivers, Trails</h3> <p>From here take the free shuttle bus to Lower Town: Explore Civil War era homes, industry and shops. See where John Brown fought against slavery- catapulting the nation into the Civil War. Discover Camp Hill and the story of Storer College. Hike up Maryland Heights and enjoy the panoramic view of the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers. Walk to the Appalachian Trail or bike along the C&O Canal Towpath. </p> <h3>Exploring Maryland Heights</h3> <p>As the highest ridge surrounding the town of Harpers Ferry, Maryland Heights once bustled with private industry and Civil War occupation. <br /> <br /> Antietam Iron Works, a major nail producer in the early 1800s, burned the timber of the heights for charcoal to fuel its furnance and forges. Traces of charcoal hearths and roads remain today as testimony to this industry.<br /> <br /> Civil War earthworks, stone fortifications, and encampments transformed the mountain into a fortress from 1862 to 1865. Today, these former defenses and camps are some of the best preserved Civil War ruins in the United States.<br /> <br /> Nature has reclaimed Maryland Heights, but hiking these trails offers a look at the weathered and silent ruins of the past.</p> <h3>Suggested Day Hikes</h3> <p>Overlook Cliff Trail (red)<br /> A steady climb to a scenic overlook with excellent views of Harpers Ferry and the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers. This trail also explore a Civil War fortification. <br /> Distance: 2.8 miles<br /> Time: 2 hours round trip<br /> <br /> Stone Fort Trail (blue)<br /> A more strenuous hike, steep in spots, to the summit. Along the way are weathered charcoal hearths and the ruins of Civil War defenses and military campgrounds. Scenic vistas reveal Maryland Heights as a strategic mountain citadel on the boarder between the North and South.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "From this vantage point, early residents watched Harpers Ferry grow from a tiny village into a thriving industrial community.<br />In 1775, town founder Robert Harper chose this hillside for his home. The home was completed in 1782. Unfortunately, he died that same year and never lived there. Harper had no children and left his property to his niece, Sarah Harper Wager. On September 6, 1832, Sarah's granddaughter, Sarah Ann, married Noah H. Swayne in this house. Referred to as \"The Mansion,\" this home was owned by the Swayne family for 89 years.<br />The Harper House is the oldest surviving structure in Harpers Ferry and has undergone many transformations from tavern, residence, rental property, abandoned ruin to restored exhibit.<br />Photo Caption: Noah H.

Despite a six-hour resistance upon the crest against a 2,000-man Confederate advance, Union defenders received orders at 3:00 p.m. to withdrawal from Maryland Heights and \"fall back to Harpers Ferry in good order.\" Forty hours later, with the capture of Harpers Ferry by Stonewall Jackson, Union commander Col. Dixon S. Miles surrendered 12,500 men, including the 2,000 defenders from Maryland Heights.</p>",

Retreating Federals set fire to the armory and arsenal.",

    "audioDescription": "\"The battle we wage is not for ourselves alone but for all true Americans\" - W.E.B. Du Bois. In 1906, the Niagara Movement held its second annual meeting on the Storer College campus. \"The Niagara Movement was the first national organization of Negroes which aggressively and unconditionally demanded the same civil rights for their people which other Americans enjoyed.\" Elliot M. Rudwick, historian, 1957. Symbolically important as the first meeting of the group on American soil, the conference organizers carefully selected the location of the meeting. They chose Harpers Ferry for its rich history, including the John Brown raid to end slavery, and Storer College for its commitment to education for people of all races. \"We claim for ourselves every single right that belongs to a freeborn American, political, civil and social...\" W.E.B. Du Bois speaking at the 1906 Niagara Movement meeting. Photo Caption: Attendees at the 1906 Niagara Movement Conference posed at Anthony Hall, the building in front of you. General Secretary W.E.B.

Refrigerated cars brought oysters and other luxuries to the town. Thousands of travelers visited Harpers Ferry as it became a gateway to the Ohio Valley. The Civil War shattered Harper Ferry's prosperity. Much of the town was destroyed, and Confederate raiders constantly sabotaged the railroad. Despite the war, the railroad escaped permanent damage, and the B&O survives today as a main artery of transportation in the United States.",

    "bodyText": "No. 1: On September 10, 1862, General R.E. Lee, commanding the army of Northern Virginia, then at Frederick, MD. Set three colums in motion to capture Harper's Ferry. Maj Gen L. McLaws with his own division and that of Maj Gen R.H. Anderson, marched through Middletown and Brownsville Pass into Pleasant Valley. On the 12th the brigades of Kershaw and Barksdale ascended Maryland Heights by Solomon's Gap, moved along the crest and, at nightfall, were checked by the Union forces under command of Col. T.H. Ford, about two miles north of this. Eight Confederate brigades held Weverton, Sandy Hook, and approaches from the east. On the 13th Kershaw and Barksdale drove the Union troops from the Heights. Ford, abandoning seven guns, retreated across the pontoon bridge, a few yards above the railroad bridge, to Harper's Ferry. The Union loss was 38 killed, 134 wounded; Confederate loss, 35 killed, 178 wounded.Brig. Gen. John G. Walker's division crossed the Potomac at Point of Rocks, 10 miles below this, during the night of September 10 and, on the 13th occupied Loudoun Heights and the roads south of the river leading east and south.<br /> <br /> No. 2: Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson, with his own division and those of Maj. Gens. A.P. Hill and R.S. Ewell, left Frederick on the morning of September 10 and passing through Middletown and Boonsboro, crossed the Potomac at Williamsport, 21 miles north of this, on the afternoon of the 11th. Hill's division took the direct road to Martinsburg and bivouacked near it. Jackson's and Ewell's divisions marched to North Mountain Depot on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, seven miles northwest of Martinsburg, and bivouacked. During the night Brig. Gen. Julius White, commanding the Union troops at Martinsburg, about 2,500 in number, abandoned the place and retreated to Harper's Ferry. Jackson occupied Martinsburg on the morning of the 12th, passed through it and about noon of the 13th, A.P. Hill's division, in the advance, reached Halltown, 3¼ miles west of this, and went into camp. Jackson's and Ewell's division, following Hill's, encamped near it.<br /> <br /> No. 3: Col. Dixon S. Miles, second U.S. Infantry, commanded the Union forces at Harper's Ferry. After General White joined from Martinsburg, September 12, and Colonel Ford from Maryland Heights on the 13th, Miles had about 14,200 men. On the morning of the 14th the greater part of this force was in position on Bolivar Heights, 1 5/8 miles west, its right resting on the Potomac, its left near the Shenandoah; artillery distributed on the line. Artillery and a small force of infantry occupied Camp Hill, nearly midway between this and Bolivar Heights. The cavalry was under partial cover of the irregularities of the ground.On the morning of the 14th Walker placed five long range guns near the northern point of Loudoun Heights, and, at 1pm, opened on the Union batteries on Bolivar Heights and Camp Hill, which was replied to. An hour later Jackson's artillery opened on Bolivar Heights from Schoolhouse Hill and, still an hour later, McLaws opened from two Parrott guns that he had succeeded in placing near the southern extremity of Maryland Heights. The fire from these three directions was continued until dark, silencing and dismounting some of the Union guns.<br /> <br /> No. 4: In the afternoon of the 14th Jackson's division advanced its left, seized commanding ground near the Potomac and established artillery upon it. Hill's division moved from Halltown obliquely to the right until it struck the Shenandoah, then pushed along the river; the advance, after some sharp skirmishing late in the night gained high ground upon which were placed five batteries, commanding the left rear of the Union line. Ewell's division advanced through Halltown to Schoolhouse Hill, and deployed about one mile in front of Bolivar Heights, bivouacking on either side of the Charlestown Road. During the night the Confederates advanced on the right and left gaining some ground, and 10 guns of Ewell's division crossed the Shenandoah at Key's Ford and were placed on the plateau at the foot of Loudoun Heights to enfilade the entire position on Bolivar Heights.About 9pm the entire Union cavalry force, about 1,500 men crossed the pontoon bridge, passed up the canal bank about a mile, followed the mountain road near the river, crossed the Antietam near its mouth, passed through Sharpsburg about midnight and escaped into Pennsylvania.<br /> <br /> No. 5: At daylight, September 15, three batteries of Jackson's division delivered a severe fire against the right of the Bolivar Heights defense. Ewell's batteries opened from School House Hill in front. Hill's five batteries on ground commanding the left of the line and the 10 guns across the Shenandoah poured an accurate enfilade fire upon the left and rear of Miles' defenses. The artillery on Loudoun Heights and Maryland Heights joined in the attack. This concentrated fire or 56 guns was responded to by the Union guns, but, in an hour, beginning to run short of ammunition Miles raised the white flag in a token of surrender. Soon after he was mortally wounded and the command devolved on General White who completed the terms of capitulation by the surrender of about 12,500 officers and men and all public property. Hill’s Division was left to parole the prisoners, while Jackson with five divisions marched to the field of Antietam. Exclusive of the loss on MarylandHeights, the Union loss was 9 killed, 39 wounded; Confederate loss, 6 killed, 69 wounded.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The structure we now call John Brown's Fort was erected in 1848 as the Armory's fire engine and guard house. The building was described in a June 30, 1848, Armory report: \"An engine and guard-house, 35½ x 24 feet, one story brick, covered with slate, and having copper gutters and down spouts, has been constructed, and is now occupied.\" It was in this building that John Brown and several of his followers barricaded themselves during the final hours of their ill-fated raid of October 16, 17, and 18, 1859.<br /> <br /> John Brown's Fort, as the structure became known, was the only Armory building to escape destruction during the Civil War. In 1891, the fort was sold, dismantled and transported to Chicago where it was displayed a short distance from The World's Columbian Exposition. The building, attracting only 11 visitors in ten days, was closed, dismantled again and left on a vacant lot.<br /> <br /> In 1894, Washington, D.C. journalist Kate Field, who had a keen interest in preserving memorabilia of John Brown, spearheaded a campaign to return the fort to Harpers Ferry. Local resident Alexander Murphy made five acres available to Miss Field, and the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad offered to ship the disassembled fort to Harpers Ferry free of charge. In 1895, John Brown's Fort was rebuilt on the Murphy Farm about three miles outside of town on a bluff overlooking the Shenandoah River.<br /> <br /> In 1903, Storer College began their own fundraising drive to acquire the structure. In 1909, on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of John Brown's Raid, the building was purchased and moved to the Storer College campus on Camp Hill in Harpers Ferry.<br /> <br /> Acquired by the National Park Service in 1960, the building was moved back to the Lower Town in 1968. Because the fort's original site was covered with a railroad embankment in 1894, the building now sits about 150 feet east of its original location.</p> <h2>Timeline</h2> <p>1848 Built as fire-engine house for U.S. Armory.<br /> 1859 Serves as stronghold for John Brown and his raiders.<br /> 1861-1865 Escapes destruction during Civil War (only armory building to do so), but is vandalized by souvenir-hunting Union and Confederate soldiers and later travelers.<br /> 1891 Dismantled and transported to Chicago Exposition.<br /> 1895 Rescued from conversion to stable and brought back to Harpers Ferry area to be exhibited on a farm.<br /> 1909 Purchased by Storer College and moved to campus<br /> 1968 Moved by National Park Service to within 150 feet of its original location<br /> Photo caption: On October 16, 1859, the abolitionist John Brown and his men attacked Harpers Ferry. By the following afternoon the local militia had penned the raiders in this building. United States Marines stormed the building at dawn on the 18th and captured Brown. Convicted of murder, treason, and inciting slaves to rebellion, he was hanged in nearby Charles Town on December 2, 1859.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>One of the largest residences in Harpers Ferry, the Lockwood House, hosted numerous venues during the Civil War. Originally constructed as the home of the Armory Paymaster in 1848, the massive stone and brick structure has an elaborate two-story porch, which became an ideal site for a base hospital during the summer of 1862. Labeled the \"Clayton Hospital,\" the large rooms, high ceilings, and airy porch offered a healthy environment for soldiers suffering from camp diseases such as dysentery, diarrhea, and various fevers. The Lockwood House also became the location where wounded Union soldiers were treated during the Battle of Harpers Ferry in September 1862.<br /> <br /> Following the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863, the Union army reoccupied Harpers Ferry and the garrison commander, Brig. Gen. Henry Lockwood, selected this building for his headquarters. The current name of the building is named after Henry Lockwood. Lockwood was not the only general to use the building; the building was also headquarters for Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan. Sheridan occupied the Lockwood House during the second week of August 1864, as he prepared to launch his Shenandoah Valley Campaign that would remove Confederates from the area.<br /> <br /> When not used as a headquarters or a hospital, this building served as a bivouac, a prison, and a ballroom. A grand Thanksgiving ball was held here in November 1863, featuring the brass band of the 34th Massachusetts Infantry and under the candlelight of a chandelier made of rifle barrels and bayonets.<br /> At the end of the war, Freewill Baptist missionaries from Maine utilized the Lockwood House as a school for formerly enslaved men and women. Under the direction of Reverend Nathan Brackett, the Lockwood House became the nucleus of Storer College.<br /> <br /> In recent history, architects and conservationists have found Civil War era graffiti scribbled on the building's plaster walls. Today, preserving the graffiti has been an ongoing conservation project and makes the house unique that it has lasted so long.</p>",

Then the park's blue-blazed trail leads to the Split Rock overlook and an awesome payoff for all of your effort. <br /> <br /> Loudoun Heights is the second highest mountain overlooking Harpers Ferry, hugging the Shenandoah River along its base. The mountain's northern face has a 900-foot vertical drop, which is the steepest bluff surrounding Harpers Ferry. The name Loudoun Heights comes from Loudoun County, Virginia, which is situated near Harpers Ferry.<br /> <br /> Confederate forces, under Col. Thomas Jonathan Jackson, were the first to occupy Loudoun Heights. In the spring of 1861, Jackson ordered the construction of three infantry blockhouses on the mountain summit. The stone foundation remains of the blockhouses still remain today and are hidden in wilderness, which has helped preserve them.<br /> <br /> During the Battle of Harpers Ferry, September 12-15, 1862, Maj. Gen. John G. Walker's Confederate division seized Loudoun Heights in accordance with General Lee's Special Orders 191. Walker's division of 4,000 men encountered no resistance by the Union troops in the area because they thought that Loudoun Heights would not affect them but their assumption was false. Confederate General Jackson ordered cannon to be placed on the mountain, which seemed impossible to do, along with four guns on the mountain's crest. When bombardment commenced on September 13, the Loudoun Heights cannon caused more damage and harm to the Union forces holding Bolivar Heights and Camp Hill than any other Confederate position, due to the elevation and near proximity of Loudoun Heights.<br /> <br /> Following the Battle of Antietam, the Union reoccupied Harpers Ferry in late September 1862. Loudoun Heights became an extensive temporary campground for a portion of the Army of the Potomac. The grounds of Loudoun Heights were miserable for camping, with limited water, steep slopes, boulder-strewn crests, and primitive roads. Remnants of these campgrounds still exist, but are inaccessible due to the rugged terrain. By early November, the Union troops had abandoned the mountain, and did not again play a significant role, as it fell under the big Union guns on Maryland Heights.</p>",

To access this area, walk from Lower Town across the footbridge over the Potomac River to the C&O Canal towpath then take a left and walk along the path until there is signage for the Maryland Heights trail.<br /> <br /> Maryland Heights is the highest mountain overlooking Harpers Ferry. Its southern face is a 300-foot vertical cliff that towers over the Potomac River, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. The mountain is steep, rugged, and primitive, with a thick veneer of Civil War history.<br /> <br /> Maryland Heights hosted the first battle between Union and Confederate troops in Maryland. The first combat on Northern soil between the two armies occurred on Maryland Heights. Maryland Heights was the most important strategic target of the Confederate army in the Battle of Harpers Ferry, which took place from September 12-15, 1862. Without the seizure of Maryland Heights, Robert E. Lee's Confederates could not entrap the Union garrison and complete Lee's assignment outlined in Special Orders 191.<br /> <br /> Lee selected Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws to lead the advance upon Maryland Heights, expecting McLaws to snare the Union garrison from the north. McLaws arrived at the eastern base of the mountain on September 12 with 8,000 men. Discovering nearly 4,000 Union soldiers stationed atop the mountain, McLaws directed William Barksdale's Mississippi brigade and Joseph Kershaw's South Carolina brigade to ascend Elk Ridge north of Maryland Heights and to take the Union position. Battling at Maryland Heights lasted from 6:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on September 13, and eventually, the Union troops under Colonel Thomas H. Ford's command abandoned their position. The loss of Maryland Heights cut off the Union forces escape routes and helped lead to the surrender of the Union garrison on September 15.<br /> <br /> The significance of Maryland Heights is further attested by the Union occupation of the mountain two days following the Battle of Antietam. By securing the heights on September 19, the Union, once again, occupied Harpers Ferry and to ensure the protection of the position, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan ordered that extensive fortifications be constructed on Maryland Heights. Union engineers quickly surveyed the terrain, and during the fall of 1862, work commenced on the Stone Fort and the 30-pounder Battery, along with improvements at the Naval Battery. Ten months later, as General Lee threatened Harpers Ferry with his second invasion during the Gettysburg Campaign; construction hastened which resulted in the Interior Fort, the Exterior Fort, and the 100-pounder Battery. This latter battery boasted a 100-pounder Parrott Rifle that could hurl a 100-pound shell more than two miles and the tube of this cannon weighed nearly 10 tons.<br /> <br /> The fortifications of Maryland Heights played a major role in the Confederacy's third and final invasion of the North. Confederate Maj. Gen. Jubal Early spent four days attempting to maneuver the Union out of the forts, but he failed. During the time Early spent worrying about Maryland Heights, the Union was able to send reinforcements to Washington, ultimately helping to save the United States capital. The Union army would occupy the forts of Maryland Heights until June 30, 1865. The final time the big cannon boomed was in memory of President Lincoln following his assassination.<br /> <br /> Though Maryland Heights was occupied by Union forces the most, Maryland Heights occupation was by Confederates. Col. Thomas Jonathan Jackson seized the mountain in May 1861. Recognizing the strategic value of the high ground, Jackson was sure he could not defend Harpers Ferry without holding Maryland Heights. Jackson's aggressiveness created major turmoil when he positioned his troops in neutral Maryland, a state that the Confederacy was trying to get to join their cause. Despite the political firestorm set off by Jackson, he refused to abandon the position. The Confederates left on their own volition on June 14, 1861, when the Confederates abandoned Harpers Ferry five weeks before the First Battle of Manassas (Bull Run).</p>",

The Master Armorer's House is at the junction of Shenandoah and High Streets only one block from the Baltimore & Ohio (B&O) Railroad Bridge and the Potomac River pontoon crossing. The Master Armorer's House was easy to find and a nerve center for communications during the Civil War.<br /> <br /> Completed just before the John Brown Raid in 1859, the Master Armorer's House was one of the newest buildings in Harpers Ferry at the outbreak of the Civil War.<br /> <br /> The most famous general who stayed in the Master Armorer's House was Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Grant only spent one night in the house, on September 16, 1864, when returning from a strategy meeting in Charles Town with his Shenandoah Valley commander, Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan. During Grant's stay, the building was the headquarters of Union Brig. Gen. John D. Stevenson. Stevenson commanded the Military District of Harpers Ferry along with managing Sheridan's logistics operations during the 1864 Valley Campaign. Stevenson was known to control Harpers Ferry, and the surrounding region, with a \"hard-hand\" of martial law. Stevenson also combated Confederate guerillas; he even entrapped John Mobberly, his nemesis, and killed him just before the end of the war. Stevenson also displayed Mobberly's corpse at the Master Armorer's House, as a reminder of the war's ruthlessness.<br /> <br /> Union commander Col. Dixon S. Miles, who opposed Stonewall Jackson during the Battle of Harpers Ferry on September 12-15, 1862, also used the Master Armorer's House as his headquarters. Miles was mortally wounded during the battle, and died here on September 16.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h4>What Does the Sign Say?</h4> <p>The faded painting on the face of Maryland Heights was an early 1900s advertisement aimed at passengers on the B&O Railroad, which was a heavily traveled rail line. It read <strong>Mennen’s Borated Talcum Toilet Powder</strong>.</p> <h4>Origins of the Sign</h4> <p>From the establishment of the town in the 1700s through today, this landscape has been exploited for business. From her house on High Street in 1906, Clara Riley watched as sign painters created a huge advertisement, out of a milk and whitewash mixture, on the side of the mountain. Mrs. Riley remembered the year because she was in labor with her first child while the sign was being painted.<br /> <br /> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, painting advertisements on brick buildings and stone cliffs was very popular. Although the Mennen’s powder sign may have been the largest in the area, it was not alone (The wall around the famous John Brown Fort advertised liver pills). As transportation shifted to roads and automobiles, advertisements moved to billboards and highways.</p> <h4>Maintaining the Sign</h4> <p>In May of 1963, the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC) attempted to hide the sign at the request of Park Superintendent Joseph Prentice. Prentice said that looking at the sign was “like looking across the Grand Canyon and seeing a Coca-Cola sign.”<br /> <br /> The PATC and the superintendent were not the only ones who disliked the sign. Many local residents believed it to be a “desecration of nature.”<br /> <br /> Eager to eradicate the sign, PATC volunteers scaled the cliff and attacked the old sign with paint remover and carbon black. However, only four years later the sign was visible once again and has since been left alone.</p>",

He dubbed it “The Experiment”. This strange craft was comprised of an iron frame that came apart in sections, over which was stretched a covering of animal hide.

When Storer College came into existence in 1867, Morrell answered the call from the Home Mission Board to return to Harpers Ferry as the spiritual leader of the college. In 1870, he and his family settled into what would become known as the Morrell House. He remained at Storer College until 1881, preaching and counseling students. <br /> <br /> This monument in memory of Morrell (and presumed final resting place) now stands on the grounds of the Curtis Freewill Baptist Church on the former campus of Storer College. </p>",

This exhibit space focuses on Meriwether Lewis' time in Harpers Ferry. <br /> <br /> In mid-March of 1803, about two weeks after Congress authorized the expedition, the twenty-eight-year-old Lewis departed Washington for the recently opened United States Armory and Arsenal at Harpers Ferry to acquire supplies. Lewis relied on the armory and its skilled craftsmen to supply “arms and accoutrements” that would meet the unique requirements of the transcontinental expedition. The armory provided 15 rifles, 15 powder horns, 30 bullet molds, 30 ball screws, extra rifle and musket locks, gunsmith's repair tools, several dozen tomahawks, and 24 large knives.<br /> <br /> Lewis also worked with armory engineers to develop a collapsible iron-framed boat that could be transported over land when necessary. He dubbed it “The Experiment”. This strange craft was comprised of an iron frame that came apart in sections, over which was stretched a covering of animal hide. Lewis planned to use the craft following the portage around the Great Falls of the Missouri River, when the river got too shallow for heavy wooden boats to navigate.</p>",

Treasury agents enforced tax regulations. People attempting to cross the Potomac from enemy territory of Loudoun County were supposed to go to Berlin, Maryland, ordered to take the oath, and remarkably, deal with U.S. Customs to carry on business.

Aimed at children and their parents, a December 1864 newspaper story called “Santa Claus Visits the New York Herald Newspaper Office ” allowed Santa to speak to the editor and comment on what the war had done to Americans and assert the joy that toys could bring to children: “No prima donna sings so deliciously as a little girl putting her doll to sleep…you ask… if I am as busy as ever this year. Busier, sir, busier! There are so many soldier’s children to look after, and alas! so many orphans. To these I am unusually tender, and it is the duty of every man to assist me. Ah, the brave old Christmas times in the South are over until the war is over. The hearthstones are desolate. Children who ought to be playing with popguns are shouldering real muskets in the rebel armies. Oh, sir, it would make you heart bleed if I could tell you of the scenes I have witnessed in Southern homes during the past four years. They were dreadful, dreadful. Merry old man as I am it saddens me to think of them. I went South as long as I could. I kept green the memory of Santa Claus in their hearts for three martial years. But now I find myself shut out by the blockades at every point, and this Christmas they must do without me. Let us hope...that before another Christmas comes round there will be a reunited Union, a permanent peace, and a Santa Claus for all the children.” </p>",

The dough proceeded through different stages of mixing until it was elastic enough to trap air, released by the yeast inside the dough, which allowed the dough to rise. The men on the left, are busy pushing or pulling baked bread or raw dough in and out of the ovens. In their hands are very long iron or wooden bread peels. The long length of the peels indicates how deep the oven was. Compare the length of the peel pole to the man holding it. The sketch indicates the oven could have been 6 to 8 feet deep. Over the men’s head on the left, are extra peels up out of the way, but still close by when needed. These ovens were kept hot and ready to bake around the clock, or 5,000 loaves a day would not be possible!</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The buildings of the arsenal no longer exist, but an outline has been created where they would have been. The footprint of the large arsenal is bordered by gray stones and filled in the center with black mulch. Along the gravel path in front of it are two signs. The larger one on the left side with the title “Weapons Under Fire” reads, “You are standing in Arsenal Square. Weapons made in the armory were carted here for storage in the two arsenal buildings from 1803-1861. The stone rectangle in the ground in front of you outlines the large arsenal built in 1799. Problems plagued the two-story building. An 1827 report found the large arsenal ‘liable to be destroyed by fire at any moment.’ By 1832, overcrowding posed a problem. ‘The large one [arsenal] is literally crammed…. Large masses [of arms] are stored in bulk for want of boxes.’ Both buildings were destroyed in 1861 – gutted by fire.” The image on the whole sign is a color drawing of Arsenal Square as it would have been in the 1840s. In the upper right hand corner is a drawing of the arsenal on fire titled “Setting Fire” with the caption “At the start of the Civil War, Virginia militia tried to seize the armory and arsenal. Outnumbered U.S. troops set fire to these buildings to keep nearly 15,000 weapons out of enemy hands.” The smaller sign to the right is titled “Meriwether Lewis at Harpers Ferry” in red. The subtitle is “Large Arsenal Foundation” and the text reads “Completed in 1800, the 2 ½ story, brick arsenal building stored weapons made for the security of a young United States of America. Lewis procured 15 rifles from this stockpile. They were the first and most essential weapons his soldiers needed to survive on their wilderness journey.” The background is a painting of the water gap looking down the Potomac River.",

Yesterday a prisoner of war, one of Mosby's guerrillas caught in Loudoun county, was reported at this office, his name is William Loge, also known as French bill, and he is notoriously known as a guerrilla bushwacker murder and assassin. And that is not all. The same person deserted from the six New York volunteers and joined the rebel forces. He was sentenced…to be hung today at 2:00 PM. A general order having been issued to that effect; Captain Pratt was ordered to see that it was carried into effect. Accordingly this afternoon an immense crowd assembled on the ground in Bolivar and the procession arrived around 3:00 PM headed by the post band it being the first execution that has occurred in this vicinity since the John Brown affair, a large crowd had congregated on the spot . The criminal bore his fate with singular courage and expressed as his only wish that he would like to see his mother, he being scarcely 20 years old but his circumstance never changed when he was notified of his sentence. He said he was willing to die. On the scaffold he made a short speech, running up his crimes, saying that he was a deserter from the U S army and owing up that he had shot in cold blood and robbed many a Yankee soldier etc the worst part of the affair was the rope broke and the poor criminal in his last struggles of agony, while being brought to the scaffolding a second time, cried that they should only shoot him and put him out of his misery. I never want to witness another execution of this kind.”",

The country is thinking about the recent contentious presidential election. Abraham Lincoln’s second election hinged on the success of Union General Philip Sheridan’s Valley Campaign, which brought the inevitable end to the conflict ever closer. The prospect of peace is around the corner; the Civil War will determine the Union of the States and eventual freedom of four million enslaved people. </p> <p paraeid=\"{33f2b9e4-d4ff-4772-9f20-5b57fabfc05b}{187}\" paraid=\"215949600\">Here in Harpers Ferry, the Provost Marshal and his Provost Guard policed military and civilian activities. Harpers Ferry changed hands eight or more times during the Civil War. Most of the time it was occupied by the Union Army. Harpers Ferry was perceived as enemy territory, and the Union Army assigned an officer as Provost Marshal with a Provost Guard to act as a military police force. The Provost Marshal dealt with prisoners of war, spies, and guerilla fighters, as well as drunk, disorderly, or deserting soldiers, and even unhappy or disloyal civilians. Enslaved people fleeing slavery who made their way to Union lines also fell under the Provost Marshal’s jurisdiction. The Provost Marshal had the authority to regulate military and civilian life under martial law with great authority. He could jail, punish, or even execute offenders of military law.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{346b3564-689b-4227-ba0c-b547ca5342b3}{14}\" paraid=\"1506107733\">This November 1864 report from Philip Sheridan to Major General Halleck demonstrates Sheridan’s scorched-earth policy: “I will soon commence on Loudoun County, and let them know there is a God in Israel. By loss of property and comforts they will cry for peace.” Young Charles Moulton of the 34th Massachusetts Regiment, a Provost clerk, noted Sheridan’s success against disloyal Loudoun County. “During the past few days, a large force of Sheridan’s Cavalry has been operating in Loudoun County and are destroying all the barns with contents, burning all the grain, hay, and cleaning the county all around of everything that possibly can afford shelter or aid to the prowling guerrilla bands that have infested the region for so long a time. I can see from the window now the reflection of the fire glowing on the horizon, showing how completely the work of devastation is being carried out.”</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The building is a red brick three story building with the Provost Marshal exhibit on the first floor. Hanging above the door is a sign reading “Provost Marshal – Military District of Harpers Ferry” in black lettering on a white background. Inside there is a sign titled “Halt! Show Your Pass!” The text reads “Harpers Ferry changed hands eight times during the Civil War. Most of the time, however, the town was under Union control. The Provost Marshal regulated military and civilian life and could jail, punish and execute offenders. A Provost Marshal’s Office was located on High Street. This exhibit is based on a description written by Charles Moulton, who was a clerk here during the war. Prisoners were held in various buildings throughout town and were quickly shipped out to more secure locations north. The furnishings represent items confiscated during war and those issued by the military. The weapons and uniforms are typical of officers and soldiers while they were on Provost Guard duty.” In the upper right corner is the image of a pink colored pass for military personnel. In the lower left corner is a black and white portrait of a white man with mustache and beard in military uniform. The caption reads “In 1864 Provost Marshal Captain, later Major, Alanzo Pratt, 34th Massachusetts Infantry, provided security during General Sheridan’s Shenandoah Valley Campaign. Townspeople described him as “kindhearted,” but his rule could be rigorous.” An image credit at the bottom of the photo reads “Image courtesy U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center.” Inside the threshold is one room blocked partially by wooden gates. There is a window on the back wall. To the left of the window, hanging along the back wall, are uniform pieces, weapons, hats, handcuffs, and bags. On the right is a black chalkboard titled “Prisoner Status” and a list of prisoners.",

The Union Army alone blamed 50,000 deaths on diarrhea-dysentery, a sum larger than \"killed in action\". In his 1862 “Culinary Hints for the Soldier,” Captain James Sanderson stated, \"Cleanliness is next to godliness, both in persons and kettles. Be ever industrious, then in scouring your pots...Beans killed more than bullets; and fat is more fatal than powder.\" </p> <p paraeid=\"{9d99f199-22b6-418b-82e4-15b1ca0691a5}{52}\" paraid=\"1218893495\">Diet kitchens operating under US Army surgeons’ control were supplied mainly through hospital commissaries and supplemented with delicacies and other necessities by the U.S. Christian Commission. All patients who did not receive meals from the general kitchen, received special diet kitchen meals by surgeons’ orders. Experienced and competent women attached to the USCC managed these kitchens. Before war’s end, more than one hundred diet kitchens were in service. Diet kitchens issued over 2 million rations during the last 18 months of the war. These diet kitchen services likely saved thousands of soldiers' lives. Coffee-wagons and “special diet-kitchens” were organized for the convalescent. The USCC estimated that their work during the war cost more than 6.25 million dollars.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9d99f199-22b6-418b-82e4-15b1ca0691a5}{106}\" paraid=\"1366479238\">The USCC played a role in Harpers Ferry during the Civil War. One of the citizens of Harpers Ferry, Mary Roeder, left her home after the death of her father, Frederick, and married a man named Kerns. As she and her family returned to their home throughout the Civil War, they often found it occupied by federal soldiers. The Roeder/Kerns family continued their support of the Union by offering food and medical supply storage to the USCC in their buildings here on Potomac Street in the lower town of Harpers Ferry.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The exterior is a concrete building with one stone step up to the doorway. Above the door a sign says “White Hall Tavern” in black lettering on a white background. To the right of the doorway is a window with gray shutters. To the left of the doorway is a sign reading “White Hall Oysters and Lunches: Frederick Roeder wishes to inform all gentlemen they will be furnished at the bar with Liquors Old and Mellow. Brandies, Gin, Rum, Scotch, Rye, and Bourbon Whiskey, Wine, Ale, Porter, Champagne, Port, Beer, Cider. Proprietor Frederick Roeder” In the doorway is a brown wooden gate and chain across the entry. After stepping up to the doorway, inside is a sign with the title “White Hall Tavern” and reading “Located directly across from the U.S. Armory, the White Hall Tavern was an 1850’s community gathering place, where white males debated politics; discussed local events; and protested armory management, wages and layoffs. The tavern’s close proximity easily tempted armory workers to raise a glass, or two…or three, before and during work. As a result, Armory officials took a stand that public houses, such as the White Hall Tavern ruined morals, work ethics, and even threatened armory production. Crowded building conditions posed another threat – fire. In 1856 the U.S. Government purchased and removed the front section of the building. They subsequently widened the street, creating the needed safety buffer around the Armory.” The sign has a black and white photo of a two and a half story building and the caption “White Hall Tavern as it appeared in the 1890s.” Faded in the background is a drawing of three men. One is seated on the far left, one standing and drinking at a bar, and the third behind the bar. The interior is one room with a bar set up straight ahead. The bar is painted red and cream and has multiple shelves with glass bottles and containers.",

Both Roeder and his wife had died, leaving their children orphans. In fact, Roeder was the town’s first casualty of war, shot by a sniper. The oldest daughter, 17-year-old Mary, became head of household. She and her brothers and sisters became refugees of war, vacating and then returning to this family home repeatedly when hostile forces left the town. During the war, this building served as a military post office for the Union Army and as the headquarters for Colonel DeWitt Clinton Baxter and his 72nd Pennsylvania Fire Zouaves, a volunteer unit largely made up of former Philadelphia firemen.   <br />  <br /> Today, Mr. Roeder’s story is found only in an obscure local history book and in some musty claims records in the National Archives. His story is the story of thousands of civilians, communities and families innocently caught in the crossfire of war. They have no battle honors, and their names embellish no army rolls, but they also paid a price for our country’s unity and freedom. Most of them have no monument or place to tell their story except, perhaps, an unvisited tombstone. We offer you this Christmas setting at his restored home as a way to preserve his memory and his family’s sacrifice to their country.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{80b08b6c-14bb-48d5-8584-f7c507489886}{126}\" paraid=\"246292380\">We hope that these images of Christmas past and present may, in true Dickensian fashion, create a brighter Christmas future yet to come, so that all of humanity may truly enjoy peace on earth and goodwill toward all.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The building is three stories. The top two are red brick and the bottom is light gray stone. The second story has a black wrought iron balcony and the front porch floor is painted red with a beige fence. Hanging from the balcony are two red cube lanterns and a small sign that reads “Confectionery.” There are two doors to walk up to and view the inside. In the doorway on the left, a sign with the title “Sweets for Harpers Ferry” reads “The enticing smell of bread, cakes, candies, and pies undoubtedly attracted many customers to Frederick Roeder’s Confectionery, making it a prosperous business from 1845 to 1861. In addition to his store, it is reported that he carried small pies to the train station to sell to hungry passengers before the days of dining cars. By 1856 Roeder was so successful that he enlarged this structure by one and a half stories, creating much needed space for his business and family of 7 children. Thriving in his adopted homeland, this German baker turned skills from his native country into sumptuous treats for his friends, neighbors, and community.” The image on the sign is a pencil sketch of a bakery counter and shelves filled with ingredients and treats. Credit is given as “Artist, Steven N. Patricia.” Behind the sign in the room is a black counter with pumpkin colored front siding. On the counter is a wedding cake and several baking tools. On the left back corner is a door painted the same pumpkin color and a bookshelf holding cake stands. On the right are two more bookshelves, one gray and one pumpkin, and a window. In the doorway on the right, a sign titled “Casualty of War” reads, “German immigrant Frederick Roeder was a prosperous baker, the father of seven children, and a recent widower. Roeder was also about to die. The Fourth of July was normally a day of celebration, but not this year – not 1861. In March Roeder buried his wife, Anna Maria; the following month Civil War erupted, Virginia seceded, and Harpers Ferry became a war zone – businesses collapsed, and the local economy crashed. A Union sympathizer, Roeder longed to catch a glimpse of the United States flag flying on the Maryland shore. Venturing out to the Potomac River, he gazed across at the Stars and Stripes, only to be struck down by a ricocheting bullet fired by a Union soldier. He crawled back to this building, his home, where he died. Roeder was the first townsperson to die during the war. His home, business and other property were confiscated by the Union Army for use as a military bakery, post office, and headquarters. His orphaned children abandoned their home, but returned a year later and lived here until 1881. They filed claims with the government for extensive wartime damage to this house and other family property. They were finally approved for compensation of $504.00 in 1906.” Behind the sign in the room are a fireplace, a couch, and a table set for tea. The back wall has a door in the center with a window to either side. The door and the window trim are painted the same pumpkin orange.",

The same United States that captured Brown and his supporters in 1859 assumed the role of Brown’s envisioned liberating army that never materialized at Harpers Ferry.

And yet we know from history and from our present-day experience that the two exist side by side. Everyone is ready for peace and the journey home during December 1864, but the soldiers must complete their tasks, load the quartermaster wagons, send them to the front, end a protracted war, and free four million enslaved people. </p> <p paraeid=\"{32d4c56d-2bf0-4182-bfb5-f10a734e387e}{51}\" paraid=\"916069040\">Flagg’s Quartermaster operation had been active at Harpers Ferry throughout the Civil War, but during 1864, Harpers Ferry became a major supply center for a military campaign involving tens of thousands of troops. Burned out armory buildings were re-roofed and turned into packed warehouses. Thousands of horses were stabled in the area, and a cavalry remount camp set up in the vicinity. Supply trains of as many as 1000 wagons a day left or arrived at Harpers Ferry. The wagons, loaded and maneuvered by 300 employees (both white and Black), contained everything to feed, arm, and clothe the army. The Quartermaster General's Department was the supply section of the U.S. Army. It procured, transported, and distributed practically all military items, including clothing, blankets, tentage, horses, wagons, lumber, tools, cooking and eating utensils, nails, paint, pens, candles, and even stationery. Anything a soldier carried was either sent from home, bought, stolen, or issued from the Quartermaster. </p> <p paraeid=\"{92313c8c-9178-42e3-b845-83a8136d557e}{52}\" paraid=\"1978525617\">Both the towns of Bolivar Heights and Harpers Ferry were consumed by the Quartermaster operation. Bolivar Heights had become a congested wagon park, filled with mules and swearing teamsters. Fields were white as snow with army tents and the canvas covers of hundreds of wagons and ambulances. Railroads were used to capacity. Eventually, General Sheridan ordered that all troops destined for his army should be armed at Harpers Ferry. All this happened in an environment where Confederate raiders attacked supply wagons, trains, and railroads. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "View of Shenandoah and Potomac Streets merging. To the left, a street corner lined with brick, stone, and wood buildings. To the right, a grassy berm topped with a stone obelisk, with stairs leading to it. On the top of the grassy berm is a defunct railroad track and wooden staircase down to the Armory grounds. The grassy lawn has several signs dotted across it, as well as a stone obelisk. The river and modern railroad track are on the other side. On the left side of the field and up on the berm is a red building and a parking lot. Wayside titled “A Nation’s Armory” reads: “You are standing directly across the street from the main entrance of one of the nation’s first military industrial complexes. The U.S. Armory at Harpers Ferry, now covered by an embankment of dirt and rubble, produced the deadliest weapons of its day from the early 1800s until the start of the Civil War in 1861. Gutted during the Civil War, the armory was later razed and mostly covered with rubble to make way for elevated train tracks. A stone obelisk on the rise in front of you marks the original location of what became known as John Brown’s Fort.” A large black and white photo shows a dirt street lined with brick buildings.

    "audioDescription": "The building is a red brick three story building with the Provost Marshal exhibit on the first floor. Hanging above the door is a sign reading “Provost Marshal – Military District of Harpers Ferry” in black lettering on a white background. Inside there is a sign titled “Halt! Show Your Pass!” The text reads “Harpers Ferry changed hands eight times during the Civil War. Most of the time, however, the town was under Union control. The Provost Marshal regulated military and civilian life and could jail, punish and execute offenders. A Provost Marshal’s Office was located on High Street. This exhibit is based on a description written by Charles Moulton, who was a clerk here during the war. Prisoners were held in various buildings throughout town and were quickly shipped out to more secure locations north. The furnishings represent items confiscated during war and those issued by the military. The weapons and uniforms are typical of officers and soldiers while they were on Provost Guard duty.” In the upper right corner is the image of a pink colored pass for military personnel. In the lower left corner is a black and white portrait of a white man with mustache and beard in military uniform. The caption reads “In 1864 Provost Marshal Captain, later Major, Alanzo Pratt, 34th Massachusetts Infantry, provided security during General Sheridan’s Shenandoah Valley Campaign. Townspeople described him as “kindhearted,” but his rule could be rigorous.” An image credit at the bottom of the photo reads “Image courtesy U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center.” Inside the threshold is one room blocked partially by wooden gates. There is a window on the back wall. To the left of the window, hanging along the back wall, are uniform pieces, weapons, hats, handcuffs, and bags. On the right is a black chalkboard titled “Prisoner Status” and a list of prisoners.",

Drive to this location on your own or add it to your Bolivar Heights hike. Take note: most of this trail is in full sun.<br /> <br /> Schoolhouse Ridge is an often overlooked and least understood topographic feature associated with Harpers Ferry's Civil War history. Until the turn of the 21st century, very little of Schoolhouse Ridge was part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park.<br /> <br /> Schoolhouse Ridge is parallel to Bolivar Heights and crosses the northeastern end of the Shenandoah Valley, which stretched nearly two miles. The northern edge rests along the Potomac River and the southern end reaches the Shenandoah River. The ridge is named for a one-story stone school house that stood near the Harpers Ferry-Charles Town Turnpike. This school house proved a popular rendezvous point for prowling Confederate cavalry. The ridge also became a popular target for the Union long-range cannon on Maryland Heights. The school house was destroyed during the war, reportedly by shots from the Naval Battery and the 100-pounder Battery on Maryland Heights, which is nearly 2 miles distant! Cannon from Bolivar Heights also had easy range to Schoolhouse Ridge, hampering Confederate movements anytime they reached this point.<br /> <br /> Schoolhouse Ridge was a witness to the Battle of Harpers Ferry, September 12-15, 1862. Confederate Commander Stonewall Jackson occupied the position on Schoolhouse Ridge, along with three divisions comprising nearly 15,000 men, during the Battle of Harpers Ferry. During the night of September 14, Jackson staged a feign movement, starting on the north side of Schoolhouse Ridge, and directed toward the Union lines on Bolivar Heights. Jackson planned this as a diversion and then sent Confederate Commander A.P. Hill's men to the far southern edge of Schoolhouse Ridge and Hill launched a successful flanking maneuver along the Shenandoah River which forced the Union surrender. The informal surrender of the Union occurred on Schoolhouse Ridge when Jackson met Union commander Brig. Gen. Julius White to discuss terms.<br /> <br /> In recent history, Schoolhouse Ridge became the focus of battlefield preservationists from 1988 to 2004. The reason for this preservation movement was because it was being threatened by high density residential and commercial development in the fastest growing county in West Virginia, at that time. Most of the battlefield was protected through the efforts of the Civil War Trust, the National Park Trust, the Trust for Public Lands, and the Federal Government. The late Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) guaranteed the protection of Schoolhouse Ridge when he and the Congress expanded the park boundary in 2004.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/school-house-ridge-north-975428.htm#4/34.45/-98.53\">School House Ridge North Cultural Landscape</a></p>",

The bench at the overlook on the southern end of the trail is one of the few places in the park with a view of South Mountain. To access this location, you must drive to its small parking lot off of Millville Road. Don't be alarmed if you hear the sound of gunfire in this area. The indoor firing range of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection is nearby. </p> <p><br /> Schoolhouse Ridge is an often overlooked and least understood topographic feature associated with Harpers Ferry's Civil War history. Until the turn of the 21st century, very little of Schoolhouse Ridge was part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park.<br /> <br /> Schoolhouse Ridge is parallel to Bolivar Heights and crosses the northeastern end of the Shenandoah Valley, which stretched nearly two miles. The northern edge rests along the Potomac River and the southern end reaches the Shenandoah River. The ridge is named for a one-story stone school house that stood near the Harpers Ferry-Charles Town Turnpike. This school house proved a popular rendezvous point for prowling Confederate cavalry. The ridge also became a popular target for the Union long-range cannon on Maryland Heights. The school house was destroyed during the war, reportedly by shots from the Naval Battery and the 100-pounder Battery on Maryland Heights, which is nearly 2 miles distant! Cannon from Bolivar Heights also had easy range to Schoolhouse Ridge, hampering Confederate movements anytime they reached this point.<br /> <br /> Schoolhouse Ridge was a witness to the Battle of Harpers Ferry, September 12-15, 1862. Confederate Commander Stonewall Jackson occupied the position on Schoolhouse Ridge, along with three divisions comprising nearly 15,000 men, during the Battle of Harpers Ferry. During the night of September 14, Jackson staged a feign movement, starting on the north side of Schoolhouse Ridge, and directed toward the Union lines on Bolivar Heights. Jackson planned this as a diversion and then sent Confederate Commander A.P. Hill's men to the far southern edge of Schoolhouse Ridge and Hill launched a successful flanking maneuver along the Shenandoah River which forced the Union surrender. The informal surrender of the Union occurred on Schoolhouse Ridge when Jackson met Union commander Brig. Gen. Julius White to discuss terms.<br /> <br /> In recent history, Schoolhouse Ridge became the focus of battlefield preservationists from 1988 to 2004. The reason for this preservation movement was because it was being threatened by high density residential and commercial development in the fastest growing county in West Virginia, at that time. Most of the battlefield was protected through the efforts of the Civil War Trust, the National Park Trust, the Trust for Public Lands, and the Federal Government. The late Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV) guaranteed the protection of Schoolhouse Ridge when he and the Congress expanded the park boundary in 2004.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Following the Civil War there were over 30,000 newly freed slaves in the Shenandoah Valley. Recognizing the need for education, the Freedmen’s Bureau, the Freewill Baptists of New England and John Storer came together and Storer College was born. The school survived for 88 years, enriching the lives of hundreds of students.<br /> <br /> Of the four million people freed by the 13th Amendment at the end of the Civil War, most wanted two things—find family members and get an education. A small school in Harpers Ferry soon became a shining example of educational outreach and accomplishment. What began as a one-room missionary school for former slaves grew into a college open to both sexes and all races. <br /> <br /> The driving force behind the mission school was Nathan Brackett. With his wife and four teachers, all possessed with boundless energy and missionary zeal, and Lockwood House as a base of operations, Brackett set up primary schools throughout the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. By 1867 Brackett supervised 16 teachers and schools for 2,500 students in the Shenandoah Valley.</p> <p>The mission grew despite some stiff local resistance. White people tried everything from mob violence to vandalism and slanderous newspaper articles to pulling political strings to shut down the schools. One teacher wrote, “It is unusual for me to go to the post office without being hooted at and twice I have been stoned on the streets at noonday.” Nothing seemed to stop the teachers and their students from going forward. Fifty years later Nathan Brackett’s daughter, also a teacher, said, “Though storms of misunderstanding might rage outside the gate, within the campus all was calm and quiet. It was a little heaven.”</p>   <h4>A New Beginning</h4> <p>The Freewill Baptist mission school in Harpers Ferry came to the attention of John Storer, a wealthy businessman in Maine. Storer offered a $10,000 matching grant to the Freewill Baptists. An intense effort to raise donations, mortgage assets and seek government funds added up to $10,000 the day before Storer’s offer expired. <br /> <br /> Storer College created a safe place for education in a world where none had existed before. It was a place to learn to read and write, to teach others, and to develop marketable skills. By 1869 the college expanded across Camp Hill in Harpers Ferry and added three more government buildings. Fundraising slowly resulted in more campus buildings as enrollment grew and African American teachers and ministers joined the faculty. <br /> <br /> Of all the benefits that Storer provided to its students, perhaps the most valuable was a sense of community. The college owned land in and around the town and profited from a summer boarding house business. By leveraging funds and selling surplus property to graduates and their families, Storer College enabled 75% of Harpers Ferry’s black citizens to own real estate. In 1892 the school newspaper declared, “When the time comes that the colored people of the South live in their own houses, cultivate their own farms, and read their own ballots, there will no longer be a race problem.” Another valuable sense of community extended far beyond physical property. As one former student put it, “Here you will gain new understanding of community living and of friendships.”<br /> <br /> Students’ children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren found a haven of hope in the dark days of segregation. Graduates left Storer with the education, training, and perhaps most importantly, a sense of self-worth to make their way in an unsympathetic society.</p> <h4>The End</h4> <p>In 1954, the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board decision ended segregation in public schools. The next year West Virginia’s Board of Education recommended ending the $20,000 annual stipend for Storer. The board preferred to support state sponsored schools that were centrally located with modern buildings and more students, and without debt and religious overtones. Finally, Storer College closed its doors in 1955. The school had provided an education to more than 7,000 students.<br /> <br /> It’s hard to convey the immense effort it took to open, grow and sustain Storer College for nearly 90 years. Storer is a heroic story of overcoming seemingly insurmountable problems, and it is a testament to the courage, faith, vision and hard work of its founders, administrators, students, alumni and supporters.</p> <h4>The Legacy of Storer College</h4> <p>A very small school started in 1865 with a straightforward mission: to provide an education to former slaves. For 25 years Storer College was the only school in West Virginia where any person of color could get an education beyond the primary level. In a quiet though important way, Storer symbolized something seldom seen today; the epitome of selflessness and a willingness to sacrifice for the benefit of mankind. The students and staff embodied the Storer College motto:<br /> <i></i></p> <p><i>Labor Omnia Vincit</i><br /> (Work Conquers All)</p>",

In 1859 there were 100,000 weapons stored in the arsenal buildings, which played a role in the John Brown raids. Brown intended to use firearms seized at Harpers Ferry to commence a war to end slavery, but failed to do so. Sixteen months later, at the outbreak of the Civil War, only 15,000 weapons were stored at Harpers Ferry. The years between John Brown's raid and the Civil War, the majority of the arms at the United State Arsenal were distributed to Southern states under the instruction of Secretary of War John B. Floyd, a politician who was loyal to Southern interests.<br /> <br /> When Virginia seceded from the Union, in 1861, Governor John Letcher ordered the Virginia militia to seize the armory and arsenal at Harpers Ferry. Captain Turner Ashby led the militia towards Harpers Ferry and once they were close they could hear an explosion. The two arsenal buildings were set ablaze by the retreating Union forces, under Lt. Roger Jones command, and 15,000 weapons were destroyed.<br /> <br /> Close to 100 years after the Civil War, the National Park Service's archeologists discovered the original foundations of the two arsenal buildings, which buried for generations. They also found thousands of pieces of burned weapons, which included melted and twisted barrels, bayonets, ramrods, and lock plates. Today the arsenal ruins are outlined to attain a better understanding of their role in Harpers Ferry's history.</p>",

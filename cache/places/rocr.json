    "audioDescription": "(401 words)<br />Battleground National Cemetery is located in the Brightwood neighborhood of Washington, DC. The one-acre park is on the east side of Georgia Avenue, NW between Whittier place to the north and Van Buren street to the south.<br />The Cemetery sits on a terrace approximately five feet above street level. A bluestone wall along the front edge is separated by two sets of three steps that lead up to a wrought-iron black gate at the Cemetery entrance. Set atop stone pillars on either side of the entrance are two six-foot long black cannons, one pointing north and one pointing south. On the face of the columns are black signs in the shape of a shield that both read in white: U.S. National Cemetery.<br />To the right from the front entrance is a two-story red stone building with brown shutters and a gabled roof. A porch extends out on the west side of the building.<br />Directly back and to the east seventy feet from the entrance is a central flagpole, surrounded by forty-one marble headstones. Behind them and the east end of the Cemetery stands a white marble pavilion with four granite pillars.<br />To the left from the entrance and set in a row across the lawn about six feet from the front edge of the cemetery are four granite monuments, each between six and eleven-feet tall. Facing the four monuments, second from the right is a nine-foot tall gray granite obelisk, about two feet wide on each side, with a rounded top that meets at a point. A cross is sculpted at the top of each of the four sides. Below on the front is inscribed:<br />In Memory of Our Comrades Killed and Wounded in Battle on This Field<br />July 11th & 12th 1864<br />Below is a one by two-foot bronze plaque of the Pennsylvania State Seal, showing two horses with their front hooves raised up along the sides of a crest featuring a ship in the middle and an eagle standing on top.

    "bodyText": "The land that became Walter Pierce Park was once the location of two cemeteries. One, The Friends' Burying Ground, was a Quaker cemetery which operated between 1807 and 1890. The other was much larger and was known as the Mt. Pleasant Plains Cemetery. This cemetery was owned and operated between 1870 and 1890 by the Colored Union Benevolent Association.<br /> <br /> After 1890 some of the land was purchased and folded into what would become the Smithsonian Zoological Park and Rock Creek Park. In the 1950s the remaining acreage was slated for high-rise apartment buildings by developers. Though the land was graded and prepared for the construction, the project was abandoned. Residents of the Adams Morgan neighborhood petitioned the city to have the remaining acres turned into a park in the 1980s.<br /> <br /> Though residents had been told that all of the graves had been relocated and removed from the land, there was evidence that this was not the case. In 2005, more intense assessments were done on the park land and intact burials were discovered. Non-invasive means--like ground penetrating radar studies--were conducted to locate the graves. Documentary research revealed the names of those buried at the site. <br /> <br /> Additional information can be found from the grassroots group conducting the research: <a href=\"https://walterpierceparkcemeteries.org/\">The Walter Pierce Park Cemeteries | Commemorating the African American and Quaker Cemeteries at Walter Pierce Park in Washington, DC</a>",

The battle, which lasted two days (July 11-12, 1864) marked the defeat of General Jubal A. Early's Confederate campaign to launch an offensive action against the nation's capital.</p> <p>The Battle of Fort Stevens also gained notoriety as being the only military action in which the commander-in-chief, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">President Abraham Lincoln</a>, came under direct fire from the enemy. With a combined total casualty figure of over 900 killed or wounded during the engagement, 40 of the Union soldiers who fought and died bravely in defense of the capital. Four civilians related to the cemetery's first caretaker were buried after the Civil War. A veteran of the battle was interred in 1936, closing the cemetery to future burials. </p> <p>Battleground National Cemetery, located one-half mile north of Fort Stevens, is one acre in size, and one of our nation's smallest national cemeteries. The entrance to the Cemetery is flanked by two <span style=\"font-size: 14.6666669845581px;\">Civil War vintage</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> 6-pounder, smoothbore guns.

This poem, as well as the words of the Gettysburg Address in bronze found on the side of the caretaker's lodge, are reminiscent of many national cemeteries.</p> <p><span>The center of the cemetery is marked by a central flagpole, surrounded by 41 regulation marble headstones, marking the remains of the honored dead of Fort Stevens.

The one-acre park is on the east side of Georgia avenue, NW between Whittier place to the north and Van Buren street to the south.<br />The Cemetery sits on a terrace approximately five feet above street level. A bluestone wall along the front edge is separated by two sets of three steps that lead up to a wrought-iron black gate at the Cemetery entrance. Set atop stone pillars on either side of the entrance are two six-foot long black cannons, one pointing north and one pointing south. On the face of the columns are black signs in the shape of a shield that both read in white: U.S. National Cemetery. To the left about six feet from the front edge of the cemetery and set in a row across the lawn are four granite monuments, each between six and eleven-feet tall. To the right is a two-story red stone building with brown shutters and a gabled roof. A porch extends out on the west side of the building. The northwest corner of the building features a three by one-foot bronze plaque engraved with the Gettysburg Address. The entrance walkway is lined with two black signs on stakes on the left side and on the right two waysides about two by three feet each. Directly back seventy feet from the entrance is a central flagpole, surrounded by forty-one marble headstones. Forty-foot tall shade trees are set on the east and west sides of the flagpole area. Further to the east behind the flagpole is a marble rostrum. Raised at a three-step elevation, the structure spans thirty feet across, twelve feet deep, and features eight white columns, four in the front, and four in the back that have a marble block wall running between them.

It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br /> But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate - we can not hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. </p>",

A grassy hillside on the left of the road goes back about two hundred feet before turning to tall grass and heavy brush. A two by three-foot wayside sits about twenty feet off the road.<br />The wayside is a light tan color and in poor condition, faded badly and barely readable. Titled Blagden Mill across the top, it features text on the left side and on the right, a picture of a two-story house sitting to the left of a creek.<br />The text reads:<br />This is the site where Blagden and Argyle mills once stood, two of the twenty-six mills that once flourished along Rock Creek. If you look close, you can still see part of the millrace and the mill road. The exact date of the construction of these mills is unknown, but the mills were in operation during the early 1800's. Stones used in the construction of the mill were quarried on the east bank of the Rock Creek Valley across from the mill. Thomas Blagden, a prominent Washington businessman owned the mills from the 1820's until 1889. Blagden's Mill, a 2 1/2 story structure, contained three millstones for grinding wheat, rye, and corn. Argyle, a smaller mill, ground animal bones for the production of fertilizer. The mills ceased operations in 1889. The millseat was forty-seven miles across and on it were located the mansion of Thomas Blagden, a smaller house for the miller, icehouse, barn, carriage house, and other assorted structures.<br />Across Beach Drive, and beyond about ten feet, the land slopes down into a creek that runs gently from left to right. Directly across the creek are ruins consisting of a seven-foot tall by four-foot wide stone pillar that supports a twenty-foot long wooden beam that connects into the hillside to the right.<br />Another fifty yards up the creek to the left and on its opposite side from where you stand, is a stone structure about twenty-feet tall and forty-feet across, situated at the bank of the creek. Also, on this side of the road on which you stand is a roughly 200-foot-wide open grassy area with picnic table and forty-foot tall tree.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(613 words)<br />Bryce Park is an urban triangle park located in the Cathedral Heights neighborhood of Washington, DC. The park is formed by the intersection of Massachusetts Ave., Wisconsin Ave. and Garfield St., NW, and is situated across Massachusetts Ave, NW to the southwest from the Washington National Cathedral. Crosswalks provide pedestrian access at each of the corners of the park, and sidewalks run along the streets on each side.<br />The area is generally busy, with frequent heavy traffic on all bordering streets. The park contains trees and pathways with benches throughout and consists of three tiered plaza areas.<br />Beginning at the southeast corner, a fifteen-foot-wide, thirteen-step cement staircase leads up from the sidewalk, past a fifteen foot tall bush and twenty-foot tall tree on the left and shorter bushes along the ground to the right, to the first plaza level.<br />The first level is an egg shaped plaza, with a cement walkway around the edge of an egg shaped grassy area that is thirty by sixty feet at the widest point. There are two ten to fifteen-foot deciduous trees and one 6-foot tall evergreen bush in the grass. The plaza is surrounded by thirty-foot trees and provides a nice shaded area. Nine benches arc around the north side of the plaza and 10 line the south side. To the northwest, another cement staircase of ten steps leads up to the middle plaza.<br />On the second level, a five-foot tall curved wall of thin stone slabs arcs around the west side of the plaza, running about 70 to 90 feet across. Stairs at each end of the wall lead to the upper level of the park. A two-foot-wide garden area runs along the top of the wall and beyond that is a two-foot high black metal fence. Plants hang over the left side of the wall. Set into the wall near the center top is a three by two-foot bronze plaque. Raised text in gold lettering reads:<br />BRYCE PARK<br />Dedicated to<br />James Bryce<br />Viscount Bryce of Dechmont, O.M.<br />British Ambassador to<br />the United States of America<br />1907-1913<br />Author - Diplomat - Scholar<br />He Delighted<br />in the Parks of Washington<br />About twenty feet to the right is an oblong plaza area, about fifty by ninety feet and featuring two round grass lawn areas, one twenty feet and one thirty feet wide, overlapping slightly to create a figure eight. A five-foot-tall tree sits in the smaller grass area. The plaza is surrounded by benches. Staircases of 11 steps at the northwest corner of the plaza and 12 steps at the right end of the wall lead to the upper level of the park.<br />On the west side of the middle plaza, between two benches which are between the middle and right-hand staircases, is a water fountain.<br />The top-level sits along Wisconsin Avenue at the west edge of the park. A round plaza fills the southwest corner of the park, where a ten foot wide flagstone path surrounds a circle of grass about thirty feet wide.<br />A plaque set in the grass patch at the base of a tall tree reads:<br />Little-Leaf Linden<br />Tilia Cordata<br />Planted on July 11, 1968 in recognition<br />of<br />Mrs. James H. Rowe, Jr.<br />National Capital Planning Commission<br />Appointed May 8, 1961<br />By Pres. John F. Kennedy<br />Chairman Nov. 9, 1961 - July 11, 1968<br />Five benches line the outer edge of the flagstone path on the southwest side. One long semicircular bench curves around the inside edge of the path.<br />A curving ten-foot wide path runs from the top of the northmost staircase towards the northwest corner of the park. A fifteen-foot-long bench, overhung by ten-foot-tall bushes, runs along the north side of the path.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(489 words)<br />The cascades fountain is located at the south end of Meridian Hill Park, in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, DC and runs from north to south from the upper to lower levels of the park. The park is bordered by 15th, 16th, W, and Euclid streets NW, and sits on a prominent hill one and one-half miles (2.5 kilometers) due north of the White House.<br />From the intersection of 16th Street and W streets, NW, proceed north on the east side of 16th street about one hundred feet (30 meters). Turn right into the park entrance and proceed about 150 feet to the east and you will be at the south end of the cascades fountain.<br />The fountain consists of a concrete structure from which water falls vertically about fifty feet from north to south, down thirteen stepped and linked water basins, each about twelve by sixteen by two feet deep, into a pool below. A plaza and rectangular reflecting pool sit to the south.<br />Sets of stairs on either side lead down along the fountain cascades from the upper level of Meridian Hill park. Running east to west across the park just above the cascade fountain is a tall retaining wall. Set into the center of the wall is a fountain in an arched alcove. Water from the fountain falls over two levels to a pool. Two rectangular alcoves on either side also feature waterspouts that feed into the pool. Between the pool and the top level of the cascade fountain is a concrete pedestrian walkway, made of the same concrete as the retaining wall and fountains.<br />The cascades are bracketed by ten-foot wide cement stairs on either side. The outer edges of the stairs are lined with trees. Short walls run between the fountain and each stairway. From the walkways the wall appears 1.5 feet tall, on the water side the wall is about 4 feet tall. he outer walls of the walkway are about 3 feet tall and are set with benches at various points down the cascade. Curved staircases feed into the walkways from outer grass lawn areas that sit on the other side of the tree lines.<br />On the walls that run between the stairs and fountain, near the bottom of the cascade, are bearded faces with curved horns. The faces are located on the sides of the walls facing the fountain, two on each wall for a total of four. Water flows from their mouths into the bottom step of the cascade, just above the pool at the bottom. The pool at the bottom of the cascades is about 75 feet wide. The waterfall from the last of the 13 steps to the basin is about 4 or 5 feet.<br />At the level of the bottom step of the cascade, the staircases flanking the cascades turn outward. Below each staircase, facing the basin, is a low archway framing an additional small fountain.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "Conduit Road School is a 19th-century one-room school house originally built in 1864 and re-built in 1874.<br /> <br /> The school served the Palisades community until 1928.<br /> <br /> Miss E.N. Bevard was appointed as teacher in 1890 and served the school for many years. She was a popular teacher and seven months after her appointment to the school, her students led a campaign to try and help her win the Sunday Herald's free European vacation for the city's most popular teacher. In June her students submitted almost 1200 votes to put her in the lead compared to other city teachers. Unfortunately, by July she had fallen into fourth place.<br /> <br /> The school was built with 1860s education standards in mind and had few amenities. In 1907, the school was blasted for not having a water supply. A female African-American \"janitress\" brought water for the children when she reported for duty in the mornings.<br /> <br /> Sometime between 1907 and 1928 a pump was installed, but the school was still far behind the quality of other area schools.<br /> <br /> By 1917 the school was openly called antiquated and considered an unacceptable facility for students. Suffering from over-crowding, Conduit Road School had four grade levels that were being taught in the one room.<br /> <br /> A 1920 article in the Evening Star was headlined \"D.C. School, Relic of Bygone Days, Menace to Pupils.\" <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\"<em>One-Room Shack poorly lighted and heated by ancient stoves.<br /> <br /> Within two miles of the thickly populated section of Washington there stands a picturesque old rural schoolhouse. which the youth of the are required to attend under the laws of the District. It is only one of the several old-fashioned types of buildings in the public school system. which were erected soon after the civil war and still are called I upon to accommodate the children of the nation's capital. When built, in 1874. a sign bearing the inscription. \"Public School.\" was placed on the front. Today the same sign remains on the building, but it is known to residents of the the children, and school as \"The Conduit Road School.\"<br /> <br /> The building is located on a government reservation on the heavily traveled Conduit road about a mile and a half from Georgetown. Despite its prominent situation, its existence is virtually unknown to a majority, of the residents of Washington.<br /> <br /> This school was considered a model in its day. but that was forty-seven years ago. It is a small, one-room frame structure, which boasts a single modern convenience, a telephone. The school has no lighting system. Its heating facilities consist of two old stoves, which are said to have been condemned years ago and referred to by the children as \"hard coal burners.\" The only time the stoves throw out sufficient heat to warm the small room, it is said, is on a warm day. The cold days of winter find the pupils shivering, and their teeth chattering.<br /> <br /> Unlike the more modern schools in the city limits, the Conduit Road School has no running water. When the pupils want a drink they are forced to go behind the schoolhouse and draw it from a pump. The pump, however, is a more recent innovation at the school. The children attending there about a decade ago were to depend on an old colored janitoress for their water supply. The colored woman brought the water to school with her each morning. Another quaint sign which greets a visitor at the school is a wash basin and soap in the cloakroom of the building. (The wash basin is clearly discernible in the accompanying Conforming with the old-fashioned ideas of school construction, the cloakroom of the school was built at the entrance. It has not been changed, except it is piled high with discarded schoolroom furniture, making it dangerous for the children to pass through to hang up hats and coats.<br /> <br /> In the building's lone room there are four classes, under one teacher, as in the days of yore. They consist of the first, second, third and fourth grades. Children promoted to higher grades are forced to attend the Reservoir School, about a mile from the Conduit Road School. The enrollment at this school today totals thirty-one, the smallest, in any school in the city. There are thirty-six seats in the school, making five vacant. It was pointed out, however, that if the school was larger and had facilities for pupils in higher grades its enrollment would increase. Children attending this school come from a radius of a mile and a half. <br /> <br /> When the school was built In 1874 It cost school officials $1,200. Since its erection there have been but few improvements. One of the improvements in recent years was the of the single room. This was done two years ago and was chronicled as one of the events in the school's history.\"</em></div> <br /> By 1927, plans were in the works to close the school. For a time, it was used as a branch of the public library.<br /> <br /> It was the last one-room school to be used in the district.<br /> <br /> <br /> The Palisades branch of the DC Library operated out of the former school until 1965 when the larger branch nearby opened. The structure had the potential to be demolished but it was saved by the Palisades Citizens Association. For the next 24 years, it was used as the Children's Museum of Washington.<br /> <br /> In 1989 it was used as a children's library and rented out by the Discovery Creek Children's Museum.<br /> <br /> Recently, plans have been made for the Palisades History Museum to use the space for exhibits, though extensive restoration work is needed.<br /> <br /> The facility remains closed to the public.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

After this, the structure was rehabilitated into a tea house or refreshment stand.  <br /> <br /> Park managers wanted to provide patrons of the Peirce Mill Tea House a pleasing sound and view scape, which they thought was best done through a cascade of water.<br /> <br /> The dam near Peirce Mill proved very popular with picnickers and visitors to the tea house. Unfortunately, the dam blocked the creek and prevented fish from spawning further upstream. <br /> <br /> After 100 years, the situation was remedied. A fish ladder was built on the East side of the dam to allow Herring, Shad and Alewife to get over the dam and access their traditional spawning grounds.  <br /> <br /> The dam is visible from the parking area at Picnic Grove #2 South along Beach Drive, as well as from the paved multi-use trail behind Peirce Mill.  <br />  ",

Water falls uniformly over the dam at an approximate six-foot drop as the creek continues south. On either side of the dam are walls of large boulders, about three by three feet each. The stone walls themselves are about six feet high from water level and thirty feet across.<br />On the east side of the creek a cement canal structure has been built. It features two cement walls spaced about three feet apart that make an s-curve as they angle away from the creek side and further into the creek. A forty-foot stone wall lines the creek bank from bottom to street level and Beach Drive above on this side.<br />A bike/walking path runs along-side the east side of the creek and is the easier location to access the dam.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Concrete could be used for purposes of economy but only if \"expressed honestly.\"   Albert H. Good used Devil's Chair Bridge as an example of this honest expression in his 1935 book <u>Park Structures and Facilities.</u> ",
    "audioDescription": "(221 words)<br />Devils Chair Bridge carries Rock Creek Trail over Rock Creek, east of the Georgetown neighborhood in Washington, DC.<br />Travel three hundred seventy-five yards (340 meters) north along Rock Creek Trail from Q street, NW. The trail turns to the right and becomes Devils Chair Bridge.<br />The bridge structure is a long, sweeping concrete arch measuring eighty-eight-feet (26 meters) long and ten-feet (3 meters) wide. Three-foot tall cement railings line both sides of the bridge. The bridge abutments underneath on both sides are made of blue stone.<br />The west side of the bridge is heavily wooded along Rock Creek and along a steep hillside that runs up to the west. On the east side of the bridge Rock Creek Trail turns to the left and continues north along the creek. A twenty-foot-wide strip of grass runs between the trail and Rock Creek Parkway to the east.<br />A trail at the west side the bridge leads to the west up steep steps that carry through thick woods up five hundred feet (152 meters) to Mount Zion Cemetery at the top of the hill. The dirt trail has many loose rocks and can be difficult to navigate. A fence about ten feet (3 meters) to the east borders a paved road that runs along the east edge of Oak Hill Cemetery to the right.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

The park is a striking example of one of the most important designs by landscape architect Beatrix Farrand. Mrs. Farrand is considered the “finest woman landscape architect of her generation.” The owners of the Dumbarton Oaks estate, Mildred and Robert Woods Bliss, wanted Mrs. Farrand to create for them an illusion of country life within the city. And, working closely with Mildred Bliss, Mrs. Farrand made the vision a reality.</span></p> <p><span>Today, there are two main divisions to the gardens at Dumbarton Oaks: the formal gardens owned and maintained by Harvard University; and the naturalistic garden that is Dumbarton Oaks Park. Mrs. Farrand intended for these two parts to be connected, a unified design where one can view the woodland of the park from the upper gardens. Over the past few years of close collaboration, the National Park Service and Dumbarton Oaks Gardens have come to share a commitment to revealing, once again, the vision of Mildred and Robert Bliss and Beatrix Farrand for the gardens of Dumbarton Oaks.</span></p>",

    "bodyText": "Reverend Sandy Alexander came to Georgetown to start a Baptist Church in 1856 after being freed from enslavement. Prior to this first organization, another man named Collins Williams held religious meetings in various private homes along 27th Street. On Reverend Alexander’s arrival in Georgetown, he found only two Baptists but quickly found converts and with a donation of land from Collins Williams, the congregation built a small frame structure and called it “The Ark” at 29th and O Streets.<br /> The church quickly outgrew it’s first building and in 1882 the present site was selected. Work on the church foundation was done at night by male members of the congregation while the women cooked hot dinners. Unfortunately, the work for the foundation exceeded the money they had raised for construction and the church sat incomplete for some time until Reverend Alexander took responsibility for seeing it completed and took out a loan. When the first payment for the loan for the church was paid, the receipt was written  out to \"First African Baptist Church.\" One of the Trustees refused the receipt and demanded it be written out to \"First Baptist Church.\" Trustee William Brown didn't want to see the congregation robbed of the honor of being the first church of the Baptist faith in Georgetown.   <br /> <br /> The church continues to serve the Georgetown community and is still an active church.",

DeRussy. Fort DeRussy was sited upon high ground on the west bank of Rock Creek to control movement along and across the valley. The fort coordinated its fire with Fort Stevens on the east and Fort Kearny on the west.

Altogether, Fort DeRussy had 11 guns and mortars which fired a total of 109 rounds to aid in the defense of Fort Stevens. Its 100-pounder Parrott rifle was the largest piece of artillery in the engagement, and was very effective in checking the Confederates' advance. It had a range that reached nearly all the way to Silver Spring, Maryland, and could destroy large bodies of troops.</p> <p>Fort DeRussy is in a good state of preservation. The parapet which consists of high earth mounds with openings where guns were mounted, and the deep ditch (dry moat) around the parapet, remain in clear and distinct outline. Also, there is visible evidence of where the powder magazines were located inside the fort. Near the fort, on the outside, well-defined rifle trenches extend in each direction.<br />  </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Fort Reno was originally named Fort Pennsylvania, and was built during the winter of 1861 shortly after the disastrous defeat of the Union Army at the First Battle of Manassas. Brig. Gen. John G. Barnard, Col. of Engineers, U.S. Army, was in charge of construction of the defenses around Washington. Barnard chose the location of Fort Reno for its strategic importance in guarding the Rockville Pike (present day Wisconsin Avenue). Being the highest elevation in the city (429 feet above sea level), Fort Reno also served as a forward outpost and signal station for detecting enemy movement near the northern part of the city.</p> <p>Constructed by the 119th Pennsylvania Regiment, the fort's name was later changed to Fort Reno in 1863 in memory of Major General Jesse Lee Reno, who was mortally wounded at the Battle of South Mountain, September 14, 1862. <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Originally rather small, Fort Reno was enlarged and strengthened with an advanced battery 300 yards north from the highest ridge, across from what is now Fessenden Street and along 39th Street. This advanced battery had eight 12-pounder guns and a magazine, a covered walkway connected it to the main fort to the south. A double line of rifle trenches was added to strengthen the position.</span></p> <p>Eventually, the fort was the largest and strongest of those defending the capital with a dozen heavy guns, three Parrott siege guns and nine 27-pounder barbette guns. A strength of three thousand men of the First Brigade made Fort Reno the stronghold of the northern defenses of the capital.</p> <p>In July 1864, due to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's insistence that troops be moved from the defenses to reinforce his army at Petersburg, Fort Reno was under-manned, as were all of the defenses around the city. Hearing from spies that the capital was poorly defended, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee sent Gen. Jubal A. Early to attack from the north. Around noon Monday, July 11, 1864 (before the Battle of Fort Stevens), Fort Reno was the first of the defenses to view Early's advance near Rockville, Maryland. The lookouts from the signal tower at Fort Reno saw clouds of dust, and then Confederate army wagons moving toward the city.</p> <p>During Early's assault of Fort Stevens on July 11th and 12th, 1864, the heavy guns of Fort Reno lent little support value, as there was a fear the long range guns would hit the Union Army's advanced pickets. One of the shells that was fired from Fort Reno by a 100-pounder Parrott Rifle traveled 3.5 miles north of the fort, killing four Confederates where the present day Bethesda Naval Hospital is located in Bethesda, Maryland. Due to Fort Stevens being reinforced on July 12, 1864, it was never taken by the Confederate army, nor was the capital city ever reached.</p> <p>During the fighting of July 10-12, 1864, small squadrons of soldiers from Forts Reno and Stevens had advanced into the countryside north of the city to fend off the invaders. A few Confederates were taken prisoner and brought back to camps where they were held until transfer to a central prison. Early's army retreated back across the Potomac River near Leesburg, Virginia, and Washington breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>After the close of the war, the forts (Reno included) were slowly dismantled and abandoned. Most of Fort Reno could be seen as late as 1892, but the fort and battery at the north end were eventually graded down for the construction of a water reservoir. Today the site is bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Fessenden Street, Belt Road, and Chesapeake Street, NW.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "(706 words)<br />Located in the middle of Fort Reno Park at the northwest corner of Nebraska Avenue and Chesapeake Streets, NW, in Tenleytown, Washington, DC is the highest point in the District of Columbia marker.<br />From Nebraska Avenue and Chesapeake streets, NW, travel west on Chesapeake about seven hundred twenty feet. To your right will be a dirt and gravel walking path. Travel north along the path five hundred feet, passing a four-foot tall, thirty square foot brown stage on the right at about mid-point. A three by four wayside sign will be on your right.<br />The sign has a light tan background and is titled at the top: Fort Reno. A map on the left side shows the diagram of a fort, with buildings, walls, and boundaries. A drawing at the top is titled: Battery Reno.<br />The right side shows a black and white image, presumed to be Major General Reno. The man is in a civil war uniform with full beard, and faces to the left. Beneath him is a sketch of an iron wire tower and is labeled Signal Tower at the bottom.<br />Text in the middle of the sign reads:<br />At 409 feet above sea level, this site is the highest point in Washington, D.C. It is no coincidence that in 1861, the Union army designed one of the largest and most heavily armed Civil War fortifications at this location.<br />Originally names \"Fort Pennsylvania,\" and renamed after Major General Jesse L. Reno, this site was the epicenter of the Union's northern defenses of Washington, D.C. With a commanding view of the surrounding countryside, Fort Reno presided over three major roads that converged at Tenleytown: River Road, Rockville Road (today Wisconsin Avenue NW, and Brookville Road (today Belt Road NW). Together with an attached artillery battery (Battery Reno), the fort's grounds stretched over 70 acres, including barracks, camps, and a parade ground.<br />During the July 1864 Confederate raid on Washington, D.C., Fort Reno's signal tower was the first to observance the advancing troops. The fort's 100-pounder Parrott rifle fired rounds 3.5 miles north, killing Confederate soldiers near present-day Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. After the war, the army abandoned Fort Reno. By the late 1800s, most traces of the fortifications were gone, making way for the creation of several reservoirs and later, residential development in the north. To the south and west of the fort, African Americans, including those who had helped construct Fort Reno and found refuge under its protection during the war, were joined by working class white residents to create Reno City. The distinct but segregated neighborhood was demolished for the creation of Fort Reno Park.<br />A three-inch black border along the bottom of the sign features a round plaque in the middle. Text on both sides reads:<br />The benchmark was placed by the Washington, D.C. Surveyors Association after surveying and establishing the highest natural ground of the District in 2007. The wayside and benchmark for the highpoint were made possible by the donations of the Highpointers Foundation in cooperation with the Highpointers Club.<br />Following the dedication ceremony in April 2008, the highpoint officially became known as Point Reno. The higher land behind the fenced area is man-made and, therefore, not the highest natural point.<br />The natural highpoint is marked with a benchmark just 180 feet north east of this sign. Can you find it?<br />Please visit the Ft. Reno homepage in the Rock Creek Park website, https://www.nps.gov/rocr/index.htm to learn more about the Foundation's education, support & conservation of the highest natural point in each of the 50 United States and Washington, D.C.<br />The bronze plaque has a triangle in its center with a + in the middle. Text around the plaque reads:<br />National Park Service<br />Highest Natural Elevation<br />In cooperation with the D.C. Association of Land Surveyors<br />Point Reno<br />Elev. 409 Ft.<br />2007<br />Washington D.C.<br />As you face the wayside sign, a second identical wayside is one hundred sixty feet east on a grassy hillside. From this location, the highest point marker is twenty-five feet east and set in the ground. The five-inch wide plaque is set in cement about seven-inches wide. A large fifty-foot tall oak tree will be sitting about fifty feet to the southeast from this location.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

The tower furthest to the right is about three hundred feet tall and resembles a castle, with its rounded stone face, pointed top, and a smaller stairwell tower connected to its left side.

    "bodyText": "<p>Fort Stevens, now partially restored, was built to defend the approaches to Washington from the 7th Street Pike (now Georgia Avenue) which was then the main thoroughfare from the north into Washington. Originally called Fort Massachusetts by the soldiers from that state who constructed the fort, it was later named after Brig. Gen. Isaac Ingalls Stevens, who was killed at the Battle of Chantilly (Ox Hill), Virginia, September 1, 1862.<br /> <br /> By the summer of 1864, the great bulk of Union troops in the east were engaged in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pete/index.htm\">siege operations around Petersburg, Virginia</a>. In fact, when Ulysses S. Grant moved south in the Spring of 1864, he stripped Washington, DC, of many well trained troops to add weight to his offensive. As a result, in July of 1864, there were only 9,000 troops to defend the city, down from over 23,000 the year before. Those that were left were primarily poorly trained reserves. Robert E. Lee was desperate to reduce the pressure on his forces around Petersburg, and so decided to send General Jubal A. Early and about 20,000 troops to strike at Washington which spies had reported was poorly defended.<br /> <br /> On June 12, Early began his march north from Petersburg and by July 9, was at Frederick, Maryland, where he demanded and received $200,000 to spare the city. On the same day, Early <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mono/index.htm\">defeated Union Gen. Lew Wallace at the Monocacy River</a>. In the light of later events, Wallace's defeat after a stubborn fight became a victory for the Union because he was able to delay Early's advance for a day. On July 10, Early encamped at Rockville, Maryland, only 10 miles from Fort Stevens.<br /> <br /> Reacting to this threat to Washington, Grant ordering the 1st and d 2nd Divisions of the 6th Corps and part of 19th Corps to the capital on July 7. The veteran units reached Fort Stevens arrived off the Potomac River around noon on July 11 as Jubal Early's lead elements advanced toward the capital.<br /> <br /> Over the following several days, Early probed Fort Stevens and its environs but never mounted a full-scale attack. Union reinforcements had reached Washington and Fort Stevens just in time.<br /> <br /> Located atop the parapet of Fort Stevens is a commemorative stone dedicated to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">Abraham Lincoln</a>. On July 12, 1864, the President stood atop the parapet to observe the fighting and came under fire from Confederate sharpshooters. It is the only time in American history in which a sitting president came under direct fire from an enemy combatant.<br /> <br /> In the years to come, many individuals would claim the honor of advising the President Lincoln to come down from the parapet. The most notable was a young officer named Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. His remarks to the president were short and straightforward: \"Get down, you damn fool!\" Holmes would eventually serve as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902-1932.<br /> <br /> Each year, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cwdw/planyourvisit/anniversary-of-the-battle-of-fort-stevens.htm\">anniversary of the Battle of Fort Stevens</a> is commemorated with special programs, living history, and more.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(632 words)<br />Fort Stevens is located in the northern corner of Washington, DC, within the center of a block bordered by 13th Street, NW to the west, Georgia Avenue to the east, Rittenhouse Street to the north, and Quakenbos Street to the south.<br />The park area rises about thirty feet from street level at the northwest corner of 13th and Rittenhouse streets to the eastern end where the fort is situated. A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location. Lined in front to the north are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four feet tall. One six-foot tall hill to the west of the flagpole has a white wooden double-sided door on its face.<br />A cement bunker wall with vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with seven three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons set on cement platforms and directed out to the north.<br />About thirty feet behind and six feet to the right of the right cannon sits a two by three-foot wayside. The sign is titled in black letters in the upper left corner: Fort Stevens.<br />The left two thirds of the sign feature a color painting of a battle scene. Men in blue military uniforms stand in a fort on a hilltop around a cannon set on a wheeled turret. A man standing above in the top left corner wears a long black suit coat and black top hat. Below him a man holds an American flag. Two men carry a wounded soldier below, a man runs with a raised right arm and hand, and a man to the right stands while holding a white flag with a red and blue cross. A quote above the image reads: \"We haven't taken Washington, but we scared Abe Lincoln like hell!\" The quote is attributed to General Jubal Early.<br />Text in the bottom right reads:<br />Illustration of President Lincoln on the parapet of Fort Stevens<br />Text below describes the battle that took place at Fort Stevens:<br />Built between 1861-1863 this structure was originally called Fort Massachusetts and guarded the northern defenses of the nation's capital during the Civil War. On July 11-12, 1864 Fort Stevens defended the city from a Confederate attack under the command of General Jubal Anderson Early. During the battle, President Abraham Lincoln came under direct fire from Confederate sharpshooters while he witnessed the battle from the parapet of the fort. The Battle of Fort Stevens marks the only time in American history that a seated President came under fire from an enemy combatant during a time of war.<br />Fort Stevens was named after General Isaac Ingalls Stevens. General Stevens was killed on September 2, 1862 during the Battle of Chantilly, Virginia.<br />You can download a podcast of Fort Stevens at www.nps.com/rocr<br />The right third of the sign is a white panel. In the top left is a sketch of an older African American woman, sitting with a slight smile and hands clasped. Text to her right reads:<br />In order to construct Fort Stevens, the home of the original property owner, Elizabeth Thomas, was destroyed.<br />To the right is a QR code to scan for additional information about the Battle of Fort Stevens.<br />Below is a black and white image of about forty military soldiers posing in a fort for the camera To the right men stand among two cannons, and another four cannons line the fort behind them from a raised platform, pointed out over the tops of the forts walls. About twenty more soldiers stand and kneel on the left by a flagpole and amongst piles of cannonballs. Text beneath them reads:<br />3rd Massachusetts Heavy Artillery at Fort Stevens 1865<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>By the 1890s, Union veterans, civic leaders, and community members desired to preserve the remnants of the Defenses of Washington. The earthen citadels that encircled the capital had long been abandoned by Federal soldiers. Peace, posterity, and the ploughshare returned much of the landscape to its pre-war condition, including Fort Stevens, site of the famed battle in July 1864. Early preservation efforts included the installation of a sign marking the spot where President Abraham Lincoln was under fire on July 12, 1864.<br /> <br /> Fort Stevens' eroding earthworks were a lasting testament to the Defenses of Washington as the Brightwood neighborhood developed around it. <br /> <br /> As part of the McMillan Plan, a comprehensive planning document for the development of the monumental core and the park system of Washington, D.C (first written in 1902 by the Senate Park Commission), the proposed Fort Drive Parkway consisted of \"a new drive-way through the suburbs of Washington to be called 'Fort Drive,' and include in its winding ways some of the most important of the fortifications which served as the Defenses of Washington during the rebellion . . .\"<br /> <br /> Rapid urban expansion and budget restraints, including the First World War and Great Depression, affected the full development of the parkway; however the Federal government was able to acquire most of the Fort Drive right-of-way between 1929 and 1932, and the forts/batteries managed by the National Park Service today.<br /> <br /> In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) accomplished a great deal of work on the fort parks. The CCC established nine camps in the Washington D.C. area, including one, established on October 23, 1933, at Fort Dupont Park. The CCC activities at Fort Dupont included erecting buildings for workers to live and eat in, cleaning up foot and horse trails, performing minor road construction, putting in a sewer, and constructing a two-car garage, carpenter shop, and toilet room. The CCC also performed \"forest protection,\" including cleaning up dead and fallen lumber, burning brush, grubbing stumps, cleaning up the dump, and disposing of trash at forts Stanton, Bunker Hill and Mahan, and doing general cleanup at forts Totten and Foote. At Fort Stevens, the CCC undertook a restoration, reconstruction, and landscape project; costing $25,000. The workers rebuilt the western portion of the fort parapet, using cement \"falsies,\" as one author called them, \"instead of logs and planks,\" because they would last longer.<br /> <br /> The work at Fort Stevens was completed in 1938. It was the only fortification restoration project. Today, Fort Stevens Park is managed by the National Park Service (Rock Creek Park).</p>",

The park area rises about thirty feet from street level at 13th and Rittenhouse Streets about two hundred yards to the eastern end where the fort is situated. A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location.<br />Lined in front, to the north of the flagpole are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four feet tall. One eight-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face. The bunker measures sixty feet across and twenty feet deep. The white door is about seven feet tall and six feet wide and has three metal brackets on the outer sides of each door. The doors overlap in the center. It is set on a cement base that appears to run back into the hill.<br />A cement bunker wall with three-inch-wide log-like vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with seven three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons on wheels, set on cement platforms and directed out to the north. Five additional cement platforms are set on about three-foot tall grass mounds that lead up to the cement wall.<br />About six feet left of the left cannon, sitting on grass just beyond the cement bunker wall is a stone marker with a bronze plaque displayed on its face. The stone is about five feet tall, four feet wide, and two feet deep. The plaque measures about one and a half feet high by two feet wide. It features a bas-relief and is engraved across the top to read:<br />LINCOLN UNDER FIRE AT FORT STEVENS<br />July 12, 1864<br />The image below is a bas-relief of a man in the center with top hat and long suit coat tending to a wounded man on the right falling with his head thrown back. Another man tries to pull the man in top hat away from the left.

A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location.<br />Lined in front to the east of the flagpole are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four feet tall. One eight-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face. The bunker measures sixty feet across and twenty feet deep. The white door is about seven feet tall and six feet wide and has three metal brackets on the outer sides of each door. The doors overlap in the center. It is set on a cement base that appears to run back into the hill.<br />A cement bunker wall with wood-log designed vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards (90 meters) across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with six three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons set on cement platforms and directed out to the north.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

It was located in Washington about three miles north of the Capitol, close to Silver Spring, Maryland.<br /> <br /> The fort mounted 20 guns and mortars, including eight 32-pounders. The fort's 100-pounder Parrott rifle provided long-range support to Fort Stevens during Confederate General Jubal A. Early's attack on that fort on July 11 and 12, 1864. Fort Totten was name in honor of Brig. Gen. Joseph G. Totten, Chief Engineer U.S. Army. </p>",

    "audioDescription": "(2016 words)Francis Scott Key Park is located in the southwest corner of the intersection of M street and 34th street, NW in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, DC. The three-fourths of an acre park is adjacent to the northeast corner of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and the park abuts the C&O Canal towpath to the south.Situated at the corner of 34th and M street, is a six-foot long, two-foot tall cement dedication sign set in a flowerbed along the sidewalk.A twelve-foot (3.5 meter) wide, thirty-five-foot (10.5 meter) long brick walkway leads into the park from left of the sign and flowerbed.Inside the park area is a fifty-foot (15 meter) wide circular brick plaza set under a pergola with fourteen limestone columns and draped in wisteria. Twisted vine branches climb the pergola columns under this shaded area. A bed of lily turf sits outside the plaza area and runs back to the sidewalk on the north end. To the right a two-foot tall brick wall rings the outer edge of the plaza. To the left in the plaza are three, three-by-four-foot wayside signs.On the opposite side of the plaza from the walkway entrance, sits a three-foot tall bronze bust statue set atop a four-foot tall oval cement pillar. The bust shows Key in a suit jacket with bow tie and high-collard coat. A one-by-four-inch bronze plaque is set on the center front top of the cement pedestal, directly in from of the bust.Facing the statue, a staircase to the left leads down to the C&O Canal towpath below. Behind the statue a brick walkway runs ninety feet (27 meters) west to the sidewalk at the Key Bridge. A flagpole sits to the left of the walkway at the exit point. Benches are set along the walkway's opposite side. A separate asphalt walkway leads from the left of this exit and runs downhill, behind the park and to the C&O Canal to the south below.Facing the three waysides, the furthest to the right is titled in the top right corner:Francis Scott Key*1779-1843*At the top left of the text below, is a one-inch black and white image of Key in suit and white bow tie. The text describes Key's time living at this location, his dealings with British troops, and the writing of a poem that would become our National Anthem:The author of our National Anthem was a lawyer, patriot, community leader and amateur poet. His home and law office stood approximately 100 yards west of here. Francis Scott Key lived there from 1803 to about 1833 with his wife, the former Mary Tayloe Lloyd of Annapolis, Maryland, and their six sons and five daughters. The house was demolished in 1947 after years of neglect by various owners.During the War of 1812, British Troops had invaded and captured Washington in August of 1814. They set fire to the Capitol, the White House and most Federal buildings. As they withdrew to their ships they took Dr. William Beanes prisoner because he had arrested some stragglers among the British troops for looting.The popular and respected 335-year-old George Town lawyer, Francis Scott Key, came to the aid of friends seeking Dr. Beanes' release. Under a flag of truce approved by President James Madison, Key set sail with Colonel John Stuart Skinner, and American agent for prisoner exchange. They located the British fleet and boarded Admiral Cochrane's Royal Naval Flagship. Key successfully argues for Dr. Beane's release.However, lest they reveal the British plans to attack Fort McHenry and Baltimore, they were detained under guard aboard their ship. Throughout the night of September 13-14, 1814 Key stood on deck watching the bombardment of Ft. McHenry. At dawn Key's anxiety was relieved. Our flag was still there! Key began to compose a poem on the back of a letter.After his release following the British defeat, Key continued work on his poem. On the next day, he showed it to a relative, Joseph Hopper Nicholson, a Fort McHenry defender. Nicholson was so moved he immediately had a broadside of the poem printed and circulated. That poem became The Star-Spangled Banner.Francis Scott Key's law practice continued to flourish. He was three times appointed to the post of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. He was active in anti-slavery causes, advocated the establishment of public schools, negotiated a treaty in 1833 between the Creek Indians and settlers in Alabama, and was a vestryman of St. John's Church as well as a founder of Christ Church in George Town. On a trip to Baltimore in 1843, Francis Scott Key died of pneumonia on January 11 at the home of his eldest daughter, Mrs. Charles Howard. He is buried at Mt. Olivet Cemetery near his birthplace in Frederick, Maryland.The high standards which guided Francis Scott Key's life continue to be an example to all Americans.The right side of the sign features an image of a man in suit, coat, and white knickers, standing atop steps on a ship's railing and looking out at the sea as another man with hat and staff in his right hand looks on from the bottom of the steps. A young boy on the left also looks",

    "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Georgetown Waterfront Park, stretching along the banks of the Potomac River from 31st Street, NW to the Key Bridge, was completed in the fall of 2011. The park links 225 miles of parkland along the Potomac River stretching from Cumberland, Maryland, to Mount Vernon, Virginia. The park is beloved by many due to its notable design elements like the labyrinth, beautiful fountain (seasonal, open \"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/rocr/planyourvisit/conditions.htm\">Alerts</a>\" at top of page for status), and charming rain gardens. Visitors come to the park to enjoy quiet contemplation or to take advantage of the large accessible pathways to exercise and recreate. Cyclists, skaters, and pedestrians have a designated pathway (free of cars) allowing them to enjoy views of individual boaters, kayakers, and competitive crews, as well as of Theodore Roosevelt Island, Key Bridge, and the Potomac River. The park has many unique design features including:  </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/waterfront-park-labyrinth.htm\">Labyrinth</a></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Looking for peace of mind? You might find it in the labyrinth at the western end of the park. Labyrinths date back to ancient times. Geometric turns are meant to encourage contemplation as you slowly travel from the outer edge into the center. To get the most out of the walk, focus on quieting your mind and disconnecting with the chaos of the outside world.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/waterfront-park-and-percy-plaza.htm\">Fountain</a><strong style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> </strong>(seasonal, open \"Alerts\" at top of page for status)</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The centerpiece of the park is the fountain found at the waterfront intersection of Wisconsin Avenue, NW, and K Street. People of all ages enjoy splashing and playing in the water on hot summer days.</p> <p><strong style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">River Steps and Pergola</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">These steps were originally created with rowing regattas in mind. In addition to providing finish line seating for rowing events, the steps are a popular year-round place to picnic while viewing the river, birds, other wildlife, and boaters. More seating can be found beneath the tall steel and cable pergola, designed as a call back to the waterfront’s more industrial past.</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The waterfront was once a dynamic center of commerce and trade, especially for tobacco. But by the 1820s, larger ships could no longer access the river due to the build-up of silt. Factories like the American Ice Company and the Brennan Construction Company transformed the waterfront port into an industrial landscape. The area became a transportation route when the construction was completed for nearby Key Bridge and the Whitehurst Freeway. As a result of this new shift,  the once booming factories began to relocate or close, and much of the waterfront was converted into parking lots.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Today, the Georgetown Waterfront Park preserves public open space and the waterfront’s history.</span></p> <p><strong style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Rain Gardens</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The rain gardens are located at the intersection of the paths that cross the park. Rain gardens collect and hold rainwater and storm water runoff, so it can soak into the ground instead of flowing into storm drains or along the surface of the land. Rain gardens help prevent erosion, water pollution, and flooding.</p> <p><strong style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Bio-Edge</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Looking at the edge of the waterfront, you will see a living bank where a crumbling concrete retaining wall used to be. Instead of simply repairing the beat-up bulkhead from the industrial era, the National Park Service added soil and native plants. This greener solution was engineered to stabilize the bank, create a habitat for wildlife, and filter rainwater as it flows from the park to the river.</p> <p><strong>Pollinator Gardens</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Can you imagine a world without flowers? Over 75% of the Earth’s flowering plants depend on pollinators for reproduction. Despite their importance, studies show that pollinator populations are declining due to loss of habitat. Pollinator gardens, big or small, help keep pollinators strong by providing a place to eat, rest, and reproduce.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"> <span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">At this park, you can find pollinator gardens with native plants along the pathways at both Potomac Street and 33rd Street. Funding for these two gardens was provided by the <a href=\"https://georgetownwaterfrontpark.org/\">Friends of Georgetown Waterfront Park</a>.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\"> </span></p> <p><span> </span></p>",

Travel four hundred twenty yards then turn left. Proceed six hundred fifty feet, and the Rock Creek Nature Center and Planetarium will be on your right.<br />Beyond the front doors of the Rock Creek Nature Center is a thirty by forty-foot space featuring a gift shop, an exhibit space in the back, restrooms to the left, and a staircase to the right of the front desk which leads downstairs to a younger kids learning area.<br />From the front entrance of the Nature Center, proceed around the right side of the building and walk back thirty feet. Turn left at the corner of the building and down four steps to a twenty by forty cement brick plaza area. A garden lines the space on its south, east, and north sides and wood picnic benches are along the building on the left and at the north end of the space. Stairs on the east side lead down to a walkway to the Edge of Woods Trail.<br />On the left against the back of the Nature Center wall hangs a three by four-foot sign. Behind a light green background, the sign is titled at the top: A Garden Protecting Rock Creek. Text below describes water sustainability efforts in Rock Creek:<br />In 2011, the Friends of Peirce Mill partnered with the National Park Service to revive the plantings and install water sustainability features at this garden. These features include two rain gardens, a pervious paver area, and a \"downspout disconnect.\" Visit and see how homeowners can help Rock Creek or their neighborhood stream through simple changes in how rainfall is used.<br />More info: http://ddoe.dc.gov/riversmarthomes<br />In the center below is a drawing of a man gardening. A picture of a garden shows mulch set above a compost/sand mix about 18 inches deep. Above him reads: What You Can Do on Your Property. Text beneath reads:<br />If feasible, disconnect downspouts leading to drainage pipes and street, or driveway, and direct to yard, rain barrel, or rain garden. Here's a typical garden design:<br />A note sitting at an angle to the right reads:<br />Stormwater washes lawn fertilizers and pesticides into creeks and harms the Chesapeake Bay. Consult cbf.org for sustainable lawn care tips.<br />Two pictures below show full, lush vegetation along a stream bank on the left and on the right, a stream with many dead branches overhanging from above. Text in the middle reads:<br />These photos show the difference between a healthy stream bank (left) and a stream bank eroded by stormwater (right).<br />To the right is written:<br />Want to Do More to Help the Creek?<br />Rock Creek Conservancy<br />www.rockcreekconservancy.org<br />The top left column of the sign states: Select Plants Wisely. Text below reads:<br />A broad selection of attractive wildflowers, shrubs and trees can be used for a rain garden; they also can add beauty to landscaping projects on your property.<br />Below are two columns of three three-square inch photos of flowers in bright green, purple, red, and yellow colors. They are identified as:<br />Blue Vervain<br />Common Milkweed<br />Purple Coneflower<br />Winterberry Holly<br />Oxeye Sunflower<br />Butterfly Weed<br />Text underneath reads:<br />Use Pervious Pavers<br />Homeowners can increase absorption of rainfall into the soil by laying stepping stones or patios on top of gravel and other pervious materials.<br />The top of the right column is titled: Rock Creek and Its Tributaries<br />Text below reads:<br />The Nature Center is in the southern portion of the 80-square-mile Rock Creek watershed or drainage area, which begins near Laytonsville in Montgomery County. About two-thirds of the stream network has been covered by roads, parking lots and other impervious development. This means that rainfall doesn't get absorbed in these areas, and that storm sewers convey torrents of water that erode stream banks and topples trees. Storm water also disrupts the natural food chain by destroying habitat for aquatic insects and fish, and contributes to the degradation of the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay.<br />Below is a map highlighting the Rock Creek Watershed, which runs from north of Rockville, MD down south to where the creek runs into the Potomac River in Washington.<br />In the bottom left corner of the sign is a drawing of a white wheel.<br />Text reads:<br />Friends of Peirce Mill<br />www.peircemill-friends.org<br />END OF DESCRIPTION <br />",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>A Gathering Place for Washingtonians</b><br /> Since Meridian Hill Parked opened in 1936, Washingtonians from the diverse neighborhoods surrounding the park have gathered here for performances, community events, and political protest.<br /> <br /> When tens of thousands of people flocked to Washington, DC, in the late 1930s and 40s for federal jobs created by the New Deal and World War II, government agencies created a series of free \"Starlight\" concerts in the park. From 1941 to 1944, Washingtonians lined the cascades and reflecting pool on summer evenings to hear classical and popular music, including a performance by the Von Trapp Family Singers.<br /> <br /> When Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in April 1968, Washington, D.C. erupted in riots. Both the 14th Street business corridor north and east of the park and the U Street corridor south of the park were devastated. To help heal and unify the city, the \"Summer in the Parks\" concert series was created. The inaugural performance was held at Meridian Hill Park, featuring Broadway and film star Pearl Bailey. Twenty-thousand people attended.<br /> <br /> Since 1969, the park has unofficially been called \"Malcolm X Park\" by the local community. As the site of the memorial to President Buchanan, Meridian Hill Park cannot officially be named for another person.</p> <h4><b>James Buchanan</b></h4> <p>Diplomat, Statesman, and Fifteenth President of the United States<br /> Buchanan was our only bachelor president and relied upon his orphaned niece, Harriet Lane, to act as his First Lady during his years in the White House (1857 to 1861). In her estate, Harriet Lane Johnson made a bequest to fund a memorial to her uncle. Designed by architect William Gordon Beecher and sculpted by Maryland artist Hans Schuler, the memorial was dedicated on June 26, 1930. It features a bronze statue of Buchanan with stone figures of Law and Diplomacy at each end, representing Buchanan's career in public service.<br /> <br /> Before becoming president, Buchanan served in the House of Representatives for nearly 18 years. He was Minister to Russia from 1832 to 1834, then a Senator until 1845. He declined an appointment to the Supreme Court by President Polk in 1844, serving instead as Polk's Secretary of State. In that post, he helped to negotiate the 1846 Oregon Treaty, which established the 49th parallel as the northern boundary of the western United States.<br /> <br /> Hostilities in Congress over slavery, abolition, and secession made Buchanan's presidency difficult. His was plagued by financial panic and then a revolt of Mormons in 1857, which the press called the Utah War. On Buchanan's final day as president, March 4, 1861, he remarked to the incoming Lincoln, \"If you are as happy entering the White House as I shall feel returning to Wheatland you are a happy man.\"<br /> <br /> Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/meridian-hill-park.htm\">Meridian Hill Park</a> website for more information.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(719 words)<br />Meridian Hill Park is located in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, DC. The park is bordered by 15th, 16th, W, and Euclid streets NW, and sits on a prominent hill one and one-half miles (2.5 kilometers) due north of the White House.<br />From 16th street and W street, NW in Washington, DC, travel north on 16th street about one hundred feet (30 meters). Turn right at the staircase and enter Meridian Hill Park. The A Gathering Place for Washingtonians, and James Buchanan wayside will be at the top of the eight stairs on your right.<br />The wayside consists of three signs, each three by four-feet. The sign in the center is titled with large white lettering in the top left corner: \"A Gathering Place for Washingtonians.\"<br />The right two-thirds of the sign feature three black and white photographs. The largest, along the top half of the sign, shows a crowd of a couple hundred well-dressed people sitting on both sides of a fountain pool area, about forty feet across. Images of the people reflect off the still water of the basin. A small fountain shoots water a few feet into the air from the pool on the right side. Trees and bushes line the outer perimeter of the park at its far end. An armillary sphere is visible in the background.<br />Below is a two by three-inch photo of a woman on stage wearing a black dress. Her arms are spread out wide. Three other performing women in dresses are on the right side of the stage and one is on the left side. A seated crowd watches on in front of the stage. Text below reads:<br />Concerts, dance recitals, and plays were held in the park throughout the 1930s and 1940s.<br />Next to this photo is an eight by twelve-inch picture of African American and white men in suits marching down a street with a cement wall behind them. A policeman riding a motorcycle can be seen along the left edge of the picture. The men hold a sign that reads NO MORE BIRMINGHAMS and shows a faded image of a man holding a bullhorn among other people near trash and debris next to a building. Text to the left reads:<br />During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, the park was the site of numerous protests, such as this march at right, on September 22, 1963, organized by the Congress of Racial Equality. The march was called to remember the children who died in the church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, and the violence that followed.<br />The sign furthest to the right is a map of the entire park area. The sign furthest left has a brown background and is titled in the top center in large white lettering:<br />James Buchanan<br />To the right in smaller lettering is the subtitle:<br />Diplomat, Statesman, and Fifteenth President of the United States<br />In the center top of the sign is a five-square-inch black and white picture of the bust of an older man with white hair, no facial hair, and wearing a dark jacket and high white collar.<br />Beneath is another black and white image, a faded drawing of an eagle with wings outstretched facing a smaller, slumping bird. Text below reads:<br />Opposition commentary on the state of the nation at the beginning of Buchanan's presidency and at the end.<br />Further below is another black and white image, this one a photograph of well-dressed men in suits, four standing and four seated around a pedestal with an open book laid atop. Text below reads:<br />Buchanan with his cabinet. Quoted on Buchanan's memorial, cabinet member Jeremiah S. Black, far right, called Buchanan \"the incorruptible statesman whose walk was upon the mountain ranges of the law.\"<br />Text along the right side of the sign details much of Buchanan's life as president and reads:<br />The left side of the sign is a faded brown photograph showing a large crowd of hundreds looking on at a grandstand built on the on the US Capitol Building steps and holding about one hundred seated people<br />Text in the lower left corner reads:<br />The first Presidential inaugural ever to be photographed was James Buchanan's. On March 4, 1857, photographer John Wood recorded the event as it took place in the midst of the Capitol building construction site.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION",

The one-acre park is on the east side of Georgia avenue, NW between Whittier place to the north and Van Buren street to the south.<br />The Cemetery sits on a terrace approximately five feet above street level. A bluestone wall along the front edge is separated by two sets of three steps that lead up to a wrought-iron black gate at the Cemetery entrance. Set atop stone pillars on either side of the entrance are two six-foot long black cannons, one pointing north and one pointing south. On the face of the columns are black signs in the shape of a shield that both read in white: U.S. National Cemetery.<br />To the left about six feet from the front edge of the cemetery and set in a row across the lawn are four granite monuments, each between six and eleven-feet tall. To the right is a two-story red stone building with brown shutters and a gabled roof. A porch extends out on the west side of the building.<br />Directly back seventy feet from the entrance is a central flagpole, surrounded by forty-one marble headstones. Behind them and the east end of the Cemetery stands a white marble pavilion with four granite pillars.<br />Set to the right of the walkway about six feet from the top of the entrance steps is a two by three-foot wayside sign. Written across the top in black letters it is titled:<br />Battleground National Cemetery<br />The background of the entire sign is a black and white photograph of a small, one-story building with chimney, two windows on one side and one on another. A white picket fence runs behind the backside of the building. In front is a flagpole surrounded by white gravestones. Text in the lower right corner reads:<br />Battleground National Cemetery<br />Circa 1865-1870<br />Text in the bottom right corner reads:<br />You can download a podcast of Battleground National Cemetery at www.nps.gov/rocr<br />A smaller four by five-inch picture is set in the upper right corner. It shows a view from across the street at a two-story building set on a raised plot of land bordered by a stone brick wall in front. A staircase leads up through an opening in the wall. Monuments line the left front side of the property. A tall evergreen tree stands over the building, and other trees are set further back in the yard. Text written underneath reads:<br />Battleground National Cemetery<br />Circa 1930<br />Text written on the left side of the side describes the formation of Battleground National Cemetery:<br />During the late evening of July 12, 1864, 4o Union soldiers that perished while defending Washington, DC from a two-day Confederate attack) known as the Battle of Fort Stevens) were laid to rest here in what was once an apple orchard. President Abraham Lincoln, who attended the burial ceremony, dedicated the land as hallowed ground, making Battleground National Cemetery one of America's smallest national cemeteries.<br />Between the 1870s and early 1900s a Superintendent's Lodge, rostrum, flagpole, and regimental monuments were added to the cemetery to pay tribute to the brave men who sacrificed all to preserve this nation and its capital city. In addition to the fallen soldiers, the cemetery also holds the remains of the wife and three children of Augustus Armbrecht, the original superintendent of the cemetery.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

About 30 feet (9 meters) into the park, and just beyond a paved path to the left, the wayside will be sitting along the walkway on your left.<br />Two three-by four-foot signs are placed at this location. The left sign provides a map and details about the entire park area. The sign on the right has a green background and is titled in large letters along the top left corner:<br />Campus to Army Camps and Back Again<br />Text below describes the Union Army's use of what would become Meridian Hill Park during the Civil War:<br />Campus to Army Camp and Back Again<br />President Monroe signed a charter in 1821 that established Columbian College on a site north of Florida Avenue between 14th and 15th Streets. Columbian College moved to Foggy Bottom in 1912 and became The George Washington University, but the original campus area continued to be called \"College Hill.\"<br />During the Civil War, the Union Army commandeered the farmland on which Meridian Hill Park would eventually be built. The Army built camps there with names like Cameron, Relief, Carver, and Barclay.

The picture is a drawing of a wide landscape of multiple acres. Six rows of ten one and two-story white buildings are in the lower left corner along a hillside. Further right is a five-story building among a line of trees, and at the far-right side more buildings are set in a square with a green campus area in the middle. Even more buildings line the bottom of the image. Written along a white border at the bottom of the picture is:<br />Carver Barracks, Washington, D.C.<br />Text above and left of the image reads:<br />Captain Grover of New York's 76th Regiment wrote home in 1861, \"We were encamped in the edge of what must be in summer a beautiful grove, on the estate of Commodore Porter, a few rods only from his mansion, now occupied as a hospital. But beautiful as was the situation...snow and mud, cold fingers and toes, empty stomachs and soiled clothes, concealed every beauty, and compelled us to attend only to the work of arranging the camp.\"<br />Two black and white three by four-inch photographs are at the top right corner of the sign. The left image shows military troops lounging in front of a pitched tent. Two men stand in front of the tent while five others pose while seated beside them. All are wearing Civil War-era hats and rifles with bayonets are displayed among the men and in front the tent.

    "audioDescription": "(497 words) Fort DeRussy is located in Rock Creek Park in northwest Washington, DC, bordered by Military Road NW to the south, Oregon Avenue to the west, and Rock Creek to the east. From the northeast corner of the intersection of Oregon Avenue and Military Road, travel two hundred fifty feet north on the east side of Oregon Avenue, along a cement paved path into the edge of a forest. A four by three-foot wayside titled Fort De Russy sits at the right side of the path. Follow the path around the wayside to the right and proceed one-hundred twenty feet east at a slight incline into the forest to a fork in the road with a dirt path to the left. Follow the dirt path four hundred thirty feet where two waysides sit to the left of the path. The left wayside is three by two feet and titled in the top left corner: Fort DeRussy. The sign features an image of men in military dress standing in a circular bunker around a cannon lowered in the circle and on a wheeled turret. Six men stand atop a four-foot-tall wall that encircles the cannon. Eight other men stand within the lowered cannon space. Text below describes the cannon and Fort DeRussy: Built in 1861 to protect the Rock Creek Valley during the Civil War, Fort DeRussy's cannon fired a total of 109 projectiles into the northern countryside as 12,000-15,000 Confederate soldiers attacked the city under the command of Confederate General Jubal Anderson Early on July 11-12, 1864. During this two day battle (known as the Battle of Fort Stevens) Fort DeRussy aided the surrounding forts by providing the main suppressive fire to ensure a Union victory on the battlefield. The largest piece of armament which Fort DeRussy utilized was the 100-Pound Parrott Rifle. This cannon, shown above at nearby Fort Totten, could hurl 100 pound projectiles several miles into the Maryland countryside. During the Battle of Fort Stevens, Fort DeRussy halted the Confederate advance into the city by firing this deadly and accurate cannon a total of 28 times. The top right corner features a black and white photograph of a man standing at attention in a plain coat, pants and boots with a strap across his chest and holding a rifle and bayonet at his right side. Text beneath him reads: Private Samuel Strawser, a member of the 151st Ohio Volunteer Infantry, was stationed at Fort DeRussy during the Battle of Fort Stevens. A black and white oval photograph in the bottom right shows a bearded man in a hat, suit and vest. Text to his right reads: \"On the right was Rock Creek running through a deep ravine which had been rendered impassable...every appliance of science and unlimited means had been used to render the fortifications around Washington as strong as possible\"<br />General Jubal Anderson Early Commander of Confederate forces during the Battle of Fort Stevens You can download a podcast of Fort DeRussy at www.nps.gov/rocr END OF DESCRIPTION",

Confederate General Jubal Early's troops attacked here on July 10-11, 1864. Abraham Lincoln famously stood on the parapet and exposed himself to enemy fire.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(525 words)<br />Fort Stevens is located in the northern corner of Washington, DC, within the center of a block bordered by 13th Street, NW to the west, Georgia Avenue to the east, Rittenhouse Street to the north and Quakenbos Street to the south.<br />The park area rises about thirty feet from street level at the northwest corner of 13th and Rittenhouse Streets about two-hundred yards to the eastern end where the fort is situated. A flagpole in the center of the hilly field marks the fort location.<br />Lined in front to the east of the flagpole are a wall of grassy bunkers, about four-feet tall. One eight-foot tall hill to the left has a white wooden double-sided door on its face.<br />A cement bunker wall with wood-log designed vertical ridges spans about one hundred yards (90 meters) across the top of the hill. The wall stands about five feet tall with six three-foot wide, three-foot tall openings. Pointed out of two of those openings are sixteen-foot long cannons set on cement platforms and directed out to the north.<br />Set at the low-end corner of the block at 13th and Rittenhouse Streets is a four by three-foot wayside. The yellow sign is written in brown letters across the top:<br />Fort Stevens<br />The partial reconstruction of Fort Stevens that you see today was done by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937. No visible evidence of the original fort remains.<br />Across a blue border just below, text reads in white letters:<br />Civil War Defenses of Washington<br />1861-1865<br />Text in the middle left describes the Battle of Fort Stevens:<br />Battle of Fort Stevens<br />July 11-12, 1864<br />On July 11-12, 1864, Fort Stevens was the focal point of a Confederate attack by Gen. Jubal Early with his force of 15,000 soldiers. Defended by a meager force of convalescents, quartermaster employees and 100 day militia volunteers, Fort Stevens held back an attack by Confederate skirmishers on July 11. Reinforcements from the Union 6th and 19th Corps on the second day checked and turned back the only Confederate threat against Washington, DC, during the war. Late in the afternoon of July 12, President Abraham Lincoln was exposed to Confederate fire while observing this battle where approximately 900 soldiers were killed, wounded, or missing.<br />Nearby Battleground Cemetery, which was dedicated by President Lincoln soon after the battle, contains the graves of 40 Union soldiers who died in defense of Fort Stevens.<br />To the right is a map of the top corner of Washington, DC, showing the locations of Civil War forts. From west to east they are: Battery Kemble, Fort Bayard, Fort Reno, For De Russy, Fort Stevens, Fort Slocum, Fort Totten, and Fort Bunker Hill.<br />Text below reads:<br />Other Civil War for locations administered by Rock Creek Park.<br />The bottom third of the sign shows a black and white photograph of Civil War soldiers standing in a fort around an eight-foot long cannon on a rotating platform, aimed to the left. The fort sits atop a tall hill with a vast view in the background of open spaces and rolling hills.<br />The caption below reads:<br />During the Civil War, Washington's forts overlooked farm land.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Below it is labeled:<br />Legion of Honor<br />\"A diplomat, a scholar and a friend of America<br />Jusserand Memorial Committee, 1937<br />Text above and below the emblem reads:<br />The granite bench before you commemorates the scholarship, wisdom and skilled diplomacy of Jean Jules Jusserand, French Ambassador to the United States from 1902 to 1925. The memorial's inscription, \"Personal Tribute of Esteem and Affection\" reflects the admiration felt for him locally, nationally and internationally. Jusserand loved Rock Creek Park and frequently walked here with family and friends. We can only wonder how the world was affected by the thoughts he pondered while enjoying the beauty of this place.<br />Diplomacy - Jusserand served as French Ambassador to the United States under five presidential administrations and throughout the First World War.<br />Scholarship - Jusserand's writings earned him recognition at home and abroad. He won the first Pulitzer Prize in History for With Americans of Past and Present Days, a book recounting the key contributions of many Frenchmen to the history of the United States, including Pierre Charles L'Enfant, designer of the city of Washington.<br />Friendship - A leader in Franco-American relations, Jusserand received the Grand Croix,\"of the French Legion of Honor, the highest French distinction. His efforts to promote friendship between the two countries led him to create the American Society of the Legion of Honor that recognizes Americans who make significant contributions to France.<br />At the opposite right end from the Jusserand photo is a picture of President Theodore Roosevelt, wearing round glasses and speaking as he faces to the left. Text beneath him reads:<br />Soon after his arrival in Washington, Jusserand earned the confidence of President Theodore Roosevelt and became a member of his unofficial \"tennis cabinet\". Roosevelt and Jusserand shared a love for the outdoors and spent many long hours hiking in Rock Creek Park. In his memoir \"What Me Befell,\" Jusserand describes their outings.<br />\"President Roosevelt gave me that unique proof of trust and friendship; he asked me to a â€˜walk'...What the President called a walk, was a run, no stop, no breathing time, no slacking of speed, but a continuous race, careless of mud, thorns, and the rest. The Rock Creek Walk usually ended at the cliff overhanging the river, near the Zoo.\"<br />\"Almost we can say -- he was a great American as well as a great Frenchman. We shall link Mr. Jusserand's name forever with the names of Lafayette and Rochambeau and De Grasse and the other valiant Frenchmen whose services in this country entitle them for all time to the grateful remembrance of all Americans.\"<br />Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the Jusserand Memorial dedication, 1936<br />Crossed flags of France and America sit at the bottom center of the sign.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(806 words)<br />The Robert Emmett Memorial sits in a small triangular park along Massachusetts Avenue, NW, and is bordered by S street, NW to the north and 24th street to the east. There are crosswalks at each corner, but the only sidewalk is on the Massachusetts Avenue side. Massachusetts frequently carries heavy traffic.<br />The triangle is a grassy patch of land and the memorial sits about thirty feet (9 meters) from the 24th and Massachusetts Avenue intersection, near the center of the triangle. From the intersection of Massachusetts and 24th, walk about thirty feet (9 meters) northwest along Massachusetts. On the right, a path of three-foot wide asphalt circles lead to the statue. There are bushes on either side of the path.<br />On the right, just before reaching the pathway to the statue, a three by four-foot wayside sits about ten feet from the sidewalk. The wayside displays the following text:<br />Robert Emmet<br />Irish Patriot<br />\"I wish to procure for my country the guarantee which Washington procured for America\"<br />The centerpiece of this small park is a sculpture of Irish patriot Robert Emmet that serves as a tribute to how American democracy inspired the independence of Ireland. Emmet, born in Dublin in 1778, was strongly influenced by the American Revolution. Educated at Trinity College Dublin, Emmet was remembered by contemporaries for his oratorical brilliance.<br />An oval shaped image assumed to be Emmet is at the top center of the sign. The man faces to his left, with a stern look on his face and is wearing an early 19th century military uniform. A sword rests on his left arm.<br />To the right is text describing the process of establishing the memorial park. The full text reads:<br />Establishing a Park<br />In 1912, the Smithsonian Institution offered space for a statue of Robert Emmet in the rotunda of the U.S. National Museum, and a group of Irish-Americans commissioned Jerome Connor to create the sculpture. President Woodrow Wilson and members of Congress attended its dedication in 1917. The Smithsonian American Art Museum loaned the sculpture to the National Park Services in 1966 to serve as the centerpiece for this park to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising. President Lyndon Baines Johnson sent this message for the 1966 dedication:<br />\"...The sheer patriotism and the gallant courage of Robert Emmet have inspired Americans no less than Irishmen...We Americans are proud to accord a place of honor here in the Nation's Capital to Robert Emmet, whose struggles and sacrifices bespeak the yearnings of mankind throughout the ages.\"<br />In 2016 the park was refurbished and re-dedicated to commemorate the 100th Anniversaries of the Emmet statue, the Easter Ring, and the National Park Service.<br />The bottom half of the sign is a color drawing of Emmet speaking to a crowd from a raised platform with a waist high rail. He appears to be speaking from the witness stand in a courtroom. Red-coated British troops are among those in the crowd.<br />Text in a black panel on the bottom left details an armed rebellion led by Emmet against British rule. The full text reads:<br />In 1803, Emmet led an armed rebellion against British rule, proclaiming the establishment of an Irish Republic. The uprising was quickly suppressed. Emmet fled, but was captured upon returning to Dublin to see his fiancÃ©e Sarah Curran. Tried for treason on September 19, 1803, he was immediately found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. Emmet's \"Speech from the Dock\" motivated the movement that led to independence for Ireland following the Easter Rising in 1916:<br />\"...I appeal to the immaculate God that my conduct has been governed only by the conviction...of the emancipation of my country from the super inhuman oppression under which she has long and too patiently travailed. Let no man attaint my memory by believing that I could have engaged in any cause but that of my country's liberty and independence...Let no man write my epitaph. When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then and not till then, let my epitaph be written.\"<br />Emmet was executed the next day, on September 20, 1803. His stirring words continue to inspire Irish patriotism.<br />The lower right side of the sign features a black and white image of a man in suit and tie, and is titled: Jerome Connor, Master Sculptor. Text to his right reads:<br />Jerome Connor, Master Sculptor<br />Jerome Connor was born in County Kerry, Ireland in 1874. After immigrating to Massachusetts in 1888, Connor trained as a stonecutter and bronze founder. He attended Elbert Hubbard's esteemed Roycroft artisan community, and in 1910 established a studio in Washington, D.C., where he lived until returning to Ireland in 1925. His sculptures included Bishop John Carroll (1912), Nuns of the Battlefield (1924), Bronx Victory Memorial (1925), and the Lusitania Peace Memorial in Cobh, Co. Cork (posthumous).<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

This process of growth, death, and decay is a never-ending cycle that helps maintain the forest community.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Evergreen trees usually have needle-like leaves with small surface areas, while deciduous trees have flat leaves with large surface areas. Since trees allow moisture to escape through their leaves, deciduous trees drop their leaves in the fall to avoid the cold, dry winter months. Evergreen trees can keep their needles year-round, continuously shedding and growing new ones.<br />Along the bottom of the sign are drawings of two trees and their leaves. On the left is an evergreen tree with dark green pine needles. To its right is a picture of a brown pinecone and a pine needled-branch with green spiky needles. The images are labeled underneath: White pine.<br />On the lower right side of the sign is an image of a green leave with a round green acorn attached to the branch.

Below is text which reads:<br />Rock Creek's Mills<br />At one time, Rock Creek hosted a large number of flour mills, saw mills, and other industries. The force of the creek's waters, dropping more than 160 feet over 33 miles, gave the mills their power. The region's farms provided abundant raw materials. Wagon paths allowed farmers to transport their grain to the mills and their flour to market. The nearby port of Georgetown offered access to more distant customers. It was a near-perfect combination.<br />Five pictures are shown in four by three-inch boxes around the left side. All but the picture titled Parrott Mill are of two and three-story A-frame buildings. The Parrott Mill photo is of stone ruins.<br />Rock Creek is indicated on the map as it passes north to south through these pictures on the left side of the map. An arrow points to a spot along the creek that states: You Are Here.<br />The following text describes the five photos in clockwise order from the top left.<br />Blagden/Argyle Mill<br />(ca. 1850-1889)<br />Flour and fertilizer mill. Remnants evident one-half of a mile upstream.<br />The Blagden/Argyle Mill image is a black and white photo showing an empty two and one-half story stone building with open windows on the side and a large rectangular opening at the front of the building. A creek runs along the side of the building at the bottom of the image.<br />Lyons Mill<br />(1780-1875)<br />The earliest mill built along Rock Creek.<br />The Lyons Mill photo is a black and white image of an empty shell of a two and one-half story building.<br />Parrott Mill<br />(early 1880s)<br />Turned cotton and wool into thread.<br />The Parrott Mill image is a black and white photo showing about an eight-foot high stone wall of ruins. It sits in a wooded area amongst stones and trees.<br />Columbian (Adams) Mill<br />(ca. 1800-1867)<br />A wheat mill bought by President John Quincy Adams.<br />The Columbian (Adams) Mill photo is a black and white image of an empty three and one-half story stone building with open windows. A twenty-foot tree sits on the front right side of the building and Rock Creek runs along the righthand side.<br />Peirce Mill<br />(1829-1897)<br />The last remaining flour mill on Rock Creek, it replaced an earlier mill on the site.<br />The Peirce Mill photo is a color image of a three and one-half stone building with white frames windows. A mill wheel on the right side of the building sits in a four-foot wide trough that runs from right to left across the picture.<br />In the lower left corner of the sign is a surveyor's mark that reads:<br />Topographical Map of the District of Columbia <br />Surveyed in the years 1856, '57, â€˜58', and â€˜59<br />By A.

Proceed through on the left side, pass over a bridge, and continue about fifty feet (15 meters) southwest. Chesapeake Bay and Its Rivers Yours to Protect wayside will be about ten feet beyond the path to the west and sitting along the river's edge.As you face the sign a boat pier will be directly in front of you on the Potomac River. The Thompson Boat Center is to the left. The sign sits on a grassy patch just beyond a thin dirt trail that runs behind it. A wood bench is to the right. Two forty-foot tall trees are at either side of the sign, about twenty feet away.The three by four-foot sign is badly faded. Written in white letters across a brown border on the top is written:The Chesapeake Bay and Its Rivers...Yours to ProtectText below on the left reads:The Chesapeake Bay, one of the largest and most productive estuaries in the world, is healthier today than it was just 10 years ago. Famous for its blue crabs, oysters and striped bass, the Bay has bounced back from its environmental low point in the 1970s thanks to an ongoing cooperative effort by the citizens and government. Although there are many positive signs, the Bay is far from restored. It still needs your help.What Makes the Bay Unique?In the Bay, freshwater from over 150 rivers and streams mixes with saltwater from the Atlantic Ocean to create the unique \"estuarine\" conditions that support over 2,700 plant and animal species. The Bay supplies millions of pounds of seafood, functions as a major shipping hub, provides a home for wildlife, and offers an incredible array of recreational opportunities.What's the Problem?We're the problem! We're also the solution. Take the first step toward a healthier Bay by realizing your everyday activities can contribute to the pollution in the rivers and Bay. Products including drain cleaner, lawn fertilizer, pesticides, gasoline, oil, and antifreeze when not properly handled can harm the rivers and the Bay.The Bay is Shallow and Vulnerable!The Bay is nearly 20 miles long and 20-miles wide, but it's only 21 feet deep on average. This shallowness limits the Bay's capacity to dilute the pollutants that drain into the Bay from its watershed.You Can Make a Difference!You can help protect the Bay and its crabs, fish and critters that call it home. Start a compost pile. Keep your car tuned up. Recycle. Use non-toxic alternatives for cleaning and for controlling pests. Try Bay-friendly landscaping with native plants and shrubs. Conserve water and electricity. Get involved! The Bay and rivers are yours to restore, yours to conserve.In a blue box in the center beneath the title text describes history of the Potomac River:Spectacular scenery is typical of the Potomac River, which begins stream in Fairfax Stone, West Virginia, and ends 380 miles later at the Chesapeake Bay. Upstream from here at Great Falls the river begins its dramatic change from a free flowing freshwater stream into a tidal estuary - a mixture of fresh and saltwater - which flows past the District of Columbia and for another 110-miles before it empties into the Bay at Point Lookout, Maryland.The Potomac also known as the \"Nation's River\" is rich in history. In 1632, two ships landed at what is now St. Mary's City on the lower Potomac and established the colony of Maryland. Less than a decade later, colonization of the Northern Virginia shore followed. Soon thriving ports were established here at Georgetown and downstream in Alexandria, Virginia. Our nation's capital was carved out of a Potomac swamp in the 1800s. As early as 1900, population growth and development caused serious water quality problems in the Potomac. Poorly treated sewage was the major culprit. By the 1950s, this stretch of the Potomac was so polluted it was declared unfit for human contact. But, in the 1960s, a massive publicly-funded clean-up effort began. By the 1970s water quality in the river began to improve. Today, the Potomac River at Washington is dramatically better. It's also a great place to fish for largemouth bass, perch, catfish and rockfish.A faded map of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Washington, Delaware, and Virginia sits in the center of the sign. A brown box to the left reads:The Chesapeake Bay drains the water for all or parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, New York, West Virginia and Delaware. The Bay drainage basin or \"watershed\" covers 64,000 square miles of land.Three faded pictures to the right of the map, appear to be scenes of boating activity on the river.The faded right column has information about ways to help keep the river clean and other ways to help protect the river. Below is a faded picture of people standing by a riverbank.Below a faded picture in the lower left corner of two baby chicks in a nest, is text that reads:BAY WATCHERS - Above, two young osprey",

    "bodyText": "<p> </p> <h3>Visionary and Park Champion</h3> <br /> Meridian Hill Park might never have been built had it not been for the determination of Mary Foote Henderson (1846-1931). For 22 years, she lobbied Congress for funds to buy the land and build the park. Congress's 1910 vote to authorize construction of Meridian Hill Park is a testimony to her resolve.<br /> Henderson's efforts in urban development weren't limited to promoting Meridian Hill Park. She engaged the services of some of the country's foremost architects for her grand schemes, including an enormous new presidential mansion and two Lincoln memorials, none of which were ever built.<br /> Henderson had nearly a dozen elaborate residences built on 15th and 16th Streets for use as embassies and other diplomatic missions. She then planned to line 16th Street with the busts of former presidents and change the name of the street to \"Avenue of the Presidents.\" Although she succeeded in getting the street renamed for a short time, her grand vision for 16th Street was never realized. <h3>Creating the \"City Beautiful\"</h3> <br /> At the beginning of its second century, the nation's capital was changing dramatically. In 1902, the United States Senate adopted a number of recommendations from the Senate Park Commission, popularly known as the McMillan Commission. By 1910, a federally appointed group of architects and designers, the Commission of Fine Arts, was directing the rehabilitation of the National Mall. Under their supervision, construction began on several new buildings near the Capitol, including the monuments to Lincoln and Jefferson, and on a series of new parks.<br /> Two principles guided both commissions. The first was Pierre L'Enfant's 1792 plan of the city, which had never been fully realized and had nearly been lost during the 19th century. The second was creation and maintenance of grand public spaces, as endorsed by the proponents of the City Beautiful movement of the 1890s, and exemplified by the Beaux Arts designs of the French and Italian Renaissance revivals. Serving as a \"monumental entrance to Washington,\" Meridian Hill Park demonstrates both principles.<br /> According to Meridian Hill Park's National Historic Landmark nomination (1994), \"the creation of a Renaissance villa landscape in the midst of an American city to serve as a public park has no true parallel.\" <h3>Design Challenges</h3> <br /> Limited funds and the dramatic change in elevation at the Meridian Hill Park site - falling 75 feet from north to south - challenged the Commission of Fine Arts and their designers. The 16th Street edge required massive retaining walls to transition from the upper park to the sidewalk at street level.<br /> Budget constraints meant the designers could not specify natural stone for the desired Renaissance forms. To find a solution, the park's architect in charge, Horace Peaslee, turned to the Earley Studio in Arlington, Virginia, renowned for its artistry and craftsmanship.<br /> \"For John Earley, Meridian Hill Park was the beginning of an involvement with concrete that was to last nearly thirty years. Eventually, he became the world's foremost expert on the practical aspects of concrete making, and under his direction the Earley Studio executed works of such unusual complexity and beauty that they have never been equaled,\"<br /> Frederick Cron, historian <h3>Park Designers</h3> <br /> Noted landscape architects George Burnap and Horace Peaslee, who worked in the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds, designed Meridian Hill Park under the guidance of the Commission of Fine Arts. By 1914, Burnap had completed his basic design: a linear series of elements that included the Mall, the Great Terrace, the Hillside Gardens with Cascades, and the Lower Plaza with memorial to President Buchanan.<br /> After Burnap returned to private practice in 1917, Peaslee submitted revision that greatly simplified the Mall. As automobiles were rapidly replacing horse-drawn carriages in the city, he eliminated vehicular access into the park. He added a pedestrian entrance on 15th Street and shifted the Buchanan Memorial off the main axis to the east side of the Lower Plaza.<br /> When park construction began in 1918, landscape designer Ferruccio Vitale was hired to develop a planting plan for Meridian Hill Park. Following Peaselee's lead, Vitale greatly simplified the lower park. He eliminated the 16th Street entrance to the Great Terrace, the bridge over the Cascades and the oval amphitheater, and simplified the pathways of the Hillside Gardens. <p> </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>James Buchanan (1791-1868) was 15th president of the United States. He was born in Pennsylvania and served in the War of 1812. Before he was elected to the office of President of the United States, he served as a Representative in Congress, U.S. Minister to Russia and to Great Britain, Senator and Secretary of State. His presidency (1857-1861) came at the brink of the Civil War, and some have faulted Buchanan for his failure to avert the sectional crisis that finally boiled over as he left office. Buchanan's niece, Mrs. Harriet Lane Johnston, who had served as the unmarried president's hostess, left a bequest to build this memorial upon her death in 1903. Many opposed the memorial's construction, finding it improper to honor Buchanan ahead of presidents such as Adams or Jefferson. After many years in limbo, the memorial was finally approved by Congress on June 27, 1918 (40 Stat. 632). <br /> <br /> <strong>Cost:</strong> Harriet Lane Johnston left $115,000 for the memorial to be built.<br /> <br /> <strong>Dedicated: </strong>June 26, 1930<br /> <br /> <strong>Sculptor:</strong> Hans Schuler</p> <h4>Memorial Description</h4> <p>The memorial consists of a bronze seated statue of President Buchanan.

    "audioDescription": "(453 words)<br />The James Buchanan Memorial is a bronze and granite memorial in the southeast corner of Meridian Hill Park. The park is bordered by 15th, 16th, W, and Euclid streets NW, and sits on a prominent hill one and one-half miles (2.5 kilometers) north of the White House.<br />From the northwest corner of the intersection of 15th street and W street NW, enter the park and proceed up the inclined walkway about two hundred twenty feet. The walkway includes many steps. You will enter a plaza landing area and the memorial will be on your right.<br />The eight-foot tall bronze sculpture of Buchanan sits in a chair with arms, atop a two-tiered six-foot high six-foot wide pedestal in front of an eighteen foot tall, ten foot wide white granite wall. He is flanked by two granite figures that sit at either end of the eighty-foot wide granite memorial. An eight-foot tall, twenty-foot long back wall spans both sides between the Buchanan sculpture and the side figures. Two steps lead up to the memorial platform from the plaza. The pedestal sits on a t-tiered base.<br />Buchanan has a sullen look on his face. His eyes are cast downward and he holds a newspaper in his left hand which lays across his left leg. He wears a long coat, suit vest, and bow tie. The sculptor's signature is etched in the lower right corner of the statue and reads:<br />Hans Schuler 1929<br />The figure seated forty feet to his left is of a topless woman with a band in her hair. She wears a robe on her lap and wrapped around her right arm, and her legs are crossed at the ankle. Her left hand rests on her left thigh and her sandaled feet can be seen below the robe. She has a long narrow piece of paper or cloth spread across her lap. Text beside her inscribed along the wall reads:<br />James Buchanan of Pennsylvania<br />President of the United States<br />MDCCCLVII MDCCCLXI<br />At the right end of the memorial, the other figure is that of a man. He wears sandals, with a robe around his waist and his legs crossed at the ankle. He holds a sword across his lap with his right hand and holds fasces upright with his left. Text to his left reads:<br />The Incorruptible Statesman Whose Walk was Upon the Mountain Ranges of the Law<br />Between the man and woman figures and the Buchanan statue are 1.5 foot tall granite benches that run along the base of the eight-foot tall back wall, on both sides.<br />Trees hang over the top of the memorial wall from behind, and the plaza area is ringed with trees, providing ample shade throughout the space.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "The Joaquin Miller Cabin was home to the eccentric poet when he was a resident of Washington, DC between 1883 and 1885.  <br /> <br /> The L-shaped cabin was originally built near the present day intersection of 16th St NW and Belmont St NW. In 1911, when the area was being developed into Meridian Hill Park, the cabin was almost demolished. Fans and supporters of Miller petitioned to have the cabin saved and it was painstakingly taken apart and re-built in Rock Creek Park.<br /> <br /> The Board of Control, who was managing Rock Creek Park at the time were against the move. California Senators intervened and had the cabin moved to Rock Creek Park. It was dedicated in 1912. The cabin was used for a time as a shelter and then as a concession stand for visitors to the park. Pherne Miller, Joaquin Miller's neice rented the cabin for over twenty years between 1931 and the 1950s. She not only sold candy and soda to park visitors, she taught art on the grounds surrounding int. In the 1970s, the Joaquin Miller Cabin poetry series began. The group originally held their meetings inside the cabin but crowds eventually exceeded the space avilable and the series was moved outside. The series was moved to the Rock Creek Park Nature Center auditorium in 2011 and renamed \"The Joaquin Miller Poetry Series.\" ",
    "audioDescription": "The Joaquin Miller Cabin is a one and a half story log cabin. Concrete fills the gaps between the logs. The roof is made of wooden shingles and has a steep peak. There are two windows at the highest points of the peaked roof while on the first floor every wall has either a door or a set of windows. Doors and window sashes are painted brown. The cabin sits among trees near Milkhouse Ford.",

    "audioDescription": "(405 words)<br />The Kahlil Gibran Memorial is located on the east side of Massachusetts Avenue NW in the Embassy Row neighborhood of Washington, DC. The memorial park is about four hundred fifty-five yards (415 meters) northwest of Rock Creek. Directly across Massachusetts Avenue to the west is the Winston Churchill Memorial, and across the street to the northwest of the Churchill Memorial is Observatory Circle.<br />The memorial sits on two acres recessed from the sidewalk and along the edge of Woodland-Normanstone Terrace Park, a wooded forest along its western back side.<br />A twenty-five-foot long concrete foot bridge leads from the sidewalk across a shrub and flower-lined grassy area into the memorial. There are no steps in the area and although the backside is at a slight elevation, it is very wheelchair accessible.<br />The foot bridge leads to a circular arrangement of benches, paths, and walls. In the front-center is a three-foot high, fifty-foot long semi-circular gray marble wall with two-foot high curbed front, and adorned with a bronze head of Kahlil Gibran. An ornate star design encircled with a twelve-inch ring of granite adorns the ground in front of the wall and sculpture. The sculptured head emerges from a group of branches, foliage, and two foot-long doves to the right, along the wall. Inscribed on the front of the wall is:<br />KAHLIL GIBRAN<br />Poet Philosopher<br />A sidewalk leads around from either side of the wall and joins a thirty-five-foot wide, circular arrangement of benches at a slightly higher elevation than the marble wall. In the center of the benches is a small pool in the shape of an eight-pointed star, ten feet across. The limestone benches, ten feet long each and three on each side, are inscribed with the details of Gibran's life and quotes from his writings.<br />The plaza floor is designed with granite stars, octagons, and other geometrical shapes. Around the front edge of the upper plaza area is an inscription on the ground that reads:<br />THINK OF ME WHEN YOU SEE THE SUN COMING DOWN TOWARD ITS SETTING<br />SPREADING ITS RED GARMENT UPON THE MOUNTAIN<br />An outer walkway encircles the entire memorial and spans two hundred twenty-five feet around with a three-foot tall stone block outer wall.<br />Bushes and trees hang over the outer area and the forest behind provides an abundance of shade. A grass lawn lines the front of the memorial fountain area and a garden bed sits at its front edge.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

The site was called Meridian Hill because it was on the exact longitude of the original District of Columbia milestone marker, placed on April 15, 1791. In 1829, the mansion became departing President John Quincy Adams' home. After its conversion to a public park, Union troops encamped on the grounds during the Civil War.</p> <p>The U.S. government purchased the grounds in 1910. Landscape architects George Burnap and Horace Peaslee planned an Italian style garden.

Together, OPBG landscape architects <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/george-burnap.htm\">George Burnap</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/horace-peaslee.htm\">Horace Peaslee</a> prepared designs for the park that integrated features from the former estate’s landscape and incorporated new elements for public park use. </p> <p>Today, Montrose Park is a sixteen-acre park located on the heights overlooking Georgetown in northwest Washington, DC.

    "bodyText": "The Mount Zion Cemetery dates back to 1808 when it was the Old Methodist Episcopal burying ground, purchased by Dumbarton Street M.E. Church. The church’s congregation at that time was 50% black and was a mix of both freed and enslaved individuals. By 1816, black members of the church separated and created Mount Zion Methodist church. They took over the burying ground from Dumbarton Street M.E in 1879.<br /> <br /> In 1842 a group of free black women created a society—the Female Union Band Society—that pledged to care for one another “in sickness and in death”. They had an adjoining plot of land to the Old Methodist Burying ground.<br /> <br /> The two cemetery plots have collectively known as Mount Zion Cemetery.<br /> <br /> In the beginning at the twentieth century, many of the families with connections to the burial were forced from the area. Headstones toppled over. Grass grew tall and wild. Trash littered the grounds. In the 1960’s developers saw an opportunity to build town homes and apartments here. While some people saw an opportunity to profit from the sale of the land, others saw a painful loss of their collective community history. They saw the loss of a vital chapter---the path to freedom. Just beneath the hill, there is a vault that has long been believed to be a stop on the Underground Railroad. In 1976 volunteers from the Afro-American Bicentennial Corporation cleared away the tall grass, the garbage and cleaned up the cemetery. They petitioned for it to be protected—and won. <br /> <br /> Today the cemetery is managed by The Mt. Zion / Female Union Band Historic Memorial Park, Inc. For more information and a tour of the cemetery visit their website at <a href=\"https://www.mtzion-fubs.org/\">https://www.mtzion-fubs.org/</a>",

    "audioDescription": "(381 words)<br />Muhlenberg Park is located in a park bounded by Connecticut Avenue, Ellicott Street, and 36th Street NW in Washington's Wakefield neighborhood. Crosswalks at each corner provide pedestrian access.<br />A twelve-step cement staircase leads up to the memorial plaza from Connecticut Avenue on the east side. A seventy-foot wide, thirty-five-foot deep plaza area stands in front of the statue, with a forty-foot wide, twenty-foot deep grass area in the middle. Two cement benches on each side of the plaza. Each bench is about six feet long and 1.5 feet high.<br />Just on the west side of the plaza, opposite and facing the steps, is a four-foot tall bronze bust sculpture of Muhlenberg displayed on an about eight-foot high limestone pedestal with a two-step, octagonal cement base and surrounded on three sides by a low 1.5-foot tall concrete wall. Trees line the back and both sides of the low wall.<br />The sculpture depicts Muhlenberg in civilian dress, with his hands resting on an open Bible before him. The bust faces to the east, toward Connecticut Avenue. Behind him on the next block is St. Paul's Lutheran Church.<br />The pedestal features a star in the middle of an inscription which reads:<br />John Peter<br />Gabriel<br />Muhlenberg<br />1746-1807<br />(star here)<br />Serving<br />His Church<br />His Country<br />His State<br />Along the front face of the wall, on its right end, is an inscription that reads:<br />In Gratitude<br />to<br />John F.

The sphere was vandalized in the 1960s and later disappeared after it had been removed from Meridian Hill Park for repair. The National Park Service is designing and building a replacement armillary sphere thanks to a generous donation.<br /> <br /> An armillary sphere is a map of astronomical objects first used in China approximately 200 B.C.E. Similar spheres were used frequently in Europe during the 7th century to illustrate the Ptolemaic theory of the earth-centered universe. The metal rings of the sphere represent the great circles of the heavens arranged in degrees for angular measurement. An armillary sphere appears on Portugal's flag, referencing the importance of maritime navigation in the nation's history.<br /> <br /> Cast in bronze, the Armillary Sphere was designed to be 6 feet 6 inches high, 5 feet 8 inches in diameter and 17.79 feet in circumference, and rested on a pedestal of green Conway granite 3 feet 4 inches high designed by the park architect, Horace Peaslee. To this day, the pedestal exists in its original location within Meridian Hill Park.<br /> <br /> The sphere contained the signs of the zodiac in bas-relief on the outside of the circle, along with the hours of the day marked in Roman numerals. A bronze arrow formed the axis of the sphere, and in the center was the figure of the winged \"Child Greeting the Sun.\"<br /> <br /> The original sphere was laid out in two equal circles that crossed each other at right angles and bisected one another. One circle represented the Meridian and the other the Equator. The meridian was divided into four 90° areas and the equator into 360°. A third circle, the Ecliptic, passed obliquely through the meridian and equator and intersected the equator at an angle of 23 1/4° at two points known as the equinoxes. Two smaller circles at either end represented the Arctic and Antarctic regions and were placed at a position 23 1/4° from their respective poles. A circle representing the line of longitude was placed at right angles to the meridian but bisecting the sphere east and west and thus passing through the north and south poles. A bronze gnomon shows the Axis of the earth and casts a shadow upon the equatorial band. On the inside of this band are represented the minutes of the day in 5 minute increments and there are star symbols that represent the hours of the night.<br /> <br /> If you're an armillary sphere enthusiast, check out the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/sarah-rittenhouse-armillary-sphere.htm\">Sarah Rittenhouse Armillary Sphere</a> in Montrose Park.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(201 words)<br />The site of the Armillary Sphere is located at the south end of Meridian Hill Park, in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, DC.<br />From the intersection of 16th street and W streets, NW, proceed north on the east side 16th street about one hundred feet (30 meters). Turn right into the park entrance and proceed about one hundred feet (30 meters) to the east, 30 feet (9 meters) to the right, and 50 feet (15 meters) to the left, and you will be at the south end of the reflecting pool.<br />At the center of the plaza area on the south side of the pool is a circular bush, about five feet tall and 12 feet wide. This was the location of the Armillary Sphere. This section of the plaza is semicircular, with the curved side to the south. Along the curved south side of the plaza is a curved concrete balustrade with 6 urns on top of the railing. At each end of the balustrade, it is topped with a 6-foot tall obelisk.<br />To the north of the sphere site is the reflecting pool, which measures about one hundred twenty feet (36 meters) across and sixty feet (18 meters) long.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Although it is preserved for its architecture today, it was originally preserved through a case of mistaken identity and a desire to remember George Washington.</p> <p>In 1791, George Washington and city planner Pierre L'Enfant were surveying the newly established District of Columbia. L'Enfant's ambitious plan for the city's layout depended on negotiating with local landowners for right of way. During one of these meetings, Washington and L'Enfant stayed in Georgetown's Fountain Inn at 31st and K Streets. The inn was better known to locals as Suter's Tavern, after its owner John Suter. </p> <p>Over on Bridge Street (now M Street), John Suter's son, John, Jr., ran a clock shop in today's Old Stone House. As the years passed, local memory conflated the two buildings associated with the two John Suters. Thus, the desire to honor and remember George Washington's 1791 visit combined with a fuzzy memory led to the Old Stone House's preservation while so much changed around it.</p> <p>The house was the site of a car dealership when the federal government purchased the property in 1953. The National Park Service opened the house to the public in 1960. Today, the house is a rare example of pre-Revolutionary architecture. Among the House's furnishings, you may find a clock built by one-time owner John Suter, Jr.</p> <h4>Hours:</h4> Open daily (ground floor only), with holiday hours from 11:00 a.m.-7:00 p.m.",

Shoemaker street ends along the left side of the barn, where there is handicap parking and a bicycle rack on the sidewalk. Shoemaker street then bends around to the left and returns to Tilden street.<br />The barn is a three-story building approximately twenty-six feet wide and thirty-five feet long and is constructed of blue granite. The white front wall of the barn is made of wood boards. The rear wall contains a single white wooden window on each of the three levels. The right-side wall facing Rock Creek contains four irregularly spaced white wooden windows, two on each of the first two floors. The left-side wall has one window on the first and second level.<br />On the front side, are three small one by three-foot windows located above the brown wooden double barn door and a two by three-foot window above the brown wooden main entry door on the right side. The entry door features an x pattern on both its upper and lower halves. Three windows are located at the third floor just below the gabled roof. The roof is of gabled wood shingles with a single brick chimney.<br />Facing the front of the barn, a fifteen-step cement staircase with metal rails on both sides leads from the right to a gravel pathway below that runs north-south between the barn and Peirce Mill, which is about 50 feet (fifteen meters) to the south.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>Peirce Mill was built on Rock Creek in 1829 at the behest of Isaac Peirce. Using the moving water as a power source, the mill ground corn, wheat, and rye. Succeeding generations further developed the mill, sawmill, orchard, and tree nursery. In 1890, an act of Congress incorporated the mill and 350 acres of the property into Rock Creek Park. The mill operated until the turbine's shaft broke in 1897. At the turn of the century, park managers went to work improving the site, improving roads and bridges and adding a new dam that provided a nice aesthetic for picnickers. In the 1920s, the mill was converted into a tea room complete with electric lights. In 1933, New Deal legislation transferred Rock Creek Park to the National Park Service. The National Park Service restored the mill and grounds to their historic layout by 1936. <br /> <br /> The mill is open seasonally.

It is constructed of blue-grey and brown stone granite.<br />The mill is approached from the northwest by a forty-foot long stone path. The front door is painted brown and is flanked on either side by a double hung window with wooden sashes and sills painted white. The three windows of the second story are of the same design. Two five-foot long log benches are set on either side of the front door.<br />Moving clockwise from the front, the left side of the building has two windows on each of three levels. Facing the back, a forty-five-foot cement walkway leads northwest from the bike/walkway path to the wooden back door. Three windows line the second and third stories, and windows sit on either side of the back door.<br />On the remaining side, sets of two windows are on the second and third levels. The first floor has windows on either side of a wooden dutch door. A ground-level door is set at the back corner of the building.<br />Along the left side of the building to the northeast, a fifty-foot stone water channel runs from the northeast and turns left as it approaches the building, diverting water under a ten-foot tall wooden water wheel connected to the structure. The channel continues southeast and runs another seventy-five feet downhill and under the bike/walkway as it returns water to Rock Creek.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(403 words)<br />The Springhouse is located on Tilden Street, NW, eight hundred feet west and uphill from the intersection with Beach Drive, on a grass median strip between the dual lanes of traffic on Tilden Street.<br />There is no walkway access to this area, and both directions of Tilden street are heavily trafficked.<br />The blue granite Springhouse structure has two stories, with a brick chimney and a gabled wood shingled roof. The ground floor has three windows; the upper level has one window at either end of the building. The front and back windows both have wooden brown shutters, and front and back doors are also wooden and painted brown.<br />The house is about forty-feet long and twenty-feet wide. It sits in the slope of the large incline of Tilden street, and the first floor and front door are sunken into the ground about two feet in the front and four feet in the back.<br />A stone wall sunken into the ground makes an approximate one-hundred fifty-foot perimeter around the house. A small stone staircase of six steps leads down to the house on the right side.<br />A thirty-foot tall tree stands just to the left of the house, and a larger fifty-foot tree sits in the back, providing an abundance of shade to the entire area.<br />A two-foot high wood railing guards the house from the street along the backside.<br />About fifty feet downhill and to the east is a three by four-foot wayside. The sign is a faded light brown and in poor condition. Titled in large letters across the top and bracketed with a floral pattern on both ends reads: Springhouse. A similar floral pattern with two horizontal lines runs across the bottom of the sign.<br />Text on the left side below reads:<br />This small stone structure was built by Isaac Pierce in 1801. Constructed around a natural spring, it was used as a cooling place for cheese, milk and butter products during the hot summer months. It also provided a clean water supply.<br />A fireplace provided warmth during the winter for cheesemaking and buttermaking activities.<br />The right side of the sign shows a picture of a small two-story house with two windows on the front upper level. A large tree sits to the left and the house is enclosed by a wood rail fence running in front of the property. Beneath the picture is written:<br />Pierce Springhouse (1801).<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "This street, and many small alleyways like it, had their own communities. While some were rough around the edges, others were vibrant, loving spaces. The Alley Dwelling Act forced change. What was on the surface a way to ‘clean up’ the more worse for wear areas of Georgetown (and the City of Washington), in reality was a way to force African Americans from their homes.<br /> Many of these structures were built in the early 1800s by affluent Georgetown residents for their enslaved African American and poor white staff members. Eventually, families were able to purchase the homes. Many owned several structures and would rent rooms out. The Alley Dwelling Act put an end to leasing rooms and demanded that these become single family homes. Property values were assessed and though a family may have owned a home for generations, the current generation could not afford the property taxes that were newly increased and levied against them. Many of the homes, without electricity, heat, or indoor plumbing were deemed “unsafe for human habitation” and were set to be demolished. However, instead of demolishing these homes, many of them were upgraded, flipped, and then sold to “New Dealers” coming to town to work for the newly expanded government. The Alley Dwelling Act was the final nail in the coffin of Herring Hill.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Poplar Alley is lined with privately owned residences.

The park is bordered by 15th, 16th, W, and Euclid streets NW, and sits on a prominent hill one and one-half miles (2.5 kilometers) north of the White House.<br />From the intersection of 16th and W streets, NW, proceed north on the east side of 16th Street about one hundred feet (30 meters). Turn right into the park entrance and proceed about one hundred feet (30 meters) to the east and you will be at the south end of the Reflecting Pool. The pool sits in the middle of a larger plaza. On the far east side of this plaza lower level is the James Buchanan Memorial.<br />The pool measures about one hundred twenty feet (36 meters) across and sixty feet (18 meters) long. A 1.5 foot high ledge lines the pool and provides a one-foot top-side space for sitting. Fountains shoot water up about two feet from the pool's four corners.<br />Beyond the pool to the north are the cascade waterfalls, a cement structure of thirteen waterfall steps. Water flows down the steps and into a pool basin below.<br />South of the Reflecting Pool, the plaza projects to the south in a semi-circular area with a three-foot-tall balustraded cement wall on the south edge. A large bush in the middle of this semicircular area marks the former site of the armillary sphere.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(307 words)<br />The Robert Emmett Memorial sits in a small triangular park along Massachusetts Avenue, NW, and is bordered by S street, NW to the north and 24th street to the east. There are crosswalks at each corner, but the only sidewalk is on the Massachusetts Avenue side. Massachusetts frequently carries heavy traffic.<br />The triangle is a grassy patch of land and the memorial sits about thirty feet (9 meters) from the 24th and Massachusetts Avenue intersection, near the center of the triangle. From the intersection of Massachusetts and 24th, walk about thirty feet (9 meters) northwest along Massachusetts. On the right, a path of three-foot wide asphalt circles lead to the statue. There are bushes on either side of the path.<br />On the right, just before reaching the pathway to the statue, a three by four-foot wayside sits about ten feet from the sidewalk.<br />Proceeding up the path to the statue, three-foot diameter asphalt pavers lead to and encircle the Emmett statue. An eight-foot long curved stone bench is on the right of the path, just beyond the wayside but before reaching the statue.<br />The seven-foot tall bronze statue sits on a five-foot high pink stone pedestal, surrounded by circular stone pavers and encircled with two to four foot high bushes and shrubs as well as a few trees.<br />A three stone wide cobblestone border runs along the base of the statue. Inscribed on the front pedestal panel is text that reads:<br />ROBERT EMMETT<br />IRISH PATRIOT<br />1778-1803<br />A faded image that appears to be a design of a harp sits below, and beneath is an inscription that reads:<br />Lidia-saon-eine<br />Emmett stands proudly, looking slightly upward and wearing a coat with long tail and knickers. His right arm is outstretched, and right hand is held open. His weight is on his back-left leg and his right foot points forward.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "In 1886, Olmsted Sr. warned that “the charmingly wooded glen of Rock Creek [was] in private hands, subject any day to be laid waste”. Throughout his career, Olmsted fought hard to warn anyone who would listen of the dangers that lay in keeping such beautiful land private.<br /> <br /> It wasn’t until Olmsted Jr. was chosen to be part of the McMillan commission, in charge of developing both the core and park system of Washington, D.C., that Rock Creek Park would get its deserved attention.<br /> <br /> Once on the commission, Olmsted Jr. encouraged his colleagues to endorse the acquisition of land for new public parks and scenic drives throughout the city, including the preservation of Rock Creek Valley in its entirety.<br /> <br /> By 1918, Olmsted Jr. and his brother John were busy on the plan for Rock Creek Park. They proposed dividing the landscape into six distinct areas that remain today. The topographical and psychological backbone of the park, their report stated, would be the area along the banks of the creek and its tributaries. This “Valley Section”, as it was described, would be preserved in its natural state, with only the addition of scattered picnic spots.<br /> <br /> Rock Creek Park’s “woodland” would consist of the western hills and plateaus, contained in the South by Military Road. Olmsted Brothers saw the “woodland” area as a spot for intensive use; their report recommended the installation of hiking paths and numerous picnic groves. Olmsted Brothers even saw an area beyond their “woodland”, designated “wilder woodland”, and it was to be preserved to the highest degree.",

    "audioDescription": "(491 words)<br />The Senator Newlands Memorial is located at Chevy Chase Circle, on the border between the Chevy Chase neighborhood of Washington, DC NW and the community of Chevy Chase, Maryland. The circle is intersected by Connecticut Avenue from the north and south, and Western Avenue from the southwest and northeast.<br />The memorial consists of a large fountain, about one hundred twenty feet in circumference, with water that shoots up twenty feet in a plume from its center into a pool area below. A two-foot tall high cement perimeter wall surrounds the fountain. An eighteen-inch wide stone walkway rings the fountain at a one-step elevation along its base.<br />Access into the circle is very difficult. Busy traffic around the circle is a constant, though there are two dedicated walkways to access the memorial. Extreme caution should be used in crossing via the walkways into the circle.<br />A seventy-two-foot long, eight-foot wide stone walkway leads into the fountain area from the street at north, south, east, and west points.<br />A twenty-foot wide garden area of bushes and flowers rings the outer edge of the circle. Just beyond the bushes, a line of wood benches circles the inner plaza area.<br />At the south end of the fountain wall, a four by two-foot-tall stone block is inscribed with:<br />Francis Griffith Newlands<br />1848-1917<br />Senator from Nevada<br />His Statesmanship Held True Regard for the Interests of All Men<br />Founder of Chevy Chase<br />This Fountain Erected in 1933 - Authorized by Act of Congress<br />On the stone plaza floor in front of the inscribed block is a three by two-foot bronze plaque with raised lettering that reads:<br />The Chevy Chase Land Company of Montgomery County, Maryland<br />On the Occasion of its 100th Anniversary<br />1890-1990<br />Rededicates this Circle and Restores this Fountain<br />In Memory of its Founder<br />Senator Francis G. Newlands<br />Along the top of the fountain wall at its south end is an inscription carved into the wall that reads:<br />Newlands Memorial Fountain <br />On the east side of the circle, just outside the bench area, is a five-foot tall, one and a half-foot wide cement boundary stone monolith sitting on a white base. On its southern face is a nine by twelve-inch design of the Maryland flag, featuring a checkerboard and cross design in alternating corners. Beneath is inscribed: Maryland. The opposite, north face has an equal-sized design of a man standing on a pedestal and woman below him to the right. Beneath is inscribed: District of Columbia. The monolith has a ribbed design of horizontal and vertical lines surrounding the emblems, though the pattern appears on all four sides.<br />An identical five-foot tall cement monolith sits on the west side of the circle, just outside of the bench area. This monolith has a darker tone due to black soot on its surface. Here the order of emblems alternates compared to the monolith on the east, with the District of Columbia emblem on the south, and Maryland on the north.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

It is an ancient method that can help decrease the stress in a hectic world. Visitors to Georgetown Waterfront Park are encouraged to visit the labyrinth and take part in traveling this ancient meditative pathway.<br /> <br /> Labyrinths and mazes differ since labyrinths have only one path--there are no dead ends in a labyrinth and no way to get lost.<br /> <br /> Visitors to the labyrinth are encouraged to follow the tan part of the pathway into the labyrinth. Follow these steps for a mentally calming experience.</p> <h4>Prepare:</h4> Take a moment to relax and reflect. Take deep breaths and slowly step on to the tan pathway. <h4>The Journey In:</h4> <p>Release concerns and quiet the mind, continue to take slow, deep breaths.</p> <h4>The Center:</h4> Receive what this moment offers--some people choose to kneel while others stand still for a moment. Others like to close their eyes or bow their heads.   <h4>The Journey Out:</h4> Review and reflect on your way out of the labyrinth. Keep taking those deep relaxing breaths. <h4>Exit:</h4> Carry the experience into your life and come back and visit the labyrinth again!<br /> <br />   <h2> </h2>",

A walkway leads across Water street at this location.<br />Three, three-foot wide cement planters stand between the street and a pedestrian walkway that runs east-to-west along the waterfront park, a six hundred fifty-yard (594 meters), one hundred twenty-foot (36 meters) wide stretch of grass lawn and gently rolling hills along the Potomac River. Trees and benches line the walkway and a twenty-foot wide garden area sits on the south side of the path.<br />Just beyond the walkway and set in the grass lawn, is a sixty-foot wide (18 meters) circular maze of one-foot-wide tan lines set over a green surface. Visitors are encouraged to follow the tan path from the south-side entrance and try to find its center as it winds, bends, and switches back and forth throughout the circle.<br />A one by two-foot white sign with brown lettering is set on a stake at the Labyrinth's north side. A brown border across the top reads in white lettering:<br />Rock Creek Park<br />National Park Service<br />U.S. Department of the Interior<br />Below in brown lettering is written:<br />Labyrinth<br />An Ancient Meditation Path<br />Walking a Labyrinth<br />Prepare Take a moment to relax and reflect<br />The Journey In Release concerns and quiet the mind<br />The Center Receive what this moment offers<br />The Journey Out Review and reflect<br />Exit Carry the experience into your life<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "Woodley Lane Bridge was constructed in 1888 and represented the latest style in light-weight bridges. Often referred to as the \"High\" bridge, it stood 54 feet above the creek, 450 feet long, 32 feet wide and was supported by two red sandstone abutments. In 1897, the bridge was dismantled while the new, larger Taft Bridge was being constructed. The span provided access to \"Woodley,\" President Grover Cleveland's summer estate [which is] still standing today, located northwest of the bridge. The name \"Woodley\" is believed to have been derived from the large stand of immense oak and chestnut trees found upon the grounds.<br /> <br /> The information panel sits near the US Park Police Edgewater Police Stable parking area and is accessible to the public. The bridge abutments might be visible in the winter and autumn when vegetation is sparse.",
    "audioDescription": "(368 words)<br />The \"Woodley Lane Bridge\" wayside is located in the northwest quadrant of Washington, DC, off of Beach Drive NW.<br />From the Connecticut Avenue overpass of the William Howard Taft Bridge, travel north on Beach Drive and turn right into the parking lot after about one hundred feet (30 meters). Proceed into the lot over a seventy-five-foot (23 meters) bridge over Rock Creek. Continue into the parking lot about one hundred feet (30 meters) and the wayside will be on the right, set about ten feet off the parking lot in a grassy area.<br />The grass area is about sixty feet wide and forty feet long. Rock Creek runs right to left across the north end of the lawn. Trees and overgrowth line the side of the creek, and the arches of the Taft Bridge loom in the background about two hundred feet to the north.<br />The southeast end of the parking lot is home to the United States Park Police Horse Mounted Training Center, housed in a one-story tan and brown building about one hundred feet wide. Two picnic tables sit in front of the building.<br />The wayside is a two by three-foot light tan sign, titled at the top in black letters to read:<br />Woodley Lane Bridge<br />1888-1897<br />Below is a black and white image of a creek running from right to left. A bridge structure spans the valley at the right side and is titled: Calvert Street Bridge. On the left a lower road structure is labeled Woodley Lane Bridge. Text below reads:<br />View of Rock Creek Valley circa 1890-1895<br />Courtesy Columbia Historical Society<br />Text at the bottom of the sign reads:<br />Woodley Lane Bridge was constructed in 1888 and represented the latest style in light-weight bridges.

    "audioDescription": "(513 words)<br />The Korean War Veterans Memorial is located south of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, and north of Independence Avenue SW in the West Potomac Park of Washington, DC<br />From the intersection of westbound Independence Avenue and Daniel French Drive, SW, travel east about eighty feet along Independence Avenue. Turn left and proceed up the pedestrian walkway four hundred feet to the north. Turn right and proceed one hundred seventy feet to the Korean War Veterans Memorial north entrance.<br />The design of the Korean War Veterans Memorial is of a triangle intersecting with a circle. North and south walkways lead into the memorial through the sides of a forest area to a field of statues.<br />Nineteen stainless steel statues, all about seven feet tall, stand in patches of Juniper bushes and are separated by polished granite strips that run horizontally between them. The men are spaced about ten feet apart. The field is about one hundred feet wide at its west end and narrows to a point about one hundred fifty feet to the east.<br />The troops wear helmets and ponchos covering their weapons and equipment. Some carry rifles and radios and appear to have backpacks under their ponchos. The men are of varying ethnicities. All are generally faced towards the memorial center to the east, although some look back behind them and to the sides as they walk.<br />A polished black granite wall, about six feet tall, spans the south side of the south walkway that leads to the center of the memorial. The wall stretches east one hundred sixty-four feet towards the memorial center. Over two thousand five hundred white images of soldiers are etched along the black surface of the wall. The images of the silver military statues across the walkway also reflect in the shiny wall surface, making the nineteen statues appear to be thirty-eight.<br />Along the north edge of the northside walkway into the memorial is an angled granite curb inscribed with the names of twenty-two countries separated by an emblem of a map of the world set over a pattern of circles and lines and bracketed by a wreath.<br />Set at the east end of the memorial is a tree-lined circular plaza. In the center is a shallow circular pool, two hundred fifty feet in circumference, lined with black granite and surrounded by a grove of linden trees and seven granite benches. The pool features a one-foot waterfall around its edge.<br />The trees are trimmed to have a block-shaped leaf design and allow for six feet of clearance space underneath. An inner row of trees surrounds the pool and a second row is set about ten feet back along the outer edge of the plaza.<br />A black granite wall, about four feet tall lines the south side of an alcove that protrudes into the pool. An inscription of the north side of the wall reads:<br />FREEDOM IS NOT FREE<br />An inscription on a low angled curb on the opposite side of the alcove displays statistics on the number of US and United Nations casualties of the Korean War.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(188 words)<br />The Korean War Veterans Memorial is located south of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, and north of Independence Avenue SW in West Potomac Park, Washington, DC<br />From the intersection of westbound Independence Avenue and Daniel French Drive, SW, travel east about eighty feet along Independence Avenue. Turn left and proceed up the pedestrian walkway two hundred feet to the north. Turn right and travel along the walkway one hundred feet, through trees on either side. As you continue, the trees begin to clear and a group of nineteen silver statues of military men stand in a field of bushes to the left. To the right of the walkway is the beginning of the Korean War Veterans Memorial: Wall of Faces.<br />The black polished granite wall stands about six feet high, consists of forty-one panels and stretches east one hundred sixty-four feet towards the memorial center. Over two thousand five hundred white images of soldiers are etched along the black surface of the wall. The images of the silver military statues across the walkway also reflect in the shiny wall surface, making the nineteen statues appear to be thirty-eight.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION <br />",

The National Mall is the continuation of that space where congressionally authorized park icons, such as the Washington Monument, WWII and Lincoln Memorials stand. This historic expanse is the linear area between the Potomac River and Capital Reflecting Pool. In addition to the memorial core, the park includes some 156 reservations, circles, fountains and other open spaces, all of which serve as the nation’s front yard. Ford’s Theatre, The House where Lincoln died, Potomac Park, Hains Point and Pennsylvania Avenue NHS are also among the park managed areas that constitute National Mall and Memorial Parks.</p> <p>Having over 1,000 acres of National Park Service managed land at the heart of our nation’s capital, National Mall and Memorial Parks provides visitors with abundant opportunities to get in touch with our heritage. With everything from colossal monuments to commemorative gardens, from presidential inaugurals to civil rights demonstrations, National Mall and Memorial Parks hosts history in the making. Numerous First Amendment activities and special events are held in the park each year to honor the courage, sacrifice and devotion to duty of war veterans; celebrate the United States commitment to freedom, equality and democratic ideals; and enjoy symbolic architecture, historic vistas and renowned natural landscapes. </p>",

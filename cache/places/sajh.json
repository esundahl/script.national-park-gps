    "bodyText": "On May 10, 1854, Henry Webber, the first American to stay for a significant period on San Juan Island landed on our shores for the second time. Henry Webber was an assistant customs inspector, sent to the island by US customs inspector <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/ebla\">Isaac Ebey</a> to monitor the newly established <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/belle-vue-sheep-farm.htm\">Belle Vue Sheep Farm</a>. This British establishment was the first non-native settlement on San Juan Island and its establishment in December of 1853 was intended to assert British sovereignty over the San Juan Archipelago. Henry Webber’s presence was an official maneuver by local American officials that demonstrated that the US did not accept Britain’s claims of sovereignty. Five years prior to the Pig War, Webber and Belle Vue Sheep Farm manager Charles Griffin turned a tense and acrimonious situation into a personal friendship that defused a potential international confrontation.<br /> <br /> On April 21, Weber and Ebey came to San Juan Island to confront the Hudson’s Bay Company’s local personnel and assert American sovereignty. After a tense encounter with Belle Vue Sheep Farm manager Charles Griffin, Ebey left Webber in a tent directly behind Griffin’s residence, with an American flag hanging above it. When Griffin’s employees tried to arrest Weber, he “instantaneously presented a revolver pistol at the breast of the constable, telling him if he touched him he would certainly fire, giving as a reason at the time that he did not consider the constable’s office legal……and if he or any other man or men attempted to arrest him he should fire, and otherwise protect himself as long as a ball remained in any one of his pistols; he had two brace of pistols hung about his waste and breast and a knife thrust in his boot at the knee.” The constable retreated and recruited six additional men to serve as reinforcements in his confrontation with Webber, but Griffin refused to authorize them to use weapons.<br /> <br /> As night fell, San Juan Island was embroiled in an international standoff and an emotional Griffin wrote “Such a farce! If this is what is called law, then it is plainly rum law.” The next day, Webber left San Juan Island to report to his superiors and Griffin conferred with British officials as well. Both the Americans and British sides decided independently that neither side would use force to assert sovereignty over each other. Consequently, when Webber returned to San Juan Island on May 10, he and Griffin had little reason for conflict. While they reported to their local governments, they were no longer adversaries; in fact, these neighbors quickly became friends as Webber settled down for several months living on San Juan Island.<br /> <br /> Though conflict between American officials and the Hudson’s Bay Company would flare up again the next year, it never led to violence. The two nations began a tradition of deliberation and de-escalation that would prove valuable five years later during the Pig War. During the joint occupation (1860-1872), the international friendship which Griffin and Webber initiated would occur between American and British soldiers and officers on San Juan Island. The precedent for British soldiers celebrating the Fourth of July at American Camp had been laid.",

Because of the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sajh/learn/historyculture/the-pig-war.htm\">Pig War</a>, the American tax collector wished to annoy the English with this patriotic display.

This area, while less crowded than <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sajh/south-beach.htm\">South Beach</a>, is still a popular place to relax and have a picnic. Fires are not allowed on this beach. Remember to practice <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/leave-no-trace-seven-principles.htm\">Leave No Trace</a>! </p> <p paraeid=\"{a0c4ae2d-93f3-435f-bb88-9a925bdf56be}{153}\" paraid=\"970875299\">There’s plenty of activity here too! The mowed grass field is perfect for playing sports and other games. Berry lovers: keep an eye out for ripe strawberries in July and blackberries in August! You can launch kayaks from the shore. Its sheltered waters are far more tranquil than the wilder, unprotected coast at South Beach. However, swimming is still discouraged due to strong currents.

    "bodyText": "Afterglow Vista, also known as the McMillin Memorial Mausoleum, is the final resting place of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/tacoma-and-roche-harbor-lime-company.htm\">Tacoma and Roche Harbor Lime Company</a> founder John S. McMillin and his immediate family and McMillin’s personal secretary who was key to his work and was like a member of his family. During his lifetime, McMillin was a major force in the local community; under his leadership, the Tacoma and Roche Harbor Lime Company became the largest producer of lime in the West Coast and the dominant force in the economy of San Juan Island.<br /> <br /> This massive burial structure houses the remains of six members of his family and combines neoclassical elements with masonic symbolism. Surrounding its open air rotunda are six chairs on which the names of the individual buried under the chair are written surrounding a limestone table. Symbolically, this is supposed to represent the family dinner table and the unity of the McMillins during life and death.  Each chair has a corresponding column representing each individual along with a broken column which represents the unfinished work left behind after one's death. Afterglow Vista was an expensive project, costing $30,000 dollars at the time of its completion in 1936, which is approximately $640,000 in 2022 dollars. This expense led McMillin’s son who then led the company to cancel the installation of a monumental bronze roof which would have significantly increased its cost.<br /> <br /> These are not the only symbolic features at Afterglow Vista; a plaque at the site explains that: “<em>The structure is approached by two sets of stairs, representing the steps within the Masonic Order. The stairs on the east side of the mausoleum stand for the spiritual life of man. The winding in the path symbolizes that the future cannot be seen. The stairs were built in sets of three, five and seven. This represents the three stages of life (youth, manhood, age), the five orders of architecture (Tuscan, Doric, Iconic, Corinthian, Composite), the five senses, and the seven liberal arts and sciences (grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy).</em> <em>The columns were created to be the same size as those in King Solomon’s temple. The broken column represents the broken column of life-that man dies before his work is completed.</em> <em>The center of the mausoleum boasts the round table of limestone and concrete surrounded by six stone and concrete chairs. The chair bases are crypts for the ashes of the family, while the whole represents their reunion after death</em>.”<br /> <br /> Today, Afterglow Vista is a unique and beautiful place to visit. Located in deeply wooded land, visitors must traverse trails that lead through a much more modest cemetery where McMillin’s workers are buried. To get there from town, take Roche Harbor road left towards the sculpture park. Past the park and the runway there will be a be clearly marked trail with a wooden archway.<b style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"> </b>On dark and foggy nights, it can be a haunting and otherworldly place, so we recommend that you bring flashlights to ward off any fears. While there, you can contemplate the immense wealth and power that the McMillin family once held and the powerful vision that created this unique space.",

It soon expanded and became a formal corporation with operations across Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. Though its operations were concentrated in Alaska, it also played a major role in San Juan Island, where numerous fishermen had fish traps near this spot.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6b5627af-4175-4719-8ba6-5625911385c5}{23}\" paraid=\"75014871\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{6b5627af-4175-4719-8ba6-5625911385c5}{27}\" paraid=\"1294158224\">The Alaska Packers Association was not the only major company operating in these waters. As the industry expanded, “Big companies, especially Alaska Packers Association, and Pacific American Fisheries had monopolized the salmon fishing industry. The cost of the trap installation every year and the exclusive rights of canning the salmon dissuaded independents.” (Jacilee Wray, <em>The Salmon Bank: An Ethnohistory</em>, P.9) While corporations managed to monopolize the fish harvest, local entrepreneurs made good money supplying the fish camps. Former American Camp Sutler <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/edward-warbass.htm\">Edward Warbass</a> and local homesteader <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/eliza-jakle.htm\">Eliza Jakle</a> made good money selling water to the corporate fish camps in 1901 and 1902, local women found work at the cookhouses, and farmers sold their produce to feed the fishery workers. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6b5627af-4175-4719-8ba6-5625911385c5}{67}\" paraid=\"1799659534\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{6b5627af-4175-4719-8ba6-5625911385c5}{71}\" paraid=\"1842182742\">This rock marks the spot where the Alaska Packers Association's fish trap was located. Bill Jakle who grew up near this spot explains that, \"they had their trap right close here....probably fifty or sixty feet away from the rock where the pilings started.\" Fisherman Bill Mason further explained the unique nature of the fish trap at this location: “Believe it or not you could walk on the beach and [The Alaska Packers Association] had piling about every fifteen feet. And they had a wire up about three and a half feet high that you could hold onto and then a log that was cabled onto the piling that was driven into the ground. You could walk clear to the trap and then walk out there and see the fish living in the trap.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{6b5627af-4175-4719-8ba6-5625911385c5}{87}\" paraid=\"1220077655\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{6b5627af-4175-4719-8ba6-5625911385c5}{91}\" paraid=\"2100069100\">Today, no infrastructure is visible from this once-bustling industrial location. To untrained eyes, it appears that it was always a natural, marine environment, no different than any other pristine location in the San Juan Islands. This history reminds us of the  the possibility of rehabilitating and transforming industrial spaces through careful land management. </p>",

    "bodyText": "American Camp (primarily known as Camp San Juan Island) shown in this picture in1868, remained active through July 17, 1874. Eight companies or batteries from four regiments -- all regular army -- under command of 15 different officers manned this post. They endured isolation, bad food, worse quarters and crushing boredom. Unlike the officers, enlisted men seldom went home on leave because they could not afford the $300 for round-trip steam ship passage east. As an escape, some sneaked off to fraternize with civillians in nearby San Juan Village, knowingly risking company punishment, which might include carrying a 40-pound log around the post perimeter or riding a sawhorse all day. A few committed suicide, while many more deserted. Officers attempted to head off trouble by keeping the men busy with endless drill, which took place on the expanse of parade ground in front of you.",

    "bodyText": "When you do your laundry, do you ever think about the washing machine does to get them clean? At the push of a button, the machine automatically mixes soap and water, presses clothes to get out grime, and spins them to get out excess water. In about an hour, several days’ worth of clothing will be clean and you will have done, at most, 30 seconds worth of work to make this happen.<br /> <br /> Before the advent of electricity, cleaning clothes required extreme effort both in time and energy. Prior to washing, clothes would be soaked overnight. The next day, clothes would be soaped up, heated in boiling water, rinsed, wrung, dried, starched and ironed. Many of these steps would have to be repeated to make the laundry clean and presentable. Laundresses would have to haul all of the heavy water buckets necessary to perform this work to the place where their laundry machines were located. The laundress would also likely be required to make her own soap from lye or animal fat. For US soldiers based at American Camp, the hard work of the laundresses was essential to keeping their uniforms clean and presentable. <br /> <br /> This building once housed as many as three post laundress families. Laundresses were officially considered military staff, like soldiers, were subject to the Articles of War. The tradition of employing military laundresses was a British tradition continued by the US military. Laundresses were officially regulated by congress in an 1802 law which specified that they were entitled to rations, straw bedding, and access to medical care at the camp hospital. In many ways, these women were treated like the overwhelmingly male members of the military.<br /> <br /> Laundresses normally earned a dollar per month for washing clothes for each soldier. At American Camp laundresses did wash for about 20 soldiers; that means that the laundress earned more money than most of the enlisted soldiers at American Camp. A laundress had to be married to one of the soldiers stationed at a military facility. If she lost her husband, she was given 60 days to find another or would be escorted off the post. While some laundresses ran through several husbands, more typically they were married to sergeants and maintained stable households. One laundress, Catherine McGarey, eventually staked a claim and settled on the island after the border conflict ended. She and her family are interred in the island’s Catholic cemetery on Madden Lane.<br /> <br /> This building is one of two laundress’ quarters originally located at American Camp. After American Camp was dissolved as a military base it was moved to Friday Harbor where it was something of a tourist attraction. Since its relocation to its current site it serves as a reminder of the hard work that women did at frontier military bases and of the complex society that existed in these places.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Following the Pig War, Great Britain and the United States in 1859 agreed to a joint occupation of San Juan Island until the water boundary between the two nations could be settled, with camps located on opposite ends of the island.<br /> <br /> American Camp began on a grassy slope about 200 yards from the shoreline of Griffin Bay, where Capt. George E. Pickett and Company D, 9th U.S. Infantry landed on July 27, 1859, establishing an American military presence on San Juan Island that lasted 14 years.<br /> <br /> Pickett changed locations five days later perhaps in a quest for level ground though more likely because of his proximity to the British naval guns. Shortly after he arrived on August 10, Lt. Col. Silas Casey ordered his growing force (now 450 men) to relocate to the north slope of the ridge just north of the Hudson's Bay Company barns. To supplement the clapboard hospital, barracks, laundress and officers quarters Pickett had brought in, Casey ordered Sibley tents shipped in from Fort Steilacoom. The veteran colonel also ordered Corps of Engineers 2nd Lt. Henry Martyn Robert - later to achieve fame for his Rules of Order - to start work on an earthen fortification on the ridge top east of the new camp with a commanding view of both strait and bay.<br /> <br /> The post served its purpose as a deterrent until November it was finally agreed to a peaceful joint occupation by a company from each nation until the boundary dispute could be resolved. Casey and the bulk of the troops departed, along with the artillery from the redoubt.<br /> <br /> Many of the key American players in the Pig War incident, including Pickett and Casey, went on to serve in the American Civil War on both sides. Throughout the war, American Camp remained an active U.S. Army installation, garrisoned entirely by U.S. Army regulars, who rotated between Northwest Washington and the battlefields of the East.<br /> <br /> Eight companies from four regiments manned the post through some of the most tumultuous years of American history, until the camp was disbanded on July 17, 1874. They endured isolation, bad food, worse quarters and crushing boredom. Some soldiers were willing to risk company punishment to numb themselves with the rotgut whisky of old San Juan Town; some deserted; and some even committed suicide. But most endured and by so doing contributed to the legacy of peace we celebrate today.</p>",

    "bodyText": "On December 15, 1853, a group of European, Hawaiian, and Native American men (inand 1,639 sheep and other farm animals landed on San Juan Island. Led by local manager Charles Griffin, their goal was to transform San Juan Island into a massive sheep farm for the Hudson’s Bay Company. 6 years later, San Juan Island was home to 4500 sheep, 40 cattle, 5 yokes of oxen, 40 hogs (including one soon-to-be-famous Berkshire Boar), and 35 horses. All of these animals were supported by hay, oats, and potatoes raised on island and a 40-60 acre vegetable farm and accompanying orchards fed the Hudson’s Bay Company’s workers like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/po-alima-peter-friday.htm\">Po`alima</a> (Peter Friday) the town of Friday Harbor's namesake. By any measure, Belle Vue Sheep Farm was a success.<br /> <br /> The initial site of Belle Vue Sheep Farm was the American Camp prairie. Hudson's Bay Chief Facter, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/james-douglas-statue.htm\">James Douglas</a> described the site he chose as being along “the banks of a rivulet, in the centre of a dry elevated sheep run containing about 1500 acres of clear prairie land, besides a large extent of brush land. This land yields excellent grass and will support from 2000 to 3000 head of sheep.” This was a large coastal prairie which had been carefully managed to support game populations, camas meadows, and berry fields by the Coast Salish people who had inhabited San Juan Island since time immemorial.<br /> <br /> As the sheep population grew, the Belle Vue Sheep Farm hired Native American laborers to build the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-cowichan-road.htm\">Cowichan Road</a> which connected their home prairie to other grazing land throughout San Juan Island. In 1858 and 1859, American settlers who did not recognize Great Britain and by extent the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson’s Bay Company</a>’s ownership of San Juan Island, began to build homesteads, planting crops and grazing animals on Belle Vue Sheep Farm’s prairies. In 1859, the conflict between the Belle Vue Sheep Farm and American homesteaders erupted into the Pig War.<br /> <br /> When American forces landed in the summer of 1859, they quickly saw the advantage of the Belle Vue Sheep Farm’s location and built <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/visit-american-camp.htm\">American Camp</a> on the Home Prairie, where they further impacted sheep raising operations. The joint occupation of San Juan Island by British and American forces provided new opportunities on the island, draining away Belle Vue Sheep Farm’s workforce and by mid-1860 the once profitable Belle Vue Sheep Farm was a money losing operation. In 1862, Robert Firth replaced Charles Griffin as Belle Vue's manager; by 1865 Firth was leasing the farm from the Hudson's Bay Company. After the Joint Occupation ended in 1872, Firth homesteaded on the land, turning Belle Vue Sheep Farm's home prairie into his personal farm.",

    "bodyText": "In December of 1872, one month after the English Royal Marines left San Juan Island, a team of American soldiers scrupulously examined the value of every building at English Camp. They declared the Blockhouse, “old and worthless.” From the 1875 until 1966 when San Juan Island National Historical Park was created, sheep grazed in front of the blockhouse, while their owner, farmer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/crook-house.htm\">Jim Crook</a>, preserved the Blockhouse. Though it has had to have its lower floors reconstructed due to saltwater infiltration from Garrison Bay on multiple occasions, it has stood at English Camp since 1860.<br /> <br /> Officially designed as a fortification structure that could defend English Camp from attack, the blockhouse mostly acted as a place to confine civilians and soldiers who had broken laws or army rules. This blockhouse was likely based on the now nonexistent American Camp blockhouse which was originally a part of Fort Bellingham. Archaeological excavations also suggest that the blockhouse used to have a cobblestone porch and was surrounded by two sentry boxes where armed soldiers may have stood watch.The blockhouse never saw any combat activity. American and British forces developed an extremely friendly relationship from the very beginning of the joint occupation of San Juan Island in March of 1860. American soldiers and British soldiers regularly fraternized and delegations from English Camp traveled to American Camp to celebrate the 4<sup>th</sup> of July an Americans traveled to English Camp to celebrate the Queen’s Birthday.<br /> <br /> The friendships between American and English officers and solders made it easier for both sides to administer law and order on San Juan Island. The island’s status as a place that was not subject to civilian law and its large population of soldiers encouraged smuggling and vice on the island. The commanders of both camps worked together to apprehend murderers, expel fraudsters, and regulate white residents who took advantage of Native Americans. Though their decision making, such as the lenient punishment that they gave to a man they believed murder multiple Coast Salish people, reflects the racial attitudes of their time, the cooperative attitudes of these two proud military forces is noteworthy for its time and ours.<br /> <br /> Nearby the blockhouse are numerous other English Camp landmarks.

This plant is found in only three sites in the United States (Washington state only) and five sites in Canada. It is imperative to the survival of the sand verbena moth. Canada has listed the moth as endangered but in contrast, it has no legal protection under the Federal or State Endangered Species programs. The American Camp sand dunes are also home to the endangered island marble butterfly and contain dense patches of tumble mustard, one of three host plants to the butterfly. American Camp and its surrounding environs are the only place left in the world that contain this rare species. </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">For the survival of this ecosystem, sand must be free flowing. Invasive plants that stabilize the sand (Canada thistle and Himalayan blackberry) prohibit this from happening and invite other non-native plants to take root. The NPS is concerned with the effects of dune stabilization and the potential conversion of the dunes to shrublands or grasslands. We continue to control invasive plants while making sure no harm comes to fragile plants and animals. To help protect the dunes, please do not walk within fenced areas. Walking in the dunes can trample island marble butterfly host plants.</p>",

    "bodyText": "This house was built by Jim Crook, a farmer, inventor, and preservationist. Jim was a year old on January 5, 1876, when his parents, William and Mary, moved into English Camp, just over 3 years after the British military left.<br /> <br /> In this partial poem, written in 1960, Crook described his life on this land:<br /> <br /> “In English Camp<br /> Where British soldiers once did tramp<br /> There is where I've spent<br /> My long career. <br /> I've hauled the logs<br /> And drained the bogs<br /> And worked<br /> With horse and steer. <br /> I've handled wood cord after cord<br /> And threw it down a slippery board<br /> At the bottom near the bowI piled it high up on the scow.<br /> I plowed up fields filled with stumps<br /> With tools on wheels<br /> I smoothed the lumps.”<br /> <br /> The Crook family found English Camp “perfectly preserved” upon moving in. Unlike most island homesteaders of this period, who lived in small log cabins, the Crooks had their choice from numerous finished structures that included pantries, mantlepieces, and dedicated kitchens. They also took advantage of the already cleared land on the parade ground where they planted apple and cherry trees and sowed grain crops. Skilled carpenter William Crook transformed existing buildings into metal workshops, storage areas, and boatbuilding yards and housed his brother in the Officers’ Quarters. During this period, several structures were lost to accidental fires.<br /> <br /> By 1900, the year that Jim Crook began constructing this house, the Crook farm was a prosperous operation, housing 65 lambs and selling 500 pounds of cherries, as well as eggs, and wool. In 1901, William Crook died and Jim Crook inherited English Camp from his family. Shortly before his death, William Crook hid an enamel pot containing $1,395 in gold coins and currency in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-barracks.htm\">English Camp Barracks</a>. The missing pot of gold became a subject of island lore and legend until it was rediscovered by the National Park Service almost seventy years after it was hidden. It was given to William Crook’s 93 year-old daughter, Rhoda and the pot itself is now housed at the <a href=\"https://www.sjmuseum.org/\">San Juan Island Historical Museum</a>.<br /> <br /> The Crook House which was finished in 1903, is far more substantial than the surviving English Camp structures the Crooks had lived in for the past three decades. It was probably built to serve as a home for a large family, likely Jim and his sister Mary’s family. Unfortunately, Mary Davis’s children all died when they were young and Jim never married, making this home a rather large residence for three adults.<br /> <br /> Jim Crook said he “always had a mind for inventions.” When he was a boy, Jim’s father had to lock up the tools and workshops to prevent Jim from working on his inventions when his father wanted him to perform farm work. Amongst the farm equipment Jim built and designed were a loom, a spinning machine, a carding machine, and a tractor that also raked hay. Around the same time the Wright Brothers were designing the world’s first airplane, Jim was working on a flying machine. However, his father destroyed it before Jim could test it. Most ingeniously, Jim Crook created a system of pulleys that would automatically make his bed once he got up in the morning and tuck him into bed at night!<br /> <br /> In 1913, Jim Crook met with an unidentified “Englishman” who wished to see the cemetery on Young Hill. This visit eventually resulted in Jim’s official hire by the British government to maintain the Royal Marines’ cemetery at the rate of $10 per year. From at least the 1940s onwards, tourists regularly visited the Crooks’ farm to see the remains of English Camp with the assistance of Jim and Mary Crook, who served as tour guides.<br /> <br /> In 1963, as the legislation that would eventually create San Juan Island National Historical Park was introduced in Congress, Jim and his sister Rhoda, who had moved in with him after Mary's death in a 1959 automobile accident, transferred much of their land to Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission. After the park’s creation in 1966, Rhoda and Jim Crook still held title to 170 acres of land in this area, including this house, where they still lived. Jim Crook died in 1967 at the age of 93. Rhoda lived in the house until she died in 1972, at which point all of the land that her parents homesteaded, including the house that her brother had built, became part of San Juan Island National Historical Park.<br /> <br /> Jim Crook’s neighbor, Jerry Jameson said Jim left such a legacy that, “It has always been difficult for me to see where English Camp ended and Jim Crook began.” Today, you can see many of Crook’s inventions in the collection of the San Juan Historical museum. Much of its collection has been digitized and is accessible on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonruralheritage.org/digital/collection/sanjuan/search/searchterm/Jim%20Crook%20Collection/field/digita/mode/all/conn/and\">the internet</a>. You can read this <a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/sajh/crook_house_hsr.pdf\">historic structure report </a>to learn more about the interior of the Crook House and the Crook Family’s history on San Juan Island. In the fall, pear and plum trees that were part of Crook’s farmstead bear fruit and are available for visitors to pick. The park also preserves the nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sandwith-orchard.htm\">Sandwith Orchard</a>, planted by homesteading neighbors of the Crook family.",

    "bodyText": "Irish immigrant Eliza Furlong and her husband James Bryant settled on San Juan Island during the Pig War. They started a family during the joint occupation at their Cattle Point area farm. Her husband drowned in Jakle's Lagoon during her second pregnancy and Eliza was unable to find help for him.<br /> <br /> After his death, Eliza farmed her land on her own and raised her surviving son as a single mother. In 1869 married John Jakle, a soldier stationed at American Camp. Eliza and John Jakle had five children together John Jakle lacked Eliza’s work ethic and left her largely responsible for providing for their growing family.<br /> <br /> Much of today’s American Camp unit, including the once thriving salmon fishery on today’s South Beach was once Eliza’s property. She rented her land to the major fishing companies who operated traps on the water just off of our park and sold water to these companies. Many of Eliza’s descendants participated in this once-thriving industry that she played a major role in creating. She also contracted with the federal government to provide land and services.<br /> <br /> Today, many descendants of Eliza Jakle live in the San Juan Islands. Her story is emblematic of the female leaders of the homesteading period on our island. Her hard work, grit, creativity, and endurance allowed her family to thrive in a challenging and isolated environment. If you want to further explore her story, we encourage you to visit our American Camp Visitor Center where you can further explore her and other important but often overlooked San Juan Island historical figures.",

    "bodyText": "This humble building was originally constructed as a mess hall for the lowest ranking soldiers and became one of two barracks that housed the enlisted men of the British Royal Marines at English Camp from 1860 until 1872.  The Royal Marines were founded in 1664 as a global strike force housed on Royal Navy ships. They were charged with projecting British military power around the globe, attacking the United Kingdom’s enemies at times of war and protecting its possessions during times of peace. In the decade prior to the Pig War, members of the garrison at English Camp had served in the Crimean War (a conflict where a British, French, and Ottoman alliance fought Russian imperial forces in central Asia), the Ned McGowan War (a conflict between American settlers and British authorities in British Columbia, the Indian Mutiny (a revolutionary movement to overthrow British control of India), and the second Opium War (a conflict in which British and French forces attacked the Chinese empire to guarantee the rights of merchants to traffic drugs in China).<br /> <br /> 83 enlisted men landed at San Juan Island on March 21, 1860 but almost every Royal Marine retired or moved to new positions by the time they left San Juan Island on November 21, 1872; the only man who stayed at English Camp the entire time was Private James Haynes. The barracks were snug quarters, measuring 90 feet by 24 feet and containing 56 beds which gave each man 4 feet of living space. Marine rations consisted of a pound of biscuits, a quarter cup of hard liquor, a pound of fresh meat, half a pound of vegetables, one and three quarters ounces of sugar, an ounce of chocolate, and a quarter ounce of tea. Marines were also given a weekly ration of oatmeal, mustard, pepper, and vinegar as well as beer, wine, and cream. Compared to the American soldiers on the other side of San Juan Island, these soldiers enjoyed a high standard of living.<br /> <br /> The enlisted men lived in tents and crude cabins while they constructed English Camp. The Officers’ Quarters were among the first buildings constructed, reflecting the military hierarchy which placed officers above common soldiers. In order to make their new fortification work, the marines tore down a massive Native American long house approximately 500 feet long and 60 feet wide that they believed “must have accommodated over a thousand Indians. The work of building English Camp was so arduous that military officials requested new uniforms to replace those ruined by backbreaking work and extra pay in recognition of their difficult labor.Eventually, English Camp became a comfortable home for the military forces based here. Its facilities included a flourishing vegetable garden, formal garden, library, hospital, workshop, reading room, recreation hall, and billiards room. On holidays, the soldiers enjoyed fun and games such as a blindfolded “wheel-barrow race [that’ evoked intense amusement [as] men rushed about in all directions and several of them disappeared, barrow and all over the embankment” and into Garrison Bay and “a game which consisted of walking a greasy pole extending 15 feet from the edge of the wharf” which led many participants to “take an involuntary header into the briny deep.”<br /> <br /> Today, this structure serves as the visitor center for San Juan Island National Historical Park’s visitor center for the English Camp unit. Visitors can explore this historic building, watch our park’s site film, view exhibits about the history and natural features of San Juan Island, purchase gifts at the bookstore, and ask questions to our park rangers. Regular programming also takes place inside and near the barracks, so check our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sajh/planyourvisit/calendar.htm\">events page</a> for more information.",

    "bodyText": "The oldest Bigleaf maple at English Camp is over 350 years in age, and was once believed to be the largest member of its species in existence. Over time it has gotten smaller due to storm damage that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. This Bigleaf  is actually not a single tree, but a cluster of several trees that have grown together over the centuries. Bigleaf maples are found in coastal lowlands from just south of the Alaska Panhandle in British Columbia, through the western sections of Washington and Oregon. Further south in the warmer, drier California climate, it is located only in moist canyons at increasing elevations in the coast ranges and the Sierra Nevada range. It is most abundant west of the Cascade Divide from southern British Columbia to southern Oregon, from sea level to 3,000 feet (where it reaches its best development).Mature Bigleaf maples growing in the open normally have squat trunks, 3 to 4 feet thick and support massive, spreading limbs. Examples range from 70 to 80 feet high and are nearly as broad. They live an average 200 years or more (as is the case with the English Camp tree). Located in forests among other varieties, Bigleafs will grow straight and tall, as high as 100 feet, with a loose crown of upward pointing branches, often forked or with several trunks close together.Bigleaf maples are easy to recognize from other maples because of their giant leaves (8 to 12 inches across), with five deeply cut lobes. The lobes have smooth margins, except for a few large blunt teeth. Leaf stalks are 6 to 12 inches long and unlike other maples, secrete a milky sap when broken. In late April and early May, while new leaves are opening, clusters of fragrant yellow blossoms (4 to 6 inches long) hang from the boughs. And all year round, thick moss and ferns cling to the rough trunk and lower limbs.  <br /> <br /> This ancient tree has been a witness to history. When it was a sapling, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-parade-grounds.htm\">English Camp Parade Grounds</a> were the site of a Coast Salish village which had been in existence since time immemorial. Residents of this village built massive longhouses in which they lived and carefully tended to the marine resources of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/garrison-bay.htm\">Garrison Bay</a> which helped to sustain their society. When the Royal Marines landed at English Camp on March 23, 1860, at least one longhouse was still standing and likely in recent use; the English disassembled it and used its timber to construct their imperial outpost. After the English left in 1872, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/crook-house.htm\">Crook Family</a> began to turn this area into a homestead and center of light industry. In 1866, English Canp became part of San Juan Island National Historical Park, which cares for this site and its landscape.<br /> <br /> There used to be two massive Bigleaf Maples at English Camp but in 2012, after years of efforts to save it, one of our Bigleaf Maples died. Park staff had the somber task of cutting the tree down to its stump. Since that time, the tree has regenerated and new growth has occurred where this giant once towered. While it will take centuries for the tree to grow back, this new growth reminds us that trees and forests are living and changing places. What looks like an eternal forest is a dynamic environment, subject to change based on human intervention and environmental factors. This Arbor Day, we salute both of our Bigleaf Maples, which remind us of the important, historic role that trees play in our community!",

    "bodyText": "The sheltered waters of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/garrison-bay.htm\">Garrison Bay</a> have long attracted seafarers. Where English Camp now stands, Coast Salish people once launched long canoes, feasted on oysters gathered from the shores and slept in a 500-foot longhouse constructed on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-parade-grounds.htm\">Parade Ground</a>. During the Joint Occupation (1860-1872) boats regularly arrived with provisions and sightseers from Victoria on Vancouver Island. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/crook-house.htm\">Crook family</a>, who lived in English Camp from 1875-1971, built boats in an onsite workshop and had a dock for their own boat or boats on site.<br /> <br /> This maritime tradition continues today at the dinghy dock, where small boats or kayaks can be launched or docked. This site is the only place in the English Camp unit where you can launch or dock watercraft and allows waterborne visitors to access our park. Vessel docking is permitted at the English Camp dinghy dock with the following restrictions: Vessels may not exceed 20-feet in length and a vessel may not be docked longer than a period of 4-hours in a 24-hour day.The first dock was erected in 1986 as a donation from the International Yachting Fellowship of Rotarians of Victoria, an example of the international friendship that our park commemorates, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the park's creation. The original dock was inadequate to the site’s environmental needs and was extended and replaced in 2012.<br /> <br /> Clam, oyster, and mussel harvesting are allowed year-round just to the north of the dinghy dock; <a href=\"https://wdfw.wa.gov/places-to-go/shellfish-beaches/220354\">check here</a> to see if any health advisories currently prevent seafood foraging.

    "bodyText": "In 1867, Captain William Delacombe, the second commander of English Camp, laid out and ordered the construction of this formal garden at English Camp. Occupying the site of English Camp’s original vegetable garden, experts believe Delacombe likely created this garden to please his wife who felt homesick so far away from Great Britain where formal gardens are common. At the same time, Delacombe designed a new residence for himself that was equally picturesque, featuring multiple rose beds, twin verandas, a wide, grassy lawn and multiple outbuildings to service his family’s home. Though the Officers’ Quarters that Delacombe designed and constructed have since been lost to fire, their pastoral beauty was a striking contrast to the utilitarian <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/pickett-house-officers-quarters.htm\">American Camp Officers' Quarters</a>.<br /> <br /> The formal garden was part of an overall emphasis on landscape design and recreational opportunities at English Camp. The Officers’ Quarters were spatially separated from the parade ground where enlisted men lived and worked by a terraced hill which was covered in vines to increase its picturesque appeal. English Camp’s residents had access to a croquet ground, billiard hall, and library. Officers and enlisted men dined in separate messes with separate menus and officers such as Delacombe were able to bring their families with them to English Camp.<br /> <br /> After the English left San Juan Island, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/crook-house.htm\">Crook Family</a> became owners of English Camp’s grounds and buildings. They removed the formal garden, transforming it into a combination of orchard and grazing land. After the establishment of San Juan Island National Historical Park, park staff and volunteers worked to create a new formal garden that roughly approximated the original. Created in 1972 for the 100th anniversary of the end of the joint occupation of San Juan Island, this garden was not a historically accurate reconstruction in terms of plantings but it matched the shape of the original garden, giving visitors a better idea of what the landscape looked like in the past.<br /> <br /> In 1982, landscape architect Carol Meadowcroft created a report that provided a far deeper understanding of what the English Camp garden likely looked like and what grew in it. Meadowcroft examined the broader history of English gardening, identifying the English Camp garden as an example of the gardenesque style which combined geometric patterns with naturalistic plant arrangement. Meadowcroft showed that garden beds consisted of single types of brightly colored plants arranged in a circular design separated by footpaths. Taller species were planted in inner beds and lower species in outer beds with box hedges separating each bed. Meadowcroft also scoured contemporary nursery advertisements to discover which domestic plants were common in this time and place. Her research has guided the current shape, design, and plantings in this formal garden.<br /> <br /> In this reconstructed garden you can partake what one American visitor called \"the singular beauty of the scenery\" of English Camp. Nearby, you can stop by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-barracks.htm\">English Camp Barracks</a> where you can talk with a ranger in our visitor center, view exhibits, or watch our site film. If you’d like to go for a hike, the nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bell-point-trailhead.htm\">Bell Point Trailhead</a> offers a level, short hike through a waterfront forest and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/young-hill-trailhead.htm\">Young Hill Trailhead</a> [link] offers a steep climb to a beautiful viewpoint and visit the English Camp cemetery where 7 of English Camp’s residents are buried.",

The hospital was served by a dedicated assistant surgeon, who was responsible for treating minor maladies, such as broken bones, fevers, and aches. For more major illnesses and injuries, convalescent soldiers were transported to the Royal Naval Hospital at the major naval base in Esquimault on Vancouver Island.<br /> <br /> Treatments available at this hospital reflected the medical knowledge of the time, when doctors had yet to understand the concept of germs and utilized medicines now recognized as toxic. For example, patients were often given such toxic substances as pneumonia and strychnine. The most striking problem in the opinion of the assistant surgeons were \"the extreme variability of climactic conditions\" in the Pacific Northwest which they believed increased \"the prevalence of Rheumatism (sic). In this country, heat, cold dampness, and dryness can always be found not only within days but within yards of each other.<br /> <br /> \"While it is unlikely that the Pacific Northwest’s climate was the direct cause of an epidemic of rheumatism, it was responsible for the majority of deaths at English Camp. Four of the seven men buried at the Royal Marines Cemetery drowned in the Pacific Ocean’s water, a cause of death likely attributable to its extremely cold water, which rapidly causes hypothermia.<br /> <br /> If you want to learn more about the Royal Marines and the history of the Pig War, check out the English Camp visitor center, located inside of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-barracks.htm\">English Camp barracks</a>, where you can talk to a ranger, watch our site film, and purchase books and gifts.

Occupation of this area was not new; Coast Salish tribes had lived on this bay since time immemorial. When the Royal Marines landed at English Camp, they noted that the surface of the Parade Ground was “a shell bank - the accumulation of Years, evidently, as it averaged ten feet high, from thirty-five to forty feet through, by 120 yards long. It was the work of Indians, as they live very much on a shell-fish called “Clams.” They also found a Coast Salish longhouse that accommodated as many as 600 individuals and which the English disassembled and used as building materials </p> <p dir=\"ltr\"> </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The British chose to live in this spot during the boundary dispute for several reasons. First, it was at the opposite end of the island to the Americans. Second, there was an established trail connecting it to Hudson Bay Company’s <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sajh/learn/historyculture/belle-vue-sheep-farm.htm\">Belle Vue Sheep Farm</a>. Third, there was enough room in the area for the large number of soldiers expected to be needed.

They had several flower gardens and grew English produce. Jim Crook, a prominent caretaker of English Camp, moved there with his family when he was little. Even when the British occupation of the land ended, Crook was paid by the British government to maintain the Royal Marines Cemetery. He dedicated his life to the stewardship of his family’s home and English Camp.  </p> <p dir=\"ltr\"> </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Today, you can view what remains from the British occupation and appreciate the same resources that drew them to the area.

    "bodyText": "In June of 1860, Rear Admiral Robert Lambert Baynes inspected English Camp, which had been established three months earlier. At the site, Royal Marines were busy transforming an abandoned Coast Salish village where a large longhouse sat atop a shell midden into an orderly British military base. At the time, soldiers slept in tents as they worked to clear brush, level land, and construct shelter for the winter. In recognition of their hard work and sacrifice, Baynes requested additional pay for the Royal Marines. He also ordered the construction of this storehouse, a place where supplies could be protected from theft and the elements in an orderly fashion. It was the first building finished at English Camp.<br /> <br /> The storehouses double doors opened directly onto the camp’s dock, making it easier to launch English Camp’s small boat which was kept in the storehouse and to transfer shipments of goods brought to English Camp. The first such goods were an order of “84 tin pannikins, 36 tin plates, 3 'dishes', 10 camp kettles, 18 lanterns, 1 measures set, and a small quantity of stationery” made by Captain George Bazalgette, the commander of English Camp. English Camp was a short boat ride from Victoria, British Columbia and the British Royal Navy’s major base at Esquimault, making it far easier to supply than American Camp which was hundreds of miles from the major base at Fort Vancouver near Portland, Oregon.<br /> <br /> The standard of living at English Camp was far higher than that at American Camp. Recreational features included outdoor tennis courts, a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-formal-garden.htm\">formal garden</a>, outdoor bowling, a library, and a billiard room. Residents of Vancouver Island often came to English Camp for social occasions such as holidays or to enjoy the beautiful scenery of San Juan Island. These amenities and social opportunities made this isolated military post feel far less isolated for the Royal Marines who lived here from 1860-1872.<br /> <br /> If you’d like to learn more about the Royal Marines and the history of the Pig War, check out the English Camp visitor center, located inside of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-barracks.htm\">English Camp barracks</a>, where you can talk to a ranger, watch our site film, and purchase books and gifts.

    "bodyText": "At the height of the Pig War, in the summer of 1859, American and British forces faced off on the land near American Camp and the waters of Griffin Bay that surround that part of San Juan Island. The American soldiers under Captain George Pickett based at American Camp had been deployed from Fort Bellingham located on the Puget Sound in Washington State. The British sailors and Royal Marines, based on the three Royal Navy ships the Plumper, Satellite, and Tribune that confronted them were sent to San Juan Island from their base at Esquimault Harbor located near Victoria on Vancouver Island. <br /> <br /> The Royal Navy first became interested in Esquimault Harbor as a possible maritime base in case of war with the United States over the Pacific Northwest. On December 2, 1845, President James Knox Polk informed the United States congress of his intention to end the joint occupation of what was then known as “the Oregon Country,” a stretch of land that included all of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, British Columbia, and parts of Montana, and Wyoming and begin to assert United States dominion. In response, five Royal Navy warships were sent to the Pacific Northwest and the British government began planning for additional deployments in the event of military conflict. Part of that planning included mapping the harbors of Vancouver Island to find suitable anchorages for British warships. Though the “Oregon Crisis” was resolved peacefully, while preparing for war, Royal Navy officials learned in detail about Esquimault Harbor, which seemed to have the sizeable harbor and access to coal necessary to establish a major naval base.<br /> <br /> Hudson’s Bay Company officials, who in addition to their work in the fur trade also served as the civil government of Vancouver Island were also eager for the Royal Navy to utilize Esquimault to prevent American encroachment on British territory and stimulate the local economy. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/james-douglas-statue.htm\">Governor Douglas</a> stressed that the rich forests provided “the finest spars in the world” and that from his perspective “the colony and the Royal Navy would be of benefit to each other, the one producing and the other consuming the products of the land.” Despite these strong inducements and florid praise, decisionmakers in London did not think Vancouver Island merited a major naval base and instead assigned one ship from the Royal Navy to protect the colony on Vancouver Island, a far cry from Governor Douglas’ vision.<br /> <br /> This situation changed markedly when the Crimean War, a conflict between Russia and an alliance of French, British, and Ottoman forces broke out in 1854. Though the war’s name suggests that it was confined to Central Asia’s Crimean Peninsula, in fact Russian and Allied forces planned and engaged in limited battles across the globe. One hot spot was the Pacific Northwest, where Russian Alaska and British Columbia shared a border. On Vancouver Island, rumors abounded that Russian warships planned to shell Victoria. Though Vancouver was never attacked, when British warships engaged Russian forces in the Pacific they sailed to Esquimault to repair battle damage.<br /> <br /> In the winter of 1854, British commanders began planning an invasion force to attack Petropavlovsk, the center of the Russian Empire’s far eastern Kamchatka Territory. To prepare for the battle, the British Navy ordered the construction of a hospital at Esquimault to treat casualties and the acquisition of 1,000 tons of coal and 2,000 sheep to provision Allied forces. On May 30, 1855, British and French forces steamed into Petropavlovsk but the Russian Navy had abandoned the port, which was conquered without firing a shot. The invading Navy returned to Esquimault which served as an improvised naval base. For the next year the Royal Navy’s forces based at Esquimault unsuccessfully searched the Pacific for Russian ships.<br /> <br /> When peace was declared on March 30, 1856, Esquimault had become a familiar harbor for the Royal Navy and the first buildings in this base, the so-called “Crimea Huts” had been constructed. Esquimault Station was on its way to becoming one of the most important naval ports in the British Empire. During the Joint Occupation of San Juan island, troops stationed at English Camp would be resupplied from Esquimault and when the British left the island, the Royal Marines were redeployed to this naval base which is tightly linked to our history.",

    "bodyText": "On August 14, 1848 the United States congress approved the formation of the Oregon Territory. At the time the Oregon Territory included all of the present day states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming. Its capital city was located in Oregon City, not far from Portland. This vast, new territory had a sparse population of American settlers; two years later, the census of 1850 counted only 13,294 residents in the Oregon Territory.<br /> <br /> The formation of Oregon came at a time of rapid expansion under the James Knox Polk administration, which centered Manifest Destiny and territorial growth in its domestic and foreign policy. On February 2, 1848, the United States and Mexico signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-mexican-american-war.htm\">Mexican-American War</a>. With American military forces occupying Mexico City and much of their nation, Mexico surrendered all of the states of California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and some of Wyoming, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas (most of which had previously been conquered by Anglo-Americans). Two years earlier, the United States and Great Britain had signed the Oregon Border Treaty which guaranteed the US claims to the lands incorporated in the Oregon Territory. This same treaty had left the maritime boundary between the two nations inexact, leading eventually to the Pig War, but at the time the Northwest was so sparsely settled that it caused little international or local friction.<br /> <br /> Four months later, in December of 1848, President Polk announced the discovery of gold in the newly conquered territory of California. Over the course of one year, California’s population increased more than 700 percent as 90,000 immigrants from around the world raced to the goldfields in this newly conquered territory. For residents of the Oregon Territory, including present day Washington, these new migrants provided an important and extremely valuable market for their agricultural and timber products.<br /> <br /> Initially, the Oregon Territory suffered population losses due to the attractiveness of California gold, but the long-term population gains and prosperous markets that the gold rush created caused additional settlement in the Pacific Northwest. It also led to firmer federal control of these newly conquered lands and the violent displacement of indigenous communities. And eventually, these historical forces would lead to the Pig War conflict on San Juan Island.<br /> <br /> Want to learn more about this period in history?

    "bodyText": "This 2 mile trail network travels through wetlands, industrial areas, and creeks, providing views of a busy airport and vistas of distant mountains.The trail network is the result of community collaboration, created by the Port of Friday Harbor, Boy Scout Troop 90, and the San Juan Island Trails Committee. It also forms the beginning of a 7 mile tral that leads between the town of Friday Harbor and our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/visit-american-camp.htm\">American Camp </a>Unit.<br /> <br /> The airport which the trail traverses is itself an important part of our island's history.Roy Franklin, who built this airport, began his career in Friday Harbor flying in and out of a sometiems icy cow pasture. Franklin \"learned pretty quicly that you shouldn't buzz the middle of a herd of cows and spearate them. You want to get alongside them and push them as a group away from where you want to land or they'll just bunch up again.\" In 1954, after six years as the only pilot offering regularly scheduled flights to and from San Juan Island, Franklin purchased 66 acres of forest which he transformed into the initial Friday Harbor Airport.<br /> <br /> In 1983, Franklin sold the airport to the port of Friday Harbor with the stipulation that the airport would NEVER be renamed to honor him. Today, the airport hosts tens of thousands of recreational, emergency, and cargo flights which help keep our isolated islands which lack a road connection to the mainland function.",

    "bodyText": "Coast Salish people have travelled through the waters surrounding San Juan Island since time immemorial. During The Pig War, the channels that separate the San Juan Islands became a contested territory, nearly sparking an international war. During the homesteading period, maritime transport allowed the agricultural and lime industry of this otherwise isolated island to international American and international markets.<br /> <br /> Today, the Washington State Ferries, a state agency, provides regular transportation to and from San Juan, Orcas, Lopez, and Shaw Islands in the San Juans and the gateway community of Anacortes on the mainland.Prior to the establishment of the Washington State Ferry in 1951, maritime transport required either private boat ownership or travelling one of many small private ships known collectively as “the mosquito fleet.”<br /> <br /> By the 1930s, almost all the car ferries in the state were operated by one private company, The Puget Sound Navigation Company. Employee strikes and rate hikes by this perceived monopoly rankled the public and the state government negotiated a public takeover of The Puget Sound Navigation Company, resulting in the creation of the Washington State Ferries system on June 1, 1951.<br /> <br /> The Washington State Ferries system is the largest ferry system in terms of usage and vessels maintained in the United States. The San Juan Island Ferry is techincally designated as a maritime segment of the Washington State Highway system. Over 2,000,000 people use the San Juan Islands section of the ferry system annually, making it a vital service to island residents and visitors alike. As you travel on the ferry keep your eyes peeled; you're almost guaranteed to see birds, harbor seals, sea lions, and, if you're lucky, an Orca!",

It attracts massive runs of migrating salmon and halibut which Native American people have harvested since time immemorial. This made the cove a great location for preserving the fish caught nearby.  <br /> <br /> This site is said to be named after one of three matriarchs in the area: Eliza Jakle, Anna Pike, or Tilly Rosler. It's still in dispute which of these women earned the title and hence named the beach Grandma's Cove. <br /> <br /> Alternatively, some call this beach Granny’s Cove because of a matriarch killer whale who frequented the area. The leader of her pod, Granny (J2) lived a long life: an estimated 65-80 years! Though Granny the orca is no longer with us, she could be seen from the cove for decades. <br /> <br /> Grandma’s Cove is a great place to go for a swim! The water is shallow and protected, making it safer and warmer than other beaches on the island. However, you might want to wear water shoes as the shore is quite rocky and covered in driftwood. The massive amount of driftwood comes over from the Olympic Peninsula.<br /> <br /> While exploring the shoreline, you might see anemones, tide pool sculpin, mussels, shore crabs, barnacles, and a variety of seaweeds in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sajh/planyourvisit/tide-pooling.htm\">tidepools</a>. Visitors often find sea glass too!<br /> <br /> If you’re interested in a hike, the <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/grandmas-cove\">mile long round trip</a> to the cove is of moderate difficulty. Along the way you can see the remains of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sajh/planyourvisit/the-redoubt.htm\">Robert’s Redoubt</a>. You might also spot bald eagles, foxes, or rabbits.  <br /> <br /> To get to Grandma’s Cove, you should park at the American Camp Visitor Center. Take the westernmost trail (west is toward the ocean) to the Parade Ground and shortly after leaving the parking lot a marked trail to Grandma’s Cove will be on your right. From there you will walk 5-10 minutes downhill on a grassy trail with expansive ocean views and then you’ll reach the beach!</p>",

    "bodyText": "Griffin Bay takes its name from Charles Griffin, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson’s Bay Company</a> employee who established the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/belle-vue-sheep-farm.htm\">Belle Vue Sheep Farm</a> on San Juan Island in 1853. The company established a dock on Griffin Bay’s relatively tranquil waters near the site of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sajh/planyourvisit/4th-of-july-beach.htm\">Fourth of July Beach</a> which it used to load and unload cargo from their island-wide sheep farm, which by 1859 hosted more than 4,000 sheep. On July 27, 1859, Captain George Pickett landed 64 soldiers on San Juan Island using the company’s dock, igniting The Pig War.<br /> <br /> Two days later, Captain Hornby sailed the HMS Tribune, a 31 gun Royal Navy steam frigate into Griffin Bay to confront Pickett’s forces and strengthen Britain’s claim to the San Juan Islands. Within a week, two more warships with numerous heavy guns and almost 2,000 Royal Marines aboard joined the Tribune in Griffin Bay. The British had more than enough firepower and manpower to easily win a conflict with the United States, but chose restraint over combat. Even as additional American troops arrived on San Juan Island and the Americans began constructing <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sajh/planyourvisit/the-redoubt.htm\">The Redoubt</a>, an earthen fortress designed for combat with the Royal Navy forces, Britain held its fire.<br /> <br /> This was a wise and courageous decision. British Columbia Royal Governor, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/james-douglas-statue.htm\">James Douglas</a>, tried to order an invasion of San Juan Island but was overruled by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lambert-baynes.htm\">Admiral Lambert Baynes</a>, the highest ranking British naval officer in the Pacific Theater. Baynes' actions allowed American leaders to intervene and countermand the aggressive actions of their field leaders who had almost incited a war on the San Juan Islands. On November 7, 1859, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/winfield-scott.htm\">General Winfield Scott</a>, the highest ranking officer in the United States military, successfully negotiated a peace agreement that allowed American and British forces to jointly occupy San Juan Island until an agreement over whose possession it was could be reached. That same day, British naval forces began leaving Griffin Bay, signaling that the tense standoff and near-war had ended.<br /> <br /> Shortly after US soldiers landed on San Juan Island in 1859, entrepreneurs, sensing a new market amongst the soldiers, began ferrying over abandoned buildings from defunct mining operations near Bellingham and repurposing them in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-town-lagoon.htm\">San Juan Town</a>. Vice-related businesses, such as alcohol sales and prostitution especially flourished in this location during the joint occupation. Proprietors evaded law enforcement by claiming American citizenship when questioned by British authorities and British citizenship in front of American authorities. Authorities only held jurisdiction over citizens of their own nation making this an attractive strategy for lawbreakers on San Juan Island.San Juan Town burnt to the ground in 1890 and left no remains. Today, however, you can walk the tranquil shoreline of Griffin Bay and imagine all the history which happened on its shores and waters.",

    "bodyText": "False Bay is one of many stunning and diverse ecosystems on San Juan Island. At low tide, the water recedes from its shallow mudflats, revealing marine life that lies beneath the water. Animals that rely on these organisms as food sources come to False Bay and visitors can walk on the mudflats and get to know more about our maritime world. This tidal feature gave it its name, because boats that didn't know about the landscape would get stuck in the mud as the seeming bay around them disappeared at low tide.<br /> <br /> If you would have come to False Bay in the early 1900s, in addition to the unique tidal variations, offshore you would have seen the fish traps of Henry Cayou, a man deeply linked to our history. Cayou was born to a Coast Salish mother and French migrant father who worked for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson's Bay Company </a>on Orcas Island during the Joint Occupation, when Orcas Island and the rest of our archipelago was claimed by both the American and British empires. As The Orcasonian points out, Cayou traced his ancestry to the Michell Bay band whose home included what is now our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp.htm\">English Camp Unit</a>.<br /> <br /> Henry Cayou was an enterprising businessman who operated fish traps at this site from 1912 until 1930. Fisherman Bill Jakle remembered that due to his clever choice of location Cayou’s harvest was “all [high quality] Fraser River king salmon. He used to get tons of them in that trap. He was a rich Indian.” Jakle said Cayou’s fish harvest was so good “he could sell it to anybody that would want it.” Cayou’s business interests straddled our archipelago and employed numerous islands, including a salmon cannery near his Deer Harbor home on Orcas Island where he also had an orchard, fish traps on Lopez Island, and a boat building business on Decatur Island.<br /> <br /> In addition to being a successful businessman, he was one of the first Indigenous elected officials in Washington state. The Orcasonian notes that about half of Orcas Island residents at that time were, like Cayou, people who had European and Native parents. He served as the San Juan Island County commissioner for 29 years and spent even more time on the local Board of Education. Cayou also played a pivotal role in bringing electricity to the San Juan Islands as the first president of OPALCO.<br /> <br /> Today, False Bay's unique environment is a biological reserve owned and managed by the University of Washington, whose cutting edge scientists, based at the nearby Friday Harbor Laboratories conduct marine research in this area. Visitors should be aware of the <a href=\"https://fhl.uw.edu/facilities-resources/biological-preserves/management-policy-for-false-bay-argyle-lagoon-and-parks-bay-marine-preserves/\">specific rules</a> that apply to it do to its special status.",

    "bodyText": "Henry Martyn Robert was born in Martinville, South Carolina. Robert and his family, who were outspoken abolitionists, soon relocated to Ohio, where Robert would grow up. He attended West Point, where he graduated fourth in his class in the year 1857 and joined the Army Corps of Engineers.<br /> <br /> Robert’s first major assignment was to Panama where he scouted a possible canal project nearly 50 years before it was built. His engineering detachment was attached to <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fova\">Fort Vancouver National Historic Site</a> and deployed to San Juan Island at the height of the Pig War. He designed the Redoubt, an earthen fortification which still stands to this day, and superintended its construction. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sajh/learn/historyculture/the-redoubt.htm\">Robert’s Redoubt</a> provided the Americans with a defensive fortification which could not only resist British warships but could credibly match them in combat. Its construction encouraged peacemaking and it never had to fire a single shot in anger.<br /> <br /> Shortly after his time on San Juan Island, Robert was assigned to New Bedford, Massachusetts (and thus is part of the history of <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/nebe\">New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park</a>). During his time there, he attended a contentious church meeting and was disappointed by the lack of clear and consistent parliamentary procedures. Robert reflected on the experience: “One can scarcely have had much experience in deliberative meetings of Christians without realizing that the best of men, having wills of their own, are liable to attempt to carry out their own views without paying sufficient respect to the rights of their opponents.\" He began contemplating effective methods of running public meetings and developed a set of guidelines and rule known as Robert’s Rules of Order which are still the most important resource on parliamentary procedure.<br /> <br /> Robert spent most of his career as an engineer, including a considerable period based at <a href=\"htttp://www.nps.gov/goga/\">Golden Gate National Recreation Area</a>. He developed and altered waterways, built flood control for hurricanes, and developed significant important infrastructure which we still rely on today. He was a general at the time of his retirement and was buried in Arlington National Ceremony. ",

    "bodyText": "In 1670, King Charles II granted a Royal Charter to “the Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson Bay” a corporation that would eventually come to be known as the Hudson’s Bay Company. The Hudson’s Bay Company, whose headquarters by the time of The Pig War was this building in London, shipped European trade goods and technology to North America, where they were sold to Native Americans for animal fur which was then resold in Europe and Asia, hence their corporate motto “Pro Pelle Cutem” which in latin means “A pelt for a skin”. Unlike the corporations we are familiar with today, the Hudson’s Bay Company fused governmental power, military capabilities, and diplomatic functions with its quest for profit. It operated throughout Canada and was especially powerful in the Pacific Northwest, where the Hudson’s Bay Company was the most potent non-native force in the region in the early days of European colonization.<br /> <br /> The Hudson’s Bay Company’s global trading business and the strategies that made it successful relied upon a diverse workforce. Acquiring fur required Native American participation and the company hired Native American employees and carefully stocked trade goods that catered to Native American consumer preferences. Company operatives often married high ranking Native American women and their alliances helped encourage trade and cooperation; children of these cross-cultural marriages often worked for the Hudson’s Bay Company, where they acted as cultural mediators who understood the needs of indigenous people and the company’s commercial empire. In the Pacific Northwest, the company found itself short on labor and hired Hawaiian men as laborers, farmers, seafarers, and fur trade adventurers.<br /> <br /> The Hudson’s Bay Company built a string of trading posts throughout the Pacific Northwest in the 1820s-1850s at a time when the United States and the British Empire both claimed the Oregon Country (the future states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Wyoming and Montana). These posts became centers for settlement, economic development, and imperial power at a time when few U.S. citizens inhabited the Oregon Country. It was only in the 1840s, as masses of U.S. emigrants used the Oregon Trail to settle in the Pacific Northwest that the Hudson’s Bay Company and British imperial power were contested. When the Oregon Treaty of 1846 gave the states of Washington and Oregon to the United States, the Hudson’s Bay Company was forced to wind down operations at its bases in Washington and Oregon, which included at one time parts of the future <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fova\">Fort Vancouver National Historic Site</a> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/whmi\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/lewi\">Lewis and Clark National Historical Park</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/nepe\">Nez Perce National Historical Park</a><br /> <br /> Still, the Hudson’s Bay Company remained powerful within British territory; one way that they demonstrated this power was by founding a massive operation on San Juan Island. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/belle-vue-sheep-farm.htm\">Belle Vue Sheep Farm</a>, established in 1853, grew into a massive agricultural complex with over 4,000 sheep and more than a dozen Hawaiian and native employees. It was a Hudson’s Bay Company pig that rooted through Lyman Cutlar’s potato patch on June 15, 1859, sparking the Pig War. During the joint occupation of San Juan Island, American Camp was established adjacent to Belle Vue Sheep Farm headquarters and the farm wound down operations on our island.<br /> <br /> Though the Hudson’s Bay Company is no longer on our island, it remains a major corporation. No longer in the fur trade, it is now one of Canada’s largest department stores. It’s unique contribution to our region’s history and to global history is crucial to understanding how San Juan Island developed.",

    "bodyText": "The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson’s Bay Company</a>'s (HBC) established their Honolulu agency offices in 1829. Hawaiians had been working in the Pacific Northwest since 1787 and over time became an increasingly pivotal part of the fur trading workforce. At this office, the HBC recruited Hawaiian workers, sold British goods and Pacific Northwest agricultural products, and resupplied its ships headed from Hawaii to China and American whaling ships which regularly stopped in Honolulu. By the mid 19<sup>th</sup> Century, the Honolulu Agency was a vital part of a global trading empire that encompassed London, North America, and Asia.<br /> <br /> Hawaiians’ importance to the HBC can be seen in the writings of Chief Factor John McLoughlin who in 1830 asked the Honolulu agency to “Sen[d] us as many of them [Hawaiians[ as possible.” These workers filled numerous vital positions for the HBC; many worked on its ships as sailors. Others, like the sixteen Hawaiians who landed on San Juan Island in 1853, were agricultural workers who grew crops and herded sheep. Still others served as construction workers whose labor helped establish fur trade outposts or as teamsters, carrying goods hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles to trade with Native Americans in the extensive network of fur trade forts that the HBC operated throughout the Pacific Northwest. It is estimated that by the mid-1800s, approximately 1/3 of the HBC’s Pacific Northwest labor force were Hawaiians.<br /> <br /> Hawaiians were hired on time-limited contracts that specified their pay and term of service. In 1844, a Honolulu newspaper claimed that “they are generally engaged for a period of three years and gain $10 per month.” Though little documentation exists, it is likely that many of these migrant workers sent wages home to their families in Hawaii. Many Hawaiians regularly renewed their labor contracts and worked for decades in the Pacific Northwest either with the HBC or as independent settlers who homesteaded after leaving HBC employment. Hawaiian migrants also worked at other National Park Service sites that were once HBC establishments, such as <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/lewi\">Lewis and Clark National Historical Park</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fova\">Fort Vancouver National Historical Site</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/whmi\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a>. On San Juan Island place names like Kanaka Bay and Friday Harbor (named after a Hawaiian man who settled there whose English name was Peter Friday) and Eastern Oregon place names like Kanaka Creek, Kanaka Bar, Kanaka Glen, and the Owyhee River demonstrate the longstanding impact of Hawaiians in the Pacific Northwest.",

    "bodyText": "Once a bustling fisherman’s community known as Argyle, today, Jackson Beach is a popular local park, operated by the Port of Friday Harbor. At Jackson Beach, visitors can launch their kayaks and boats, build a bonfire in fire pits, have a large picnic in the picnic shelter, stroll the rocky beach, and observe nearby Lopez Island and the distant mountains of the <a href=\"htttp://wwww.nps.gov/noca\">North Cascades</a>. Dogs particularly love Jackson Beach and they are often seen with their owners, walking its rocky shore.           <br /> <br /> At the western edge of Jackson Beach is the hulking remains of a salmon cannery. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, salmon canning was a major business on San Juan Island, because prior to widespread refrigerated transportation salmon had to be preserved near where they were caught. San Juan Island had some of the best salmon fishing anywhere in the Pacific Northwest because the Salmon Bank, a long, shallow shelf offshore from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/south-beach-trail.htm\">South Beach</a> provided a key place for migratory salmon to feed during their spawning journeys. Hundreds of people worked in the salmon industry or profited from it including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/eliza-jakle.htm\">Eliza Jakle</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/henry-cayou-false-bay.htm\">Henry Cayou</a>, and hundreds of Chinese immigrants who worked in the cannery. Unfortunately, overexploitation led the salmon industry to decline, leading to the closure of these canneries.<br /> <br /> Nearby Jackson Beach is a pristine natural area known as the Argyle Lagoon Biological Preserve. This 14 acre area administered by the University of Washington includes a tidal creek and a massive lagoon where shellfish and fish research occur. Beside the cannery is another, less trafficked beach known as North Bay Beach which is also open to the public. If you explore the Argyle Lagoon respect the rules that prohibit fishing and shellfish gathering so that this area, once home to a massive fishing operation can flourish and the University of Washington's scientists can continue to learn about our marine world from this special reserve",

    "bodyText": "This statue commemorates James Douglas who was the royal governor of Vancouver Island and British Columbia and Chief Factor of the Hudson’s Bay Company, making him the most powerful British official in the Pacific Northwest at the time of the Pig War. Douglas also had the most experience in the region, having served as an agent of British Empire in the Pacific Northwest for 39 years by the time <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lyman-cutlar-homestead.htm\">Lyman Cutlar</a> shot his company’s pig. Unlike his colleagues in the Royal Navy, who advocated for a peaceful solution to the Pig War Crisis, Douglas encouraged swift and decisive action to confront the American occupation of San Juan Island.<br /> <br /> James Douglas was born in 1803 to Martha-Ann Ritchie, a free Barbadian of Afro-Scottish descent and a well-connected Scottish merchant who met in the South American colony of Guyana. Described in official documents as a “Scotch West Indian,” Douglas’s multiracial heritage was no hindrance to his success in the Hudson’s Bay Company, which had many multiracial employees at all levels of the company during his tenure. Douglas’s own 1837 marriage to Amelia Connolly, whose father was a fur trade superior and whose mother was a member of the Cree Tribe of Native Americans, demonstrates the ubiquity of cross-cultural marriages in the North American fur trade. Later Douglas descendants, likely in an effort to avoid racial stigmatization, claimed that Douglas was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland where he was sent to school as a young man and omitted his diverse heritage from his history. Douglas is far from the only historic figure in the Pacific Northwest whose racial background has been falsely remembered by history to characterize the settler era Northwest as a less diverse place than it really was.<br /> <br /> James Douglas began working in the fur trade in North America in 1819 when he was only fifteen years old and labored in this industry for his entire working life. Douglas’s career required him to balance the hyperlocal needs of the isolated and culturally diverse trading outposts where he lived with the financial and market forces that governed a commercial empire ruled from London. Douglas learned to balance diplomatic and trade relationships with indigenous people and defuse tension between white settlers and Native Americans who were both important clients of his employer. Though Douglas's duties as a clerk required rigorous and methodical recordkeeping, it could also involve brute force, such as the time Douglas and other young employees of the Northwest Company intimidated Hudson’s Bay Company by brandishing “Guns, Swords, Flags, Drums, [and] Fifes” at their rivals.<br /> <br /> After the 1821, merger of the Hudson’s Bay Company and the Northwest Company, Douglas’s work also brought him all over North America. In his first decade on this continent, Douglas lived at a fort on Lake Superior, in Saskatchewan, at two locations in New Caledonia, and in Oregon. His work also required great strength and endurance; one of the many major voyages he took was about 6000 miles in length and required the use of boats, canoes, horses, and snowshoes with a group of around 30 employees. As Douglas was promoted to higher positions, he negotiated with Russian, Mexican, American, and indigenous leaders to extend his company’s footprint into new markets and attain labor and products.<br /> <br /> James Douglas was based at the Hudson’s Bay Company post at Fort Vancouver, now <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fova/\">Fort Vancouver National Historic Site</a>, until 1849, when Britain surrendered control of the present-day state of Washington to the United States. Douglas relocated the Northwestern headquarters for the Hudson’s Bay Company to Victoria, which is visible from our park on clear days. In 1851, Douglas was appointed royal governor of Victoria, making him the most important political and business leader in the colony. In the 1850s, US settlers took over existing Hudson’s Bay Company posts managed by Douglas, such as Fort Nisqually. In 1858, massive numbers of Americans moved through Victoria and into the Fraser River Valley in the mainland, which Douglas also controlled. With more Americans in his colony than British settlers, Douglas feared displacement and only through keen use of Hudson’s Bay Company and Royal Navy assets was he able to control a situation in which Americans could have once more used force to seize British North American colonies and Hudson’s Bay Company assets.<br /> <br /> Though it is impossible to know what role Douglas’s diverse heritage played in his actions during the Pig War era, it is likely significant. In 1858, just prior to the Pig War, Douglas sent a letter to San Francisco’s Black community, encouraging members to immigrate to Vancouver Island, which lead several hundred Black families to settle on the island at a time in which Douglas tried to limit white migrants from California. As a Hudson’s Bay Company official, Douglas employed numerous Hawaiian immigrants and had witnessed how racist laws in the Washington and Oregon Territories stripped them of their rights and property. Douglas was mindful of this recent history, as well as the conflict over slavery that would soon erupt into the Civil Warm as he fought for a tough line against the US soldiers that he regarded as having invaded his colony and his company’s property in the summer of 1859.<br /> Douglas retired in 1864, after nearly 45 years of work in the fur trade. He was knighted by Queen Victoria for his services to the British Empire. Though he went to Europe on a grand tour after his retirement, Douglas lived the rest of his life in Victoria, the city that he had done more than any person to build. Today, Douglas is widely considered “the Father of British Columbia.”",

    "bodyText": "<p>Jimmie Pickett, the son of Captain George Pickett, the first commanding officer of American Camp, and his second wife, a young Haida woman whose family was working near Camp Semiahmoo was born in this house, the oldest home in Bellingham. Pickett met his wife during his service as commanding officer at Fort Bellingham. Mrs. Pickett died within a year of Jimmie’s birth on New Year’s Eve, 1857 and Captain Pickett left the Pacific Northwest in 1861 to serve in the Confederate military during the Civil War. Jimmie Pickett was raised near Shelton on Hammersley Inlet by loving foster parents Catherine and Aaron Collins who nurtured his artistic talents. After Aaron died, Catherine re-married and her second husband William Walter continued to mentor the artistic prodigy and supported his further education.<br /> <br /> Pickett’s artistry had attracted notice since his childhood. Visitors regularly came to the farm he grew up on to see the early paintings which he made on the planks of the barn. Displays of his earliest paintings gained notoriety and garnered artistic prizes. As a young adult, Pickett taught art classes at the Union Academy in Olympia which he attended and created commercial artworks such as etchings and engravings for the publisher of Oregon county histories and The Oregonian newspaper. He also regularly stayed in touch with his family back East, including his father and his stepmother after his father’s death.<br /> <br /> Pickett’s time at the San Francisco Art Institute was eventful but also difficult. During his time there, he met his half-brother, George Pickett, Jr. but their meeting did not go well. Historical sources are murky about the specifics of this family encounter but it is believed that race—specifically Jimmie’s indigenous ancestry and near-identical appearance—caused a lasting rift with his younger brother who seems not to have known that his half-brother was half-indigenous. Pickett also felt that the formal artistic training of the only professional art school on the West Coast—was too slow for him and that it was not a good use of his artistic talents. He dropped out of school after five months and moved back to Portland, where he took on students and became both a fine and commercial artist.<br /> <br /> Pickett died of typhoid complicated by tuberculosis at the young age of 31. In Portland, he was part of the staff at The Oregonian, where he worked as a regular illustrator. Pickett also produced sketches and engravings of cityscapes and highly admired oil paintings. Though he died young, he was beloved by his Portland art community friends who said of him in an obituary: “His life seems as a picture of magnificent conception laid away half finished As a beautiful poem half written, or a sweet sad song whose melody is shattered just as we begin to be enchanted by its music. James Pickett will ever live in the memory of those who knew him best as one of the truest, purest, manliest of men, as well as one of the rarest geniuses this Northwest has ever produced.”</p>",

Visitors are likely to meet river otters, deer, and can pick apples and pears from a remnant orchard planted by former settlers but look out for thorny cacti which also live on Jones Island.<br /> <br /> Jones Island has been a Coast Salish homeland since time immemorial. The first Euro-American settler was Robert Kittles who homesteaded on the island with his Lummi wife during the time of the San Juan Island Boundary dispute. The fruit orchard on this island was planted by their family and remains of their farm can be visited on your trip to Jones Island. In 1959, almost a century after it was a homestead, Jones Island became a state park.<br /> <br /> Visitors can take advantage of 4 miles of hiking trails and can use docks or mooring buoys for their boats during their visits. 24 primitive campsites are available for visitors and water is available May through September. No garbage service is available, so pack in what you pack out.",

    "bodyText": "This statue, of a Berkshire Boar with a potato in its mouth was created by sculptor Robert MacDonald. It commemorates the potato filching pig whose actions ignited The Pig War. On the morning of June 15, 1859, a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson’s Bay Company</a> owned pig began rooting in the small farm plot of American farmer <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lyman-cutlar-homestead.htm\">Lyman Cutlar.</a> This had not been the first time an HBC pig had gotten into Cutlar’s crop, and in a fit of pique, Cutlar shot and killed the pig after a short chase. Though some chroniclers have claimed that the pig was a particularly prized animal, no evidence exists to suggest that it was unusual, but was instead just an ordinary Berkshire Boar.<br /> <br /> Cutlar knew that he was in the wrong for killing this pig, because in 19<sup>th</sup> century farm culture it was farmer’s responsibility to prevent errant free-ranging livestock like pigs out of their property. To make amends, Cutlar visited the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/belle-vue-sheep-farm.htm\">Belle Vue Sheep Farm</a> and offered reparations to farm manager Charles Griffin. Griffin quoted the unquestionably outrageous price of $100 for the pig’s life, causing Cutlar to explode with anger. Cutlar’s actions had played into Griffin’s hands. Griffin had long been angered by the approximately 20 Americans who had recently been occupying his company’s sheepfolds and treating them as their personal farms. In the aftermath of the pig’s death, Griffin began exerting legal force to eject Cutlar and the other Americans who had moved onto San Juan Island in the past year.<br /> <br /> American resistance to Griffin’s plans was far more vehement than he had anticipated. Not only did Cutlar threaten to use deadly force against any British official who trespassed on what he regarded as his land, but his friends reported the incident to American military officials. This report eventually made its way to General William Harney who deployed American forces onto San Juan Island on July 27, 2022, igniting the Pig War.<br /> <br /> This statue’s name honors Kaiser Wilhelm I, the man whose actions eventually ended the boundary dispute on San Juan Island. Kaiser Wilhelm, the first emperor of Germany, a nation he played a leading role in creating, held arbitration hearings in Switzerland in 1871-72, which were designed to finally settle the disputed British-American international boundary in the San Juan Islands.<br /> <br /> Three German legal experts listened to arguments and counter-arguments presented by American and British diplomats and attorneys over where the boundary should be. After months of hearings, two out of three experts voted for the American boundary claim and one argued that not enough information had been presented. The Kaiser decided that this was sufficient judgement to endorse the American boundary and on October 21, 1872 declared that the Haro Strait would be the international boundary making San Juan Island into U.S. Territory. ",

Over the course of decades, a 300 foot hill was broken up into small rocks and barged from the nearby waterfront to Canada where the gravel was sold to consumers.The LaFarge company's operations were part of a period of time in which extractive industry was far more prominent on San Juan Island. From the commercial fisheries found at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/south-beach-trail.htm\">South Beach</a>, to the numerous<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/tacoma-and-roche-harbor-lime-company.htm\">limestone mining sites</a> on our island, San Juan was a place whose natural resources were exported to consumers throughout our region.<br /> <br /> By 2007, when this area became public land there was a deep pit where the hill once stood.Now a part of the San Juan Island Recreation Department, the Lafarge Open Space is now a special place for San Juan Islanders. On rare snowy days locals bring their skis and snowboards to grab turns on their way into the bottom of the pit. Throughout the year, pet owners bring their dogs to romp in this rare public space that allows off leash dogs. If you visit on a clear day, you can enjoy excellent views from the high point that look down upon Jackson Beach and out to the North Cascades.",

    "bodyText": "Admiral Sir Robert Lambert Baynes arrived in his flagship, the <i>HMS Ganges</i>, in the waters surrounding San Juan Island on August 5, 1859. Largely due to Baynes keeping the peace, the only casualty of the Pig War was the pig.<br /> <br /> He was in his sixties when he arrived and had already seen his fair share of fighting. Baynes’s extensive military career included the Greek War of Independence, Crimean War, and the War of 1812.<br /> <br /> Because of these previous successes out at sea, in 1857 he was appointed Commander in Chief of England’s Pacific Station. When the Fraser River Gold Rush began in the spring of 1858, at least 20,000 Americans flooded into British Columbia, greatly outnumbering the British settlers. Governor James Douglas was concerned about the possibility that they would challenge British sovereignty and requested additional military forces to keep British Columbia British. Baynes and the Royal Marines under his command were expected to enforce rules and Britain’s agenda. Baynes was stationed in Peru when he was called up to San Juan Island.By 1859, Baynes preferred top hats, fancy bow ties, and humor instead of conflict. An employee of the Hudson’s Bay Company described him as, “plain, little, big-hearted, unassuming, lowland Scotsman, lame but full of salt and fresh fun.”<br /> <br /> When the pig crisis was first brought to his attention, Baynes is reported to have said “tut, tut, no, no, the damn fools.” He recognized right away that this disagreement was not worth a war. He ordered Capt. Geoffrey Hornby to avoid interacting with the American army and “by every means in your power… prevent the risk of collision taking place.” Despite push back on this decision, Baynes remained steadfast and kept peace on San Juan Island. In April of 1860, he was knighted for his commitment to a calm resolution to the conflict. The Baynes Sound in British Columbia (appropriately located near Hornby Island, named after Captain Geoffrey Hornby who helped Baynes keep the peace in the San Juan) and the town of Ganges, British Columbia honor his local legacy.",

Southern Resident Killer Whales, an endangered species of Orca, often pass close by its rocky beaches searching for chinook salmon in the kelp beds just offshore. These Orcas require approximately 400 pounds of fresh seafood per day to remain healthy and they almost exclusively eat Chinook salmon. Visitors can also spot Humpback whales, Minke Whales, and harbor seals in the waters off Lime Kiln Point.<br /> <br /> To learn more about Orcas, visit the Lime Kiln Point Interpretive Center, located in a converted Coast Guard garage. Visitors can get up close with Orcas by observing their orca statues, replicated dorsal fin, and a variety of interactive displays that illuminate these elusive sea creatures. The interpretive center is operated by the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FolksSJI\">Friends of Lime Kiln Society</a> (FOLKS) volunteers who will happily answer any questions you might have about the park and its natural and human history.<br /> <br /> This park also has an extensive human history. As you hike around the park, you cannot help but notice the massive lime kilns and scarred hillsides that are a legacy of extensive lime mining that took place in this area. The first lime kilns on the island were operated by American settlers and the Royal Marines during the Joint Occupation of San Juan Island (1860-1872). By the late 1800s and early 1900s, lime mining was the largest industry in the San Juan Archipelago. Old growth trees throughout San Juan Island were felled to feed the lime kilns which had to reach a temperature of between 900-1000 degrees Celsius to produce the chemical reactions which extract usable lime from rock. Lime from San Juan island was then shipped to customers throughout the west coast.<br /> <br /> Lime Kiln State Park also features Washington State’s last major lighthouse which went into operation in 1919. Washington State Park rangers offer regular tours of the light house, where you can also listen to a hydrophone which allows you to hear the songs of approaching whales. If you get hungry during your visit, you can visit the park’s snack bar, The Blowhole: Snacks With a Porpoise. To extend your visit and see more remnants of the lime industry, hike the <a href=\"https://sanjuanislandtrails.org/trailsw/lime-kiln-park/\">3+ mile trail network </a>which takes you into land owned by the San Juan County Land Bank.",

    "bodyText": "On the morning of June 15, 1859, Lyman Cutlar woke up to find his potato patch under attack….by a pig.  25 year-old Cutlar was a recent arrival to San Juan Island, where he settled on land already claimed by the Hudson’s Bay Company, a British corporation with globe spanning operations who had been using much of San Juan Island as the Belle Vue Sheep Farm since 1853. While Cutlar’s only known crop was potatoes and his cultivated land may have only amounted to 1/3 of an acre (according to Charles Griffin, the farm’s manager). By contrast, the Belle Vue sheep farm was a massive livestock operation with approximately 5000 head of sheep who were pastured at sheep stations across the entire length of San Juan Island as well as numerous free ranging cattle and pigs. Today, the site of Lyman Cutlar's farm is still a working small farm, owned by the San Juan County Land Bank which preserves open land in our community and who keeps it open to the public as the <a href=\"https://sjclandbank.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020_Frazer_map.pdf\">Frazer Homestead Preserve</a>.<br /> <br /> In the past year, approximately 16 United States’ citizens, predominately gold miners who had failed to find riches during the Fraser River Gold Rush, had landed on San Juan Island and began constructing “a log cabin and a potato patch on the most valuable prairies” the Hudson’s Bay Company possessed. Though most American farmsteads were humble establishments similar to Cutlar’s, some American settlers were more ambitious, such as the settler who had landed 20 head of cattle. From the British perspective, these American settlers were squatters, illegally occupying company land located inside the British Empire.<br /> <br /> From the American perspective, San Juan Island was part of the United States of America and the Hudson’s Bay Company was an imperious enterprise whose illegitimate claims threatened their livelihood. In fact, from a certain perspective, San Juan Island was located in both the British Empire and the USA. The Oregon Treaty, signed 13 years earlier in 1846, said that the local boundary between the two nations shall be “the middle of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver’s Island.” In fact, there were two channels, the Haro Strait (which if it was selected would make San Juan Island part of the USA) and the Rosario Strait (which would make San Juan Island part of the British Empire). Thus, the potato patch which the pig invaded was contested ground.<br /> <br /> This was not the first time that one of the Belle Vue Sheep Farm’s pigs had invaded Cutlar’s farmstead. But when Cutlar woke up to find a Hawaiian herdsman named Jacob laughing that the pig “was up to his old game” he picked up his gun and in “a moment of irritation” killed the pig. When Cutlar, who felt regret for killing the company pig instead of merely scaring it away, went to see Hudson’s Bay Company manager Charles Griffin, the longstanding local and global tensions collided. When Cutlar offered to pay for the pig, Griffin told him, “you Americans are a nuisance on the island and have no business here…and I shall…have you removed.” Cutlar retorted, “I came here to settle for shooting your hog not to argue the right of Americans on the island for I consider it American soil.”<br /> <br /> Within a day’s time of Cutlar and Griffin’s dispute a group of 4 British officials showed up at Cutlar’s farm, threatening to arrest him if he did not pay the high sum of $100 (more than 6 times the hog’s value) for its death. Word of these threats spread to American officials on the mainland and 42 days later, on July 26, 1859, US forces under Captain Pickett landed at the Hudson’s Bay Company’s dock to protect American citizens on San Juan Island. The Pig War had begun!",

The first peoples created complex cultures around canoe journeys and salmon cycles. Then came Spanish, English, Russian and American explorers in search of territory and shipping lanes. As the country developed, the region’s ports began to bolster trade of vast natural resources, and naval installations came to guard the continent. <br /> <br /> Washington’s coastline is rich with historic buildings and vessels, museums, and archival collections, and the maritime industry remains a foundation of the region’s economy today. Shipyards, container ports, cruise ships, tugs, and marinas full of small and large pleasure craft are as much a part of this NHA’s inheritance as historic ships or lighthouses.   <br /> <br /> To read the Maritime Washington National Heritage Area management plan, click here. <br /> <br /> The vast diversity of this living landscape can be divided by geographic regions:  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{94}\" paraid=\"11\">Olympic Peninsula </h2> <p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{100}\" paraid=\"12\">The Olympic Peninsula is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Puget Sound’s Hood Canal. The Olympic Mountains rise prominently in the interior. Historic ports, coastal communities, and traditional tribal lands rim this boxy landmass. Home to Olympic National Park, the peninsula features the longest stretch of publicly-owned and undeveloped shoreline on the Pacific Coast, and closely resembles the shoreline inhabited by the tribes before Europeans arrived. Olympic National Park is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, designated for its ecosystem diversity, while the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary lies offshore, distinguished for its educational opportunities.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{106}\" paraid=\"13\">Puget Sound </h2> <p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{112}\" paraid=\"14\">A complex inlet of the Pacific Ocean and the third-largest estuary in the United States, Puget Sound comprises many waterways, basins, and bays, including Seattle’s brackish Lake Union. For millennia, the sound connected the Northwest people to the sea – for travel, trade, sustenance, protection, and recreation. Today, Puget Sound is home to maritime industries, military bases, small coastal communities, the cities of Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, and the state capital Olympia. The Kitsap Peninsula and enchanting islands lie in the interior of Puget Sound, with the Hood Canal between them and the Olympic Peninsula.    </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{118}\" paraid=\"15\">Northern Coast </h2> <p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{124}\" paraid=\"16\">Along the western edge of Skagit and Whatcom Counties lies Washington’s northern coastline, a series of protected bays stretching north to the Strait of Georgia, which separates Vancouver Island from mainland Canada. The traditional aquaculture, fishing, and sea trade economies remain important in this region. Continuing a centuries-old tradition, northern coastal cities like Bellingham still provide jumping-off points for journeys to Alaska through the Inside Passage.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{130}\" paraid=\"17\">Salish Sea Islands </h2> <p paraeid=\"{53103d88-8610-4d83-ab9c-a5392def8c09}{136}\" paraid=\"18\">Three Northwest water bodies – the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, and Canada’s Strait of Georgia - are together called the Salish Sea. The over 400 islands that lie in these waters are the ancient homelands of native tribes and habitat for some of the region’s most diverse marine wildlife. This varied island environment– including Whidbey Island, one of the largest islands in the contiguous United States, and the San Juan archipelago— contains some of the most remote and rugged places in this region, as well as active ports and popular vacation destinations. </p>",

    "bodyText": "Matia Island is one of the gems of the Washington State Marine Park System due to its giant, near rainforest vibrant old-growth cedars, abundant wildlife, and excellent coastline. Like all Marine State Park, acres can only be accessed via boat or kayak. Due to its wild status (most of Matia Island is designated as wilderness), many areas of the island are off-limits to humans and no dogs are allowed on Matia Island.<br /> <br /> Matia Island has been a Coast Salish homeland since time immemorial. Its first Western settler was a mystically-minded Civil War veteran, Elvin Smith, who moved to Matia in 1892 and lived alone here as a homesteader dubbed, \"The Hermit of Matia Island.\" Elvin's religious mysticism gained a national following and he solicited and received numerous cash gifts from visitors who sought the power of his prayers and sometimes they traveled all the way to his refuge for personal spiritual guidance. Elvin regularly rowed to Orcas Island to collect the money sent him by his admirers and purchase supplies; his Orcas friends convinced him to have a friend move in with him so that he wouldn't be injured as he aged, but unfortunately their boat capsized and both were lost on a trip from Orcas Island to Matia in 1922. A year later a fox farm was built on Matia Island but it was not successful and Matia became federal government property.<br /> <br /> In 1959, the federal government leased the island to the State of Washington and Matia Island became a State Park. Matia Island has six campsites, a picnic area, and a composting toilet for visitors. A 1.2 mile trail system takes visitors into the wilderness areas of the island. Fires are not allowed on the island due to its sensitive ecology. A dock and two buoys are available for maritime visitors to tie up on their visit to Matia Island. The island has no trash service or drinking water so bring lots of liquid and pack out what you pack in when you come to Matia Island.",

Mitchell Hill contains historical remnants of the Old Military Road which connected English Camp and American Camp during the joint occupation of San Juan Island. The Old Military Road built upon an existing network known as the Cowichan Road which was built by Native American contractors working for the Belle Vue Sheep Farm who used the road to connect their various pastures.The 312 acres of the Mitchell Hill area contain excellent trails for hiking, biking, and horseback riding.<br /> <br /> The trails in this area feed into a larger network of trails known as the Roche Harbor Highlands trail system]. You can hike from here to the top of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/young-hill-trailhead.htm\">Young Hill</a>, visit the Royal Marines Cemetery, or go to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-parade-grounds.htm\">English Camp Parade Grounds</a>, where you can hike the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bell-point-trailhead.htm\">Bell Point Trail</a> or the Westcott Bay Trail.

    "bodyText": "Moran State Park, located on Orcas Island, is one of the jewels of the Washington State Parks system. Former Seattle mayor, Robert Moran moved to Orcas Island in the early 1900s believing that the climate of the San Juan Islands would improve his faltering health. Moran purchased a massive estate where he built an impressive mansion. While the mansion remains in private hands, Robert Moran recognized that the lakes, woods, and mountains that were a part of his estate were natural treasures which deserved to be preserved for public enjoyment. In 1921, he donated these lands to the state of Washington for the creation of Moran State Park.<br /> <br /> Some of the most breathtaking lands in the San Juan Islands can be found at Moran State Park. Its 38-mile hiking trail network is the largest in the archipelago, providing visitors with opportunities to stroll along lakes, enjoy waterfalls, and stroll along five different lakes. Trails and roads lead to the top of Mount Constitution, whose 2,409 foot summit is the highest point in the San Juan Archipelago. Visitors can also ride horses, go mountain biking, fish for lake trout, kayak, or camp in the 151 campsites available for Moran State Park visitors.<br /> <br /> Moran State Park is not just a natural wonder, it is also a historic place. Much of the park’s infrastructure, including the stunning stone observation tower atop Mount Constitution, was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The CCC was a New Deal Era program designed to provide meaningful work for Americans who lost employment during the Great Depression. Many of the most iconic facilities in national and state parks throughout the United States were constructed by the men who worked for the CCC.<br /> <br /> At the top of Mount Constitution, the park also operates the Summit Visitor Center, which interprets the natural history of the San Juan Islands. The indoor visitor center and gift shop is open April through October and outdoor exhibits are available year round. The park also has concessionaires who will rent various watercraft to visitors and a snack bar, “The Sugar Shack” is located on Cascade Lake. If you’re feeling adventurous, Moran State Park has many recreational opportunities for all types of visitor! Learn about the numerous <a href=\"https://moranstatepark.com/campgrounds/?utm_source=VisitSanJuans&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=VisitSanJuans%20Referral\">camping opportunities</a> available at Moran State Park and check out the <a href=\"https://www.parks.wa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/863/Moran-State-Park---brochure-with-map-PDF?bidId=\">park map</a> to begin planning your visit.",

This loop trail has many options in terms of hiking distance from 2-4 miles in total. The trail is mainly forested, with the trees clearing away at the top of the hill. <br /> <br /> As you begin the trail you will cross meadows where you may encounter foxes, eagles, and deer who live on this island. At 0.3 miles, you will encounter the junction with the Nature Trail. 0.25 miles later, you will ascend Mount Finlayson; at this point, you can shorten your hike by taking a connecting trail to Second Lagoon which loops back toward the trailhead or continue another 0.3 miles further for a longer loop.As the trail loops back, you walk down a long road through second-growth forest.<br /> <br /> This area of San Juan Island was extensively logged during the 1800s and this forest has regenerated since its extensive exploitation. Today’s forest is lush with numerous Douglas Firs, wild roses, and ferns. As you walk back towards the trailhead, small side trails offer you the opportunity of visiting and exploring Third Lagoon, Jakle’s Lagoon, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-town-lagoon.htm\">Old Town Lagoon</a>.",

    "bodyText": "Construction started in October of 1860 for the first Officers’ Quarters at English Camp. Commanders chose hillside residences for their good view and separation from the rest of the company, a feature which replicated the class stratification of Victorian society. Making this spot livable required intense labor. Soldiers had to dig out the terraces, excavating rocks and dirt, to make areas large enough to fit houses and outbuildings. Rocks, and clam shells from the nearby midden, were then used to level out the earth and construct walls.<br /> <br /> The first resident of the original Officers’ Quarters was George Bazalgette. He was a consistent leader and kept the peace between his camp and American Camp. He even was quite friendly with American leader George Pickett. Unlike the soldiers at American Camp who were often under provisioned due to their isolation from US supply lines, the Royal Marines enjoyed a comfortable stay on the island due in large part to their close proximity to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/esquimault-naval-base.htm\">Esquimault Naval Base</a>. They were provided with plenty of food and recreational activities including a billiard room, library, and extensive gardens.<br /> <br /> Bazalgette’s time on San Juan Island came to a close in 1867, after a disagreement between him and the American commander of the time, Thomas Grey. During a Christmastime visit to American Camp, Bazalgette noticed a British marine who had deserted his company. To add insult to injury, former bulger George Hughes was now a US soldier! Bazalgette requested for Hughes to be returned to his company, but Grey was offended and refused. Even though the two commanders were in conflict, the matter was resolved in a peaceful, civil, and bureaucratic manner. Ultimately, it resulted in Bazalgette’s superior removing him from the post. Richard Temple-Grenville, the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos and Lord President of the Privy Council wrote:<br /> <br /> “His Grace considers it necessary therefore to draw the serious attention of their Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to the case in order that they may direct such instructions to be sent to Captain Bazalgette as they may deem fit to prevent reoccurrence of any similar proceedings.”<br /> <br /> After the Hughes incident, Bazalgette returned to England, and William Addis Delacombe took command of English Camp. When Delacombe arrived, the Officers' Quarters were worse for wear. He was advised to repair or rebuild entirely; the building was not fit to withstand another winter. He submitted plans for a new, five room cottage. Delacombe had his wife and several children with him, so he needed the space. This large home would cost around $2,000 and was 150 feet behind the old quarters. He also built a nearby home for his lieutenant for $1,500.<br /> <br /> With the new Officers’ Quarters finished, Lieutenant S. Eardly-Wilmot described English Camp as follows:<br /> <br /> “The English camp is picturesquely situated at the head of a beautiful little land-locked harbour. The officers’ quarters—neat wooden buildings—are on the slope of a hill surrounded by gardens. The commander’s house is about 200 feet higher up: a well constructed building, with offices complete and a well-filled garden, while an extensive forest close to it is an inexhaustible resource for timber and fuel.”<br /> <br /> Delacombe left the island in 1872. By that time, San Juan Islands had been ruled American territory by Kaiser Wilhelm I, so joint military occupation was no longer needed. With the military gone, English immigrant <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/crook-house.htm\">William Crook</a> claimed this land. Along with his family (especially his son James), he took care of the Officers’ quarters along with the rest of English Camp. At some point, however, the Officers’ Quarters were lost to fire, as were many of the buildings at English Camp. Today, you can climb the terrace to the Officers’ Quarters and get a sense of what life was like there for the Crooks and the high-ranking members of English Camp.",

The trail continues another 5 miles beyond the Frazer Homestead Preserve, ending in the town of Friday Harbor. The route is only partially off-trail, with hikers routed onto Cattle Point Road and Golf Course Road for a significant portion of the trail. At the end of the golf course, the trail crosses the road and continues next to the Friday Harbor Airport, allowing excellent opportunities to watch planes take off and land.The Old Military Road has a storied history.<br /> <br /> The first formal roads on San Juan Island were built by the<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson’s Bay Company,</a> primarily utilizing contract laborers from the Cowichan Tribe, to connect a series of sheep runs on this island operated by their subsidiary, The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/belle-vue-sheep-farm.htm\">Belle Vue Sheep Farm.</a> The Old Military Road utilized and improved upon that road network to create a route that connected American Camp and English Camp during the Joint Occupation of San Juan Island (1860-1872). This route allowed the commanders of both militaries to communicate quickly and resolve disputes that emerged during the Joint Occupation. Towards the end of the Joint Occupation, a telegraph line was laid to provide even quicker communication, demonstrating the importance of the Old Military Road in helping to keep the peace on San Juan Island. As you walk this trail, you will follow in the historic footsteps of the many groups of people who made the Old Military Road possible.",

    "bodyText": "Charles Griffin, the head of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s Belle Vue Sheep Farm, was amazed by the unusual community that once occupied this scenic lagoon. “Soldiers, Inds. (Indians) and men were all determined to be drunk together. [I] Never saw anything like it.” Members of the American Boundary Commission were equally derogatory, describing San Juan Town as consisting of “about 20 houses…five or six are ‘rum mills’…the population of the place numbers about 30 or 40..white men, Chinamen and Indians. Whiskey drinking seems to be the principal occupation. There were not more than half a dozen respectable Americans in the place.”<br /> <br /> This small village was an immediate result of the military presence on San Juan Island during the boundary conflict. Shortly after US soldiers landed on San Juan Island in 1859, entrepreneurs, sensing a new market amongst the soldiers, began ferrying over abandoned buildings from defunct mining operations near Bellingham and repurposing them in San Juan Town. Vice-related businesses, such as alcohol sales and prostitution especially flourished in this location during the joint occupation. Proprietors evaded law enforcement by claiming American citizenship when questioned by British authorities and British citizenship in front of American authorities. Authorities only held jurisdiction over citizens of their own nation making this an attractive strategy for lawbreakers on San Juan Island.<br /> <br /> Not all observers had a negative opinion of San Juan Town. A US newspaper described it as having “quite a stable appearance. The town possesses a bakery, a butchery, three or four barrooms, one aristocratic “two-bit” house, a fruit stand, grocery…..all of which are liberally patronized.” This small town was a multiethnic community whose residents and habitues included German-Jewish immigrants such as Israel Katz, Asian and Hawaiian migrant workers, Native Americans, and of course soldiers from both the US and British militaries.When the border conflict ended in 1872 and the armed forces left the region San Juan Town was abandoned and Friday Harbor became the urban center of life on San Juan Island.<br /> <br /> By 1890, the only resident of San Juan Town was “Whispering Pete” Searcy a local character who lived in the otherwise abandoned community. That year, San Juan village was obliterated by a brushfire which Searcy attempted to fight but which consumed the remaining landscape of this early settlement.Today, no visible traces remain of San Juan Town. Instead, a scenic lagoon brimming with plants and animal life occupies its location. On a clear day, stunning views of Mount Baker and the San Juan archipelago await visitors to this former townsite. You can reach Old Town Lagoon by walking along the waterfront from the Fourth of July Beach trailhead or downhill 1/10th of a mile from the Jakle’s Lagoon Trailhead.",

    "bodyText": "British soldiers wearing a distinctive scarlet tunic first saw combat on foreign soil at The Battle of the Dunes on June 14, 1658, part of the Franco-Spanish War. A combined French and British force defeated a Spanish Army on the sand dunes near the beaches of Dunkirk, losing only 400 soldiers compared to the Spanish losses of 1200 men. This battle was the decisive victory that ended ten years of conflict between the three nations. It was under these propitious circumstances that the Red Coat debuted in combat.<br /> <br /> Though the term “redcoat” has a negative connotation in the United States since it was worn by British soldiers fighting against US Independence in the American Revolution, it has a far more illustrious meaning in the former British Empire. The armies of former British colonies, such as New Zealand and Canada, wear red coats as part of their formal dress uniforms, paying tribute to their imperial heritage. This uniform dress not only gave the British Army a sense of cohesion across the globe, but the bright color allowed individual soldiers to easily distinguish between friends and foes.<br /> <br /> On San Juan Island, redcoated Royal Marines deployed to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp.htm\">English Camp</a> in March of 1860, where they lived for more than twelve years. Despite the imperial rivalry between the US and the United Kingdom, both sides became friends on San Juan Island. In fact, this friendship grew so quickly and so deeply that for twelve years redcoats attended and participated in 4th of July parties at American Camp, where they joined in at public readings of the Declaration of Independence, a sight that would likely have greatly surprised the men who wrote it.<br /> <br /> In the 1850s, new materials and new uniforms were introduced for British soldiers that came in different colors, including yellow, khaki green, and blue. Red coats still remained the color used in the Royal Army's dress uniform, up until World War I, when they were phased out due to the comparatively expensive price of the dye used to make them. However, red coats can still be seen here at San Juan Island National Historical Park, where our living history program uses authentic period uniforms to recreate what life was like for the British soldiers who made our park their home and where Redcoats still raise the Union Jack.",

    "bodyText": "This small but elegant home with its gracious porch was one of several cottages built for officers stationed at American Camp during its existence from 1859-1874. Captain George Pickett constructed this building at the beginning of the occupation (in either 1859 or 1860) out of disassembled buildings from Fort Whatcom. At the beginning of the Pig War, Pickett was ordered to abandon Fort Bellingham and he and his troops carefully salvaged the buildings in that facility and used lumber from that frontier outpost to construct American Camp. This act significantly increased the speed at which American Camp was built up because no sawmill existed on San Juan Island, which meant that standard sized boards and other lumber had to be imported from the mainland of Washington State.<br /> <br /> George Pickett was the first man to serve as commanding officer over the 15 years that American Camp was in existence. Pickett’s rash actions during the Pig War crisis, such as his threats to the British and his poor initial choices for American Camp’s location led him to be relieved of duty on San Juan Island by Winfield Scott, the highest ranking general in the United States military. Restored to his post by General Harney after Scott left the Pacific Northwest, Pickett learned from his earlier mistakes and established cordial relations with British forces at English Camp, a pattern of friendship and cooperation that remained in place for all 12 years of the Joint Occupation.<br /> <br /> While English Camp only had two commanding officers in 12 years, American Camp had 15 commanders over the course of 15 years. This high turnover rate reflected the undesirability of the San Juan Islands as a posting. During the Civil War (1861-1865) the US military regarded San Juan Island as a low priority and the soldiers and officers stationed here received few supplies and money leading them to have a lower standard of living than most members of the US military. For professional soldiers, orders to report to San Juan Island kept them far away from the front lines of the largest war the US had ever fought in, preventing them from serving their country and gaining the experience that could advance their career. These very real factors were a major reason that so many commanding officers served for such a short time on San Juan Island.<br /> <br /> This double frame house is made of cedar and features weatherboarding and a shingled roof. The bedrooms were located at the front of the building and the kitchen and the dining room were located in the rear. Originally intended as a duplex that would house two officers, by 1867 it was occupied by a single officer. Porches were originally located on all four sides of this structure but three out of four of the porches were removed and were later restored. Significant alterations, including the installation of plumbing, electricity, and telephone lines were performed by the farming families who later lived here.<br /> <br /> Robert Firth, the last manager of the Hudson's Bay Company's Belle Vue Sheep Farm homesteaded in American Camp, claiming the land and buildings as his property after American Camp closed in 1874. He used this building as his farmhouse, a tradition continued by the McRae family who purchased the farm from him. In that time, the history of this building and the other surviving structures at American Camp were enshrouded in local myth and only through a combination of archaeology, archival research, oral history, and painstaking research has this building’s history been recovered.<br /> <br /> The Officers’ Quarters are currently closed to the public, but we plan to furnish it with historically accurate furniture and possessions to recreate what it looked like during the Pig War period. This building was originally intended as a temporary structure, but it has now stood for over 160 years. This remarkable feat is a testament to its excellent construction and the preservation work that farm families and park service staff have done to keep this piece of history alive!",

    "bodyText": "<p>Po`alima also known as Peter Friday (Po`alima means ‘Friday’ in Hawaiian) was a Hawaiian Islander who first came to the Pacific Northwest in 1842 at the age of 12. Po`alima initially worked at the Cowlitz Farm, a Hudson's Bay Company agricultural center near the mouth of the Columbia River in present day Washington. While there, Po`alima married a Coast Salish woman and they had a child named Joe Friday. In 1854, the Friday family moved to San Juan Island where Po`alima worked as one of the Hudson's Bay Company shepherds, rearing and herding sheep from his home in what is now the village of Friday Harbor.<br />  </p> <p>During his time there, Po`alima was visited by a passing American ship who asked him what the name of the place he lived was. Po`alima, misunderstanding his interlocutors, told the Americans his English name, which is how Friday Harbor got its name. In 1860, Po`alima left the Hudson’s Bay Company and began homesteading independently at his former sheep station. At some point, Po`alima’s wife died and he remarried a Songhees First Nations woman named Saaptenar with whom he had two daughters. When all the other Hawaiians left San Juan Island in 1872, the Friday family remained, using Joe Friday’s status as an American-born citizen to claim their family homestead, which Po`alima and Saaptenar could not do because Native Americans and Hawaiian born men were barred from full citizenship due to their race. In his old age, Peter Friday rejoined his fellow Hawaiian HBC employees and their families in British Columbia, where they had relocated after the boundary dispute resolution to enjoy equal rights.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The prairies in American Camp are some of the last surviving native prairies in Washington, constituting only 3% of its original extent. Of the roughly 700 acres of American Camp considered prairie \"grasslands\", most are dominated by invasive grasses and plants. Only about 30 acres of these grasslands can be considered a true native prairie. This includes portions of remnant prairie at English Camp near Young Hill.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Prairies are integral to the history of the park. For millennia, Coast Salish people maintained the prairies and encouraged the growth of native plants used for food and medicine. Within the last 200 years, prairie habitat within the park was altered by historic Euro-American farming and ranching. The newly enforced lack of fire changed the overall structure of the prairie and introduced many non-native plants.  </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Despite these setbacks, the American Camp prairie and grasslands are still home to a wide array of native plants and rare and unique animal species, such as the endangered island marble butterfly (Euchloe ausonides insulanus) and several varieties of camas.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Plants such non-native grasses, Canada thistle, Himalayan blackberry, and encroaching woody species make it hard for native plant species to thrive. Park staff continually survey the prairie, mapping new and problematic invasives. Over 200 person hours are devoted per year to remove invasive plants and control small conifers that continually encroach into the prairie. To help keep new invasive plants out of San Juan Island, make sure to check your shoes and vehicle tires for hitchhiking seeds before entering the park— (especially if you’ve been in areas where invasive plants are known to occur).</p>",

    "bodyText": "<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/crook-house.htm\">Jim Crook </a>was one year old when his family began homesteading at English Camp. The Crook family made the structures the Royal Marines had left behind a year earlier into homes and workshops. In addition to the officers quarters, blockhouse, commissary, and hospital, the English also left behind a cemetery, where the final remains of seven individuals still lie in honor to this day. These soldiers did not die in combat, but were largely the victims of tragic accidents, such as drownings and an unintentional shooting. Nonetheless, they were soldiers deployed in a near-war and this memorial day we celebrate their memory.<br /> Jim Crook lived almost his entire life at English Camp. As a senior citizen, he reflected on the cemetery for a newspaper interview. “I can even remember what it looked like when I first started going up there. There was a different kind of fence and a gate with an arch over the top [and] some faded lettering on the arch.”<br /> <br /> Crook earned 10 pounds a year from the English government for maintaining the cemetery where at least 5 Royal Marines died while serving their nation (the identity of two of the individuals buried at the English Camp Cemetery have been lost). According to a member of the Canadian Navy, his annual pay arrived dramatically, being “taken over by a Canadian Naval Ship” that landed at English Camp. Crook was not sure of how long he’d been doing his duties, estimating in 1956 that he’d “been tending that plot for 40 some years.” Crook explained that as a graveyard tender he would “build a fence and a stile and I paint them. When they wear out I build another fence ad stile. I keep the grass and weeds down and two-three times a year I gather up the fallen leaves.”<br /> <br /> The headstones at the Royal Marines’ Cemetery read as follows:<br /> “Davis, William, d. May 07, 1868, age 26, Pte. 109th Company RMLI, accidentally drowned. Ellis, Jos, d. Jan 04, 1863, Pte. RMLI, accidentally drowned. Riddy, Thomas, d. Jan 04, 1863, Pte. RMLI, accidentally drowned. Stewart, G. E., d. Jun 01, 1865, age 28, Corp. (corporal) RMLI, suddenly departed this life, Native of Derby, England. Taylor, William, d. Jan 26, 1868, age 34, (civilian) accidentally shot by his brother. Weasley, James, d. Apr 07, 1869, Pte. 27th Company RMLI, drowned in the adjacent harbor (<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/garrison-bay.htm\">Garrison Bay</a>).<br /> <br /> Today, our maintenance staff carries on the tradition of caring for these military graves that Jim Crook initiated. The Royal Marines cemetery is about .25 miles from the trailhead of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/young-hill-trailhead.htm\">Young Hill Trail</a>. Visitors can pay their respect to these men and their national service during a visit to our park.",

After its resolution, many of the soldiers deployed to the island, such as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/eliza-jakle.htm\">Jakle family </a>remained on the island as homesteaders.<br /> <br /> Agriculture continues to thrive at the San Juan Island Farmers Market. Founded in 1987, it features around 35 vendors including artists, artisans, farmers, and bakers. Visitors can purchase produce raised on island and seafood from our waters. Shellfish, cheese, salmon, eggs, fruits, and vegetables are available as well as prepared food from around the world such as falafel, momos, paella, and pizza. The Farmers Market is open from 9:30AM-1 PM every Saturday from April-October and the 1st and 3d Saturday in November, December, and March. In January and February, it is open on the first Saturday of the month.",

They welcome folks of all ages to explore and learn about the island’s history, industry, culture, families, and nature. You can walk around the main museum, as well as see the restored James King farmhouse, original county jail, and Scribner log cabin. It also has an extensive research collection of primary sources from our island that has and continues to enable historians to research and write about San Juan County history.</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">In the society’s words: “The purpose of the San Juan Historical Society and its museum is to share and interpret the story of the peoples of San Juan Island. The Historical Society will assemble, collect, preserve, exhibit and make available for future generations, historical data, information and artifacts which illustrate the heritage of San Juan Island. Collections, programs and publications will provide for the enjoyment and education of residents and visitors.”</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Their current collection primarily focuses on the Pig War and the stories of the white settlers following this conflict. Their extensive collection of primary sources are crucial for anyone wanting to learn more about San Juan Island’s history. In recent years, they have extensively focused on Coast Salish history, and are hoping to incorporate the stories of Hispanic and Asian immigrants. The 19th century replica barn on site is being converted into a new Museum of History and Industry, and will tell tales of all those who have influenced daily life on San Juan Island. The Atrium and the Logging and Limestone processing exhibits are already open to the public!</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.sjmuseum.org/home/\">Visit their website</a> for hours, fees, and more information!</p> <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "In 1999, the Sandwith Orchard was overgrown with chest heigh wild Nootka rose bushes and its historic heirloom fruit trees were choked by thick snowberry vines. The orchard, parts of which were planted as early as 1875, had been largely untended since 1935 when its third owner lost it in a Depression-Era bank foreclosure. Consequently, it required significant restoration work if it was going to become a historically accurate landscape. This did not deter National Park Service cultural landscape preservation staff who worked with maintenance personnel to restore the historic orchard through hard work and scientific inquiry.<br /> <br /> Cuttings were taken from 9 historic trees and analyzed at USDA genetic laboratories to identify the heirloom varieties that grew in the orchard. Additional cuttings from these trees and the pear trees at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-parade-grounds.htm\">English Camp Parade Grounds</a> and plum trees at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/crook-house.htm\">Crook House </a>were grafted onto seedling root stock at the Raintree Nursery in Morton, WA. These saplings were nursed for two years and then on March 14, 2009, 11 pear, five apricot, four apple, and three plum were planted by a combination of park service staff, local volunteers, and members of the Washington Conservation Corps. Since this time the trees have matured, and fruit is available for foragers in this area around the beginning of August.<br /> <br /> This orchard is part of the Sandwith Homestead, a tract settled and farmed by Isaac Sandwith from 1875-1902. Sandwith built a house using material salvaged from one of the English Camp buildings which were abandoned 3 years earlier and constructed several farm structures, including a barn, stable, granary, chicken house, and fences. Sandwith’s homestead abutted the land of Augustus Hofmeister, the English Camp sutler whose operation provided meat, fruit, and vegetables for the Royal Marines at English Camp. Hofmeister, who chose to remain on San Juan Island after the English military he was a part of departed, died a year prior to Sandwith’s settlement. Sandwith, who paid rent to Hofmeister’s estate, almost certainly incorporated some of Hofmeister’s improvements into his homestead.<br /> <br /> The Sandwith Orchard was part of a 160-acre homestead, raising sheep, cattle, hogs, grain, fruit, and vegetables which Isaac Sandwith farmed for 27 years. This orchard held fruit that came ripe sequentially over the course of late summer and fall, providing a series of different fruits for the Sandwith family for eating and preservation. Oral histories also indicate that the Sandwiths sold fruit to native Americans who passed through San Juan Island as part of their seasonal rounds. Isaac Sandwith eventually acquired 640 acres of range land for the 1,000 sheep he owned around 1901.<br /> <br /> In 1902, Sandwith sold his farmland to Dr. Victor J. Capron, a prominent citizen and local doctor. Capron, the creator of the first telephone lines on San Juan Island, was noted for his technological savvy and willingness to do house calls. His portable x-ray machine, which he modified to power through his car’s battery, combined his technical skill and love of community service. In 1926, Capron sold the former homestead to farmer Alfred Douglas, who had lived on San Juan Island since 1870; Douglas would lose the land in 1935, when he was unable to pay his mortgage and the bank foreclosed on this property.The Sandwith Orchard abutted the Old Military Road, a road that connected English Camp and American Camp, traces of which can still be seen on the landscape. Remains of the Sandwith home and other archaeological resources can also be found in the nearby woods including the Sandwith home's foundations, artifacts, and remnants of a stone wall that likely enclosed the farm.<br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing additional remains of San Juan Island’s homestead period, you can visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/crook-house.htm\">Crook House </a>located at English Camp. While there, you can tour the historic structures on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-parade-grounds.htm\">English Camp Parade Ground</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-barracks.htm\">the Barracks </a>and blockhouse which provide a sense of the building that Isaac Sandwith tore down to construct his house.

Its sunny and windy environment aided in preservation. And its proximity to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/sajh/salmon_bank.pdf\">Salmon Bank</a> made it an ideal location; they didn’t have to transport the fish far after catching them. Also located nearby was Cattle Point Village, a summertime gathering spot for the Coast Salish.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2d827ca8-54c9-46cc-b7b7-d21296083e34}{33}\" paraid=\"213499606\">In the late 1800’s, European settlers began to use South Beach for the same purpose. The Hudson Bay Company would salt and pack the salmon they bought from the Coast Salish. Then they sold it to Hawai’i and other global purchasers. Additionally, they transformed the land around the beach into fields and farmland. Homesteader Eliza Jakle, a female farmer and entrepreneur, sold drinking water to the fish trap workers who worked here seasonally. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{364e896f-8f16-4c3a-92ed-077e7189164e}{135}\" paraid=\"1804135215\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Today, South Beach is the longest stretch of publicly accessible wild coastline anywhere in the San Juan Islands! From the two miles of gray sand, pebbles, and driftwood, there’s an excellent view of Juan de Fuca and Haro Straits.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2d827ca8-54c9-46cc-b7b7-d21296083e34}{111}\" paraid=\"1236459937\">You can access this popular gathering spot from the American Camp Visitor Center by hiking the South Beach Loop Trail. While camping is not allowed, there’s still plenty to do at South Beach. Have a bonfire or barbeque in one of several fire pits, take a walk, enjoy a picnic, or host a party! Dogs can partake in the fun as long as they are <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/pets/be-a-bark-ranger.htm\">on leash</a>.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2d827ca8-54c9-46cc-b7b7-d21296083e34}{181}\" paraid=\"851287288\">Keep an eye out for orcas in the water! You might be able to see other sea life, such as river otters, anemones, shore crabs, and barnacles. On the hill behind the shore, you might see eagles, hawks, foxes, or rabbits. In late May and early June, look out for the endangered <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sajh/learn/nature/raising-an-endangered-butterfly.htm\">Island Marble Butterfly</a>.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{2d827ca8-54c9-46cc-b7b7-d21296083e34}{225}\" paraid=\"929225596\">To get to South Beach from Friday Harbor: take Spring Street from town, then a left onto Mullis Road. This will turn into Cattle Point Road. You will see a sign for Fourth of July Beach- keep going. About half a mile later, the exit to South Beach will be on your right, down Pickett’s Lane. </p>",

Visitation to its 814 acres and ten miles of hiking trails is only possible via watercraft, but its two docks and 48 buoys provide ample anchorage all around the island. 39 campsites are available for visitors who want to sleep on this isolated island.<br /> <br /> Sucia Island has long been part of the Coast Salish homelands and was first explored by Spanish explore Francisco de Eliza, who gave it its name which means 'dirty' due to its turbulent waters and reefs. Settled in the 1880s by Charles Henry Wiggins and his wife Mary Luzier, a Cowlitz Tribe member, they moved from Waldron Island to more isolated Sucia after their 8 children were forcibly removed by the government and taken to an Indian boarding school. On Sucia, the Wigginses had five more children and built a farm and ranch.<br /> <br /> In 1952, the state of Washington acquired part of Sucia Later parcels were donated by preservationist minded private citizens and through future government acquisitions which enabled the entire island to become a state park in 1972.Sucia’s natural history is as old as the dinosaurs. The only known dinosaur bone discovery in Washington State occurred on Sucia Island’s appropriately named Fossil Bay in 2012. The 80 million year-old fossil belonged to the same family of dinosaurs as Tyrannosaurus Rex, meaning that this fearsome predator may once have roamed our region long before the San Juan Islands formed.<br /> <br /> Visitors to Sucia Island can enjoy world-class snorkeling, clamming, and crabbing. While there, picnic tables and beaches provide ideal sites for relaxing and enjoying this special place. Visitors are required to pay <a href=\"https://www.parks.wa.gov/165/Boating-fees\">moorage fees</a> to the Washington State Parks system if they dock their boats during their visit.",

    "bodyText": "The first lime producers on San Juan Island were the Royal Marines stationed at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp.htm\">English Camp</a>, who mined and processed lime at Roche Harbor during the Joint Occupation of San Juan Island (1860-1872). This lime was used to construct English camp itself, serving as a vital ingredient in the whitewash, mortar, and paint used to build English Camp. Commercial operators, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lyman-cutlar-homestead.htm\">Lyman Cutlar</a>, the settler whose violence towards a Hudson’s Bay Company pig sparked The Pig War, began limited commercial lime production in 1860. The San Juan Islands soon became the largest site of lime production in Washington State, a title it would retain into the 1920s.<br /> <br /> Lime mining and processing existed at 30 different known sites on 4 different islands with production concentrated on San Juan and Orcas Islands. In the first decades of production, San Juan Island’s lime served local markets in British Columbia and Washington State but by the late 1880s, lime from the San Juans was being exported as far away as Hawaii and California for use in industry and construction.<br /> <br /> Lime production was heavy and hard work. At the mine site workers used explosives to blow large chunks of limestone free from the cliffs where it was found, jackhammers were then used to split rocks into chunks sized properly for processing in the lime kilns themselves. In the kilns, massive amounts of old growth trees were used to heat limestone to about 1800 degrees Fahrenheit, which spurred chemical reactions that separated carbon dioxide from calcite, thereby forming lime.<br /> <br /> John S. McMillin, the owner of the Tacoma and Roche Harbor Lime Company was raised in a lime producing region of Indiana and immediately entered the lime industry when he migrated to the Pacific Northwest in 1882. His company was the largest lime producer in the Pacific Northwest, producing almost 300,000 barrels of lime per year when production peaked in 1904. Over 800 people lived in the company town of Roche Harbor, which operated 13 kilns and 15 quarries and had its own hotel, post office, and power plants. Visitors to Roche Harbor Resort can tour the remaining lime kilns, located not far from the Hotel de Haro which was operated by McMillin’s Company. Additional Lime kilns can be seen at<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lime-kiln-point-state-park.htm\">Lime Kiln Point State Park</a>.<br /> <br /> By the time of the Great Depression, the Juan Islands limestone industry was dwindling, due in no small part to the exhaustion of easily accessible old growth trees to power the lime kilns. The Tacoma and Roche Harbor Lime Company, the last lime producer in operation, ceased making lime in 1956. Seattle businessman <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/reuben-tarte-county-park.htm\">Reuben Tarte</a> purchased the company’s assets and transformed it into the extensive resort which has carefully preserved facilities from its industrial past. Near the resort, you can visit John S. McMillin’s elaborate mausoleum, hike the 10 miles of trails in the<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/roche-harbor-trails.htm\">Roche Harbor Trail System</a>, or view art at the San Juan Islands Sculpture Park.",

    "bodyText": "\"The colored population of San Francisco have been making enquiries about Vancouvers Island and whether or not they would be allowed to settle and purchase land in this Colony, as owing to some recent oppressive enactments of the legislature in California they wish to transfer their allegiance to this Country; I gave them a favorable reply and assured them of the protection of the laws if they settle in this Colony.”<br /> <br /> This April 27,1858 note from British Columbia Governor James Douglas to his Hudson’s Bay Company bosses documents an often-overlooked freedom journey taken by hundreds of African-Americans who left their homeland to find liberty under the protection of the British Empire, which then controlled British Columbia. This street contains bricks commemorating individual members of the Black Pioneers.<br /> <br /> When examining 19th century racism on the West Coast, public attention normally turns to Oregon, the only state to make it illegal to be a Black resident in its state constitution. Racist laws and practices also permeated California, whose Black citizens were denied the right to testify in court, which made it far easier for white citizens to exploit and victimize them, vote, or attend schools. The 1857 Dred Scott decision, famous for its line that Black people were \"so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man is bound to respect\" denied all federal citizenship rights, potentially including the right to homestead, to African-Americans and empowered fugitive slave hunters and kidnappers to operate in free states like California. This presented a grim prospect to California's Black population who could easily envision their second-class citizenship rights disappearing in the wake of this supreme court decision.<br /> <br /> In early 1858, at least four shiploads of Black Californians dubbed the “Black Pioneers” left for freedom in British Columbia. A year later, during the Pig War, nearly 800 people had migrated to freedom on Vancouver Island. These freedomseekers had been invited to British Columbia by Governor Douglas, a man of Afro-Scottish ancestry, who sought loyal citizens to help him retain power during the Fraser River Gold Rush. That spring, the pursuit of instant riches had brought approximately 20,000 Americans to British Columbia, where they vastly outnumbered British immigrants, making Douglas apprehensive that they would not only displace his subjects but seize power and make British Columbia a part of the United States. The vast majority of these men, known as “the floating population of California” returned home without riches in late 1858 and early 1859, but the Black Pioneers who Douglas had invited to his domain remained.<br /> <br /> At the height of the Pig War, between 40 and 50 Black people, most of them migrants from California, volunteered to serve as a militia to defend Vancouver Island from possible US aggression. The Victoria Pioneer Rifle Corps publicly drilled in Victoria, participated in civic ceremonies, and were trained by the Royal Navy, which means they almost certainly interacted with Royal Marines personnel that visited and lived at English Camp. In the early 1860s, Black voters also played a key role in local politics, with their votes (something they wouldn’t have had the ability to cast in the United States) playing a decisive role in keeping Governor Douglas in power. In 1865, Governor Douglas retired and the Victoria Pioneer Rifle Group disbanded due to neglect and insults from the new, more racist authorities. Nonetheless, their mere existence as part of a successful alliance between a British Royal Governor and African-American immigrants charged with defending imperial territory from US aggression is notable, at a time when Black people were denied military in the United States.<br /> <br /> Despite their comparative freedom and their public prominence in British Columbia, Black Pioneers still faced discrimination, which was likely heightened by their alliance with Governor Douglas, which made them a juicy political target for his political rivals. Political differences with British-born Black immigrants and the new promise of freedom following the Civil War made many Black Pioneers conclude by 1865 that, as a local newspaper put it, \"We have brighter prospects of political elevation under our own [American] government, than in any British colony on this coast.\" While approximately 50 percent of the Black Pioneers returned to the United States, many present day residents of British Columbia are descended from the Black Pioneers who found freedom on Vancouver Island. <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "On Monday, April 10th, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/belle-vue-sheep-farm.htm\">Belle Vue Sheep Farm</a> Journal, kept by Charles Griffin read: “Five Cowichins (Cowichans) who I engaged yesterday….opening a road in the center of the Island to get to Prairies in order to extend our sheep run. Skachets (Skagits) carrying plank, shingles, & C.” These Cowichans, First Nations people from Vancouver Island, were hired as labor contractors by the Hudson’s Bay Company to construct the first road network on San Juan Island. The Cowichan Road connected the various prairies on San Juan Island, effectively serving as a sheep run that enabled San Juan Island to serve as a massive farm housing over 4,000 sheep.<br /> <br /> Griffin’s journal makes clear the extent to which Native American workers made the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson’s Bay Company</a>’s farm possible. In less than 30 days in the spring of 1854, some of the entries in his journal read: “Cowitchins (6) at road” “For Skatchets carrying small gravel” “Two Chimsians (Tshimshians) &1 Skatchet, making a park for cattle” “3 Skatchets & 4 Cowitchins opening another Road” “Chimsians and 3 Klalams (Klallams) finished road” “All Indians Variously Employed.” Griffin expressed frustration with Coast Salish people who strictly enforced the terms of their labor contract, calling them “rascals” for leaving his service when “their time was up.” Nonetheless, within two days of these complaints, Griffin hired new Native Americans to help construct his large farm, suggesting that though he was their employer, Griffin relied far more on Coast Salish people than they relied upon him.<br /> <br /> The Hudson’s Bay Company’s first activities on San Juan Island relied upon indigenous labor and knowledge. In 1853, this English company sent operatives to the salmon fishery located near present day American Camp to purchase, preserve, and export excess salmon from Coast Salish fishermen who had long ago developed a technologically advanced fishery. Though Coast Salish people did not possess sheep, they had successfully bred a variety of wooly dogs which they raised on San Juan Island for their fur, an activity not that different from the sheep raising that took place on the Belle Vue Sheep Farm. On that farm, many of the shepherds were Coast Salish people or were Hawaiians married to indigenous people like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/po-alima-peter-friday.htm\">Po`alima (Peter Friday)</a>. This was also true for early American settlers and military members, such as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lyman-cutlar-homestead.htm\">Lyman Cutlar </a>and George Pickett, who formed families with indigenous women in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/the-salish-sea.htm\">Salish Sea</a> region.<br /> <br /> During the Pig War period, American and British soldiers continued to improve the Cowichan Road, rerouting and transforming it into the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/old-military-road-american-camp-trail.htm\">Old Military Road</a> which connected American Camp and English Camp. After San Juan Island was declared American territory in 1872, homesteaders began to formally claim Coast Salish homelands on San Juan Island for farms of their own, starting at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/visit-american-camp.htm\">American Camp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp.htm\">English Camp</a>, and in the San Juan Valley in the interior of the island. As this 1906 photograph of sheep being herded to Friday Harbor to be taken off island demonstrates, the road network that the Cowichan people first constructed provided a way to get settlers' produce to markets off island and to bring vital resources to their isolated homes.",

    "bodyText": "On March 28, 1854, Great Britain and France declared war on Russia, joining the Ottoman Empire in a conflict that became known as The Crimean War. European powers had not fought a major war against each other since the Napoleonic Wars which ended in 1815. The Crimean War was an imperial war fought on many fronts, including modern day Ukraine, the Baltic Seas, and the Kamchatka Peninsula of East Asia. During the war, modern weaponry and new mass media technologies, such as steamships and telegraphy heightened the intensity of the conflict and brought details of the war rapidly to the global public.<br /> <br /> Many of the British Royal Marines stationed at English Camp were veterans of the Crimean War. The Crimean War lasted from 1854 until 1856 and encompassed trench warfare, amphibious assaults, and naval blockades. The primary center of the conflict was in Central Asia, including areas in Ukraine that are now embroiled in conflict, where the Russian Empire fought an alliance of Ottoman, English, and French forces. The official cause of the war was a dispute between the Russian Czar, Nicholas I and the Ottoman Emperor, Abdulmejid I, over which empire would have authority over Orthodox Christians living in Ottoman territory.<br /> <br /> This religious dispute was a pretext for European powers to project power against each other. At the time the war began in October of 1853, the Ottoman Empire’s Western European allies were concerned with Russian imperial expansion and viewed this religious and political disagreement as an opportunity to check Russian expansion through superior military force. The Ottoman Empire, which had recently lost territories in Western Europe to nationalist revolutions believed that with the support of the more powerful French and British imperial militaries they could reinvigorate their empire and secure their borders. Thought the argument over religious freedom was the reason this global war broke out, the reasons the world’s most powerful nations chose to fight this war were imperial rivalries and territorial expansion.<br /> <br /> The Crimean War was one of the first truly modern wars. New technologies, such as railways, telegraphs, and steamships, which did not exist during the Napoleonic Wars enabled the combatants to rapidly deploy forces into numerous theaters of combat. Military firepower had also significantly advanced by the time of the Crimean War and soldiers in the field faced down artillery barrages unlike those that their predecessors had faced. Works of literature, such as “The Charge of the Light Brigade” by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, evoke the senseless slaughter that British forces (and all combatants) faced during this conflict. Florence Nightingale became an international celebrity for the capable and timely assistance she gave to injured soldiers who prior to her intervention faced unsanitary and deplorable conditions in improvised field hospitals.<br /> <br /> The Crimean War ended a mere 3 years before the Pig War conflict. British Columbia Governor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/james-douglas-statue.htm\">James Douglas</a> had played a role in the conflict in North America and Asia, while many Royal Marines later stationed at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp.htm\">English Camp</a> fought on the frontlines. The US military sent observers to examine the battlefield tactics and new technologies utilized by combatants, which greatly informed the strategies used during the Civil War. The horror of this conflict and the desire to avoid another modern war undoubtedly informed British and American decision making during the Pig War.",

    "bodyText": "In February of 1857, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/james-douglas-statue.htm\">James Douglas</a>, the head of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson’s Bay Company </a>in British Columbia and Royal Governor of Vancouver Island shipped a modest amount of gold that had recently been discovered in the Fraser River Valley to the San Francisco Mint for processing. Word of Douglas’s shipment rapidly spread in the San Francisco area. By April, hundreds of Californians “suffering” from “gold fever” had arrived in Victoria. These men were the advance guard of an estimated 25,000-40,000 Californians who rapidly uprooted their lives and traveled vast distances into uncharted territory to extract riches from the challenging environment of Canada’s Fraser River Valley. Fort Yale, a Hudson's Bay Company outpost in the Fraser River Valley was a gateway for these fortuneseekers. Their actions would change the lives of First Nations people, alter the policies of imperial governments, devastate local ecosystems, and eventually lead to the Pig War. <br /> <br /> On April 4, 1858 a headline in a San Francisco newspaper read, “People Abandoning Everything for the Mines!” This was not exactly true; even as thousands of San Franciscans left their homes for Canada, they had to purchase many new things, including clothes, tools, food, horses, and transportation to get to the mines. The isolated communities in the Fraser River Valley consisted of Native American villages and Hudson’s Bay Company fur trading forts which lacked the agricultural base and stockpile of goods that could supply thousands of men who traveled there to engage in arduous and single-minded work, extracting wealth from the ground.<br /> <br /> This issue was exacerbated by a lack of environmental knowledge. The gold miners attempted to mine in Canada the same way they had in California, which in the early stages meant looking for bars of land normally submerged by the river and sifting their stones and sand for gold when high waters receded. Unfortunately for the miners, who largely arrived in Canada in May, June, and July, the Fraser River remained too high to find significant gold until late September. That meant that almost all of the prospective miners were forced to remain idle, using their dwindling supplies or paying exorbitant prices for scarce food and material at the isolated area where gold was discovered. This led some miners to head home early and empty handed, caused others to prospect further inland where they attacked First Nations people whose homes they had invaded in search of gold, and lead other miners to turn to gambling, drinking, and prostitution to pass their idle time.<br /> <br /> In late September, the water dropped low enough for mining activities to begin in earnest, but the gold that was found did not live up to miners’ outsized expectations. In the next few years, additional explorations would reveal that rich lodes of gold existed upstream and on tributaries, but it was clear that easy pickings were not available in the first places gold was found. If they would have waited until winter and had the endurance to work outside in the freezing cold and adaptability to move on in search of gold, many Californians would have found what they came for in Canada. Instead, they went home emptyhanded. Many also left bearing a resentment towards the British Empire and Governor James Douglas specifically; despite Douglas’s herculean efforts to deal with the rapid growth of his province with absolutely no funding from the British government (Vancouver was supposed to be self-supporting), and maintain British sovereignty in a community where American citizens suddenly vastly outnumbered British citizens, Douglas was reviled for the $5 license fee his government charged miners and regarded as a profiteer.<br /> <br /> Just as rapidly as they had come to Canada, miners began to leave Canada. Amongst those miners was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lyman-cutlar-homestead.htm\">Lyman Cutlar</a>, a 27 year-old man from Kentucky, who left Canada in the spring of 1859 with a Native American woman who he met and married during the Gold Rush. Cutlar and his new bride settled on San Juan Island, where they built a small cabin and planted crops in an area used by the British Hudson’s Bay Company as a major sheep farm. When one of the British pigs rooted up Cutlar’s potato patch on June 15, 1859, he killed it in anger. Cutlar’s actions would soon lead to a confrontation between the British and American empires, but many of the men involved in that conflict had participated in the Fraser River Gold Rush, which had shaped their understanding of US/British relations on the Northwestern frontier. ",

The water has land on both sides: Vancouver Island on the west and San Juan Island on the east. Its central location makes it great for both local and international shipping and traveling. </p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">In 1790, Spanish Peruvian colonizer Manuel Quimper named the strait after his ship's pilot: Gonzalo López de Haro. Over the next couple of years, more European men (José María Narváez and George Vancouver) mapped and explored the strait </p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">The Haro Strait played a large role in the San Juan Island Boundary Dispute between the United States and Britain. The Oregon Treaty (1846) split North America between the two countries along the 49th parallel. Due to unclear wording within the treaty, ownership of San Juan Island was still disputed. It didn't specify which channel in the archipelago defined the boundary. Both countries believed the island to be theirs. This led to a 12 year joint occupation of San Juan Island known as the Pig War. </p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">Americans wanted Haro Strait to be the boundary, with President Buchanan writing, “the line shall pass through the Canal de Arro… this would probably be the fair construction.”</p>   <p dir=\"ltr\">In 1870, the conflict was arbitrated by Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm I. He decided that the Haro Strait would be the western-most boundary of the United States, which placed the island under American control. <br /> <br /> Today, the Haro Strait is still used for shipping and travel. It’s especially good for nature watching tours. There is a dense population of orca whales, seals, sea lions, and sea birds. Unfortunately, the sounds from boats disrupt the hunting, navigation, and communication of the southern resident killer whales. In an attempt to make the water quieter, it is suggested that <a href=\"https://www.portvancouver.com/environmental-protection-at-the-port-of-vancouver/maintaining-healthy-ecosystems-throughout-our-jurisdiction/echo-program/projects/haro-slowdown/\">boats slow down</a> when traversing the strait.</p>",

    "bodyText": "20 years before British and American forces fought a bloodless war in the San Juan Islands over an imprecise boundary, the States of Iowa and Missouri engaged in a similar conflict. Imprecise treaty language, inept work by the official surveyor, and territorial rivalry led to armed conflict between the two newly settled states. Iowa's claim rested on survey made by John C. Sullivan in 1816 when the United States signed a treaty describing the border between the US and Osage Tribe (at this point in time Iowa and Missouri had not become states or territories). Sullivan, however, did not draw the straight line he intended to, leaving a boundary that edged North as it headed eastward and that varied markedly from the official boundary on maps.<br /> <br /> When the state of Missouri was created 3 years later, it inherited the wavering and imprecise boundary that Sullivan had created. But within a decade, the crude earthen mounds which Sullivan had left behind had eroded, making the boundary even more imprecise. In 1837, the state of Missouri sponsored a re-survey which adhered to the treaty language, sort-of. The original treaty language referred to the “Des Moines Rapids”, a turbulent part of the Mississippi River as the endpoint of this line, but the new surveyor instead looked for some sort of rapids in the tranquil Des Moines River. If this new line was accepted, the State of Missouri would gain 2,616 square miles of territory at the expense of Iowa.<br /> <br /> The two sides were at an impasse and congress appointed a commission with an Iowan, Missourian, and federal representative, but Missouri soon withdrew its participation as its leaders knew that a mutually agreeable settlement would likely deprive it of some of its land. At this point, three options remained; the inexact Sullivan Line, the Missouri Survey, or a new survey which corrected Sullivan's errors and favored Iowa even more.As this dispute simmered, Missouri government officials decided to enforce their claims by sending a tax collector into disputed territory in July of 1839, which was how Washington State first began to assert territorial control in the years before The Pig War. Residents who felt they lived in Iowa protested to the Iowa governor.<br /> <br /> By late August, both states' governments had issued proclamations claiming that the disputed territory was their rightful real estate and that they would use force to maintain it. In October 1839, Missouri Sherriff, Uriah Gregory entered the disputed territory to collect taxes and was forced to return to Missouri or face violence from Iowans. In retaliation, Missouri settlers cut down 4 trees known to be storehouses of honey used by local bees.In November, Sherriff Gregory entered the disputed zone again, was arrested and jailed in Muscatine Iowa for “usurpation of authority.”<br /> <br /> Rumors spread in Missouri that he was kidnapped by Iowan farmers, leading Missouri to call out the state militia and between 600-2500 Missouri troops were mobilized. In response, Iowa created its first territorial militia and mobilized troops of its own, with self-provisioned and outdated weapons, including rusty swords left over from the war of 1812, revolutionary war muskets, and farming implements refashioned into weaponry, such as a butter churn dasher and a plow blade on a chain. The Governor of Iowa supplied 5 barrels of whiskey to his hastily improvised army, and at their camp soldiers became eager to vengeance, shouting the battle cry, “Death to the invading pukes!”<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in the Missouri militia's camp discontent brewed as the militia went unpaid. Militiamen divided a deer carcass into two parts, hung them from trees, and declared each to be an effigy of Missouri and Iowa's governors. The soldiers \"fired a few rounds at them, until we considered them dead! Dead!!!\" The deer meat was then buried with military honors, including gun salutes from the soldiers who had shot it in effigy. Shortly after this bizarre ritual, the two state’s legislatures agreed to let the federal government mediate the boundary and both sides demobilized and withdrew without firing a shot.Though congress issued a boundary proclamation 5 years later, Missouri continued to litigate. Ultimately, the Supreme Court intervened a decade after the conflict and decided that the original Sullivan Line would stand. The two states erected boundaries that roughly conformed to the original boundary. And the only casualties were the bees in those trees. The Honey War was one of numerous bloodless armed conflicts over boundaries in the early United States which provided precedence for The Pig War.",

    "bodyText": "On May 13, 1846, the United States declared war on Mexico, beginning the Mexican-American War. The Mexican-American War is one of the least known pivotal moments in US History. It paved the way for so many other important events, from the expansion and dispossession of indigenous people, the California Gold Rush, and American Civil War. It added the states of California, Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming to the United States. American success in the war solidified belief in the concept of Manifest Destiny, confirming the idea that the United States had been destined by divine entities to expand into a continental empire resembling the present-day nation. For proponents of slavery and abolition, the new territory provided a source of conflict over whether slavery would expand and continue in the West. For the major military leaders of the Civil War on both the Confederate and Union sides, including such Pig War figures as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/winfield-scott.htm\">Winfield Scott</a>, George Pickett, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/series.htm?id=27608386-E4A3-0C0A-4560DA3D8023BFC7\">William Harney</a>, it was a crucible in which their skills were tested, their tactics were formed, and they built the bonds of camaraderie that they relied on during the Civil War.<br /> <br /> The immediate cause of the Mexican-American War was a disputed boundary between the United States and Texas on the Nueces Strip. Mexico did not recognize Texas as legitimate American territory and Texas admission to the United States antagonized Mexican officials and citizens. Rather than ameliorate this problem, President Polk intentionally worked to aggravate Mexico and provoke a war. On January 13, 1846, Polk ordered American forces into deeply disputed territory. In April, an army of approximately 4,000 men lead by General Zachary Taylor entered the Nueces Strip, a contested territory that Mexico and many Americans regarded as never having been a part of Texas. Polk knew this action would antagonize Mexican military forces stationed within sight of Taylor’s army at Matamoros. Colonel Hitchcock, who served with Zachary Taylor’s army, could see the real intention of his deployment from his vantage point on the front lines: “We have not one particle of right to be here. It looks as if the government sent a small force on purpose to bring on a war, so as to have a pretext for taking California and as much of this country as it chooses.” <br /> <br /> On April 9, Taylor’s army deployed the bulk of its artillery within striking distance of the 16,000 person city of Matamoros, Mexico. The US Navy then cut Matamoros off from the Gulf of Mexico, creating a blockade by land and water of the Mexican civilians and soldiers just across the Nueces River from Taylor’s forces. On April 24, Mexican forces crossed the Matamoros River to break the blockade; Taylor sent a small force to respond, and the Mexican Army opened fire, killing 11 American soldiers. The site of this battlefield is now preserved as <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/paal\">Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park</a>.<br /> <br /> When word reached Washington, D.C., two weeks later, President James K. Polk informed congress that: \"The cup of forbearance had been exhausted even before the recent information from the frontier of the Del Norte [Rio Grande]. But now, after reiterated menaces, Mexico has passed the boundary of the United States, has invaded our territory and shed American blood upon the American soil. She has proclaimed that hostilities have commenced, and that the two nations are now at war.<br /> <br /> Prior to these actions, America was deeply divided about the prospect of war with Mexico. Abraham Lincoln, then a US Congressman tried to challenge the war by demanding proof that the spot where the war began was on US soil. Transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau engaged in civil disobedience, going to jail because he refused to pay federal taxes that supported the war.\"<br /> <br /> Most Americans, however rallied around the flag. Many individuals enlisted in the army, swelling the small US army with new recruits. These recruits were motivated by more than just patriotic feelings. As American forces rapidly defeated Mexican forces, sexual assaults, looting, and violence toward civilians and surrendered Mexican forces were common. At the highest level, Commanding General Winfield Scott forced Mexican authorities to pay massive ransoms that supported underfunded American troops in the field. Historian Amy Greenberg has also shown how racist attitudes that saw Mexicans as racial inferiors and anti-Catholic bigotry enabled American soldiers and leaders to justify extreme violence and what we would now regard as war crimes against Mexican forces and civilians.<br /> <br /> The US military was wildly successful and used a combination of innovative strategy, competent officership, luck, and brutality to achieve victory. American forces captured Mexico City within 16 months of the war’s beginning and expeditionary forces also fought battles in California and New Mexico that enabled the seizure of vast tracts of territory. As the Mexican-American War came to an end, gold was discovered in California, causing a massive population surge on the West Coast that ensured continued American sovereignty over the entire West Coast and paved the way for the boundary conflict in the San Juan Islands.",

    "bodyText": "20 years before the Pig War, the United States and the British Empire fought a bloodless conflict over their northern maritime border. But, unlike the Pig War, this conflict occurred on the far northeastern edge of the nations’ boundaries. It also did not result in the combat death of any creature, even a pig. Instead, it earned the nickname of “The Pork and Beans War” because the frontier soldiers and armed lumberjacks who were on the frontlines largely relied on pork and beans as their diet during the conflict. It did, however, lay the precedent for peaceful conflict resolution and cooperation by national authorities that paved the way for the positive resolution of the Pig War crisis.<br /> <br /> When the United States won its independence from Great Britain, the treaty ending the war did not declare precise boundaries between the two nations. The Jay Treaty, which in 1794 delineated the geographical boundary stated that the source of the St. Croix River would serve as the boundary line between the two nations. Unfortunately, due to a lack of surveying, the remoteness of the area, and a lack of settlement in the area which made settling the boundary a low priority for both governments, the exact source of that river remained a matter of interpretation for Britain and the US.<br /> <br /> Further complicating things, during the War of 1812, the British occupied coastal Maine, holding territory that unquestionably was within the United States by the letter of the Jay Treaty and only relinquishing it after the war’s end. This created a state of uncertainty in terms of legal titles, with people in the Penobscot Bay region holding competing land grants from Britain and the United States providing financial motivations to see their land definitively incorporated into the nation which had recognized their property rights.<br /> <br /> In 1830, this uncertainty nearly led to armed conflict as some of the residents on the St. John River held meetings to incorporate their community, located in the disputed region, as a town under the jurisdiction of the state of Maine. Militia from New Brunswick, a province of the British Empire, showed up at incorporation meetings and arrested some of the community leaders who attempted incorporation. To quell this unrest, US and British officials submitted the boundary to neutral mediation under the king of the Netherlands, who in 1835 created a practical boundary that Britain accepted and the US rejected.<br /> <br /> In the winter of 1838-1839, lumberjacks from the United States and the British Empire engaged in logging operations in the disputed zone. Armed standoffs, such as “The Battle of Caribou” occurred where loggers threatened each other and US and British officials arrested and fined loggers from the rival countries for illegally entering what they perceived as their terrain. American and British military forces deployed to the area, and though no shots were fired, a tense standoff, much like the Pig War commenced with rival forts under construction in the disputed lands.<br /> <br /> From 1840 until 1842, civilians and military forces faced off in the uncertain territory. Ultimately, US officials in Great Britain came upon a settlement which gave more land to the United Kingdom than had originally been anticipated and paid compensation to state authorities in Maine and Massachusetts for their perceived losses. This peaceful resolution, while it caused some discontent in the British parliaments and in the future nation of Canada, was widely accepted by officials and citizens in the UK and the US. This precedent paved the way for the US and UK to resolve their boundary disputes nonviolently 20 years later during the Pig War",

Building the redoubt was no easy feat. At least 100 men used picks and shovels to alter the landscape, which included massive boulders.

Its northern boundary is formed by the Discovery Islands, to the north and west of the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. The cities of Seattle, Vancouver, Victoria, and Tacoma all sit alongside its waters which include but are not limited the Strait of Georgia, the Puget Sound, and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. These major cities were a direct result of the Salish Sea and the commercial opportunities and marine resources which it contains.<br /> <br /> The term, Salish Sea is a recent innovation by geographers who wished to stress the interconnected ecosystems and cultures of the areas connected by this body of water. The Coast Salish Tribes, the sea’s namesake, have lived in this region since time immemorial. Their culture and lifeways have been deeply shaped by the Salish Sea, which provided abundant salmon and shellfish and served as a transportation route between settlements throughout its waters in the US and Canada. Coast Salish people indigenous to San Juan Island invented an advanced and unique form of technology known as reef net fishing, which enabled them to harvest large numbers of migratory salmon and preserve them to sustain their families. The sea’s importance to living native cultures can be seen in the canoe journeys which annually traverse its waters and the tribal communities that still call the Salish Sea their home.<br /> <br /> Euro-American settlers were also drawn to the Salish Sea because of its resources. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson’s Bay Company </a>first sent workers to San Juan Island in 1852 to purchase and preserve salmon for export to the Hawaiian market. The first steam powered sawmill in Seattle, built by settler Henry Yesler, began operating on the shores of the Salish Sea in March of 1853 and was a major employer and driver of settlement in this city’s early days. The strategic importance of the Salish Sea and access to its waters are believed by historians to be a major factor in inspiring General William Harney to order forces to San Juan Island during the Pig War, so as to protect American access In the late 1800s and early 1900s, industrial salmon packing plants which over-exploited the Salish Sea’s natural resources were built throughout its waters, including the San Juan Islands, where they were major employers and sources of wealth.<br /> <br /> Today, the Salish Sea is home to millions of people and hosts visitors from across the globe. Coast Salish Tribes on both sides of the American and Canadian border continue to draw sustenance from its abundant resources. Visitors and residents alike kayak and canoe amidst the bioluminescent algae in our coastal waters and travel for work and play between the mainland and its numerous islands. Major international ports and naval bases have been built to take advantage of its deep ports. Endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales regularly swim through the Salish Sea, whose Chinook salmon they have evolved to eat. The University of Washington’s Friday Harbor Labs performs cutting edge science that allows us to better understand this unique ecosystem",

    "bodyText": "In 1860, Dr. C.B.R. Pemberly declared that: \"In the vicinity of the southern end of [San Juan] island are perhaps the best fishing grounds on Puget Sound. Great quantities of halibut, codfish, and salmon are taken by the numerous tribes of Indians who at the proper season resort to this vicinity for the purpose of fishing. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson's Bay Company</a> were formerly in the habit of putting up at this place from two to three thousand barrels of salmon alone which were bought from the natives. Persons supplied with the proper appliances for carrying on a fishery might find it a profitable occupation.\" Pemberly was describing The Salmon Bank,a shallow shelf that extends for about half a mile offshore from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/south-beach-trail.htm\">South Beach</a>. This shelf was created by glacial activity which created our park's topography. The abundant marine life on the shelf attracts migratory salmon and halibut for rest and feeding, creating the perfect place for a fishing industry to spring up.<br /> <br /> Coast Salish people have fished on the Salmon Bank since time immemorial. The bounteous catch of Native American fishers attracted the attention of Euro-Americans in the 1800s. In 1850, the Hudson's Bay Company began purchasing salmon from indigenous fishers and exporting them in their global trade networks as far as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company-s-honolulu-agency.htm\">Hawaii</a>; by 1853, the year the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/belle-vue-sheep-farm.htm\">Belle Vue Sheep Farm</a> was founded on San Juan Island, the company was purchasing around 600 barrels containing 60 massive salmon each from this spot. Hudson's Bay Company Chief Factor <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/james-douglas-statue.htm\">James Douglas</a> enthused to his bosses that year that: San Juan Island's \"shores and inlets abound with salmon and other fish which form a productive export and an inexhaustible form of great wealth\" <br /> <br /> After the Boundary Arbitration Resolution, which made San Juan Island into an American possession, the Salmon Bank transformed from a large, customary fishery into a big business. Corporations invested capital into canneries and fish traps on San Juan Island which replaced the traditional reef netting method. Salmon traps were stationary devices, built on an annual basis which tricked tens of thousands of fish to swim into and get trapped in corrals. Fishery workers could then draw the fish up in massive nets into boats alongside the trap. At the peak of the salmon fishing industry dozens of workers operated up to a dozen fish traps just off of South Beach alone.This prolific harvest, however, exhausted nature's bounties; combined with the growth in highly efficient purse seining fishing boats, the salmon harvest was over-exploited. Though fishing boats are still seen actively harvesting salmon every summer in these waters, the boom times in which our waters spawned a big and valuable business are long gone.",

    "bodyText": "Future Pig War commanding general, William Harney watched as American forces stormed Chapultepec Castle, the last major citadel protecting Mexico City from the invading US Army. At 9:30 A.M. on the morning of September 13, 1847, the US flag rose above the Mexican lines, signaling that his side had won the battle. Harney ordered his mule carts forward, tightening the nooses on 30 men who he led to the gallows. This was the last of 3 mass executions that General Winfield Scott had ordered against the San Patricio (Saint Patrick) Brigade, a group of mostly Irish immigrants who fought on the side of Mexico in the Mexican-American War. It was the largest collective execution ever ordered by the US military, and 12 years before he instigated the Pig War, William Harney was the executioner.      <br /> <br /> The war that Harney fought in had divided the American people. Northerners, such as then-Congressman, Abraham Lincoln, saw the US invasion of Mexico as “‘from beginning to end, the sheerest deception,” because it was unprovoked and unjustified. Lincoln argued (and most historians agree) that President James Knox Polk, sent American military forces into disputed territory to intentionally provoke a military response form Mexican forces who were defending their homeland from invaders. With reports of troops under fire, Polk gained bipartisan congressional support to fund an invasion of Mexico that enabled him to fulfill his campaign promise of territorial expansion. Many Americans considered these actions part of a broader “Slave Power Conspiracy” by powerful Southern elites and their Northern allies that was designed to increase the number of slave states and create antidemocratic structures that empowered slaveholders. Amongst the Americans who opposed this war were the men that Harney executed at war’s end in Mexico City.           <br /> <br /> The San Patricio Brigade was primarily comprised of Irish immigrants who had objected to the war or who resented their treatment in the United States military by officers such as Harney who had a documented history of abusing enlisted men. Most members of the San Patricio Brigade were traumatized survivors of the Irish Potato Famine who had watched their friends and loved ones starve because of British imperial policies which devalued Irish life and which privileged Protestant settlers over the Irish Catholic majority. Within the US Army many of these men encountered anti-Catholic bigotry and brutal discipline that left them disenchanted. For men who grew up as unwilling imperial subjects, the US invasion of Mexico reminded them of the British dominance of Ireland.            <br /> <br /> Not all members of the San Patricio Brigade were Irish. Some were escaped slaves and free Blacks who saw Mexico, a nation that had outlawed slavery, as a freer country than the United States and who fought against the expansion of slavery. Others were catholic immigrants from other countries such as Germany, Poland, and France who grew disenchanted with the United States due to the widespread bigotry towards Catholics which only ratcheted up as the predominately Protestant US prepared for war with the overwhelmingly Catholic nation of Mexico. Still others were attracted by generous land grants that Mexico offered to foreign nationals who enlisted in the Mexican Army. Whatever attracted them, this predominately Irish fighting force became one of Mexico’s most competent units in the Mexican-American War.         <br /> <br /> The San Patricio Brigade was organized from a pre-existing unit of foreign soldiers who fought for the Mexican Army from the beginning of the war. On September 21, 1846, they saw their first action as an individual artillery unit, when they defeated American forces in three separate engagements during the Battle of Monterey. Their success in this battle encouraged more American soldiers to defect and join the San Patricio Brigade, whose numbers swelled from about 200 to 700 following the conflict. It was at this point that they designed their signature battle flag, a green flag with a gold harp at the center, surrounded by shamrocks and bearing the words “Erin Go Bragh.”           <br /> <br /> The San Patricio brigade fought with distinction in numerous battles. They took heavy casualties at the Battle of Buena Vista where official reports argued that they were “worthy of the most consummate praise because the men fought with daring bravery.” Despite supply issues and large numbers of casualties, the San Patricio brigade performed valiantly throughout 1847, until the Battle of Churubusco when other Mexican units they fought alongside decided that they were hopelessly outnumbered and should surrender. When their comrades raised a white flag, the San Patricio Brigade shot at them, refusing to surrender until all hope was lost. Eventually, however, 80 members of the San Patricio Brigade surrendered to US forces.After their capture, 72 members of the San Patricio brigade were tried before court martials as deserters. Their two mass trials, which were carefully managed by General Winfield Scott, were held a mere 3 and 6 days after their capture. At the trials they were denied access to legal counsel and no transcript was made to document the procedures. 50 men were sentenced to death and executed by the United States military as it captured Mexico City. The most brutal of these mass executions was the group hanging that Harney carried out on September 13, 1847. Harney, claiming “I was ordered to have them hanged and have no orders to <i>unhang</i> them” left the corpses of the 30 men he executed to decay on the gallows, as a macabre warning to Mexico City residents who might resist American forces. Despite this violent display, irregular militias and individual Mexicans resented the American occupation of their country and guerilla forces regularly fought back against the Americans until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed on February 2, 1848. Under the terms of the treaty, Mexico recognized Texas as part of the United States and ceded all or part of California, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and Wyoming. As these conquered territories were incorporated into the United States, military commanders such as William Harney used violent force to subjugated and dispossess the indigenous people whose homes they had been since time immemorial.<br /> <br /> During the Pig War, Harney and Winfield Scott who had worked together to execute the San Patricio Brigade violently disagreed over whether aggressive action was the appropriate way to settle the boundary dispute between the United States and Great Britain. Harney left Mexico a mere six weeks after the execution of the San Patricio brigade, while Scott stayed for many months. During this time, Scott witnessed the toll of guerilla warfare and gained a great appreciation for the power of diplomacy in solving complicated international disputes.<br /> <br /> Today, the San Patricio Brigade are regarded as national heroes in Mexico and Ireland. In Mexico City's San Jacinto plaza, where a plaque honors the San Patricio Brigade, a squad of Mexican bagpipers plays a monthly tribute to their service. In Clifden, Ireland, where the San Patricio Brigades commander was born a statue was erected to honor the San Patricio Brigade and the city flies the Mexican Flag annually on September 12 to celebrate their heritage. In 1997, the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the San Patricio Brigade’s creation, Mexico and Ireland issued identical stamps bearing the flags of both nations to pay tribute to their history and legacy. Despite conducting their execution, in order to discourage desertion the United States military denied the existence of the San Patricio Brigade until 1915 when a congressional inquiry revealed the coverup of their history.",

    "bodyText": "The first Royal Marines stationed at English Camp were recruited from the British forces that occupied Guangzhou, China and arrived in North America on the <em>HMS Tribune</em>. They left Guangzhou in November of 1859 and along the way they stopped in Nagasaki, Japan, where they repaired and resupplied their storm-tossed ship. After a six week trip across the Pacific Ocean, the Royal Marines arrived at Esquimault Naval Base, on Vancouver Island. But why were these redcoats fighting a war in China in the first place?           <br />    <br /> In the 1800’s, European powers sought access to Chinese markets where they could purchase products that were in high demand in Europe, such as silk, tea, spices, and furniture, but found few European products that interested Chinese consumers save such natural commodities as fur and sandalwood. The only ready currency that Europeans could use in China was silver, but that made the trade far less profitable. European merchants, working in conjunction with the British East India Company, began trafficking opium, an illegal drug in China (though not in the US) to China. <br /> <br /> Chinese authorities soon caught on to this traffic. In 1810, the emperor issued a statement that “Opium has a harm. Opium is a poison, undermining our good customs and morality. Its use is prohibited by law.” Despite these official statements, Westerners, including Americans, continued to circumvent the law, leading to increased amounts of illegal drug use in China. Bemoaning the effects of opiod addiction on his population, Lin Zexu was sent in 1839 by the emperor of China to Guangzhou, the only place in China open (on a limited basis) to European traders and the center of the illegal opium trade. By this time, Opium exports to China were estimated to be approximately 1400 tons per year.<br /> <br /> Lin demanded that Euro-American traders surrender their opium and after some conflict the foreign traders in Guangzhou surrendered their opium supplies which were publicly destroyed. Trade was allowed to resume again, but under strict supervision. A few months later, British sailors in modern day Hong Kong murdered two Chinese civilians and refused to allow them to be punished by Chinese authorities. China retaliated by cutting off food supplies to British ships on the coast of China and eventually the British attacked a Chinese fort for failing to supply it. This incident led to a war which lasted for almost three years and that led China to surrender Hong Kong to the British and in which China agreed that foreign subjects would not have to answer to Chinese law while in China.<br /> <br /> The Second Opium War, which brought English Camp's Royal Marines to Guangzhou, started after the Chinese seized a suspected pirate ship that was registered as a British merchant vessel. In retaliation, Britain began destroying Chinese forts and eventually gathered an international force that would include British, French, and American combatants. This war would last for four years and climaxed with the burning and looting of the Summer Palace in Beijing, shortly after the Royal Marines arrived at English Camp.<br /> <br /> The <em>HMS Tribune</em>, which brought the Royal Marines to English Camp, was a participant in the battle of Guangzhou, during which it had successfully destroyed a fleet of Chinese warships in the Pearl River Delta. Members of the Royal Marines had seen combat across China during the Second Opium War, including fighting in sieges of Chinese forts and naval battles. This wartime experience was part of what it meant to be a Royal Marine; you were fighting for a global empire and might see service in China, India, the West Indies, Africa, and the Americas. In fact, redcoats stationed at English Camp had fought for their country around the globe prior to arriving at English Camp.",

The land this trail traverses a part of English Camp during the Joint Occupation of San Juan Island. The English chose this location for its abundant water resources and during springtime you will cross seasonal creeks that flow after heavy rains on the island.<br /> <br /> The Westcott Bay trail ends at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bell-point-trailhead.htm\">Bell Point Loop Trail</a>. If you take a turn to the right, you will reach a picnic table just beyond the trail intersection with views of Bell Point.

Continue down the Bell Point Trail to reach the<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/english-camp-parade-grounds.htm\">English Camp Parade Grounds</a>, where you can see historic structures and learn more about our history. Beyond the Parade Grounds is the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/young-hill-trailhead.htm\">Young Hill Trail</a>, a short but steep trail which takes you to the Royal Marines’ Cemetery and a summit with fantastic views of Victoria and the Strait of Juan De Fuca.",

    "bodyText": "General Winfield Scott, the dominant figure in the pre-Civil War US military, was born in present day Petersburg, VA. Scott held a general’s rank for more than 47 years of his life and was known equally for his facility as a strategist, diplomat, attorney, and administrator. Nicknamed “Old Fuss and Feathers” for his insistence on military protocol and order, Scott’s successful negotiations during The Pig War, led to a lasting peace between the US and British empires in the San Juan Islands. Scott lived in this home from 1852-1855, just before The Pig War.<br /> <br /> Trained as an attorney, Scott joined the military soon after he first began practicing law. Scott first came to national prominence as a young hero of the War of 1812, when his success at the Battle of Chippewa inspired national hopes at a time when US forces had not fared well. After the war’s end, Scott helped organize the early US Army and design its tactics and training. Scott served in numerous Indian wars, including The Black Hawk War, the Second Seminole War, and Creek War. Though he was appointed to oversee the removal of Cherokee people from the Southeastern United States known today as \"The Trail of Tears\" Scott was transferred shortly after it began and so his culpability for the human rights disaster that unfolded is inconclusive.<br /> <br /> His greatest glory came during the Mexican-American War, when as the highest ranking general in the US Army, Scott created the tactics that would enable the United States military to defeat the Mexican forces and successfully conquer Texas, New Mexico, Nevada, California, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma, and part of Wyoming permanently. A successful amphibious invasion of the city of Vera Cruz, which Scott used as the staging area for an overland trek to Mexico City, during which numerous successful battles were fought, enabled US forces to rapidly conquer Mexico. With long supply lines, Scott’s forces often took food and material they needed from Mexican civilians; Scott himself forced the citizens of Mexico City to pay a large ransom to support his occupation forces while a final peace treaty was negotiated.<br /> <br /> After the war, Scott was widely regarded as a national hero. Nominated for president in 1852 on the Whig Party ticket, Scott failed to reach the nation’s highest office, but demonstrated how central a figure he was to American life prior to the Civil War. His continued importance was demonstrated conclusively during The Pig War, when the aging and infirm Scott traveled from New York City to the San Juan Islands in just over a month’s time. Twenty years earlier Scott had negotiated a successful and peaceful end to a boundary conflict between the US and Britain in Maine known as “The Pork and Beans War.” In less than two weeks, Scott negotiated a peaceful settlement that ensured American and British forces would live in peace on San Juan Island for 12 years and that a tense military standoff on our island would end peacefully.<br /> <br /> Though the Pig War demonstrated the agility of Scott’s mind and his forceful command, the Civil War ended his long military career. Initially the head of US forces during the Civil War, Scott lost Abraham Lincoln’s confidence early in the war for his seeming lack of energy and strategic blunders. Though Lincoln never officially relieved him of duty or demoted him in rank, after the battle of Bull Run Lincoln bypassed Scott and began treating General McClellan as the de facto head of the US Army. In October of 1861, Scott resigned from the US Army after 53 years of honorable service. Though Winfield Scott is not a major celebrity today, he was a pivotal historical figure who left as big of a mark on our nation and its military as he did on the San Juan Islands.",

    "bodyText": "On a clear day, the hike to the top of Young Hill provides a panoramic view of San Juan Island’s harbor, English Camp, and Vancouver Island. During the joint occupation (1860-1872) visitors from Victoria regularly climbed to the top of Young Hill and took in its impressive vantage point. This trail allows visitors to follow in their footsteps.<br /> <br /> The 1 mile out-and-back trail is steep, climbing 587 feet to reach Young Hill’s 650-foot summit. Along the way, exercise caution as you cross San Juan Valley Road .3 miles into the hike and carry water, as none is available on the way. At .4 miles into the hike, you will cross a short spur trail that leads to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/sajh/learn/historyculture/the-royal-marine-cemetery-at-english-camp.htm\">English Camp Cemetery</a> the final resting place of 6 members of the Royal Marines and one civilian who died during the joint occupation of San Juan Island. At .8 miles into the hike, the woods clear, providing you with your first viewpoint out into the bay. 1 mile into your hike you will reach the end of the trail with stunning views and excellent rocks for an informal picnic.<br /> <br /> A network of unsigned trails continue from the end of the trail which are a part of the <a href=\"http://sanjuanislandtrails.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SJI-Trails3_12Apr15.pdf\">Roche Harbor Highlands Trail Network</a>. If you’d like to do more hiking in this area you can extend your trek using these trails or hike the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bell-point-trailhead.htm\">Bell Point</a> and/or Westcott Bay trails in English Camp. Our American Camp unit, located 13 miles away also features many trails, including the Mount Finlayson Loop and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/south-beach.htm\">South Beach Trail</a>. ",

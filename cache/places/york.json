    "bodyText": "<p>Commissioners met at the Moore House to negotiate the terms of surrender.  The British sent Lt. Col. Thomas Dundas and Major Alexander Ross. The allies sent the Viscomte do Noilles (Lafayette's brother-in-law) and Colonel John Laurens. The British argue the terms for many hours, but to no avail.</p> <p align=\"left\">The site on which the Moore House now stands was first patented by Governor John Harvey in the 1630's, and was named \"York Plantation.\" A century later, it was part of a 500 acre plantation called \"Temple Farm\" where Lawrence Smith II built a family home. In 1754, the estate passed to Smith's son, Robert. By 1760, however, Robert found himself in financial straits, and was forced to sell the farm that had been in his family for three generations. He sold the 500 acre estate to his brother-in-law, Augustine Moore.</p> <p align=\"left\"><b>Augustine Moore</b></p> <p align=\"left\">Augustine Moore began his career as a merchant at the age of 14, when he became an apprentice to William Nelson of Yorktown. He served the Nelson firm for many years, and became parter of \"Thos Nelson, Jr. & Co.\" in 1773.<br /> In 1767, Augustine inherited three plantations from his father, establishing him as a landowner of some estate. The following year he purchased \"Temple Farm\", and eventually moved his wife and son into the present plantation house to become a gentleman farmer in the fashion then prevalent in Virginia.<br /> In 1781, when General Cornwallis moved his British army into Yorktown, many residents left their homes and fled the area. The Moore family may also have abandoned their home, temporarily moving to Richmond during the Yorktown Siege. What they certainly could not have known, was that their home would become a site of national significance on October 18, 1781, when it was selected to be the backdrop for one of the final scenes of the American Revolution.</p> <p align=\"left\"><b>The Surrender Negotiations</b></p> <p align=\"left\">At 10 o'clock on the morning of October 17, 1781, a drummer beating a \"parley,\" and a British officer with a flag of truce, mounted a parapet south of Yorktown. The allies saw the signal, and soon the incessant, devastating artillery fire ceased. A hushed stillness fell over the field.<br /> Lord Cornwallis, realizing the defeat of his army was inevitable, sent a message to General George Washington:</p> <p align=\"left\"><i>\"Sir, I propose a cessation of hostilities for twenty-four hours, and that two officers may be appointed by each side, to meet at Mr. Moore's house, to settle terms for the surrender of the posts of York and Gloucester.\"</i></p> <p align=\"left\">Why Cornwallis selected the Moore House for the negotiations was not explained, however, there are a number of possibilities.The Moore House was well outside the line of siege fire, and therefore, not damaged. It was a neutral location, hiding the British situation in town, and possibly selected in the hope of securing better surrender terms. And finally, it was a convenient location for both sides to reach, as it was situated along the York River.<br /> <br /> Washington agreed to only a two hour cease fire for Cornwallis to submit general terms of surrender. Messages continued to pass over the battlefield between the two commanders.<br /> <br /> Finally, on the afternoon of October 18, the two British commissioners, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Dundas and Major Alexander Ross met in \"Mr. Moore's house\" with the allied officers, Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens, for the Americans, and Second Colonel Viscount de Noailles (Marquis de Lafayette's brother-in-law), representing the French.<br /> <br /> The negotiations ended before midnight, and Laurens carried a rough draft of the articles to General Washington. Washington, however, was not completely happy with the results and made a few minor changes. Once the articles were revised and redrafted, a copy was sent to Cornwallis in Yorktown for his signature.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Moore house is a white, wooden planation home. It is a two story home. It has two brick chimneys on each side of the house. Its front façade has 5 windows on the top floor and four windows on the bottom floor with a door in the center. There is a porch area in front of the door. The house has a very large yard that is surrounded by a white wooden fence. There are several large white oak trees in the pack of the house. There is a informational wayside outside the home that says, \"Moore House 'I propose a succession of hostilities for 24 hours , and that two officers may be appointed by each side, to meet at mr. Moore's house , to settle terms for the surrender of the post of York and Gloucester.' on October 18th, 1781 after over eight days of continual bombardment, the battlefield was finally tranquil. Washington and Cornwallis now focused on the surrender negotiations taking place at this house, the home of Augustine Moore. Each General has selected two officers to handle the face-to-face discussions lieutenant colonel Thomas Dundas and major Alexander Ross represented the British, while lieutenant colonel John Laurens and second colonel Viscount de Noalles spoke for the allies. Slowing the process was Lauren's insistence, with Washington's support , that the British submit to similar terms granted by the British to the defeated American Army at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1780. those terms had deprived the American soldiers to surrender with the army's personal honor intact. The British argued for better terms, but the Allies prevailed and around midnight, a draft of the Articles of capitulation was completed with 14 provisions, two conditions that denied the British the full honors of War. These two articles required that at the surrender ceremony , the British army would case their regimental Flags, and their military band would play British music instead of professionally saluting the Victor with American and French songs.\" On the Wayside , is a photo of a draft of capitulation articles in the handwriting of British negotiator major Alexander Ross. there is also a black and white photo the Moore house in disrepair during the Civil War , With the caption underneath saying, \" this Matthew Brady image buy photographer Alexander Gardner shows the Moore house the 1862 Siege of Yorktown\" The wayside also says, \"History of Moore house. the Moore house is an early 18th century home that has undergone many structural changes 50 owners the house was extensively damaged during the Civil War, both by cannon fire and soldiers stripping wood from the house campfire use. By the 150th anniversary of the surrender , the house was in a dilapidated state. In 1931, Park Service undertook its first restoration of a historic building-- the Moore House. 3 years later the project was complete and the house once again appeared as it did in 1781.\"",

Around the monument in four corners are a list of some of the dead who gave their life at Yorktown. On the monument are various symbols about the victory. I. The base carries an inscription on each of its four sides: A. One dedicates the monument as a memorial of victory. B. A second presents a succinct narrative of the Siege. C. A third commemorares the treaty of alliance with France. D. The fourth tells of the resulting treaty of peace with England. II. The pediments just over the inscriptions carry: A. Emblems of nationality. B. Emblems of war. C. Emblems of the alliance. D. Emblems of peace. \"The base is thus devoted to the historical statement.\" III. The podium is a \"symbol of the birth of freedom.\" It carries the sculptur of thirteen \"female figures\" hand in hand in a solemn dance to denote the unity of the thirteen colonies. Beneath their feet is the inscription \"One country, one constitution, one destiny.\" IV. The column which springs from the podium, is a \"symbol of the greatness and prosperity of the nation after a century of various experience, when thirty-eight free and independent states are shining together in a mighty constellation.\" There is a star for each state which was in the Union at the time the monument was designed. On the field of the shaft and among the stars, as reminder of the past, is the \"shield of Yorktown covering the branch of peace.\" V. Atop the shaft is the sculptured figure of \"Liberty herself\" -- attesting to the existence of the nation as \"a proof of the possibility of a government of the people, by the people, for the people.\" There are two waysides near the monument. The Victory Monument wayside says... \"Resolved, That the United States in Congress assembled, will cause to be erected at york, in Virginia, a marble column, adorned with emblems of the alliance between the United States and his Most Christian Majesty; and inscribed with a succinct narrative of the surrender of earl Cornwallis to his excellency General Washington, Commander in Chief of the combined forces of America and France; to his excellency the Count de Rochambeau, commanding the auxilliary troops of his most Christian Majesty in America, and his excellency the Count de Grasse, commanding in chief the naval army of France in the Chesapeake.\" Just 10 days after the Victory at Yorktown , the Continental Congress directed a monument be built To commemorate The Siege and the American French Alliance. However, funds were not legislated for its construction until 1880, as the Centennial anniversary the battle approach. A congressional Committee of legislators from the original 13 colonies delegated oversight of the project to the Secretary of War , who in turn , chose architects , Richard M. Hurst and Henry Van Brunt , and Sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward to design the new monument. The country's spirit of reconciliation in the aftermath of the Civil War affected the design, as evidenced by the inscription , \" One country , one Constitution , one destiny\", on The Monuments shaft. On October 18 , 1881 , the cornerstone for The monument was dedicated during events commemorating The 100 anniversary of The Siege. On the night of July 29, 1942 , lightning decapitated the Statue of Liberty and destroyed her arms the damaged was replaced with a redesigned statue 15 years later. There is a black and white photo showing the ceremony of the laying of the cornerstone on the wayside.

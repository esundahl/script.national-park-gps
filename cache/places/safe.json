    "bodyText": "<p>Situated on the border between Missouri and Kansas, the Alexander Majors house was home to both the Majors family and one of his freighting companies called Russell, Majors, and Waddell.<a href=\"#1\">[1]</a> The company was a venture with merchants William H. Russell and William B. Waddell who joined Majors in an attempt to gain a government contract to supply western forts.<a href=\"#2\">[2]</a> Already an experienced Santa Fe Trail dealer, Majors had the knowledge and equipment, while Russell and Waddell had the capital, to secure the government contract. For a short time, the company had a “virtual monopoly of the army freighting business in the west and southwest.”<a href=\"#3\">[3]</a> <br /> <br /> The 300-acre farmstead was dissected by the westernmost US border, making part of the property outside US jurisdiction and, thus, untaxable. The company’s barns, mule sheds, grazing lands, wagon and blacksmith shops, and other business-related entities were located on the portion of property located in the Kansas Territory.<a href=\"#4\">[4]</a> A caravan camp was used to load the heavy freight wagons which would travel the trails.<a href=\"#5\">[5]</a> <br /> <br /> The home was built in 1856, most likely using the labor of enslaved people.<a href=\"#6\">[6]</a>  The “T” shaped floorplan with recessed front porch makes it a unique iteration of the Greek revival style in Kansas City.<a href=\"#7\">[7]</a>  Today, it is one of the oldest buildings in Kansas City, as one of only 4 pre-Civil War buildings left standing.<a href=\"#8\">[8]</a> Though the house remains, many of the other original structures are gone and the land has been divided into distinct plots. Among the lost structures were living quarters for the 16-17 people enslaved by the Majors’.<a href=\"#9\">[9] </a><br /> <br /> In 1930 Louisa P. Johnston, Majors’s great grand-daughter, travelled to visit her ancestral home and found the house abandoned. She bought the house in 1932 and, for the next forty years, worked to preserve the property. In 1984 the Alexanders Majors House Museum was opened to the public for tours and events. In 2010 the house partnered with the John Wornall House and Museum to create one nonprofit dedicated to preserving both properties.  </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(8201 State Line Road (east side of road near 85th Street), Kansas City)<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.wornallmajors.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <br /> <br />   <div> <p id=\"ftn1\"><em><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Marc Simmons, Following the Santa Fe Trail: A Guide for Modern Travelers (Santa Fe, NM: Ancient City Press, 1984), p. 61.</em></p> <p><em><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Martha Kusiak, “Alexander Majors House,” National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form.

The site marks the western end of the Arrow Rock ferry, with another landing on the other side of the river. The ferry played a significant role in shepherding traffic westward, including traffic on the Santa Fe Trail. They continued using this ferry until 1828 (when it was no longer used for significant, long-distance Santa Fe Trail travel) and for many years thereafter. A cabin housing the ferry master formerly existed here, and the former trail ascended the hill (along a present-day road trace), after which it continued west across the prairie.</p> <h3>Arrow Rock Bluff</h3> <p><br /> For generations, Arrow Rock Bluff was a significant landmark on the Missouri River for American Indians, explorers, and early westward travelers. The limestone bluff first appeared on a 1732 French map as pierre a fleche, which means the “rock of arrows.” As a landmark on the river, it guided westward travel by water and wagon for trade and settlement.</p> <blockquote> <p><br /> “Our company crossed the Missouri near the Arrow Rock Ferry on the first day of September 1821…”<br /> -William Becknell</p> </blockquote> <p>The Arrow Rock is part of the Santa Fe Trail story. When William Becknell’s party crossed the river here in 1821 heading west to trade, a new era in American history began. For some, the trail brought wealth and opportunity. For others, the trail caused loss of life, land, culture, and resources.<br /> <br /> Today, the river no longer flows in front of the bluff. </p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Northern extension of 2nd Street,  Arrow Rock., Arrow Rock, MO, 65347)<br /> <br /> The Arrow Rock Ferry Landing was put on the list of the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 2013, and Rich Lawson, who owns the property with his wife, Debbie, is looking to add more richness to Arrow Rock's history.<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/08b84e89-e3e4-4f92-ad4e-7276bd74538b\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Signatures on the walls came from soldiers, teamsters, gold seekers, and others traveling the Santa Fe Trail. Because of the signatures, Cold Springs Creek became known as Autograph Rock.

    "bodyText": "<p> </p> <p>Bent's New Fort connects the story of Bent's Old Fort and William Bent's family to the Sand Creek Massacre. The New Fort represented an attempt to continue trading with Plains Tribes following the end of the Mexican War. The operation was shortlived, and William Bent sold the structure to the United States Army, which located a military garrison there under a new name. Both of these forts played a role in the development of the Santa Fe Trail, the destinies of the Plains Indians, and the future of Colorado.</p> <h3>Bent’s New Fort (1853-1869)</h3> <p>William Bent abandoned his old fort (present-day <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bent-s-old-fort-national-historic-site.htm\">Bent’s Old Fort National Historic Site</a>) in 1849. Lacking satisfactory offers to purchase it, Bent is believed to have burnt much of the fort to keep it from falling into the hands of the Army or his competition. To continue his trade with the Plains Tribes, Bent built a new fort of stone in 1853. Based on Cheyenne recommendations, he located this new fort overlooking the Arkansas River at Big Timbers, near present-day Lamar.<br /> The new fort had several advantages over the old fort, including its stone construction, simple rectangular design, and lack of adobe. Bent no longer needed to hire labor to apply adobe every season, and the durable nature of stone added to its protection. With trade no longer profitable and the construction of Fort Wise nearby in 1860, Bent leased his stone fort to the Army, which used it as a post quartermaster & commissary and Indian Agency office.</p> <h3>Fort Wise (1860)</h3> <p>Fort Wise was made possible through the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty, which offered Plains Indians annuities and recognition of their land in exchange for allowing uncontested passage along the western trails and the establishment of forts. Named in honor of Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise, Fort Wise served to protect travelers and transportation along the Santa Fe Trail between Fort Larned in Kansas and Pueblo, Colorado.<br /> <br /> The Army situated the fort on lands adjacent to the Arkansas River in 1860, just west of Bent’s New Fort. Fort Wise lacked a protective wall or barricade, instead locating numerous barracks and offices in a square around a central parade ground. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Governor Wise led Virginia’s secession from the United States. The U.S. Army renamed the military post Fort Lyon in mid-1862 to honor of General Nathaniel Lyon, the first United States general killed in the Civil War.</p> <h3>Fort Lyon (1860-1867)</h3> <p>Fort Lyon encompassed both the former Fort Wise and Bent’s New Fort, as both offered advantages to the Army. As a way station along the Santa Fe Trail, Fort Lyon served as a base for U.S. Army patrols and a rest stop for travelers. In 1864, Colonel Chivington used the fort and its troops for the attack on Sand Creek. He uttered his infamous outburst, “<em>Damn any man who is in sympathy with Indians!</em>” inside the quartermaster office of Bent’s New Fort.<br /> <br /> Detachments of the 1st and 3rd Regiments Cavalry, Colorado (U.S.) Volunteers led by Colonel John Chivington marched overnight from Fort Lyon to reach a village of peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho at Sand Creek at dawn on November 29, 1864. The 40 mile ride took about 10 hours and allowed the volunteers to attack the village with complete surprise. The attack resulted in the death of approximately 230 men, women and children.<br /> <br /> Fort Lyon’s low position near the Arkansas River rendered it vulnerable to flooding and disease. A large flood in 1867 undercut many of the buildings. In June 1867, the U.S. Army leased land near Las Animas, Colorado, and transferred the post there, making the new military post the second to bear the name Fort Lyon. By William Bent’s death in 1869, the fort near Lamar lay abandoned and neglected, its stones later scavenged for use in local buildings.</p> <h3>The Site of Bent’s New Fort today</h3> <p>Because of its significance to trade along the Santa Fe Trail and its role in the Sand Creek Massacre, the National Park Service worked with the landowner and other partners to open the site of Bent’s New Fort to the public in 2013. This public-private partnership provides access to the site, where visitors can walk a short trail, read interpretive wayside exhibits, and gaze across the scenic Arkansas River Valley.</p> <h4>Driving Directions</h4> <p>To reach Bent’s New Fort Site, take U.S. 50 to County Road 35, approximately 10 miles west of Lamar or 25 miles east of Las Animas. Turn south on County Road 35 for one mile to County Road JJ (T Junction). Turn east (left) and drive ¼ mile, turning south (right) onto County Road 35.25 for ¼ mile to the Bent’s New Fort parking area. A walking trail and interpretive exhibits are available; however, no public facilities exist at the site.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>For much of its 16-year history, Bent’s Fort was the only major permanent white settlement on the Santa Fe Trail between Missouri and the Mexican settlements. William and Charles Bent, along with Ceran St. Vrain, built the original adobe fort in 1833 for trade with local Native American tribes and trappers for buffalo robes. Situated along the northern bank of the Arkansas river in what is now southeastern Colorado, the fort quickly became the center of the expanding holdings of Bent, St. Vrain & Company. Soon, it was also an important stop on the Santa Fe Trail’s mountain route and a center for commercial, social, military, and cultural exchange. <br /> <br /> The fort brought together trappers from the southern Rocky Mountains, Anglo-American travelers from Missouri and the east, Hispanic traders from Mexico, and Native Americans, primarily from the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche, and Kiowa Tribes. In addition to trading prospects, the fort also provided weary travelers, such as those following the Santa Fe Trail, with a place to get needed supplies and rest. During the war with Mexico in 1846, the fort became a staging area for Colonel Stephen Watts Kearny's \"Army of the West.\" Disasters and disease caused the fort's abandonment in 1849.<br /> <br /> Although the original fort no longer stands, at Bent’s Old Fort National Historic Site the fort has been reconstructed and is open to the public. The site preserves the resources associated with the Bent–St. Vrain trading empire and provides visitors with the opportunity to explore the trading post’s complex history. <br /> <br /> After your visit, if you are heading West, you have the unique opportunity to stop at Comanche National Grassland and retrace a piece of the Santa Fe Trail at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/sierra-vista-interpretive-site-comanche-national-grassland.htm\">Sierra Vista Interpretive Site</a>.

A trapper or other Fort employee will greet you as you enter the plaza of the two-story adobe fort and there you begin to realize what you see, hear, and smell is true to the spirit of the time. During the peak visitor season and special events, period clothed interpreters may be working in the kitchen, trade room, and carpentry or blacksmith shop.

    "bodyText": "<p>Boggsville, located on the Purgatoire River, was first used as a campsite by the Plains Indians. With the fur trade vanishing, many former mountain men found work raising livestock. Through his wife’s government land grant connections, Thomas Boggs started his ranch near the river on a branch of the Santa Fe Trail. It became known as Boggsville after he and his wife, Rumalda Luna Bent Boggs, built their first home. John Wesley Prowers moved to the Boggs’s ranch in 1867 along with frontiersman Kit Carson and his family. A year later, with Carson in poor health, his wife, Josefa, died from childbirth complications. Kit died several weeks later at nearby Fort Lyon. Thomas Boggs was the executor of Carson's will.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(two miles south of Las Animas on Colorado Highway 101)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities:</strong> Today, Boggsville is a renovation project in progress. Seeing the site now, which has just a few buildings and old foundations, it is hard to imagine that here is where the cattle and sheep industries first boomed in Colorado. A lot of the early history of Colorado started here. Slowly, some of the buildings are being restored and more are going to be rebuilt.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibits:</strong> A bronze state historical marker is located along Colorado Highway 101, and there are several interpretive markers along an area hiking path.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.sangres.com/history/boggsville.htm#.YBSs03OSmUk\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>In the heart of what is now called Howard County, Missouri, three natural salt springs merged into Salt Creek. Because of the presence of salt in the water, animals often licked the ground nearby where salt had risen to the surface. Thus, the area was called a “salt lick,” later to be named Boone’s Lick after the two men who settled and opened a salt works there.  <br /> <br /> Salt was an incredibly important resource, and thus, Boone’s Lick was important for Native Americans, and later, Euro-American settlers in the central Missouri River area. In 1806, brothers Nathan and Daniel Morgan Boone (sons of famous frontiersman Daniel Boone) began using the salt lick to extract salt which they sold in St. Louis. The brothers built a sizeable operation using a boiling method. <br /> <br /> The route to the salt lick was originally a Native American trace but had been cut and widened to accommodate increasing traffic. The road, which became known as Boone’s Lick Road, led from the St. Louis area to Franklin, MO (south of Boone’s Lick). The terminus of Boone’s Lick Road became the start of the Santa Fe Trail in 1821, creating a continuous path between St. Charles and Santa Fe.<br /> <br /> The area near Boone’s Lick became known as “Boone’s Lick Country” and was a major site for Westward emigration in the 1800’s. The area was fertile, not only with salt, but with timber, water, and wild game. Today, the area is part of <a href=\"https://mostateparks.com/park/boones-lick-state-historic-site \">Boone’s Lick State Historic Site</a> which includes 52 acres of wooded area and the remains of the original salt works. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Adjacent to Missouri State Highway 187 (County Road 328), between Lisbon and Petersburg (and east of Arrow Rock) in Howard County, Boonesboro, MO)</p> <p>Boone’s Lick is a heavily wooded area featuring three salt springs and a salt creek.

    "bodyText": "<p>Throughout the summer of 1864, the probability of conflicts between American Indians and travelers of the Santa Fe Trail increased dramatically west of the Little Arkansas. Troops were assigned to the Little Arkansas and the Stone Corral area in April 1865. It was called Station Little Arkansas. Company G, Third Wisconsin Cavalry, were the first troops to be stationed at the Stone Corral. By early May, 93 men were stationed at the post, most of them from the 2nd U. S. Volunteer Infantry. In June 1865, the 13th Missouri Cavalry was present. There were 185 enlisted men and five officers from the 13th Missouri Cavalry and the 2nd U. S. Volunteer Infantry. In June, 1865, four men were killed by American Indians near Station Little Arkansas. A cholera epidemic also claimed eight men at Station Little Arkansas. All were buried near the south end of the breastworks in the Cottonwood Grove Cemetery at Station Little Arkansas. Later the bodies were exhumed and moved to the Fort Leavenworth Cemetery in 1888 or 1889.<br /> <br /> Peace talks and signing of peace treaties with the American Indians occurred in the fall of 1865. It appears troops were withdrawn from the Little Arkansas post late in 1865. This peaceful situation did not last long as soldiers were again stationed at the Stone Corral site in 1867. At this time the camp was called Camp Grierson, to honor Colonel Benjamin Grierson of the 10th Cavalry. In 1867, the camp was occupied from May to November by Company C of black troops of the 10th Cavalry. This company of some seventy troops constructed dugouts for protection from the American Indians and the weather in the riverbanks of the Little Arkansas. They erected breastworks above the dugouts for protection, which are still visible today.<br /> <br /> During the summer of 2005, a stone was found in a nearby foundation of a fire damaged house that was inscribed with the name of Andrew Welsch of Co. E, 13th MO Cavalry. This unit was at Station Little Arkansas in 1865.</p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(P Ave., between 30th Rd. and Plum Ave. (31st Rd.), South of Windom, KS)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/The-Little-Arkansas-Crossing-Brochure-August-2014.pdf\">Santa Fe Trail Association Little Arkansas Crossing Brochure</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Santa Fe Trail passed by where Cimarron Crossing Park is now, bringing people and goods along the trading route. Just to the south, the Arkansas River formed the border with Mexico. Traders and travelers required accommodations, supplies, and protection. The Ranch at Cimarron Crossing was established in 1866 by William and Frank Hartwell and several other investors to meet those needs. Later, it was operated by Robert Wright, one of the founders of Dodge City, and A.J. Anthony.  At full force there were 12 armed men at the Cimarron Crossing station.<br /> <br /> The ranch sat in the midst of a vast open plain, covered only with cactus on the higher ground and with grass in the river bottoms as high as a man on horseback. Buffalo could be seen in any direction, and for an hour at a time the river might be heard roaring in the night from the crossing of great herds. Wolves could be heard from darkness until dawn.<br /> <br /> Many Native Americans, such as the Cheyenne, viewed settlements such as the ranch as intrusions onto their homelands. Tension between settlers, traders, and the military increased, including an attack on a wagon train crossing here in June 1867. In 1868, the ranch was abandoned due to the continuous threat of attack from Native Americans.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Cimarron Crossing Park is located on the south side of Cimarron, KS, along the banks of the Arkansas River.)</p> <p>The Cimarron City Park is one of the most beautiful parks in Southwest Kansas.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Coronado Quivira Museum contains Santa Fe Trail artifacts as well as Spanish Colonial and ancient indigenous artifacts from sites located in Rice County Kansas.<br /> <br /> Years before the Santa Fe Trail passed through this land, the Quivira (Wichita) people lived here. The Quivira were farmers who built and lived in grass huts in the area. They created trails that would later become parts of the Santa Fe Trail as they travelled west to trade corn and other crops with nearby tribes. <br /> <br /> Almost three hundred years before the initial journey on what would become the Santa Fe Trail, a Spanish conquistador and his men traveled along the trails created by tribes for hunting and trading. Fransicso Vasquez de Coronado travelled here in search of the legendary “Seven Cities of Gold.” His quest led him from Mexico into what we know call Kansas. Though he did not find the Cities of Gold, he did encounter the Quivira. <br /> <br /> Years later, American traders from Missouri followed nearly the same route as Coronado to trade with the people of the newly formed country of Mexico. By the time the route became the Santa Fe Trail, the Quivira had moved south, but American traders encountered other indigenous people as they travelled the trail. <br /> <br /> The Coronado-Quivira Museum has many items from the three cultures—Quivira, Spanish, and American. You will see a model of a grass lodge in which the Quivira lived. You will also see chain mail and other artifacts believed to have belonged to Coronado or his men. There are also Santa Fe Trail exhibits. </p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(105 W Lyon St, Lyons, KS 67554)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations </a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.kansastravel.org/coronadoquiviramuseum.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail </a></h2>",

This is the location of Moore’s Ranche which served variously as a mail station, US Post Office (1860-1866), general store, and hotel. <br /> <br /> An extra day was usually spent at the crossing to repair wagons and other equipment in preparation for continuing westward. The stream channel was relatively deep. It had steep banks that required excavating “cut-downs” or ramps for the wagons, and double or triple teams were needed to pull the wagons up the ramps (one team could consist of as many as 6 yoke, i.e. 12 oxen). If possible, the stream was crossed immediately upon arrival so the crossing could be completed before a rain storm might cause the creek to rise and delay crossing, perhaps for days. <br /> <br /> Sometime prior to 1857, George Smith established a road ranche (equivalent to today’s convenience store) just south of the crossing; it was labeled as a “hotel” on the 1857 General Land Office survey plat. In 1858 he sold his ranche to brothers Abraham Atlantic and Ira Moore, and Smith moved east to establish Lost Spring Station. The ranch at Cottonwood Crossing became known as Moore’s Ranch and was in existence throughout the Santa Fe Trail Era.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (From Durham, KS, take 5<sup>th</sup> St west out of town and then continue westward on the paved road (which becomes 285<sup>th</sup> St) approx. 1.3 miles.)</p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/cottonwood/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Cow Creek Crossing was adjacent to the south side of the present bridge one mile south of the Father Padilla Cross. There was a toll bridge about 150 yards upstream during the 1860s. About 150 yards above the post, the creek was spanned by a bridge 8 feet wide and 30 feet long. Dr. Asahel Beach and his son, Abijah, established a supply ranche (trading post) here in the 1850s. This area was also known as Beach Valley.<br /> <br /> William Mathewson -- the original \"Buffalo Bill\" -- was at Cow Creek (Beach Valley) ranch from its beginning days up to 1862. In 1860, he hunted buffalo to supply meat to settlers of Eastern Kansas whose cattle herds had been reduced by droughts in 1859 and 1860. Mathewson along with two other men, survived an disputewith American Indians which lasted three days, July 20, 21, and 22, 1864. Five hundred American Indians attempted to advance, but Mathewson, along with the other men, kept them at bay.<br /> <br /> One month later, in August 1864, William Mathewson married Elizabeth Inman, a native of Yorkshire, England. It is said that Mathewson did not bring his bride to Cow Creek ranch until she had become expert with rifle and revolver. By all accounts she was a courageous woman, operating the ranche while Mathewson was away serving as guide for Maj. Gen. James G. Blunt's expedition against the Plains Indians.<br /> <br /> Perhaps the best-known surviving feature of the Cow Creek Crossing area is Buffalo Bill's hand-dug well. The well, with a Daughters of the American Revolution marker to the north of it, is still there.</p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (3 miles west of Lyons, Kansas on Highway 56 and 1 mile south on 12th Avenue)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/Cow-Creek-Crossing-Brochure-Nov%202012.pdf\">Read more: Cow Creek Crossing (Beach Valley) brochure by the Santa Fe Trail Association</a></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

The dead man, friendless and unknown, was wrapped in a blanket by the townsmen and buried where he fell with his boots on. So began Boot Hill. For six years Dodge City had no official cemetery. Persons dying who had friends, enough money, or sufficient standing in the community were buried at Fort Dodge. Others, penniless or unknown were buried where it was convenient to dig a hole.<br /> <br /> Boot Hill, now a part of Dodge City, is the most famous burial ground in all Western lore, even though it was only used until 1878. Two schools were built atop Boot Hill before the Spanish-style City Hall was erected in 1929, which still stands today. <br /> <br /> In front of this historic place stands a cowboy statue. It was created by Dr. O.H. Simpson, a pioneer dentist. Joe Sughrue, and early day lawman, was the model. The marker on the base of the statue commemorates the frontier days of the cattle drives: “On the ashes of my campfire this city is built.”</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (The Old City Hall Monuments are located at 501 W.

The fort’s main purpose was to protect Santa Fe Trail travelers from hostilities of local Native American tribes, whose historic lands the travelers were crossing. On June 25, 1851, a newly built fort was officially named Fort Atkinson. The fort was built of sod and was soon dubbed by the soldiers quartered there “Fort Sod,” and later “Fort Sodom.” Field mice were reportedly quite a problem for the troops. Lieutenant Henry Heth, commanding officer, requisitioned a dozen cats from Fort Leavenworth to cope with the problem. Fort Atkinson was abandoned permanently on October 2, 1854, due to its inadequate buildings and supply difficulties. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Fort Atkinson was located about two miles west of the present Dodge City.)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

At this point in their journey, many of the passing wagons needed maintenance and repairs to continue, which they could find at Fort Mann. The Plains tribes opposed the construction of Fort Mann on their lands and its occupation by outsiders, and so conflict arose. As a result, in May of 1847 all but ten of the teamsters left the Fort. The rest followed in June after a particularly intense attack. Abandoned, the Fort fell into disrepair, passing travelers stripping it of wood for cooking. The Indian Battalion of Missouri Volunteers were formed in September in part to once again occupy Fort Mann. The battalion’s destructive interactions with the Pawnee and infighting amongst the men at the Fort created significant controversy that led to an investigation. The Fort was again abandoned by the summer of 1848. In 1850 Fort Atkinson was built a few miles east.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (A few miles West of Dodge City)</p> <p>Fort Mann no longer stands.

The Corps of Discovery first passed through the area on June 23, 1804, although no mention regarding the site’s suitability for a fort was noted in the journals. At the time, Clark only documented an island that was then across the river from the later site of Fort Osage. However, when he returned in 1808 as a brigadier general in the Louisiana Territory militia and U.S. agent for Indian Affairs, Clark referenced his initial un­documented impression of the location, writing that he “examined the Situation and the points of a Small Island which is opposit, found the River could be completely defended and Situation elegant, this Situation I had examined in the year 1804 and was delighted with it and am equally so now, […] and fixed on the spot for the fort and other buildings.” In 1810, as Nicholas Biddle prepared the expedition journals for publica­tion, he interviewed and corresponded with Clark in order to elaborate on details within the text. Based on information provided by Clark at this time, the first edition of the journals, published in 1814, revised the original June 23, 1804 journal entry to insert the text: “Directly opposite on the south, is a high command­ing position, more than seventy feet above high-water mark, and overlooking the river, which is here but of little width; this spot has many advantages for a fort, and trading house with the Indians.” Following aban­donment in 1827, archeologists rediscovered the fort’s foundations in the 1940s. It was then reconstructed to portray the circa-1812 appearance.</p>",

The second fort was abandoned in December 1869.<br /> <br /> Although gone now, the buildings were made of Dokota sandstone quarried north of the fort. The walls were about 16 inches thick with a smooth face and the inner walls one foot thick. At the southeast and northwest corners there were hexagonal, two-story towers, with two sets of loop holes for rifle ports. These loop holes were arranged in sets of three on a side, and presented a face opening of two inches wide by 16 inches high that widening in the wall to a breadth of about 16 or 18 inches on the inside.

Randolph Marcy’s 1859 The Prairie Traveler, Itinerary II: “Water Holes-Water generally; no wood.”  This site possibly noted by Matt Field, in summarizing his travels of July 15, 1839: “Since we left the Cotton Wood [Creek] we have traveled 15 miles over the most desolate prairie we have yet seen – we met water now and then in holes – tasteless and warm.”</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong></p> <ul> <li>From US Hwy 56, on the southeast side of Lehigh, KS, north 5.0 miles on Diamond Road to 250 Rd.</li> <li>West on 250 Rd 1.0 miles to Chisholm Trail Rd (a SFNHT sign and visible ruts can be seen on 250 Rd). </li> <li>South on Chisholm Trail Rd 0.5 mile to 245 Rd (a SFNHT sign can be seen on Chisholm Trail Rd).</li> <li>West on 245 Rd approx. 0.2 mile to a DAR marker and a SFNHT sign.  SFNHT is running southwest from this location and is the “French Frank’s Trail Segment.”</li> </ul> <p>Parking adjacent to signs is on the shoulder of 245 Rd, an improved gravel road with very little traffic.</p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/cottonwood/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

In the middle is a pavilion with a metal roof supported by four posts, covering three large signs. Behind the pavilion, against the wall is a metal bench. At the right side of the paved area a sidewalk makes a looping path about 100 yards long in total through meadow-like vegetation. At the far end of the loop are 4 more signs, two at each corner, and another metal bench.<br /><br />The signs under the pavilion discuss nearby trail sites to the east, north-east and west, some of which are included in this app for the Oregon Trail.<br /><br />The signs along the looping sidewalk cover other topics. One titled \"Eye of the Needle\" reads in part, \"The historic junction of three great western frontier trails - the Santa Fe Trail, the Oregon Trail and the California Trail - is located approximately one-half mile to the north. To the southwest lay the Santa Fe Trail and to the northwest was the road to Oregon and California...Between the late 1830s and the early 1850s, as many as 200,000 emigrants may have passed through this gateway in order to start a new life in the Oregon Territory or to take a chance seeking their fortune in the gold fields of California. During this same period, thousands of freighters loaded with commodities were also rumbling through this junction heading to and from the markets at Santa Fe.\"<br /><br />Another sign titled \"Following Their Dreams\" discusses the various types of travelers who followed these trails. A third sign, titled \"Apprehension and Conflict,\" discusses the impact the large numbers of travelers had on the Indian Nations who lived in the Great Plains Region west of the Missouri River. The final sign is titled \"From Prairie Schooners to Locomotives\" and covers the decline of the trails as railroad lines spread and the transcontinental railroad was completed.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Hays House lays claim to being the oldest, continuously-operating restaurant west of the Mississippi River. Seth Hays, great-grandson of Daniel Boone, was Council Grove’s first permanent settler. He came here in 1847 to trade with the Kaw (Kansa) Indians, who purchased guns, blankets, flour, and tinware from him. About 1857, he replaced his log store with this frame building, which served citizens and travelers as a trading post, courthouse, post office, printing office, and meeting and social hall.<br /> <br /> Business was lively in Council Grove: in a four day period in 1860, the Kaw Indians spent $15,000 here and across the street at the Conn Store. The Santa Fe trade became increasingly lucrative. In 1863, Hay’s former partner, G. M. Simcock, estimated that $40 million in freight was hauled in ox- and mule-drawn wagons through the town.<br /> <br /> In addition to supplies, the Hays House offered meals and rooms to weary traders on their eight-week trip between New Mexico and Missouri. The Kansas Press described the accommodations in 1859 this way:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Those who have occasion to stop at Council Grove, on the Santa Fe Road, will do well to ‘put up’ with Charles A. Gilkey [Hay’s hotel clerk]…mine host of the Hayes House. [They]…cannot but help feeling quite at home.”</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(112 W. Main Street (U.S. Highway 56) at Neosho Street, Council Grove)</p>   <p><strong>Available Facilities</strong> <br /> The Hays House, a longtime restaurant, is known as the oldest continuously operating restaurant west of the Mississippi.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibits</strong> <br /> Today, the Hays House contains many historical artifacts, including artwork, arrowheads, other American Indian relics, and a notable crystal collection.

Prominent Mexican trader Don Antonio José Chávez, who made his fortune raising sheep and investing in mining and freighting, was murdered by Missouri ruffians during a trip on the Trail. <br /> <br /> Don Antonio José Chávez made two mistakes in 1843 as he set out from Santa Fe for Missouri: the caravan left too early in the season and with too few men. The caravan originally numbered 20 men, two wagons and 55 mules. However, after bitter cold caused frostbite and killed most of the mules, 15 men deserted on the plains. These events put them at a disadvantage when they encountered the Missouri marauders who intended to job the caravans from Mexico loaded with goods and money. <br /> <br /> When the Missourians encountered the Chávez caravan, they captured the traders and marched them away from the wagons so the loot could be divided among the criminals. The leader of the gang decided the group should kill Chávez, and afterward, they found his money belt containing 39 gold doubloons. This initiated another search of the wagon, where the thieves found about $3000 of gold dust in a trunk to split between the remaining members of the gang. The body of the unfortunate Chávez was tossed into the gully of Owl Creek. The murderers were eventually caught and punished for the murder.</p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Travel south of Lyons on Highway 96 to Avenue Q.  Turn east (left) and travel 4 miles.  Turn north (left) and go 1 mile.  Turn east (right) and go approximately 1/2 mile.  There is a marker to commemorate the incident on your left.  The actual site was approximately 1/2 mile north of the marker along the creek.)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/JarvisCreek-August-2014.pdf\">Read more: The Chávez Murder brochure by the Santa Fe Trail Association</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

With a homestead of nearly 500 cultivated acres, the Wornalls were in a position to help outfit overland travelers with needed provisions. The cliché “it takes a village” was the reality when you envision thousands of westward migrants descending upon the western Missouri frontier each spring, all of whom needed supplies and foodstuffs to last them for up to a six-month overland journey.<br /> <br /> In 1843, Richard and Judith Wornall, and their two sons, John Bristow Wornall and George “Thomas” Wornall, moved to Westport, Missouri. In the late 1850s Wornall chose the site of his new showplace carefully—it was two hundred feet away from the main road that lead [sic.] south from Westport and headed toward the Santa Fe trail. Wornall purchased nearly 500 acres of land from John McCoy and soon sold the land to his sons. <br /> <br /> Thomas died of cholera on the western plains in 1849, and John became the sole titleholder. After Judith died in 1849, Richard Wornall returned to Kentucky. John built the house in 1858. The homesite was subsequently subdivided and the original homestead remained in the Wornall family until the 1970s when the Jackson County Historical Society saved, restored, and opened the home as a museum.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (6115 Wornall Rd., Kansas City, MO)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.wornallmajors.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Lamar was founded in 1886, after trading on the Santa Fe Trail was diminished due to the railroad reaching Santa Fe in 1880. The town was organized by the Santa Fe Railroad as a rail head for shipping cattle. The National and the Goodnight cattle trails passed near here. Therefore, Lamar represents the end of the Santa Fe Trail era.</p> <p align=\"justify\">In 1927, the Daughters of the American Revolution (D.A.R.) erected 12 large markers called the <a href=\"https://www.dar.org/national-society/historic-sites-and-properties/madonna-trail-statue-1\">Madonna of the Trail Statues</a>. \"The Madonna of the Trail\" is a pioneer woman clasping her baby with her young son clinging to her skirts. The face of the mother, strong in character, beauty and gentleness, is the face of a mother who realizes her responsibilities and trusts in God. It has feeling of solidity, a monument which will stand through the ages.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (109 E Beech St, Lamar, CO)</p> <p>Visitor center and historic museum.

    "bodyText": "<p>Las Vegas, New Mexico, was officially founded as Señora de Los Dolores de Las Vegas (Our Lady of Sorrows of the Meadows). The city grew from an 1835 Land Grant from the Mexican government to become the largest city in the Southwest, at least for a time. Long before, the area had a rich and vast history with the Paleo-Indians and the Anasazi and Mogollon cultures. The Santa Fe Trail went through the old original settlement plaza, in the center of town, which was a key trading spot on the Santa Fe Trail. For eastern traders, Las Vegas was the town toward the end of the Trail. For western traders, it was first town after leaving Santa Fe.<br /> <br /> During the 1846 Mexican-American War, General Stephen Watts Kearny, came down the mountain route and marched his army to the central plaza. On top of a flat roof, he announced that Las Vegas was now the property of the United States. Upon becoming part of the United States, Las Vegas also became the largest community in the Southwest and housed some of the most wanted rebels. <br /> Santa Fe railroad tracks reached Las Vegas on July 1, 1879, and the first train entered the city three days later. Las Vegas served as the railhead (and eastern trail terminus) for the last few months that the Santa Fe Trail served as a long-distance route.  <br /> <br /> Today, Las Vegas boasts of more than 900 registered historic structures and many Santa Fe Trail sites. You can have a picnic at the historic Las Vegas Plaza and learn about Santa Fe Trail and local history at the Santa Fe Trail Interpretive Center. Craving even more history? The City of Las Vegas Museum and Rough Rider Memorial Collection on Grand Avenue has a wealth of information on local topics and features artifacts and archives on Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders. For a taste of railroad history, visit the 19th century Train Depot on Railroad Avenue. The station also serves as the City of Las Vegas Visitor Center and offers a full range of local and regional information.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Las Vegas, New Mexico; east of Santa Fe, New Mexico on Interstate 25)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.visitlasvegasnm.com/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Major Bennett Riley, in the year of 1829, commented that the Little Arkansas was about ten feet wide with steep banks of fifteen feet high. The bottom of the stream was very muddy. Major Riley's military detachment of dragoons shoveled down the banks to the river to make it passable for the wagons to cross. Some early groups of travelers placed stones in the muddy river bottom to improve the crossing. Some of these stones are still there and can be seen during dry periods when the level of the water in the stream is very low.<br /> <br /> This crossing became a major overnight stop and camping area due to problems with making the deep crossing. The crossing would be made upon arrival of a wagon train later in the afternoon just in case an overnight rain would flood the area. When the valley was flooded, a wagon train may have to wait for a few days until the flooding subsided. A wagon would typically be pulled by 8 to 10 oxen or mules. To help pull the wagons through the muddy river bottom, an additional team or two from other wagons would be hitched in front creating double and triple teams to pull the wagons.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(The Little Arkansas Crossing and related sites are located 5 miles south of Windom KS.

He was a tireless advocate of Lone Elm and its location on his farm. He also was instrumental in the placement of the Daughters of the American Revolution Santa Fe Trail marker in 1906. This marker still graces the same spot today on the northwest corner of Lone Elm Park.\"<br /><br />Past the sign, the entrance road curves to the left past a large relief sculpture of a covered wagon and team of 4 oxen set well back from the left side of the road. A stone marker in front tells us that the sculpture is \"Trails West\" by Eldon Tefft originally commissioned in 1994 and placed at the Kansas Visitor Center. In 2003 it was restored and erected here.<br /><br />The road then proceeds around to a parking area in front of a large covered picnic pavilion. The pavilion is made of large wood posts and beams set on stone foundations and has a large stone fireplace and chimney.<br /><br />To the left of the pavilion is a paved patio with 4 wayside signs on the edge and, in the middle, a metal grill covering a hand-dug well. A small sign reads, \"Kansas Heritage Feature - Hand-dug well. This well supported early agriculture by providing water for livestock, crops and people. The well was likely constructed in the late 1800s and remained in use throughout the 1900s. The well is 15 feet in total depth.\" Water may be seen below through the grill.<br /><br />The wayside signs discuss the Santa Fe Trail and the Oregon and California Trails, all three of which passed this way; the use of the land here as a campground along this branch of Cedar Creek; the travelers that passed through, both famous and infamous; and the history of the campground as it turned into a farm and then to a park.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The “original” Lost Spring is located on Lyon Creek, approximately ¾ mile east and ½ mile north of the Lost Spring Station site, and is inaccessible to the public. In 1859, George Smith established a road ranche in Sec. 20 about a mile to the southwest of the “original” Lost Spring, but soon lost it in a poker game to Jack Costello. Not long after, Costello acquired a partner in the station, Thomas Wise. The road ranche was a station operated for the contractors transporting mail between the Missouri River and Santa Fe. The station, which was located close by this site, included a hotel, and provided meals, supplies, and a place of entertainment for travelers.<br /> <br /> The station gained a reputation for catering to the rougher element including visitors such as “Bloody” Bill Anderson in 1861 (who later became notorious as Quantrill's lieutenant). There are numerous legends about events that supposedly occurred at Lost Spring Station, but few can be confirmed with primary documentation. A US Post Office named Lost Spring was operated at the station 1861-1864. <br /> <br /> Activity on the Santa Fe Trail between the Missouri River and the Great Bend of the Arkansas River greatly diminished in 1866 when the railroad reached Junction City, Kansas. Costello sold out to Wise in 1868. Wise and Costello were active in establishment of the Town of Marion and organization of the County of Marion. <br /> The station took its name from its proximity to the “original” Lost Spring on Lyon Creek a mile to the northeast. Over the years, however, the spring a few yards northwest of the station on Cress Creek came to be known as “Lost Spring” because of its proximity to Lost Spring Station. In 1908, the Marion County Old Settlers organization and the Shields family erected a large granite marker to commemorate the station. A blue and white metal sign at the site contains misleading information about the site, but a new historic interpretive sign was erected adjacent to the granite monument in 2010.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(From the Town of Lost Springs, KS, go west on 340<sup>th</sup> St approx. 2.4 miles.)</p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/cottonwood/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>In the sweltering, dry prairies of the Santa Fe Trail’s Cimarron Route, every water source was indispensable. The Corrumpa Creek, just within present-day New Mexico, was a welcomed refreshment for weary trail travelers.  If coming from Missouri, travelers were guided to Corrumpa Creek by the site of Rabbit Ears Mountain, an indispensable landmark and sign of much needed resources. Amidst the loose sandy banks of the creek, a natural rock shelf provided easy passage at what came to be known as McNees Crossing. <br /> <br /> The crossing bears the name of a young trader who, along with a fellow traveler named Monroe, rode ahead of their caravan and stopped to rest at the crossing in 1828. While napping, the two men were shot by American Indians in view of the approaching caravan.  McNees passed away and was buried at the crossing while Monroe survived the thirty-mile journey to Upper Spring before passing. While burying Monroe, the travelers were approached by a group of six American Indians who likely had no knowledge of the shooting. Josiah Gregg’s account of the incident suggests, “It is more than probable . . . that the Indians were not only innocent but ignorant of the outrage that had been committed, or they would hardly have ventured to approach the caravan.” Angered and seeking revenge, a traveler shot at the unaware American Indians, leading to more gunfire and the death of five people. In Gregg’s words, it was a “dreadful catastrophe.” <br /> <br /> Three years later, in 1831, Gregg attended an Independence Day celebration at McNees Crossing. The celebration may be the first of its kind held in present-day New Mexico. A marble marker erected by the American Legion in 1921 commemorates the 4th of July event. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p>Location (Located on New Mexico Highway 406, 3.5 miles west of the Oklahoma state line, then 1.5 miles south of the small community of Moses, NM, 88415.  On a private ranch road, approximately 1 mile after crossing Corrumpa Creek/N.

Named after Union Civil War General James Birdseye McPherson, the city of McPherson was founded in 1872 towards the end of the Trail’s use. In 1879 the Santa Fe and Union Pacific Railroads arrived in McPherson, effectively replacing the Santa Fe Trail.<br /> <br /> McPherson County struck oil in the late 1920s, aiding the during the Great Depression. After World War II, community leaders created an industrial base in the city. McPherson has developed into one of the most industrialized small communities in the US. McPherson is also one of the top agricultural centers of Kansas.<br /> <br /> Today, McPherson has much to offer visitors. The city boasts museums, parks, art galleries, and more. It is also home to two buildings on the National Register of Historic Places (the McPherson Opera House and County Courthouse).

    "audioDescription": "Minor Park. 459 words<br /><br />If you stand at the rear of the small parking lot with your back to the street, a sidewalk leads 25 yards to the left, gently curving to the right around a large tree. A wayside sign sits at the end of the sidewalk. Ahead of you is a broad, grassy lawn dotted with scattered trees ending at an overgrown meadow. Several swales can be seen crossing that lawn from right to left, coming up the gentle slope to the river about a quarter of a mile to the left. Feel free to walk across the lawn and over the swales. The first one is about 12 yards from the end of the sidewalk. The largest one is 100 yards away at the edge of the meadow. That one is 20 yards wide and five feet deep. Standing in that swale is a granite marker commemorating the Santa Fe Trail, erected by the Daughters of the American Revolution.<br /><br />The wayside sign is titled, \"Trail Hazards.\" An illustration shows a large covered wagon with a team of six oxen stopped on a muddy trail, a river visible in the distance behind them. The wagon sits tilted toward the rear right corner, where one wheel has been removed as two men work on repairs. The caption reads, \"Crossing the Big Blue river before a bridge was built in 1859 was hard on people, animals and equipment. Before crossing, wagon travelers might camp while waiting for others to cross or for swollen waters to recede. Once across, they had to stop to dry out and rearrange their loads. And with the jostling and wrenching by swift currents their wagons often needed repairs.\"<br /><br />Main text on the panel reads, \"From the late 1830s and into the 1860s, thousands of traders, emigrants and gold prospectors passed this way. After crossing the Big Blue River, covered wagons struggled up this hill due to the mud left behind from torrential spring downpours. Over the years, thousands of wagon wheels and hooves churned the earth and rain washed away the loose soil, creating the swales before you.<br /><br />Lumbering freight wagons heading for Santa Fe carried tons of trade goods, such as bolts of fabric and boxes of tools and cookware. On a return trip a trader might transport wool, mules, coins, silver bars or gold dust as payment for goods. Emigrants and gold prospectors also passed by here on their way to Oregon or California. Pulled by oxen or mules, their wagons carried enough food and other necessities to last several months.\"<br /><br />A small map on the right side shows the three trails that passed this way: the Oregon and California trails heading northwest and the Santa Fe Trail heading southwest.",

This innovative mode of transportation was not a locomotive nor horsepower, but it was a wheeled coach, or wagon, pulled along rails by Missouri mules.<br /> <br /> This ‘train’ was powered by two mules, one in lead of the other. Construction had begun in 1848. The track was made of steel-faced wooden timbers laid lengthwise, just as iron rails were later used. The wheels of the cars, too, were of wood.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (214 W Maple Ave., Independence, MO)</p> <p>The train terminated at Independence Square at a station once located where Dave’s Deli is today (2015) and a historical marker commemorates this historic, local fact with national significance. Take time to explore the surrounding grounds- the Santa Fe, California and Oregon trails all marked Independence Square as their starting point.</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Today with 3,000 objects, the collections are the most comprehensive compilation of Spanish Colonial art of their kind. Dating from the Middle Ages to the New Millennium, the collections span centuries in art, place and time. Among the various media featured are santos (painted and sculpted images of saints,) textiles, tinwork, silverwork, goldwork, ironwork, straw appliqué, ceramics, furniture, books and more. All combined, the collections represent the artistic history and ongoing evolution of Hispano culture in New Mexico while firmly establishing its important place within the global arts landscape. <br /> <br /> <strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> The Pueblo Revival-style building was designed by renowned architect John Gaw Meem in 1930.

    "bodyText": "<p>When William Becknell and his party made their consequential first trip on the Santa Fe Trail, it is likely that they passed through the New Santa Fe area, and perhaps crossed the ruts that are still visible in the New Santa Fe Cemetery. Located at the westernmost border of the US, New Santa Fe (now part of Kansas City, MO) was a gateway to the adventure and challenges of trail travel.Thus, the area was a significant transition point on the trail. It was a place for outfitting and loading for travel west. It was also a place where goods and silver from Santa Fe could be unloaded and distributed. <br /> <br /> When emigrant traffic began to grow in the 1840’s, trails to Oregon and California shared this path with the Santa Fe Trail. Thus, these trail swales saw not only heavy commercial traffic, but significant emigration traffic. Because it was, for several years, the last stop in the US, it was an important milestone for those leaving behind what they knew for a chance at a new life. After the discovery of gold in 1848, many “49ers” also used this path on their way to find wealth in the gold fields. <br /> <br /> By the late 1840’s, a stage stop on this route called “New Santa Fe” offered several amenities: a post office, two general stores, an inn, a shoe shop, drugstore, blacksmith, and saloon. Seeing the success of the area, Dabney Lipscomb platted the town of New Santa Fe in 1851. Conflict on the Missouri-Kansas border in 1860 prior to the Civil War disrupted traffic on the trail and led to a decline in the town. <br /> <br /> By the time the New Santa Fe Cemetery was designated as a burial ground in 1880, trail traffic had dissipated, but the ruts may have still served as a road for cemetery visitors. Though the cemetery post-dates significant trail traffic, it helped protect the ruts from the fate faced by most in the area. As Kansas City grew, the town of New Santa Fe was dismantled and replaced by modern development. The swales in the cemetery are a unique historical remnant amongst the surrounding urban environment.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (122nd Street and State Line Road, Kansas City, MO)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> The New Santa Fe Cemetery now sits in the heart of a residential neighborhood developed in the 1980’s. Spanning the cemetery’s entrance is a delicate metal sign that reads “New Santa Fe.” A historical marker and an informational exhibit sit on either side of the entrance and explain the history and importance of New Santa Fe and the trail ruts. The ruts are met on both sides by burial plots intentionally spaced to leave the ruts undisturbed. The ruts are visible as depressions in the grassy land. The cemetery also features mature trees, and weathered gravestones from the late 1800’s.  </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.newsantafe.org/\">More site information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elte/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail </a></h2> <p> </p>",

The site also represents the earliest official government documentation of any location on the Santa Fe Trail. The first wagons ever carried over the Santa Fe Trail crossed here at Nine Mile Point. In 1821 William Becknell forged the Santa Fe Trail when he led a small group of men on horseback from frontier Missouri to Mexico’s northern colonial outpost, Santa Fe.<br /> <br /> The very next year, in 1822, again bound for Santa Fe, Becknell led a larger group of men and three wagons loaded with trade goods west on the trail through Nine Mile Point here. These were the very first wagons ever taken on the Santa Fe Trail. In 1823 surveyor Joseph Brown and his crew surveyed the western border of the young state of Missouri.<br /> <br /> Starting in the center of the mouth of the Kansas River, Brown and his men measured the state line southward, erecting sod markers at each mile point. As they reached this location just over nine miles from their start, Brown recorded in his field notes “…to a trace leading from Fort Osage toward Santa Fe.”<br /> <br /> The trace that Brown noted was created by the three historic wagons of William Becknell that had come through this location at Nine Mile Point the previous year. In 1825 Joseph Brown returned to this area as a government surveyor ; this time as the surveyor of the Santa Fe Trail, working with the leader of that George Sibley.<br /> <br /> This survey once again brought Brown through Nine Mile Point, but this time not as a boundary surveyor but as the surveyor of a highway between nations.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (78th and State Line Road, Prairie Village, KS)</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.pvkansas.com/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/36/641\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>In 1821, William Becknell and his party left Franklin, MO westbound toward Santa Fe. Though they did not know it at the time, their journey would be the first successful, legal trade on the Trail between the US and Mexico. They returned to Franklin with substantial profits, signaling the opening of the Santa Fe Trail as a profitable commercial route. <br /> <br /> Franklin was located on the north bank of the Missouri River. Between 1826-1827, devastating floods forced residents to relocate further inland. New Franklin was established in 1828 northeast of the original site.

    "audioDescription": "Little remains of the Old Franklin site. A flood in 1993 washed away the few remaining foundations of Old Franklin, as well as the Missouri Intelligencer monument and a DAR marker that stood beside the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad tracks. A flagpole placed by the Santa Fe Trail Association marks the site of the old town square which is now a grassy area. National Park Service wayside exhibits provide information about the site and the Santa Fe Trail.",

He was also a Santa Fe trader and a backer of other Santa Fe traders.

Settlers and travelers riding the trail between Santa Fe, NM and Independence, MO passed right by the remnants of Pecos Pueblo. Long before Europeans entered this country, the pueblo village of P`ǽkilâ (Pecos) was the juncture of trade between people of the Rio Grande Valley and hunting tribes of the buffalo plains. After Spanish colonization, a successful Pueblo revolt, and recolonization, the population of Pecos Pueblo was decimated. In the 1830s, the last remaining Pecos people migrated permanently to the Pueblo of Jemez where the Pecos traditions live on.<br /> <br /> In 1862, the area surrounding the ruins of Pecos Pueblos was the setting of what some call the Gettysburg of the West – the Battle of Glorieta Pass. During the battle, Union and Confederate troops utilized the Santa Fe Trail, the heart of the conflict occurring within a two-mile stretch of the Trail. The Confederates campaigned to take control of the West, which would have greatly improved their chances of success. However, in just three days of tough fighting, the Union Army ruined the Confederate plans and sent them retreating back southwards. The Union retained control the American Southwest for the rest of the Civil War. Today, you can visit the Glorieta Pass Battlefield at Pecos National Historical Park. Additionally, you can visit one of the famous stops along the Santa Fe Trail – Kozlowski’s Stage Stop and Trading Post. Here, weary travelers rested, a day’s ride from Santa Fe, and explored the ruins of the mission church and pueblo.<br /> <br /> After you finish visiting the park, there are many other Santa Fe Trail sites you can visit nearby. Head west to Santa Fe and you can see the Palace of the Governors, the Santa Fe Plaza, and sites at the end of the Trail. Head east and you can explore the charms of the historical trail town of Las Vegas and the adobe remnants of the largest 19th century military fort in the region at Fort Union National Monument.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (1 Peach Drive, Pecos, NM 87552)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/peco/index.htm\">Pecos National Historical Park</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<h2>History</h2> <p>One of many traders hauling merchandise over the trail, Frank Huning had concerns about conflicts with American Indians. Apprehensive, he requested a military escort as far as Fort Zarah. It wasn’t granted. When Huning caught sight of Plum Buttes, a Santa Fe Trail landmark with 100-foot sand dunes and wild plum bushes, his worst nightmare came true.<br /> <br /> Huning knew that the area between Cow Creek and the Big Bend of the Arkansas River was dangerous. On this particular trip, he had his mother-in-law and her youngest son, Fritz, in the caravan. The attack came from the southeast. Huning shot the leader, dividing them into two parties. One swept through the center of the train driving four wagons, including his mother-in-law and her son, off the road until they stalled in the deep sand about 200 yards away. Both of Huning’s relatives died during the attack.<br /> <br /> As soon as the American Indians left, Huning and the remainder of the party continued to the trail campsite at Big Bend on the Arkansas River. Later, he accurately established the point of attack as being near Plum Buttes: \"about midways between Cow Creek and the Big Bend of the Arkansas and about fifteen miles from Fort Zarah, twenty five miles from Little Arkansas, and about thirty five miles from Fort Harker.” Huning further states that the attacking party appeared to be members of three tribes: Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Arapaho.<br /> <br /> Huning returned to the site of the ambush and removed the bodies, which were buried temporarily near Fort Zarah. The next spring on his annual trip east, Huning moved their bodies to Ellsworth, Kansas.</p> <p><strong>A Different Perspective</strong></p> <p>American Indians were threatened by traders and travelers on the Santa Fe Trail, who were entering their lands and using their resources. This is not the only story of its type on the trail; there was ongoing conflict throughout the trail era.</p> <p><strong>Plum Buttes</strong></p> <p>Plum Buttes, was an important landmark for travelers of the Santa Fe Trail, as they could be seen immediately after crossing Cow Creek. Ultimately they were destroyed by the same force that built them, the Kansas wind.</p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Private)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/Ralphs-Ruts-and-Plum-Buttes-Massacre-Nov2012.pdf\">Read More: Ralph's Ruts & The Plum Buttes Massacre brochure from the Santa Fe Trail Association </a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

They eroded and compacted the ground, which created ruts. Over time, the ruts were weathered into the more gently sloping swales visible today.

Going left, it leads to a semicircular area bounded by a low stone wall with a wayside sign, titled \"Prairie Highway.\" An illustration shows a large covered wagon pulled by oxen. The sign reads in part, \"Over 100 years ago, the gentle grassy depression in front of you was one of the most important highways in North America. Here, you'd see wagon trains on the Santa Fe Trail winding through a rolling landscape covered with thick, waist-high prairie grasses. Imagine thousands of trade wagons rumbling and creaking back and forth between Missouri and New Mexico. Wagons - and the hooves of the oxen and mules that pulled them - wore this road into the earth. By the 1840s, emigrants bound for Oregon and California Trails wore it even deeper. Here, the prairie is gone. Wind and rain have smoothed the rough dirt road into a gentle swale - a subtle reminder of a once-great highway.\"<br /><br />By moving around the stone wall and walking out onto the grassy lawn you may be able to feel the swale that crosses from left to right, although it is very shallow. About 40 feet out, on the other side of the swale, is a cement post with a small marker for the Santa Fe Trail.",

Visible across the prairies in present-day Oklahoma and Eastern New Mexico, the mountain was a vital landmark for guiding weary, disoriented travelers and a sign that restorative water, grazing grass, and wood were near. <br /> <br /> Part of the Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field, Rabbit Ears was formed by basaltic lava flow, creating a challenging terrain ranging from level plain to rocky ridges and ravines. Travelers were rewarded for navigating the topography with necessary resources and respite. Three major campsites exist near the mountain: McNees Crossing, Rabbit Ears Creek Camp, and Turkey Creek Camp. If resources were plentiful, travelers would stay in the area a few days to rest and replenish their energy before continuing their journey. Westbound travelers still had around 200 miles to travel before reaching Santa Fe. <br /> <br /> Rabbit Ears Mountain is a double-peaked formation created by past basaltic lava flow. The irregular peaks rise above a midgrass prairie. Some accounts suggest the two peaks look like rabbit ears (leading to its name), but most historical accounts attribute the name to Chief Orejo de Conejos (Rabbit Ears) who was killed on the mountain in a battle with Spanish colonizers in 1717. </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (North West of Clayton, New Mexico)<br /> Today, Rabbit Ears Mountain is part of private land, but visitors can view it from other accessible places: Clayton Lake State Park, McNees Crossing, Kiowa National Grasslands, and the Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway. </p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.claytonnm.org/rabbitearmountain\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Hathaway, filed a homestead claim in 1878 for this land. While breaking sod on the northeast forty acres of this quarter, John and his sons plowed up a pistol, a watch, pieces of hardware from burned out wagons, and bits of broken ironstone china—grim evidence of the notorious Plum Buttes Massacre.  <br /> <br /> Here at the Hathaway homestead are some of the most pronounced and fine Santa Fe Trail ruts to be found along the full length of the Santa Fe Trail. These have become known among trail buffs and historians as \"Ralph's Ruts.\" These forty acres of rolling grass have been saved from the plow because Ralph's grandfather discovered it was to sandy to become satisfactory cropland. Having been left in the native sod the ruts have been well preserved. One unique feature of these ruts is that there are seven, instead of the four that you find at most rut sites. This is probably due to the sandy soil at this location. The ruts became so deep and the layer of loose sand offered so much rolling resistance to the wagon wheels that from time to time some of the drivers simply moved over to one side and made a new path parallel to the others.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Rawlinson-Terwilliger Home was the last house Santa Fe-bound freighters and travelers passed leaving Council Grove as late as 1863, and, conversely, being the first house they saw approaching from the west. The original route of the Santa Fe Trail angled northwesterly from the Last Chance Store, passing about 1 1/2 blocks north of the Rawlinson-Terwilliger Home.  An alternate route, approximately following Main Street in front of the Home, was established during the Mexican War, in 1846, when the U.S. Army constructed some culverts west of town to create a short cut following Elm Creek to the Wilsey area.<br /> <br /> The stone house was constructed in 1860-61 by Abraham and Mary Rawlinson, whose family occupied the property until it was sold to William Riley Terwilliger in 1870. From the front porch of the home, one could have watched the last wagon train pass through Council Grove in the fall of 1866. It was then that the Union Pacific Railway, Eastern Division (renamed the Kansas Pacific Railway in 1869) reached Junction City.  The next spring, Santa Fe freighters offloaded at the railhead and primarily followed the Fort Riley to Fort Larned military road to Ellsworth before turning south to access the Santa Fe Trail.</p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (803 West Main Street (at Adams Street), Council Grove, KS)</p> <p><strong>Exhibits</strong><br /> Various items in the restaurant explain the history of the Santa Fe Trail as well as the property itself;the property surrounding the café interprets a later (1920s) tourist camp.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.jcprd.com/435/Lanesfield-Historic-Site\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Between 1821 and 1880, the Santa Fe Trail was primarily a commercial highway connecting Missouri and Santa Fe, New Mexico. The route was pioneered by Missouri trader William Becknell, who left Franklin, Missouri in September 1821. Others before him had been arrested by Spanish soldiers once they neared Santa Fe, and most had been hauled south toward Mexico City to serve lengthy prison sentences. Becknell, however, was pleasantly surprised to find that Mexico had overthrown the Spanish yoke, and the new Mexican government – unlike their predecessors – welcomed outside trade. Not surprisingly, others got into the trade soon after Becknell returned, and by 1825 goods from Missouri were not only being traded in Santa Fe, but to other points farther south as well. Some traders used the so-called Mountain Route, which offered more dependable water but required an arduous trip over Raton Pass. Most, however, used the Cimarron Route, which was shorter and faster but required knowledge of where the route’s scarce water supplies were located.</p> <p>From 1821 until 1846, the Santa Fe Trail was a two-way international commercial highway used by both Mexican and American traders. Then, in 1846, the Mexican-American War began, and a few months later, America’s Army of the West followed the Santa Fe Trail westward to successfully invade Mexico. After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the war in 1848, the Santa Fe Trail became a national road connecting the more settled parts of the United States to the new southwest territories. Commercial freighting along the trail boomed to unheard-of levels, including considerable military freight hauling to supply the southwestern forts. The trail was also used by stagecoach lines, thousands of gold seekers heading to the California and Colorado gold fields, adventurers, missionaries, wealthy New Mexican families and emigrants.</p> <p>In 1866, just a year after the Civil War ended, an unprecedented period of railroad expansion began in the new state of Kansas. Within two years, rails had been laid all the way across central Kansas, and by 1873, two different rail lines reached from eastern Kansas all the way into Colorado. Because the Santa Fe Trail hauled primarily commercial goods, this railroad expansion meant that the trading caravans needed to traverse increasingly short distances. During the early 1870s, three different railroads vied to build rails over Raton Pass in order to serve the New Mexico market. The winner of that competition, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, reached the top of Raton Pass in late 1878. Additional track mileage further shortened the effective distance of the Santa Fe. Then, in February 1880, the railroad reached Santa Fe, and the trail faded into history.</p> <p><strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Santa Fe Plaza has long been the spatial, economic, and social center of New Mexico’s capital city. Accordingly, it is the location of various historic buildings and events throughout New Mexico’s history. Now half its original size, the Plaza is landscaped with flagstone, walks, benches, and trees. It includes storefronts, a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/index.htm\">Civil War</a> memorial, a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe Trail</a> marker, and a monument commemorating the annexation of New Mexico. Until 2020 it included a central obelisk memorial erected after the Civil War. The memorial was controversial for generations, as it was dedicated to \"the heroes who have fallen in the various battles with the savage Indians in the territory of New Mexico.\" Protesters toppled the obelisk on Indigenous Peoples' Day in 2020.<br /> <br /> The Plaza was founded by the Spanish in 1609 as a strategic location for defense. It later served as the endpoint marker of the Santa Fe Trail after Mexico gained its independence. During the Spanish occupation, the Plaza was unpaved. When Anglo-Americans arrived in about 1850, they brought the Plaza to its current size—about one city block—and enclosed it with buildings facing the Palace of the Governors.<br /> <br /> Located at the center of Santa Fe, the Plaza has been the site of a number of significant gatherings and events. During the early 1900s, it became a hub of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/womenshistory/19th-amendment.htm\">suffrage</a> activity as demonstrators organized, gathered in public, and petitioned local political leaders. The Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CU) was one of the most active groups. Because of this, they were labeled as labeled “aggressive” and “militant” for their tactics by contemporaneous newspapers and historians. The state’s constitution made it almost impossible to pass a suffrage amendment or referendum, requiring a three-fourths majority at an election and a two-thirds majority in each of the state’s counties. As a result, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/new-mexico-and-the-19th-amendment.htm\">New Mexico</a> suffragists focused their efforts on the passage of a national amendment.<br /> <br /> Many offices and residences overlooked the Plaza, including the Catron Block, the law offices of U.S. Senator Thomas Benton Catron. On October 21, 1915, the New Mexico branch of the CU gathered at Senator Catron’s residence. They called for Catron’s support of the national <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/susan-b-anthony.htm\">Susan B. Anthony</a> constitutional amendment. Catron was a boss of the Santa Fe Ring, New Mexico’s first political machine. He was a strong and vocal opponent of women’s suffrage. His was a significant hinderance to the movement. In the November 21, 1915 issue of <em>The Suffragist</em>, the weekly publication of the CU, a delegation can be seen standing with Catron outside of his home.<br /> <br /> The Santa Fe Plaza was also the home to the Second Governor’s Mansion, commonly referred to as the executive mansion. After state governors stopped living in the Palace of the Governors in 1907, they resided in a new building on the plaza that resembled the White House. In 1952, this residence was demolished. During its occupation, particularly during the governorship of Washington E. Lindsey, the Governor’s Mansion hosted several women’s suffrage meetings due to the first lady’s involvement with the women’s clubs of the state. Members of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage even met with Governor Lindsey to press their demands for women’s enfranchisement.<br /> <br /> While the surrounding buildings have undergone many changes over the years, the Plaza itself remains. The Santa Fe Plaza was designated as a National Landmark on December 19, 1960 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.<br /> <br /> <em>The content for this article was researched and written by Jade Ryerson, an intern with the Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education.</em></p> <h4>Bibliography</h4> <p><em>Albuquerque Morning Journal</em>. “Suffragists Prepare for Legislature.” November 24, 1918.

    "bodyText": "<p>When William Becknell and his crew set out on their now-famous trek on the Santa Fe Trail in 1821, they departed from Franklin, MO (now Old Franklin).  Travelling West from Franklin meant crossing the mighty Missouri River. The ferry at Arrow Rock was a convenient method for crossing, making the “Rock of the Arrows” an important landmark. Travelers like Becknell who used the ferry would then climb up the bluff and fill their water stores at the Santa Fe Spring. Also known as Big Spring and Arrow Rock Spring, the spring was a quality source of water for travelers heading West.  <br /> <br /> In 1829 after the town of Arrow Rock was started (originally called New Philadelphia), Burton Lawless granted free use of the spring, which was on his land, to the newly established town.

    "bodyText": "<p>The land always remembers. At the Santa Fe Trail Tracks we catch a glimpse of the memory of traders crossing the Trail in search of opportunity. For 60 years, this prairie sod was torn by the hooves of mules, oxen, and horses, and compacted by the weight of the large freight wagons they pulled. <br /> <br /> Plains Indians crossed this path as well, the land their home. Cheyenne, Apache, Kiowa-Apaches, and Arapahoe Indians roamed here. As more and more Santa Fe Trail travelers passed through the lands of the Plains Indians, an uneasy tension developed. Friendly trade, wary suspicion, plunder, or bloodshed could result from any encounter.<br /> <br /> Soldiers and temporary fortifications protected trading caravans as early as 1847, but isolation and lack of supplies led to their abandonment by 1854. Fort Dodge, established in 1865, was the area’s first permanent fort. You can still visit the Fort today. With its construction came a series of changes that eventually made it impossible for Plains Indians to live their traditional way of life.<br /> <br /> The site of the Santa Fe Trail Tracks also contains the remains of the Eureka Irrigation Canal (Stoule Canal). Built in the 1880s by Asa T. Soule, a prominent Dodge resident, the canal is seen as an engineering marvel of the 19th century. The canal was intended to irrigate farmlands north of Dodge City, but failed when a prolonged drought and similar projects lowered the Arkansas River’s water level.  </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (North side of US Hwy 50, 11 miles west of Dodge City)</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/learn/historyculture/dodge-city-ruts-exhibits.htm\">More Site Information (Exhibits)</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Overnight travelers camped on the hill where Comanche Elementary School now stands. This 21-acre park was known in recent years as Comanche Park.

The marker reads, \"Santa Fe Trail, 1821 - 1872, Marker by the Daughters of the American Revolution and the State of Missouri, 1909.\"<br /><br />Slightly to the right of that, a large stone sign, place perpendicular to the street reads, \"Santa Fe National Historic Trail, Schumacher Park.\" Below that are the three logos for the trails, each shaped like a rounded, equilateral triangle. The one for the Santa Fe Trail shows a covered wagon pulled by a team of 6 oxen. The one for the Oregon Trail shows just a covered wagon. The one for the California Trail shows a yoke for oxen with the curved top bar and two \"U\"-shaped extensions below.<br /><br />To the left of the fenced area a broad, cement sidewalk leads into the park, then curves behind the fencing. Behind the marker, another walkway leads back to a large covered pavilion, about 20 feet wide and 35 feet deep. The front half of this area has picnic tables, two on either side. Along the sides at the rear of the pavilion are 4 waysides signs. One titled \"The Capitalists\" discusses trade and merchantmen. The next is titled \"Los Capitalistas\" and discusses the traders and merchants at the New Mexico end of the Santa Fe Trail. Another is titled \"Bias and Business\" and covers the role of women, American Indians and slaves in trade. The last panel is titled \"Cultures in Collision\" and discusses the impact of the many trail travelers on native populations.<br /><br />The rear of the park property is covered with native prairie plantings -- tall and medium grasses and a variety of wildflowers.<br /><br />On either side of the sidewalk behind the stone marker are two more waysides, one discussing the three trails that passed through this region and the other discussing the role of the Daughters of the American Revolution or DAR in locating and marking the original route of the Santa Fe Trail.<br /><br />From the fenced area, the sidewalk leads another 50 yards to the right to one final wayside sign which discusses the disappearance of trail remnants due to modern development and the use of maps and aerial photographs to identify the routes.",

    "audioDescription": "Shawnee Indian Mission State Historic Site. 411 words<br /><br />This site has three historic, red-brick buildings and several smaller structures on both sides of the street. A stone sign near the entrance to the parking lot reads \"Shawnee Indian Mission\" and directly across the street is a stone marker proclaiming this as a state historic site. Another marker identifies this as a Registered National Historic Landmark. The buildings sit on grassy lawns with scattered trees. Some of the tree are black walnuts with their large round fruits on the ground underneath.<br /><br />One building is right next to the parking lot. A sign on the far side tells us that this is the East Building, erected in 1840-41, which \"provided a chapel and classrooms, and living quarters for the teachers. Indian boys slept in the attic. The first territorial legislature met here in 1855 and enacted the so-called Bogus Laws in an attempt to perpetuate slavery in Kansas.\" To the left of the building at the far end of the parking lot is a plot of land enclosed by split-rail fencing with several historic wooden buildings. Also at that end of the building, out in the middle of the lawn sits a covered wagon. Feel free to touch this exhibit.<br /><br />A sidewalk leads from the end of the East Building nearest the street which crosses a stream via a small wooden bridge and leads to the West Building. This building also has two stories and has a wing extending towards the rear. The wing has a second story porch enclosed by white railings and reached by an outside stairway next to the main building. A sign in front of this building tells us that \"This is the oldest of the three mission buildings now standing. Built in 1839 it was used for classrooms and living quarters for superintendents and teachers. Territorial officials had offices and rooms here in 1854-1856.\"<br /><br />At the front left corner of this building is a garden of native plants. Behind it is a small vegetable garden enclosed by a 4-foot-high wooden fence. <br /><br />The other building sits on the other side of the street. Also two stories, it has a two-story porch along the front with outside stairways leading up from either end. A sign tells us that \"This building, erected in 1845, was the dormitory and school for Indian girls. Here they were taught spinning, weaving, and other domestic arts. Andrew H. Reeder, first territorial governor of Kansas, had executive offices here.\"",

    "bodyText": "<p>Sometime during 1858, a trading post was established at the Stone Corral. In February of 1859, the Kansas Territorial Legislature passed an act to authorize William T. Williamson and others to build a bridge at the Little Arkansas crossing. The legislature set the toll rates as follows: wagon or vehicle, 50 cents; each large animal, 10 cents, each small animal and person, 5 cents; man and horse, 10 cents. The earliest known somewhat permanent operator of a ranch at the Little Arkansas crossing was William D. Wheeler.<br /> <br /> Wheeler, with the help of others, may have built the Stone Corral that existed on the site of his ranch. The original Buffalo Bill, William Mathewson, had a trading post here for a short time. Some believe that the soldiers who occupied the site in 1865 and in 1867 did the work, but there are references to the corral prior to 1865, when troops were first stationed there. The stone used for the construction of the Stone Corral was quarried from an outcropping of rock about one mile west of the Stone Corral location. The corral was described as an excellent example of dry masonry, the walls being so perfectly laid and the sandstone slabs so carefully placed together that little or no light could be seen through any place. There was a small stone room built into one corner of the corral. The walls were about eight feet high and perhaps thirty inches thick. The corral was 300 to 400 feet long east and west, or perhaps northeast to southwest, and about 200 feet wide. The north wall had one or two openings about 10 inches up and down, and two feet long on the inside, tapering to about 10 inches square on the outside. A gateway at the southeast corner of the corral allowed wagons and livestock to enter.<br /> <br /> William Wheeler disappeared after May 1864. Prior to 1872, American Indians burned the bridge over the Little Arkansas in an unsuccessful attempt to stop travel on the Santa Fe Trail. Nathan A. C. Bean was the first to officially settle on the Stone Corral site in the 1870's, living in the corral for several months. According to Bean, eight to as many as thirty wagons regularly camped within the walls of the Stone Corral enclosure. Early in the 1870's Mr. Bean began selling stone from the walls of the corral. Some of this was used to build a school house a mile south and three quarters of a mile west of the Stone Corral location. Known as Stone Corral School, the building is still standing though it hasn’t been used in many years. Some of the stone was hauled to Nickerson for the construction of a railway roundhouse. Early settlers in the area used some of the stone to line water wells and build foundations for the homes and farm buildings that were being constructed in the area. Within a few years nearly all the stone was gone and the land was cleared for cultivation.</p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (30th Rd., between P Ave. and O Ave., South of Windom, KS)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/The-Little-Arkansas-Crossing-Brochure-August-2014.pdf\">Santa Fe Trail Association Little Arkansas Crossing Brochure</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

He was a plainsman and former mountain man. The 1879 biographical sketch of his life says the year was 1862 and his own statement in 1864, confirms that he \"built the ranche and corral, dug and walled the well, and owned the trading post himself...\"<br /> <br /> In 1863, after operating it only one year, Mathewson sold his ranche at the Great Bend to Theodore R. (Dick) Curtis and H. F. (Frank) Cole. These partners had obtained a license from Indian agent Samuel G. Colley to trade with the Cheyennes, Kiowas, Comanches, Arapahoes, and Plains Apaches. Curtis, however, was employed as an interpreter at Fort Larned (some 35 miles west) and it was Frank Cole who stayed at the ranche.<br /> <br /> The ranche at the Great Bend of the Arkansas existed less than two and a half years.</p> <h2>Site Information </h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Intersection of South Fritz Ave and West A Street in Ellinwood, Kansas)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.santafetrail.org/chapters/quivira/Brochures/The-Big-Bend-of-the-Arkansas-Brochure-Nov-2012.pdf\">Read more: <em>The Great/Big Bend of the Arksansas</em> brochure from the Santa Fe Trail Association</a></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <br />  ",

Its fortunes were tied to nearby Fort Union and the Santa Fe trade. Tiptonville's bars, church, and Masonic Lodge drew the thirsty and the faithful. Its Methodist Mission Day School, the first in the territory, served the area until 1880, when Tiptonville's population peaked at about 125 residents.<br />  <br /> Tiptonville was an important place to weigh the merits of two Santa Fe Trail branches (routes). The village was located on the longer, safer Mountain Route. Close by, travelers could access the faster, drier, Cimarron Route. As they did in Council Grove, Kansas, trade caravans met in Tiptonville to organize and exchange information on conditions, water resources, and dangers along the Trail.<br />  <br /> At the outset of the Mexican-American War in 1846, the Army of the West followed the Santa Fe Trail through Tiptonville. In 1862, during the American Civil War, the US Military followed the Trail enroute to the Battle of Glorieta Pass, 60 miles to the west.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Mountain Branch Overlook, Watrous, New Mexico)</p> <p>Today, Tiptonville is home to a few residents and has limited to no public services. <strong>Please respect private property and view the village from a distance.</strong><br /> <br /> Continuing north on New Mexico 161 from the Mountain Branch Overlook takes you to Fort Union National Monument.

It winds its way up the gentle slope to your right and crosses in front of you, disappearing to your left.<br /><br />The wayside sign has an image of a covered wagon being pulled by a team of six oxen, its wheels moving in two ruts on a trail through tall grasses. Text tells us that \"thousands of wagon wheels, animal hooves and human feet once passed this way, creating the deep depression in front of you. This swale, now worn by erosion, is grassed-over evidence of three trails once connecting frontier Missouri to distant lands. In the mid-1800s, caravans moving through here hauled freight between Missouri and Santa Fe. Overland emigrants followed, headed for Oregon's farmlands or California's gold fields. This swale, evidence of past trail use, is one of the few known in the greater Kansas City area. During some years, wet and muddy conditions on the trails led to frustrating delays, yet memorable experiences.\"<br /><br />At the bottom of the sign are two contemporary accounts. The first reads, \"Amid the fiercest storm I have yet witnessed on the trip, I encamped last night with a party of â€˜our folks'; and though I was literally soaked through when I arose in the morning from my grassy couch, I never slept more profoundly, nor experienced healthier feeling. Favored with pleasanter weather, we continued, after breakfast, our ride to the plains. - George L. Curry, May 1846, writing near this spot.\"<br /><br />The second reads, \"The first day we got but 3 miles from town with half our wagons, the other half we left mired in devious and sundry mudholes strung along for a mile behind. On Sunday morning we started and got on pretty well until dark overtook us at Mr. Barne's place 8 miles from town where we encamped and placed our animals all in his pasture. It commenced pouring down rain soon after dark and the next morning the roads were so slippery and muddy that we could not stir until about 12 o'clock. - William H. Glasgow, June 1846, writing near this site.\"",

For eight years following 1859, Wright worked as a trader and contractor, hauling grain and cutting hay and wood for military posts along the Santa Fe Trail. He had 3 road ranches on the trail and was one of the last owners of the ranch at the Cimarron Crossing from 1866 - 68. He was also the owner of the sutler store at Fort Dodge.<br /> <br /> He became a major business man in Dodge City and the Rath and Wright store was the main business in Dodge City supplying first the buffalo hunters and then the cattle men and their drovers. Wright served as mayor and as a state representative from 1875 - 1883. In 1883, Wright purchased 19 plus acres of treeless swampland north of the Arkansas River from the town company. Wright intended to give the city the land as a park. He and Peter Mootz, a nurseryman, planted cottonwood trees and filled in the channels. In 1900, the city took ownership and the park was named in Wright's honor. The park has expanded to 61 acres and is the main park in Dodge City.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Wright Park is located at 71 N 2nd Ave, Dodge City, KS, 67801.)</p> <p>At Wright Park today, not only can you find peace under the shade of tall trees and at the Liberty Garden, but you can also find excitement visiting Wright Park Zoo, the playground, and skatepark.

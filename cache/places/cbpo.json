If they could capture the city—the third largest in the United States and a commercial and shipbuilding hub—they could likely bring the war to an end. Military and civilians, including free and enslaved African Americans, rallied to fend off the British.<br /> <br /> On September 12-14, 1814, the British attacked by land from <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/stsp/learn/historyculture/battle-of-north-point.htm\">North Point</a> and by water at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fomc/learn/historyculture/the-bombardment-of-fort-mchenry.htm\">Fort McHenry</a> on the Patapsco.

Located in Dundalk, MD, the park was dedicated in 1839 to honor the Maryland militia who fought against the British forces.<br /> <br /> The park's large “Home of the Brave” mural highlights the region’s role during the War of 1812 through five separate images. The main image is a depiction of the Battle of North Point with American militia troops engaging British soldiers en route to Baltimore City. On either side of the center image are portraits of the two military leaders for the conflict, with U.S. Brigadier General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/stsp/learn/historyculture/john-stricker.htm\">John Stricker</a> on the left and British Major General <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/robert-ross.htm\">Robert Ross </a>on the right. The final two flanking panels showcase Todd’s Inheritance, a signal house and horse courier station during the war, and the 25th anniversary commemoration event where the original Star-Spangled Banner was spread across the stage. The mural, created by artist Marshall Adams and unveiled in 2014, runs along the park's western boundary on an exterior wall of a business, across the street from the <a href=\"https://dnr.maryland.gov/publiclands/Pages/central/NorthPointBattlefield.aspx\">North Point State Battlefield.</a>",

In late summer, visitors can enjoy splashes of color provided by cardinal-flower and the threatened red turtlehead (Chelone obliqua). In the evening, one may also hear the quick trill of the arboreal gray treefrog. Visitors can enjoy several hiking trails that lead through the property.</p> <p>Battle Creek Cypress Swamp encompasses about 100 acres of cypress swamp and surrounding upland woods. It was purchased in 1977 by The Nature Conservancy and is currently leased and operated by Calvert County Parks and Recreation.

By the time the Americans realized that the British invasion force was heading to Washington, they had little time to prepare. <br /> <br /> The British veteran force of 4,500 had marched for four days carrying loaded packs in near 100-degree heat. This included a contingent of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/stsp/learn/historyculture/colonial-marines.htm\">Colonial Marines</a>, formerly enslaved men from the Chesapeake region who had sought their freedom with the British.  There were 6,000 Americans, including regulars, Chesapeake Flotilla crewmen, marines, and inexperienced militia.<br /> <br /> At 1:00p.m. the British stormed the bridge.<br /> <br /> The opposing troops clashed in three hours of intense fighting. Though superior in number, most of the American defensive forces were poorly trained, ill-equipped, and positioned so the lines could not support one another. They were no match for the seasoned British army. <br /> <br /> President James Madison and several cabinet members were on the field of battle that day. Seeing the start of an American rout, they beat a hasty retreat to Washington, sending word ahead to warn others to save what possessions they could and flee. After a few hours of rest, the British then moved on to Washington, D.C. <br />  ",

English colonists used the land for farms and other agricultural practices such as logging, orchard growing and raising cattle. By the early 1900s, the island had become a popular hunting retreat. Following development pressure in the 1960s, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acquired the entire island to preserve the valuable wildlife habitat and natural resources. Today, the refuge serves as a major stop for migratory birds along the Atlantic Flyway, with various outlooks and trails providing premium wildlife watching spots and a visitor contact station that offers information, interpretive displays, and restrooms.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Eastern Neck National Wildlife Refuge is an island of nearly 2,300 acres surrounded by the waters of the Chester River and Chesapeake Bay, and consists of marshlands, grasslands, cropland, and forest. Flat, paved roads and several hiking trails and boardwalks allow for great views of the varied habitats and wildlife. A small visitor center located in a historic hunting lodge provides visitors with information, maps, displays, and restrooms.",

They also wanted to stifle Fells Point---the home port for many of the privateers that preyed on British merchant ships. The United States augmented its small navy by licensing privately owned ships to attack enemy vessels. Baltimore privateers captured more than 500 British ships during the War of 1812. </p> <h2>Learn more</h2> <p>To find out more specifics on Fells Point in regards to resturants, shops and other various attractions, please visit the Visit Baltimore website,<a href=\"https://baltimore.org/neighborhoods/fells-point/\"> https://baltimore.org/neighborhoods/fells-point/</a>.<br /> <br /> Paid public parking is available.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>In September of 1814, after occupying Washington, D.C. and burning the public buildings, a British invasion force proceeded to Baltimore - a busy port city that specialized in outfitting privateers to prey on British shipping. <br /> <br /> Baltimore represented a more stategically important target than the largely undeveloped capital city of Washington, and was thus well protected by a masonry fort commanding the entrance to Baltimore harbor. After a 25 hour bombardment by the British fleet and determined resistance by the gunners of Fort McHenry, the invasion force was repulsed. <br /> <br /> After two and a half years of indecisive campaigning on the Canadian frontier, America was in debt, weary of war, and facing a trained and disciplined European army. There was no hope of achieving the stated goals of the war: free trade, sailors' rights, and the annexation of Canada. But a victory at Fort McHenry offered hope that the War of 1812 might end on terms agreeable to the United States and that the American republic could endure. <br /> <br /> The feeling of pride, patriotism, and hope emerging from the victory at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fomc/index.htm\">Fort McHenry</a> was recorded by Francis Scott Key, who witnessed the fort's American flag surviving the bomardment and recorded his impressions in the words that became America's national anthem -\"The Star Spangled Banner.\"</p>",

Located within Pocomoke State Forest and the Nassawango Creek Preserve, Furnace Town was built by the Maryland Iron Company to house workers for the Nassawango Iron Furnace. From 1828 to 1850, about 300 people lived and worked in Furnace Town to service the furnace at its peak. However, by 1850 the furnace reported bankruptcy and the town soon dissolved. By 1929, only a few foundations of previous buildings and the furnace remained.<br /> <br /> Today, what remains of the historic site has been preserved and is open to the public to explore and learn about Furnace Town, its impact on the region and the burgeoning of industry on the Eastern Shore. Guided tours, a museum and visitor center relay the years of history found on the grounds, with nearby trails snaking through Pocomoke State Forest.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>A Historic Plantation</h3> <p>Built in 1703, Sotterley Plantation grew to become one of the largest plantations in the Chesapeake Bay region. An economic hub of its own, Sotterley's wharf on the Patuxent River saw the export of tobacco, corn, and lumber produced by the enslaved population of the plantation. Ships arrived into the port carrying captive Africans alongside luxury goods from Europe. Managed by a succession of powerful owners, the plantation's income eventually collapsed with the outlawing of slavery in 1864. The buildings and garden have since been restored, and today the site operates as an educational organization with National Historic Landmark status. Sotterley seeks to engage visitors with the challenging realities of our history, cultivating a respect for the past and the natural environment. </p> <h3>Visit Historic Sotterley </h3> Find detailed information about Historic Sotterley on their website: <a href=\"https://sotterley.org/\">Historic Sotterley Home - Sotterley</a><br /> <br /> <u><strong>Address:</strong></u> 44300 Sotterley Ln.

Machicomoco was the first state park dedicated to Virginia's Indigenous peoples. <br /> <br /> In addition, the park is the site of Timberneck, a circa 1793 house that was part of the larger Rosewell Plantation. A local archeological firm is currently working to restore the site, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, for future use as an education and lodging building. <br /> <br /> Visitors to Machicomoco State Park can enjoy a variety of activities. The park has a 3.3 mile paved trail for walking and biking, .7 mile gravel trail around the interpretive area, and a natural trail that runs 2.4 miles.<br /> <br /> Two picnic shelters and numerous campsites are available for rent, including cabins and yurts. An open-air pavilion provides an opportunity to learn more about Virginia's Indigenous communities and history. Follow a timeline from the first arrival of people in North America, to the formation of Tribal groups whose descendents still live in Virginia today.  <br /> <br /> A car-top boat launch allows access to Poplar Creek and the York River. Access to the Catlett Islands and accompanying marsh areas is prohibited due to the sensitive nature of the resources. Motorized boats and boats launched from trailers are not permitted to use this access. Water access is closed from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31 to protect migratory waterfowl that use the area for overwintering. Fishing is permitted at the floating slips located on Timberneck Creek. A valid Virginia saltwater license is required from the Virginia Department of Marine Resources.",

In the historic area, a historic plantation house stands in addition to a model Indigenous longhouse constructed artistically from a metal structure.",

Over half of the park boasts protected wetlands, known as the Black Marsh Natural Area, which hosts upper tidal marsh with shrubs, wetland grasses and unique flowers. The many natural areas of the parks host a variety of wildlife species, including muskrats, beavers, foxes, otters, osprey and more.<br /> <br /> North Point has an extensive history of human use, with evidence dating back at least 9,000 years. The site played a key role for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fomc/learn/historyculture/the-bombardment-of-fort-mchenry.htm\">Battle of Baltimore</a> during the War of 1812. A 1767 farmhouse formerly located at the park served as a lookout station during the war. In September 1814, a signal flag atop the farmhouse sent a warning to Baltimore that the British fleet was approaching, alerting American troops and local residents to prepare for an attack. During the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the park was the site of the Bay Shore Amusement Park, a small park featuring gardens, a dance hall and even a bowling alley. Today, the park features fishing piers, picnicking areas, hiking trails, a water accessible area and more.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Reedville Fishermen’s Museum is in Northumberland County, Virginia along the banks of Cockrell Creek, a tributary that drains into the lower Chesapeake Bay. The museum stands on land once owned by Captain Elijah Reed. In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, Reed sailed to the Chesapeake Bay from Maine and set up residence and a small menhaden fishery along the creek. There he introduced a method of extracting large quantities of oil from the fish to be used as a lubricant and in lighting, and the leftover bones and carcasses were used as meal and valuable fertilizer. The menhaden fishing industry brought tremendous wealth to Northumberland County and the town of Reedville, which was once known as the wealthiest town in the United States, due to its large income produced by the menhaden industry.<br /> <br /> Today, the property is home to the William Walker House, which represents a waterman’s home during the 1800s. This location was the first home of the museum but has now expanded to include a standalone museum and gift shop, a boat shop, model shop, pilot house and several vessel exhibits, two of which are on the National Registry of Historic Places.<br /> <br /> The museum hosts a collection of artifacts, items and historical materials that document and explore the history of fishing in the region, dating from early American Indian practices to modern-day oystermen. The museum operates Thursday through Saturday from 11AM to 4PM and Sunday from 1PM to 4PM from Memorial Day through Labor Day.<br /> <br /> Address: 504 Main Street, Reedville, VA. </p>",

However, this small island is home to a community of watermen and women whose ancestors have lived here since colonial times. Surprising stories emerge from the island's history, from the Native Americans who came here to hunt and fish to the enslaved African Americans who escaped to the island to find their freedom. </p> <h2>Visiting Tangier</h2> <p>Tangier Island is only accesible by private boat or ferry.

They likely came here to take advantage of the summer's rich bounty of fish and shellfish.The Pocomoke people of the Bay's Eastern Shore were among the groups that could have traveled here. They would have reached the offshore island in dugout canoes, the largest of which could reach 70 feet long. </p> <h3>Colonial Settlement</h3> <p>Among the first Europeans to observe the island, John Smith and his crew spotted Tangier and its neighboring islands during their voyage throughout the Bay in the summer of 1608. With a penchant for naming the places he visited, Smith called the islands the Russell Isles, after a member of his crew, Doctor Russell. As early as the 1670s, colonists held patents to the island, which they primarily used to graze livestock. A century later, the first permanent residents arrived on the island. At first they made their living by farming, but fishing, crabbing, and oystering soon took over as their primary occupation. </p> <h3>War of 1812</h3> <p>For nearly 1,000 slaves during the War of 1812, Tangier Island was a fortress of salvation, and the place where they took their first free steps. Fort Albion, named after the ancient name for England and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/george-cockburn.htm\">Commodore George Cockburn</a>’s flagship, was constructed on the island in 1814 to serve two major functions: as a central base to sustain continued British attacks along the Chesapeake, and as a depot for receiving runaway American slaves into citizenship and service to His Majesty, King George III of England.</p> <p>Using America’s slaves against itself was not a novel idea – the British successfully employed this war tactic during the Revolutionary War. However, in the War of 1812, American slaves were considered free British citizens as soon as they set foot on British soil (which included forts and vessels), as slavery was illegal in all British territories. The new recruits remained neither American nor enslaved in the eyes of the British. Some slaves stole boats or canoes and met British troops directly; others started fires to get the attention of British soldiers for rescue. In some cases, these slaves took up arms as part of an active offense, while in others they simply took the opportunity presented by the British to escape bondage.</p> <p>As early as 1813, British army and navy officers were instructed to “provide shelter, protection, and evacuation to refugees.” <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/alexander-cochrane.htm\">Admiral Alexander Cochrane</a> formalized the policy in April 1814, with a <a href=\"http://www.novascotia.ca/nsarm/virtual/africanns/archives.asp?ID=70\">proclamation</a> offering the “choice of either entering into His Majesty’s Sea or Land Forces, or of being sent as FREE Settlers to the British Possessions in North America or the West Indies.”</p> <p>With an anticipated influx of new recruits, the Royal Navy needed a new base. Tangier Island provided an easy access point in the Chesapeake to the Upper and Lower Bays, as well as the Potomac, Washington and Baltimore, while being surrounded by slaves in the plantation country of Virginia and Maryland. Fort Albion included a barracks, a hospital, a church, family dwellings and gardens, meant to accommodate not just prospective soldiers, but the families they brought with them as well. From its earliest inception, Fort Albion was conceived not just as a place for military training, but a place which would be a temporary home for newly freed Britons.</p> <p>Tangier Island was not employed long; the War of 1812 ended less than a year after Fort Albion was built, on February 17, 1815. As the British withdrew, Cockburn ordered that “on no account [is] a Single Negro [to] be left, except by his own request,” fully embracing the status of the former slaves – whether in service or not – as free subjects of the British Empire. On March 21, 1815, the evacuation of the British from the island was completed, and Fort Albion and its barracks were burned. Former slaves were sent as soldiers and citizens to settle British colonies in the Caribbean and Canada.</p> <p>Between the fort’s intentional destruction and subsequent unintentional destruction by storms and floods common in the Chesapeake, nothing remains of Fort Albion today. Much of Tangier Island where it stood has eroded, leaving a sandy beach reminiscent of those that slaves saw as they set foot on the island, in search of freedom.</p>",

The island's first settlers in the 1700s relied on farming for their occupation, but over the next century, harvesting seafood became the more lucrative profession. During the War of 1812, the British built Fort Albion on Tangier Island and used it as a staging area for battles further inland.

Construction of the house's brick Central Block began in the spring of 1771. The following year, Thomas and his family likely took up residence even though the work was incomplete.</p> <p>The Central Block’s first floor comprises the Center Passage along with the East and West Rooms. The second floor had two large rooms that would have served as bed chambers.</p> <h4>Center Passage</h4> <p>Upon entering the Center Passage, guests could see a large and attractive stairway, expensive portraits, and decorative rooms to the left and right, which provided clues to the wealth and status of the Stones. With doors at each end, this breezeway may have been one of the house's most comfortable rooms during the spring, summer, and fall.</p> <h4>West Room</h4> <p>The West Room is believed to be the Master Bedchamber. Ornate first floor bedchambers in colonial era homes often served the dual purposes of being daytime or informal parlors. In the case of Margaret Stone, who developed a debilitating case of arthritis that often turned her into an invalid, she likely did not receive many guests but could converse with her family on her better days.</p> <p>While there is no supporting evidence, the lifestyles of slave owning gentry of the time suggests that an enslaved African American may have slept either on the floor of the West Room or in the adjacent Center Passage, to be readily available to care for the family's needs both night and day.</p> <h4>East Room</h4> <p>It is evident this room was used for entertaining. Contrary to modern and romanticized visions of colonial era homes, most were not elegant and pristine. Few colonial homes had rooms as beautiful as Thomas Stone's East Room. The expensive furnishing and window coverings and the well crafted woodwork were designed to impress guests, and even though this woodwork is a reconstruction of the original it still shows the detail that was put into the work.</p> <p>Aside from its beauty, the East Room may have served a more important function. With only one doorway, the room could provide privacy for Thomas Stone as he performed his legal and political duties along with directing county defense activities during the American Revolution. In Maryland’s heavily class-based society, the elegance of the East Room emphasized the importance, power, and success of Thomas Stone and justified his role as a leading figure in the community.</p> <h4>Second Floor</h4> <p>The purpose of the second floor was to serve as bed chambers, not just for Thomas and Margaret Stone’s three children. Upon Thomas's father's and eldest brother's deaths in 1773, Thomas permitted some of his younger brothers and sisters to live in the home. Also, as a host to law clients, political allies, several siblings and their families, distant relations, and countless friends, Stone was expected to provide places for everyone to sleep. </p> <p>Crowded homes were quite common in the colonial era. Rooms were hot and stuffy in the summer and drafty and cold in the winter. Privacy by modern standards barely existed. Even George Washington referred to his mansion of Mount Vernon as a “well-restored tavern.”</p> <h4>West Hyphen</h4> <p>The adjoining West Hyphen was built during Thomas Stone’s ownership to connect to the West Wing, which served as a kitchen for the Stones. This Hyphen may have served as a multi-use space with easily moved furnishings to allow dining, indoor chores and crafts, entertaining, and possibly to serve as a guest chamber.</p> <h4>West Wing</h4> <p>The original West Wing kitchen space is believed to have been a small and relatively unadorned structure designed for the function of cooking, cleaning, and other household chores by enslaved workers. The current West Wing, which partially rests upon the original foundations, dates from the mid-1840s. There are two rooms on the first floor and a steep stairway that leads to two more rooms above. In 1846, William Briscoe Stone remarked in a letter to his daughter Mary that the West Wing was, “…much enlarged improved & amended. I am certain you will be surprised and pleased with the change.\"<br /> <br /> During the 20th-century, the residents redesigned the West Hyphen to create a connective hallway between the second floor of the Central Block and the West Wing. This modernization was removed by the National Park Service to help return the mansion to a more historical design.</p> <h4>East Hyphen</h4> <p>The East Hyphen was a unique space. Its primary function was to serve as a protective cover for the full cellar that existed beneath the Central Block. It is not connected in the same way as the West Hyphen is connected. In order to gain access to the space, one would have to go outside the house and enter from the outside. </p> <h4>East Wing</h4> <p>Architectural historians believe that the East Wing is the oldest part of the house. It was likely a wholly separate and independent structure moved from some other location on the plantation to serve as the East Wing. Like the East Hyphen, there was no internal connection from the Central Block to the East Wing. One had to exit the mansion, walk across the lawn, and then enter the East Wing. </p>",

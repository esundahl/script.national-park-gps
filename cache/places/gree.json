Along the 5.3 miles, you will see the roads that surround the park : Greenbelt Road, Interstate 95, the Baltimore Washington Parkway and Kenilworth Avenue. You will also see parts of Still Creek, cross over a couple of wooden bridges and end up at the entrance of the park. Along the trail, you have the possibility of white tailed deer, woodpeckers, squirrels, and other forest animals.Greenbelt Park is located in suburban Maryland so there is no chance to see any bears.",

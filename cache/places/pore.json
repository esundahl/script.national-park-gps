    "audioDescription": "The Abbotts Lagoon Beach is the section of the 11-mile-long (17-kilometer-long) Point Reyes Beach near the west end of Abbotts Lagoon. To the west is the Pacific Ocean. The sandy and steep-sloped Point Reyes Beach stretches for about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) to the north-northeast before giving way to the rugged shoreline of Tomales Point. To the south-southwest, the Point Reyes Beach stretches for about 9 miles (14.4 kilometers) before ending at the Point Reyes Headlands. Abbotts Lagoon is composed of three connected bodies of water that drain from the northeast. The largest and westernmost lagoon is closest to the ocean and separated from the ocean by a natural dam composed of sand that can vary in width from one season to the next. After some powerful storm events, ocean waves may flow into this lowest lagoon, or water from the lagoon may top the dam and flow into the ocean. The largest lagoon stretches to the southeast for about 4,700 feet (1425 meters) and gets up to about 1,700 feet (515 meters) wide. The middle lagoon is a few feet higher in elevation than the lowest lagoon and stretches to the northeast from the lowest lagoon's north-northeastern edge. A footbridge is located where these two lagoons meet, and, depending on the water level, there may be a very short waterfall as water flows from the middle to the lower lagoon. The middle lagoon is about 3,300 feet (1000 meters) long and up to about 920 feet (280 meters) wide. The upper lagoon lies to the northeast of the middle lagoon. It is the smallest lagoon and measures about 1,100 feet (335 meters) long and 450 feet (137 meters) wide. Sand dunes, some covered in sparse vegetation, surround the western end of Abbotts Lagoon. The dunes give way to coastal grasslands to the east, some of which have been converted to fences in pastureland. Wetland vegetation immediately surrounds the upper and middle lagoons. The Abbotts Lagoon Trail starts about 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) to the east at the Abbotts Lagoon Trailhead along Pierce Point Road. The trail passes through grassland along the south sides of the upper and middle lagoons before crossing the footbridge and passing along the northern sandy shore of the lower, westernmost lagoon.",

The \"Alamere Falls Trail\" is NOT a maintained trail, and poses many hazards to off-trail hikers—crumbling and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/safety.htm#CP_JUMP_726515\">eroding cliffs</a>, massive <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/safety.htm#CP_JUMP_726517\">poison oak</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/safety.htm#CP_JUMP_726518\">ticks</a>, and no cell phone service. Visitors who use this unmaintained trail may endanger themselves and rescuers, and inadvertently cause resource damage, such as trampling plants, which may lead to the death of the trampled plants. On an almost weekly basis, visitors get hurt scrambling down the heavily rutted route leading to the top of the falls or sliding down the crumbly cliff-face to get to the beach, sometimes requiring search and rescue teams to be mobilized. The National Park Service strongly advises visitors against using this unmaintained route.

    "audioDescription": "An approximately 20-foot-wide (6-meter-wide) waterfall cascades over an approximately 40-foot-tall (12-meter-tall) beige-colored bluff onto a sandy ocean beach. Green moss, algae, and small plants grow on the bluffs on either side of the falls. To the south of the falls, the bluffs become taller and the beach becomes more narrow and rocky. Sandy beach gives way to rocky intertidal habitat. A tall headlands about 2000 feet (610 meters) to the south jut out into the ocean, blocking the view of the coastline to the south. To the west, ocean waves wash ashore. To the north, the bluff-lined Wildcat Beach stretches 2.6 miles (4.2 kilometers) to Miller Point. Follow Wildcat Beach 1.1 miles (1.8 kilometers) to the north to return to Wildcat Campground, which is the only location along Wildcat Beach with a safe route to leave the beach.",

    "audioDescription": "The Bayview Trailhead is located at a small gravel parking lot with space for ~20 vehicles on the north side of a very windy paved two-lane road. It is at an elevation of approximately 780 feet (235 meters) near the crest of a forested ridge that runs from the northwest to the southeast. To the southwest, a triangular peninsula stretches 10 miles (16 kilometers) into the Pacific Ocean. A large sign in a wooden frame provides information about the Vision Fire that burned much of the surrounding landscape in October 1995. From the west end of the parking lot, the Inverness Ridge Trail—which is a single-lane dirt-gravel service road closed to visitor vehicular traffic—heads to the north along the ridge crest. A ten-foot-long metal gate blocks vehicular passage onto the Inverness Ridge Trail, but there is sufficient room on either side of the gate for pedestrians, bicyclists, and horse riders. The single-track Bayview Trail ascends from a wooded valley to west, enters the parking lot near its southwest corner, crosses the paved road, and then parallels the road along its south side as it winds to the east along the ridge crest. Trail signage near where the trails depart from the road or parking lot provide information about what uses (i.e., pet walking, camping, building fires, riding bicycles) are prohibited on which trails and the distances to other trails or points of interest.",

    "audioDescription": "The Bear Valley Trailhead is located in a large, grassy meadow on the floor of a moderate-sized valley that runs north-northwest to south-southeast between two ridges. The ridge to the west rises about 1000 feet (300 meters) above the valley floor and is covered by a dense, mostly-coniferous forest, the edge of which is about 800 feet (240 meters) to the west. The ridge to the east is about one mile (1.6 kilometers) away and rises about 400 feet (120 meters) above the valley floor and is mostly covered by cattle-grazed pasturelands. From the Bear Valley Trailhead, a paved, two-lane access road heads north, and a 12-foot-wide (3.7-meter-wide) gravel road/trail heads south. Immediately to the northeast of the Bear Valley Trailhead is a large gravel parking lot with room for about 210 passenger vehicles. At the northeast corner of this gravel parking lot is a moderate-sized restroom building, adjacent to a picnic area filled with tall fir trees. Immediately to the northeast of the trailhead is a smaller dirt and grass covered parking that can accommodate about 20 buses, RVs, and/or vehicles pulling trailers. Further to the north is a paved lot adjacent to a large, gray, barn-shaped visitor center surrounded by fenced pasture in which horses may be grazing. A single-lane paved driveway leads up a small hill to the west to a cluster of buildings and trees at the Morgan Horse Ranch. The Morgan Trail, a single-track path, follows along the south side of the driveway. About 225 feet (70 meters) to the southwest of the trailhead is a small copse of tall fir trees surrounded by meadow. The single-track Woodpecker Nature Trail heads southwest from the trailhead toward these trees. The aforementioned gravel road/trail that heads south is the Bear Valley Trail, which leads through the meadow for 1150 feet (350 meters) before entering a dense forest. The single-track Rift Zone Trail departs to the east through the tree-dotted meadow toward a tree-lined creek about 1500 feet (455 meters) away. There are two metal gates across the Bear Valley Trail, about 50 feet (16 meters) apart, to prevent unauthorized automobiles from driving onto the trail. There is space on the left side of the first gate for pedestrians, cyclists, and horses to pass around the gate. The second gate is left open when the trail is open. Adjacent to the first gate is a brown metal sign that reads: \"Bear Valley Trailhead, permits and trail information available at the Visitor Center.\" There are three universal icons on the sign that indicate pets and fires are not allowed, but camping is permitted (with a reservation). There are metal receptacles for recycling and garbage near this sign. On the west side of the trail between the two gates is a large wood-framed map of the southern part of Point Reyes National Seashore and information about hiking. On the west side just north of the second gate is a large wooden bench. A small sign about twenty feet to the east of the second gate marks the beginning of the Rift Zone Trail. Split-rail wooden fences line the parking lot, surround the trailhead, and run along the south side of the Rift Zone Trail for about 120 feet (40 meters).",

    "audioDescription": "The historic lifeboat station's boat house is a two-story building measuring about 40 feet by 60 feet (12 meters by 18 meters). It is painted white with green trim on the windows, and a red gabled roof. One of the 40-foot-wide sides faces Drakes Bay to the north-northeast. Drakes Bay is a semicircular body of water stretching about 8 miles (13 kilometers) from west to east and about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) from north to south, opening to the Pacific Ocean to the south. The northwest side of Drakes Bay is line by beige-colored bluffs that rise above sandy beaches. The boathouse is located near the southwest end of Drakes Bay along a narrow peninsula that stretches east from the west end of the much larger Point Reyes Peninsula. Immediately to the south of the lifeboat station and boathouse, grass covered hills rise steeply about 200 feet (60 meters) in elevation, before dropping abruptly into the ocean. A long wooden marine railway, designed to lower a lifeboat into the water, extends into the bay on wooden piers from the north-northeast-facing side of the boathouse. Next to the building is a small area for cars to park, and wooden railings painted white marking the parking area and deck of the building. A small beach edges Drakes Bay on both sides of the building. A one-lane-wide driveway leads steeply up and over a headland to the west-northwest toward a two-story-tall white house, a couple garages, and other out buildings associated with the Lifeboat Station. Coniferous trees surround the buildings, shielding them from wind. Two picnic tables and trash and recycling receptacles are located along the southeast side of the boathouse.",

    "audioDescription": "The Chimney Rock Trailhead is located near the eastern end of a small narrow peninsula, with a semicircular bay to the north and east and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The Point Reyes Headlands stretch about 3 miles (5 kilometers) to the west, rising to an elevation of about 600 feet (180 meters). To the north, pale-colored bluffs rise above the bay. To the east across the bay, a forested ridge runs northwest to southeast. A narrow paved road descends a grassy hill from the northwest to a small paved parking lot with space for 20 vehicles. Accessible parking spaces and a small wooden bus shelter are located on the south side of the parking lot. A vault toilet is located behind and to the south of the bus shelter. A single-track dirt trail departs the parking lot to the east of the bus shelter and leads south and east to the eastern end of the Chimney Rock Peninsula, about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) to the east-southeast. Along the north side of the parking lot, the Chimney Rock Road continues downhill toward the bay before reaching a fork in the road 180 feet (55 meters) to the northeast. The left fork bends to the northwest before arcing sharply to the east. At the bend, a narrow dirt path heads northwest to the Elephant Seal Overlook. The right fork of the road leads east toward some trees, beyond which is the historic lifeboat station. Interpretive signs about the lifeboat station are located along the northeastern side of the parking lot.",

The Coast Trail—which is a single-lane dirt-gravel service road closed to visitor vehicular traffic—heads south along the valley floor, paralleling an alder-lined creek. Across the paved road and to the northwest is an old, moderately-sized ranch house that now serves as the main building for Limantour Lodge. The lodge is perched just above the road on the side of the hill, with a narrow driveway leading up to it. For about 300 feet (90 meters) along the south side of the paved road, the dirt and grass-covered shoulder is wide enough to parallel park vehicles. The Coast Trail descends steeply descends from the elevated paved road. A ten-foot-long metal gate blocks vehicular passage onto the Coast Trail, but there is sufficient room on either side of the gate for pedestrians, bicyclists, and horse riders. On the east side of the trail is a brown metal National Park Service sign with white lettering that says \"Coast Trailhead\" and \"Camping by permit only.\" There is an icon showing a tent, an icon showing that dogs are not allowed, and an icon showing that campfires are not allowed. There is a blue Tsunami Warning Zone sign and various other informational signs.",

    "audioDescription": "Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, a two-lane highway, descends from the wooded Bolinas Ridge to the west-southwest, crosses a bridge over Lagunitas Creek and bends to the east-southeast as it begins to follow the creek. The medium-sized Lagunitas Creek winds from the southeast to the northwest between the forested Bolinas Ridge to the west and mostly grass/pasture-covered unnamed ridge to the east. Just east of the bridge, Sir Francis Drake Boulevard intersects with Platform Bridge Road, which follows Lagunitas Creek downstream toward the northwest. There are houses, barns, and other structures of a small cattle ranch on the northeast corner of the intersection of these roads, and additional houses and structures to the north on the west side of the creek. An older, smaller, decommissioned single-lane bridge with arches runs parallel to the current bridge about 150 feet (45 meters) to the north of the modern bridge. The old route of Sir Francis Drake Highway ran across this older bridge and an approximately 600-foot-long (180-meter-long) section of the old roadway parallels the current highway to the west of the bridge before intersecting with the current road as it heads uphill. Parking is available along the southside of the old roadway and along the west side of Platform Bridge Road.

A large parking lot opens up to the west at the south end of the road. A large one-story, elevated building made of wood is on the left at the southeast edge of the parking lot and contains a visitor center, bookstore, and restrooms. To both the east and west of the parking lot and visitor center complex, the land rises steeply to over 80 feet (25 meters) in height and then plateaus. Coastal grasslands and coastal scrub cover the land. To the south of the parking lot is a sandy beach, beyond which is Drakes Bay. Once on the beach, to the east and west, steep beige sandstone cliffs stretch for some distance in either direction, rising 80 feet (25 meters) or so from the sand. The shoreline to the west arcs to the south for about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) to Chimney Rock, before breaking due west toward the Point Reyes Headlands. To the east, the shoreline gradually starts arcing to the south, stretching past Limantour Beach in the distance.",

    "audioDescription": "Drakes Beach Road descends a steep hill to a large flat area at the mouth of what used to be a coastal stream and a tidal lagoon. A large parking lot opens up to the west at the south end of the road. Spread along the northern end of the parking lot are seven picnic tables and six elevated charcoal grills. Ten-foot-tall willows grow along the northern edge of the picnic sites. A large one-story, elevated building made of wood is on the left at the southeast edge of the parking lot and contains a visitor center, bookstore, and restrooms. To both the east and west of the parking lot and visitor center complex, the land rises steeply to over 80 feet (25 meters) in height and then plateaus. Coastal grasslands and coastal scrub cover the land. To the south of the parking lot is a sandy beach, beyond which is Drakes Bay. On a concrete platform between the visitor center and the beach are two additional picnic tables. Once on the beach, to the east and west, steep beige sandstone cliffs stretch for some distance in either direction, rising 80 feet (25 meters) or so from the sand. The shoreline to the west arcs to the south for about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) to Chimney Rock, before breaking due west toward the Point Reyes Headlands. To the east, the shoreline gradually starts arcing to the south, stretching past Limantour Beach in the distance.",

    "audioDescription": "The Earthquake Trailhead is located at the north end of a large, grassy meadow on the floor of a moderate-sized valley that runs north-northwest to south-southeast between two ridges. The ridge to the west rises about 1000 feet (300 meters) above the valley floor and is covered by a dense, mostly-coniferous forest, the edge of which is about 1100 feet (330 meters) to the west. The ridge to the east is about one mile (1.6 kilometers) away and rises about 400 feet (120 meters) above the valley floor and is mostly covered by cattle-grazed pasturelands. From the Earthquake Trailhead, a four-foot-wide (1.2-meter-wide) asphalt trail leads slightly downhill to the east. Immediately to the southwest of the Earthquake Trailhead is a large gravel parking lot with room for about 210 passenger vehicles. At the northeast corner of this gravel parking lot and just south of the Earthquake Trailhead is a moderate-sized restroom building. To the north of the trailhead is a picnic area filled with tall fir trees. A large, gray, barn-shaped visitor center surrounded by a fenced pasture in which horses may be grazing is located 360 feet (110 meters) to the west across an access road and paved parking lot.",

The first U.S. Life-saving Service station at Point Reyes was built in 1889 along the unprotected Point Reyes Beach to aid ships that were stranded or wrecked along the shores of this peninsula that stretches 10 miles (16 km) into the Pacific Ocean. In 1927, operations were relocated to the new lifeboat station on the more protected Drakes Bay near Chimney Rock. From 1927 to 1968, the Pacific Area U.S. Coast Guard officers and crew members used motorized lifeboats to aid ships. However, during the World Wars, with the militarization efforts of the West Coast, the primary operations of the life-saving station shifted to coastal defense and harbor patrol.</p> <p>In 1968, the property was transferred to the National Park Service and Point Reyes National Seashore, which used the lifeboat station for park housing until it was restored in 1976. As a result of further restoration to the historic district, Point Reyes possesses the only surviving lifeboat station on the Pacific Coast with an intact marine railway.</p> <p>Visit the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/historyculture/stories_maritime_lifeboatstation.htm\">Lifeboat Station History at Point Reyes</a> page for more information.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/parkregulations.htm\">Park Regulations</a></h2> <ul> <li>Vehicles over 24 feet (7.3 meters) in length and vehicles pulling trailers with a combined length in excess of 24 feet (7.3 meters) are prohibited on Chimney Rock Road.</li> <li><strong>Take only pictures; leave only footprints:</strong> Almost everything one finds at Point Reyes is protected by law, including shells, rocks, fossils, flowers, and artifacts.</li> <li>Please only travel on authorized trails, respect posted signs, and practice <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/leavenotrace.htm\">Leave No Trace principles</a> when recreating in the park.</li> <li><strong>Pets</strong> are <u>not</u> permitted on any of the paths, trails, or driveways in the Chimney Rock area.

    "audioDescription": "The historic lifeboat station's boat house is a two-story building measuring about 40 feet by 60 feet (12 meters by 18 meters). It is painted white with green trim on the windows, and a red gabled roof. One of the 40-foot-wide sides faces Drakes Bay to the north-northeast. Drakes Bay is a semicircular body of water stretching about 8 miles (13 kilometers) from west to east and about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) from north to south, opening to the Pacific Ocean to the south. The northwest side of Drakes Bay is line by beige-colored bluffs that rise above sandy beaches. The boathouse is located near the southwest end of Drakes Bay along a narrow peninsula that stretches east from the west end of the much larger Point Reyes Peninsula. Immediately to the south of the lifeboat station and boathouse, grass covered hills rise steeply about 200 feet (60 meters) in elevation, before dropping abruptly into the ocean. A long wooden marine railway, designed to lower a lifeboat into the water, extends into the bay on wooden piers from the north-northeast-facing side of the boathouse. Next to the building is a small area for cars to park, and wooden railings painted white marking the parking area and deck of the building. A small beach edges Drakes Bay on both sides of the building. A one-lane-wide driveway leads steeply up and over a headland to the west-northwest toward a two-story-tall white house, a couple garages, and other out buildings associated with the Lifeboat Station. Coniferous trees surround the buildings, shielding them from wind.",

    "audioDescription": "The Kehoe Beach Trailhead begins on the west side of Pierce Point Road. On the left side of the trail at the trailhead are two vault toilets. The flat, single track, dirt trail borders Kehoe Marsh, which is to the left. Shrubby evergreen coyote brush border the trail on both sides. After 0.6 miles, the trail turns to sand and ascends up and over a sand dune. A pet restriction sign announces that pets are not permitted to the left between Memorial Day and Labor Day. The Point Reyes Headlands rise from the horizon eleven miles to the south at the far end of a sandy beach which is usually subject to large, pounding surf. To the north, sand dunes transition to increasingly taller coastal bluffs and cliffs of the headlands of Tomales Point.",

By 1958, the federal government \"terminated\" the recognition of Coast Miwok people as well as many other tribes.</p> <p>After over 40 years, the Coast Miwok are once again a federally recognized tribe. Legislation was signed in December 2000 granting the <a href=\"https://gratonrancheria.com/\">Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria</a>, formerly known as the Federated Coast Miwok, full rights and privileges afforded federally recognized tribes. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The site of Kule Loklo is in an open grassy field surrounded by Douglas fir to the west, eucalyptus trees to the south, and a grove of coast live oak to the north. The knuckled ridge of Black Mountain is 3 miles (5 kilometers) to the northeast. Several redwood structures are spaced through Kule Loklo. They vary from eight feet to 12 feet tall. The smaller structures are acorn granaries with two or three shelves inside. The larger ones are sleeping structures called kotchas. There is enough room to fit four to eight individuals, sleeping in a circle. A large grinding stone, with three depressions of varying depths for crushing acorns is at the north end of the village. Shade structures are made from willow cuttings. Six cuttings are planted in a rectangle. They are about 16 feet wide and 10 feet in length. The structure is about 12 feet tall. In the spring and summer, the willow branches leaf and provide shade. There are two underground structures in the village. The smaller is a sweat lodge. There is currently no access to this building. The larger is a ceremonial dance house, which currently lacks a roof. Large stones make the circular foundation of the dance house.",

    "audioDescription": "The Observation Deck above the Point Reyes Lighthouse is an approximately 25-foot by 25-foot (7.5 meter by 7.5 meter) concrete platform surrounded by a three-foot-high (0.9-meter-high) chainlink fence near the edge of a 500-foot-high (150-meter-high) rocky promontory that rises out of the Pacific Ocean. It is located at the top of a 3-foot-wide (0.9-meter-wide) concrete stairway that steeply descends 240 feet (73 meters) in elevation to the west along a narrow rocky ridge. At the base of the stairs is the three-story-tall Point Reyes Lighthouse, along with three rectangular building perched on the edge of a 270-foot-high (82-meter-high) cliff. Narrow pathways made of concrete connect these structures. Immediately to the east of the Observation Deck is a rock outcrop that rises about 30 feet (9 meters) above. Along the south edge of the rock outcrop is a narrow concrete path that leads east to the Lighthouse Visitor Center and beyond. Surrounding the human-made structures is largely windswept, mostly barren rock cliffs and steep slopes. Some areas are covered in sparse vegetation. The Pacific Ocean is 500 feet (150 meters) below the Observation Deck and surrounds the peninsula to the north-northeast, to the north, to the west, and to the south and southeast. A single picnic table made of plastic is located on the Observation Deck.",

    "audioDescription": "Limantour Beach is a three-mile-long (five-kilometer-long) sandy beach. To the west of the large gravel parking lot, the low-profile sand dunes of Limantour Spit separate Estero de Limantour to the north from Drakes Bay to the south. Limantour Spit is about two miles (3.2 kilometers) long but only about 500 feet (150 meters) wide. To the west of Limantour Spit, beige-colored bluffs start to rise from the edge of the bay as the shoreline arcs to the southwest toward Chimney Rock, which is 5 miles (8 kilometers) to the the southwest of Limantour Beach. To the southeast, the shoreline is backed by low dunes for a mile or so before giving way to increasingly taller coastal bluffs. To the north and east, the grass and scrub covered land rises to forested ridges. The Limantour Beach Trailhead is to the south of the large gravel parking lot. Moderately tall pine trees grow along the north and west side of the trailhead area. Three vault toilet buildings are located along the northern edge of the trailhead area and two picnic tables are along the southern edge. A wide path leads south across a large footbridge that spans a drainage of the estuary that ebbs and flows along the south side of the trailhead area. This path leads to Limantour Beach and Limantour Spit Trail. In the southwest part of the trailhead area is a small metal sign for the Muddy Hollow Trail. This six-foot-wide path leads a short distance through the trees to the west, skirting along the north and eastern edge of the estuary.",

    "audioDescription": "Marshall Beach is a 400-foot-long (366-meter-long) sandy beach on the west side of Tomales Bay in the northern part of Point Reyes National Seashore. Tomales Bay a narrow ocean inlet that is over 10 miles (16 kilometers) long and averages about one mile wide (1.6 kilometers), stretching from its mouth at the north-northwest end to its head toward the south-southeast. The east side of the bay is lined with many building (mostly residences) of the small community of Marshall. Rising above Marshall to the east is a pasture-covered ridge that runs parallel to the bay. A forested ridge parallels the bay on its west side, with trees descending to the water's edge along most of the western side of the bay. Along the west side of the southern end of the bay are the small communities of Inverness and Inverness Park. The northern end of the western side of the bay is lined with small bluffs and headlands which separate sandy beaches of varying lengths. Marshall Beach is located about halfway between the bay's head and mouth, due west from the community of Marshall. It stretches along the northern end of a small circular cove and is one of the bay's longer beaches.",

    "audioDescription": "A sinuous two-lane paved highway runs northwest to southeast along the floor of a valley. The valley is bounded by a forested ridge to the west and a ridge to the east that is partially covered by trees and otherwise covered by chaparral. Along a tree-lined section of the highway, a section of the shoulder on its west side has been paved, large enough for three parked vehicles. A split-rail fence lines the paved parking area. A brown sign for the Olema Valley Trailhead stands adjacent to a gap in the fence that provides passage onto the trail that leads to the northwest. The Olema Valley Trailhead sign contains icons for no pets, no fires, but camping is allowed by permit only. On the east side of the highway are a number of short wooden posts and some moderate-sized boulders, along with a brown sign for the McCurdy Trailhead. The McCurdy Trailhead sign contains icons for no camping, no fires, but pets are allowed on leash. Further north on the west side of the highway is a large brown sign for Point Reyes National Seashore.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Morgan Horse Ranch was established at Point Reyes National Seashore to raise and train Morgan horses for the National Park Service. Due to their unique physical stature and calm temperament, the Morgan Horse breed made for the perfect patrol partner. The ranch was dedicated in 1970 with the help of the Northern California Morgan Horse Association. At its height, the ranch maintained a herd of approximately 35 to 40 horses. As foals were born, mature animals trained at the ranch were transferred to other parks where they helped rangers patrol both backcountry and urban environments. For many years, classes were also held at the ranch to train park rangers in horsemanship. Though the breeding program was phased out in the late 1990s as more parks started maintaining their own stables, Point Reyes National Seashore still maintains a small herd of working horses. The four horses living at the ranch (as of April 2023) are Honcho, Mira, Knight Hawk, Gentry, and Moon. Together they assist rangers with everything from Search and Rescue to harbor seal counts and the Thule elk census. They also serve as a friendly presence at special events—Honcho and Elvis (who passed on January 1, 2023) even had the distinct honor of riding in the 2016 Rose Bowl Parade to celebrate 100 Years of the National Park Service!</p> <h2>Visiting the Morgan Horse Ranch</h2> <p>If you would like to visit the horses, learn more about this amazing breed and their connection to the National Park Service, the Morgan Horse Ranch is open to the public seven days a week. Rangers or volunteers are typically present from 9 am to 4 pm, during which time you are able to view the exhibits and facilities inside the ranch buildings. Though our horses are always happy to greet visitors, for their safety and yours, please do not enter the corrals or feed the horses at the fence line. The Morgan Horse Ranch is located on a small hill to the southwest of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/visitorcenters.htm\">Bear Valley Visitor Center</a>. To visit, walk up the maintenance road located at the southeastern end of the Bear Valley parking lot. With a disability parking placard or plate, you may drive your vehicle along this maintenance road to a small parking area close to the stables. Exhibit areas are accessible.</p> <p>Learn more about the history of the ranch and Morgan Horses on the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/morgan_horse_ranch.htm\">Morgan Horse Ranch</a> page.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A paved maintenance road leads up to the Morgan Horse Ranch. Wooden fences run along both sides of this driveway. On the right, is a grassy pasture that slopes down towards the Bear Valley Visitor Center. The driveway continues past white office buildings with signs indicating this is the headquarters for the Point Reyes National Seashore Association. Shortly after, on the left there are two parking spaces with signs that indicate they are reserved for disabled persons. In front of these parking spots there is a singled-chain fence, just beyond which there is antique farming equipment resting in a field. From here, an arc of various sized buildings and structures is visible. They are described as follows, beginning from the left-most building and moving clockwise. First is a small one-story red shed building with open doorways on either side—a paved path runs through it. Inside, on either side of the path are tall panels describing the history of the Morgan Horse breed, as well as photos of Morgan Horses and National Park Service rangers. Directly to the right of this building, there is another one-story red wooden shed with a garage-like opening—visible inside is an assortment of historic blacksmithing equipment. When not in use, there is a metal grate pulled across this opening. To the right again, is a covered square arena. There are no walls, but there is a white wooden fence along its border, with tall wooden beams holding up a red roof. Hanging from the roof are two red, white and blue pleated fan flags. Inside the arena, the ground is made up of a deep sandy dirt, rutted with hoof prints. Approximately thirty-feet to the right is the main building of the Morgan Horse Ranch. The main building is a tall, two-story red barn, with white-trimmed windows. A wooden awning sticks out about 10 feet, covering a metal hitching rail and a dirt floor. Attached to the outside of the awning are two wooden, decorative cowboy silhouettes—giving the illusion that they are leaning against the white posts. Above the awning is a hanging wooden sign with engraved white letters reading: \"Point Reyes National Seashore Morgan Horse Ranch.\" The barn door under this awning leads into one of two \"rooms\" inside this main building. It has a sink, and two wooden stalls. The stall doors are approximately five feet tall, and signs indicate that they were once used for pregnant mares and foals, or injured horses. They are currently empty. There are also saddle blankets on display, and two normal doors on either side of the room which are for staff use only. An open doorway on the far side leads to the second room. On either side of the doorway are framed photos with photos of each horse currently living at the ranch. In the next room, on each wall, tack and equipment for horse riding is displayed. There are leather bridles, rope halters, and various kinds of leather saddles. There are also \"pack saddles\" which have leather straps and wooden crossbars. Another open doorway leads down three wooden steps back to the paved driveway. Just across the driveway from this doorway is a another small red building with a white door, and a sign that reads \"Office.\" In front of the office is a thick wooden log on its side, upon which embossed letters read: \"The Point Reyes National Seashore Morgan Horse Farm.\" Elk antlers adorn each side of this sign. Following the paved driveway to the left, is a brownish-red wooden fence line. Behind the fence is a pasture with short grass, and various obstacles. Two wayside signs explain the color and physiology of Morgan Horses, as well as how each of these obstacles are used to train horses. The obstacles are: a bridge, an array of tires, a gate, two logs for jumping and an L-shaped frame on the ground. The fence line leads to a gate. This is the terminus of the area open to visitors. Horses may or may not be visible from this point.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Point Reyes Beach—also known as Great Beach and Ten Mile Beach—is an incredible expanse of undeveloped ocean beach. It stretches over 11-miles (~18-kilometers) from Tomales Point and Kehoe Beach at its north end to the Point Reyes Headlands at its south end. \"North Beach\" (aka Point Reyes Beach North) is actually located close to the mid-point of this long sandy beach. It is named \"North Beach\" because it is the section adjacent to the northernmost parking lot for Point Reyes Beach, e.g., the Point Reyes Beach North parking lot. It is a very short walk from the parking lot down the sand dunes to the beach.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/nature/gray_whales.htm\">Gray whales</a> may be observed from shore during the annual winter (December–January) and spring (March–April) migrations. Search for whale blows on the horizon.</p> <h2>Beach Safety</h2> <p>If you are looking to observe the drama of heavy surf and large waves, this is the place to be. However, <strong>never turn your back to the ocean and stay well away from the water's edge.</strong> Due to the frequently large surf, this is not a beach at which it is safe to play close to the water's edge, much less to go for a swim. Sneakers waves frequently hit unexpecting visitors playing at or taking photographs close to the water's edge, some of whom have then been pulled into the ocean and drowned. The ocean water may be as low as 50°F (10°C). Hypothermia, sneaker waves, and rip currents are just a few beach hazards of which visitors should be aware while visiting Point Reyes Beaches.

It was the largest ranch operation on the Point Reyes peninsula in the late 1800s. Imagine what ranch life was like as you walk through the ranch complex, where interpretive signs describe the history and function of the various buildings. Historic features include the main house, a schoolhouse, a blacksmith shop, barns, dairy houses, and many other structures.</p> <p>Please note: The main house currently serves as a residence for park employees. Please respect the privacy of the residents.</p> <h2>The Best Butter in the Land</h2> <p>Established in 1858, Pierce Ranch excelled in the production of the finest quality of butter, as indicated by Goldberg, Bowen, and Company—a famous San Francisco fine food purveyor—which purchased the entire butter production of Pierce Point Ranch during late 1800s. Pierce Ranch was at the top among the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/historyculture/stories_ranching.htm\">Point Reyes ranches</a> in the quality of its product. In recognition of its importance, it was written up in 1878 and again in 1880 as an outstanding example of a dairy ranch. The Pierce Ranch ceased operations in 1973.</p> <h2>Preserving the Pierce Ranch</h2> <p>Beginning in 1980, the National Park Service invested in the rehabilitation of the ranch core, citing it as the best example of a west Marin dairy ranch from the 1800s. Pierce Ranch is probably the least altered, least modernized, physical complex of ranch buildings in the area. Part of the ranch's main house dates to 1856, making it the oldest surviving ranch house in the Point Reyes region. Pierce Point Ranch was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, and was subsequently opened to the public as an interpretive site.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Pierce Point Ranch is on Tomales Point (aka Pierce Point), a narrow grass- and shrub-covered peninsula at the north end of the Point Reyes peninsula. Tomales Point is about 1.4 miles (2.2 kilometers) wide at Pierce Point Ranch and gets progressively narrower to the north-northeast. To the west is the Pacific Ocean; to the north is Bodega Bay; to the east is one-mile-wide Tomales Bay and grasslands/pasturelands covering the north end of Bolinas Ridge beyond the bay. A hill rises to the south of the Tomales Point Trailhead. Pierce Point Road, a windy two-lane road descends this hill and ends at the dirt parking area at the south end of the ranch. Just before the parking lot, a short, narrow paved road descends to the McClures Beach Trailhead parking lot. To the north of the trailhead parking lot are a complex of historic white ranch buildings and a dairy barn. To the west is a row of mature cypress trees that were planted to serve as a windbreak. There is also a pay phone booth and waste and recycling receptacles. A dirt trail leads west from the parking lot before turning north to pass along the west side of the historic white milking barn on its way to the north end of Tomales Point. Just before the southeast corner of the milking bar, a narrow path branches off of the Tomales Point Trail and passes to the east of the milking barn. Along this path that travels into the center of the ranch buildings are a number of interpretive wayside exhibits with information about some of the buildings and the ranch’s history. At the center of the ranch yard is the old dairy house. Around the perimeter of the ranch yard, starting from the milking barn along the south and moving clockwise are: a calf shed, a blacksmith shop, the west bunkhouse, and an open front shed along the west fence; a schoolhouse, the north bunk house, a wash room, and the main house along the north side of the yard; and a horse barn, a couple chicken houses, a wagon shed, and a small garage to the east. At the northeast corner of the milking barn is the new dairy building.",

    "audioDescription": "Pierce Point Ranch is on Tomales Point (aka Pierce Point), a narrow grass- and shrub-covered peninsula at the north end of the Point Reyes peninsula. Tomales Point is about 1.4 miles (2.2 kilometers) wide at Pierce Point Ranch and gets progressively narrower to the north-northeast. To the west is the Pacific Ocean; to the north is Bodega Bay; to the east is one-mile-wide Tomales Bay and grasslands/pasturelands covering the north end of Bolinas Ridge beyond the bay. A hill rises to the south of the Tomales Point Trailhead. Pierce Point Road, a windy two-lane road descends this hill and ends at the dirt parking area at the south end of the ranch. Just before the parking lot, a short, narrow paved road descends to the McClures Beach Trailhead parking lot. To the north of the trailhead parking lot are a complex of historic white ranch buildings and a dairy barn. To the west is a row of mature cypress trees that were planted to serve as a windbreak. There is also a pay phone booth and waste and recycling receptacles. A dirt trail leads west from the parking lot before turning north to pass along the west side of the historic white milking barn on its way to the north end of Tomales Point. Just before the southeast corner of the milking bar, a narrow path branches off of the Tomales Point Trail and passes to the east of the milking barn. Along this path that travels into the center of the ranch buildings are a number of interpretive wayside exhibits with information about some of the buildings and the ranch’s history. At the center of the ranch yard is the old dairy house. Around the perimeter of the ranch yard, starting from the milking barn along the south and moving clockwise are: a calf shed, a blacksmith shop, the west bunkhouse, and an open front shed along the west fence; a schoolhouse, the north bunk house, a wash room, and the main house along the north side of the yard; and a horse barn, a couple chicken houses, a wagon shed, and a small garage to the east. At the northeast corner of the milking barn is the new dairy building. Three picnic tables are along the north side at the western end of the milking barn and one picnic table is on the east side of the milking barn.",

    "audioDescription": "The Point Reyes Lighthouse is a three-story-tall tower. The exterior of the lower two levels of the cast iron tower is painted white with green trim and the walls are angled inward by about 15 degrees. The top level is more cylindrical in shape and is composed of 48 window panes within 16 columns with white-painted metal frames. The lighthouse is capped by a red low-profile conical metal roof. Doors on the northeast side of both of the lower and the middle allow one to enter the tower. Forty feet (12 meters) to the west and about 20 feet (6 feet) below the historic lighthouse is the modern lighthouse. It is roughly square-shaped and is only one story tall, with a red gabled roof. On top of the roof is a small concrete platform on which sit photovoltaic panels. A three-foot-tall post rises from the platforms east end. A small cylindrical light sits atop the post and serves as the current visual aid to navigation. Thirty feet (9 meters) to the northeast of and ten feet (3 meters) above the historic tower is a larger rectangular building with a red gabled roof that houses fog signal equipment and an office. Sixty-five feet (20 meters) to the east of the historic tower is a smaller shed-like structure made out of concrete. Narrow pathways made of concrete connect these structures and lead east to the base of a 3-foot-wide (0.9-meter-wide) concrete stairway that steeply ascends 240 feet (73 meters) in elevation along a narrow rocky ridge. At the top of the stairway is a concrete observation deck. Surrounding the human-made structures is largely windswept, mostly barren rock cliffs and steep slopes. Some areas are covered in sparse vegetation. The Pacific Ocean is 270 feet (82 meters) below the historic lighthouse tower and surrounds the peninsula to the north-northeast, to the north, to the west, and to the south and southeast.",

    "audioDescription": "A sinuous two-lane paved highway runs northwest to southeast along the floor of a valley. The valley is bounded by a forested ridge to the west and a ridge to the east that is partially covered by trees and otherwise covered by cattle-grazed pasture lands. A barbed-wire fence line runs along the east side of the highway. An old dirt and gravel ranch road branches off of the highway and passes through a 10-foot-wide metal gate mounted between two large cylindrical posts whose tops have been cut diagonally. Beyond the gate is a brown sign for the “Randall Trailhead” with icons indicating pets are permitted on leash, no camping, and no fires. Trash and recycling receptacles are located close to the sign. The shoulders along this stretch of the highway are used for parking by hikers and are barren of vegetation. From the west side of the highway, a trail next to a sign for \"Olema Valley Trailhead\" leads through a dense thicket of willows.",

Leading off from a roadside pull-out, a stairway composed of 54 steps flanked by a wooden fence steeply descends to a flat dirt overlook surrounded by a split rail fence. A nearly vertical cliff that runs from the east to the west drops about 400 feet (120 meters) to the ocean below. Many large boulders line the jagged shoreline below. Sea lions may be lounging on some of the boulders. Twenty miles (32 kilometers to the south, the jagged Farallon Islands rise above the horizon.",

A ten-foot-long metal gate blocks vehicular passage onto the Sky Trail, but there is sufficient room on either side of the gate for pedestrians, bicyclists, and horse riders. From the north corner of the parking lot, the single-track Bayview Trail heads north, paralleling the paved road along its south side as it winds to the north and west along the ridge crest. Trail signage near where the trails depart from the parking lot provide information about what uses (i.e., pet walking, camping, building fires, riding bicycles) are prohibited on which trails, as well as the distances to other trails or points of interest.",

It stretches over 11-miles (~18-kilometers) from Tomales Point and Kehoe Beach at its north end to the Point Reyes Headlands at its south end. The section of this beach referred to as \"South Beach\" gets its name because it is adjacent to the southernmost parking lot for Point Reyes Beach, e.g., the Point Reyes Beach South parking lot, even though it is over 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) north of the south end of the beach.</p> <p>To get onto South Beach, walk to the restroom building at the south end of the parking lot, then follow the sandy pathway located just north of the restroom building that leads toward the beach. Please stay out of the dune restoration area west of the parking lot.</p> <p> </p> <h2>Beach Safety</h2> <p>If you are looking to observe the drama of heavy surf and large waves, this is the place to be. However, <strong>never turn your back to the ocean and stay well away from the water's edge.</strong> Due to the frequently large surf, this is not a beach at which it is safe to play close to the water's edge, much less to go for a swim. Sneakers waves frequently hit unexpecting visitors playing at or taking photographs close to the water's edge, some of whom have then been pulled into the ocean and drowned.

    "audioDescription": "A large, paved parking lot is surrounded by sand dunes to the north, east, and south. The dunes are covered by grass and other low-growing vegetation. A wooden restroom building is located at the south end of the parking lot. A low split-rail fence lines the west edge of the parking lot. Beyond the fence is a steep descent to a long, narrow stretch of sandy beach. More often than not, large waves crash on the beach. Although it is often foggy, when it is clear, the view can extend all the way across the water to the horizon. About 4 miles to the south-southwest, the rocky Point Reyes Headlands rises to a height of 600 feet.",

Tomales Point is about 1.4 miles (2.2 kilometers) wide at the Tomales Point Trailhead and gets progressively narrower to the north-northeast. To the west is the Pacific Ocean; to the north is Bodega Bay; to the east is one-mile-wide Tomales Bay and grasslands/pasturelands covering the north end of Bolinas Ridge beyond the bay. A hill rises to the south of the Tomales Point Trailhead. Pierce Point Road, a windy two-lane road descends this hill and ends at the dirt parking area at the trailhead. Just before the parking lot, a short, narrow paved road descends to the McClures Beach Trailhead parking lot. To the north of the trailhead parking lot are a complex of historic white ranch buildings and a dairy barn. To the west is a row of mature cypress trees that were planted to serve as a windbreak. There is also a pay phone booth. A dirt trail leads west from the parking lot before turning north to pass along the west side of the historic white milking barn on its way to the north end of Tomales Point. The trail passes through low shrubs of coyote bush and lupine. Tule elk regularly graze in the vicinity of the ranch and may be found anywhere within the Tule Elk Reserve.",

    "audioDescription": "Wildcat Beach stretches from northwest to southwest along the southern end of Drakes Bay for about 2.9 miles (4.7 kilometers). About eleven miles (18 kilometers) to the west, the Point Reyes Headlands rise above Drakes Bay. At the north end of the beach, a medium-sized rocky headland, Miller Point, reaches into Drakes Bay. A few guano-covered sea stacks rise above the bay off of Miller Point. Steep, brown-colored bluffs rise all along the length of the beach, limiting safe places to descend onto the beach to the small valley through which Wildcat Creek flows, about two miles (3.2 kilometers) south of Miller Point. On a low, flat area north of Wildcat Creek is Wildcat Campground, a backpacker campground with eight campsites. Near the south end of Wildcat Beach, Alamere Creek cascades over a 40-foot-tall bluff, forming Alamere Falls, which varies in volume through the year. At the far south end of the beach, a 400-foot-tall (130-foot-tall) headland named Double Point rises abruptly above the water. Depending on the tide level and the season, there may be much sand along the entire beach (summer and fall) or very little (winter and spring). At high tides and during the winter and spring, the ocean waves may reach the base of the bluffs.",

Visitors are encouraged to take a photo from these points and follow instructions on the sign to upload it, allowing the public and park scientists to observe change over time.<br /> <br /> The Woodward Fire burned close to 2,000 acres in its first four days due in part to the lack of available firefighting resources, since so many  fires were burning simultaneously across California in the summer of 2020. While the Woodward Fire continued to spread after this initial phase of rapid growth, the remaining 3,000 acres that burned did so more gradually during burn-out operations. </p> <p>A burn-out operation is a method of managing or containing a wildland fire. Rather than focusing all efforts on putting out a blaze, firefighters  strategically plan containment lines in the directions a fire may spread. Firefighters choose lines where they think it will be reasonable to stop the fire, provided there is not a risk to life or property in between.  Lines may be well beyond  the fire’s present boundary, and  can be an existing natural feature like a river or a cliffside, or a man-made feature such as a road or trail–anything where  firefighters can stage resources and the flames cannot reasonably jump over. </p> <p>Once the containment line is in place, firefighters will conduct “back burns”, essentially burning the area between the containment line and the fire’s edge. They will thin out flammable materials and  set up hoses to ensure the back-burn remains controlled and does not get too hot. </p> <p>The Bear Valley Trail and adjacent creek served as a containment line for the Woodward Fire. If you are walking south on the Bear Valley Trail (away from the Visitor Center), almost the entirety of the right-side of the trail makes up the eastern perimeter of the Woodward Fire. The hillside shown in this timelapse was not burned in the initial blaze, but rather was a low-heat back-burn which also resulted in healthy outcomes for many fire-adapted native plant species along this trail.</p>",

Visitors are encouraged to take a photo from these points and follow instructions on the sign to upload it, allowing the public and park scientists to observe change over time.<br /> <br /> When most people think about wildfires, they typically think of forests, not the ocean, but the Pacific Ocean played a vital role in the Woodward Fire! Since the ignition point was so close to the coast, the beach acted as a natural boundary for the fire, and made it impossible for the fire to spread further west. Think of it this way; with the ocean right there, the firefighters only had to worry about three sides to the fire instead of four! </p> <p>While  the beach  may not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of wildland fire, many of California’s coastal ecosystems are adapted to or even dependent on periodic fire! Coyote brush, part of this coastal scrub community, is the predominant species seen at this photomonitoring point, and can withstand low heat fires since it has evolved with fire-retardant compounds in its leaves. Coyote brush actually thrives in distrubed areas like a post-burn site,  since its small wind-borne seeds can land and germinate on the newly bare soil. This prolific shrub will even help protect and provide shade for other species attempting to root in its environment. That said, coyote brush is not very tolerant of that shade itself, and if an area is left unburned long enough for a tree canopy to form, it will slowly be replaced. </p>",

Visitors are encouraged to take a photo from these points and follow instructions on the sign to upload it, allowing the public and park scientists to observe change over time.<br /> <br /> Wildland fires are often named after a landmark near its origin point. The Woodward Fire was named after the Woodward Valley, seen from this photo monitoring point, and not far from where the fire originated. While much of the Woodward Fire burned with low or moderate heat, there were several tracts such as this that did burn severely and will take longer to recover. </p> <p>When a fire burns with high heat, it can burn the soil as well as the overlying vegetation. Scorched soil may become hydrophobic, forming a crust that  repels water, making it harder for new plants to root and more subject to erosion. Fires that burn with high heat don’t leave behind as much organic matter, and it will take longer for these areas to rebuild a nutrient rich soil that is ideal for new life. <br /> <br /> Many factors lead to  a fire’s heat intensity on any given day, and several of those factors are visible at this location. This area had not burned in many years, meaning it had a lot of woody fuels ready for the fire to consume. Fires like to climb uphill, and the steepness of the slopes in the Woodward Valley made it very susceptible to a hot, fast moving fire. This same steepness and density of the brush also made it hard to access for firefighters. Additionally gusty winds, common in Point Reyes, helped breathe oxygen into the fire and made it spread faster during its first few days. <br /> <br /> Since the vast majority of the Woodward Fire burned at a low severity, it stands in stark contrast to many of the destructive fires that have occurred across California in the last decade. Less frequent burns due to many years of fire suppression, and hotter, drier, longer summers driven by climate change, means that this trend will likely continue. Hopefully watching how this tract of land recovers over the next several years will help us understand how these ecosystems might be able to bounce back.</p>",

Most of the Woodward Fire burned within the 33,373 acres of designated Wilderness within Point Reyes National Seashore. The Phillip Burton Wilderness was designated in 1976, to provide an extra layer of protection for the most remote areas of the seashore, to forever preserve its wild characteristics. </p> <p>For many years, managers for public lands such as National Parks, National Forests and designated Wilderness Areas chose to suppress all wildland fires, fearing their destructive capacity and looking only at the losses rather than the gains. Left unburned for decades, many areas of California are now subject to extremely hot, fast-spreading fires that devastate natural and man-made environments, rather than the more frequent, low-heat fires that occurred regularly before Western settlement, and which were often set intentionally as part of indigenous land management practices to promote a healthy environment. </p> <p><br /> Thanks to years of research and wisdom shared by  California’s many indigenous peoples, public lands agencies now attempt to manage fires in a similar  way that is best for the ecosystem. While many Wilderness areas across the country choose not to suppress naturally (lightning) ignited fires, due to their many benefits, the Fire Management plan in Point Reyes states that all fires must be managed and controlled because of the Seashore’s relative proximity to nearby communities. It took a lot of work and many resources to control the blaze, but the outcomes of the Woodward Fire were largely positive! According to a <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7hg7j88v\"><u>report by National Park employees</u></a>, “The Woodward Fire burned with mixed severity across a matrix of coastal habitat types that have seldom burned in recent decades but are largely fire tolerant or fire adapted. The result of the return of fire as an ecological process to the Point Reyes landscape could be a mosaic of vegetation communities more heterogenous, resilient, and diverse than before.” </p>",

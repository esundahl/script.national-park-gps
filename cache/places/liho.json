    "bodyText": "<p>Abraham Lincoln came of age while living and working as a private citizen in Springfield, Illinois. It was here that he chose to settle down, build a life for himself and his family, and worked hard to achieve success. At the same time, many of Lincoln's social and political beliefs were formed while he lived in this house at Eighth and Jackson Streets.<br /> <br /> The house that would become the future Lincoln Home was built in 1839 for the Reverend Charles Dresser. Dresser actually married Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd in 1842. When the house was completed, the house stood one-and-a-half stories tall with five rooms, including a sleeping loft.<br /> <br /> In May 1844, the Lincolns purchased the Dresser home and lot for $1500. Abraham, Mary, and Robert, born August 1, 1843, moved into the comfortable home. During the 17 years the Lincolns lived in this home, three of the Lincoln children were born--Edward \"Eddie\" Lincoln in 1846, William \"Willie\" Lincoln in 1850, and Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln in 1853. Eddie sadly died in the Lincoln Home of \"consumption\" when he was nearly 4 years old.<br /> <br /> The Lincolns continued to live in the house until departing for the White House in February 1861. Although they had planned to return, the Lincolns never came back to live in their house on the corner of Eighth and Jackson Streets. Today, the restored house reflects the Lincoln Home of 1860.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>The inside of the Lincoln Home is only accessible to the public by taking a guided tour of the Lincoln Home. Tickets for the guided tour are free of charge and can be obtained at the Visitor Center located one block west of the Lincoln Home, at 426 South 7th Street. </strong></em></p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Lincoln Home is a 2-story Greek-Revival style wooden house, painted a tan color known as Quaker Brown, with dark forest-green shutters. The house is viewed from its southwest corner. The west face has a wooden front door in center, with two windows on each side. There are five windows on the second floor on the west face. The south face has three windows on the first floor, and four on the second floor, with the southeast corner of the house approximately five feet shorter less wide than the main part of the house, giving space for a narrow, covered porch in the southeast corner first floor. The roof of the porch has an elaborate metal railing. There are two chimneys visible on the sloped roof on the main part of the house. Surrounding the house is a tan wooden fence with a gate. The entire property is elevated on a brick retaining wall, with steps leading up to the front door. The sidewalk in front of the house is redbrick.",

There, he raised his family and pursued his passion for law and politics. The heritage area also highlights the people and the stories that shaped him to lead our nation through issues of unity, equality and race relations, and democratic ideals. It is home to Lincoln’s infamous 1858 Illinois State Senate debates with incumbent Senator Stephen A. Douglas, where they squared off in seven communities. Known as the “Land of Lincoln,” each community in the heritage area region has its own Lincoln story to tell in the form of artifacts, folklore, screenscapes, buildings, and living landscapes. Together, they bring an immediacy and tangible quality to the powerful Lincoln legacy. <br /> <br /> Looking for Lincoln? You’ll find him here! His stories come to life through the heritage areas’ living history programs. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{241b52fe-ba93-49b7-91be-0ce88c0edad3}{54}\" paraid=\"16\">Historic Sites and Points of Interest: </h2> <ol role=\"list\" start=\"1\"> <li

    "audioDescription": "A Lot of Activism in the Neighborhood In the empty lot before you once stood two small houses. The 1850 census tells us two families lived here. The Jenkins and the Blanks shared walls and a common goal: to improve the lives of African Americans. Both families became advocates for freedom through their activism. James and Martha Ann Blanks, free people of color, arrived in Springfield in the 1840’s. James became a champion for African American education. In the 1850’s, he helped organize a school fundraiser and joined a group of African Americans who believed education was “the only sure way to redeem ourselves from the bondage that we are now in.” The Jenkins family arrived in Springfield sometime in 1844. Jameson Jenkins filed his Certificate of Freedom with the Sangamon County Recorder of Deeds on March 28, 1846 to prove he was free. Jenkins was a drayman or wagon driver who transported goods. His occupation was a perfect job for someone who was also a conductor on the Underground Railroad. On January 16, 1850, Jenkins successfully transported escaped slaves north to Bloomington, Illinois. Image (left): Sepia document with handwritten text. In upper left corner, the name “Jameson Jenkins” can be read. Caption: This document is a scan of the transcription of Jameson Jenkins’ Certificate of Freedom as it was entered into the Sangamon Country Recorder of Deeds book. Image Credit: Illinois Regional Archives Depository. Image (lower left): Photo of white obelisk-shaped monument on gray stone/concrete base, maybe 7 ft. Tall. Chiseled into monument is name “J. Jenkins.” Caption: Jameson Jenkins was born in North Carolina in 1810 and died in 1873. Martha Ann Pelham Blanks was sister to Jameson’s wife Elizabeth. Most of the Jenkins and Blanks family, including James Blanks, are buried in Springfield’s Oak Ridge Cemetery. In 2012, multiple community organizations came together to restore the Jenkins monument. Image Credit: National Park Service Traces of Activism Excavations at the Jenkins Lot in 2013 (photo, left) revealed this ceramic fragment from a children’s mug with the words “Reward of Merit” printed on it (fragment with artist rendering of cup, right). This term was commonly used in the 19th century to describe paper certificates or objects given to children for achievement in school. The Jenkins Lot is part of the National Park Service National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Images (lower right): On left, photograph of archaeologist in jeans, short sleeve shirt, and wide-brimmed hat standing in large geometric-shaped hole/pit cut out of ground. Tarps, shovel, and other tools are scattered around and inside the pit. On right, monochrome drawing of a ceramic cup with printed text “Reward of Merit,” surrounded by flowery design pattern. Photograph of off-white triangular shard of original cup is superimposed on drawing, with text “of RIT” and part of golden flowery border visible. Logo (bottom right corner): golden star with silhouette of side profile of a person’s head with a small white star by tip of person’s nose, with text “National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom.”",

    "audioDescription": "A Place to Call Home You are standing in front of the house Abraham Lincoln and his family called home from 1844 to 1861. Take a closer look and you will find a plaque in the front door with Lincoln’s name on it. Seven years after he rode into Springfield on a borrowed horse with all his belongings in two saddlebags, Lincoln bought a small cottage that would grow right along with him and his family until it became a full two story house. This would be the first and only home he ever owned. The Lincolns lived for seventeen years in this house. Lincoln’s sons Eddie, Willie, and Tad were born in this house. Here Abraham and Mary Lincoln’s friends and neighbors gathered for Eddie’s funeral in 1850. A familiar sight would have been Lincoln closing his front door behind him as he walked to his law office. From this home, Lincoln’s first-born son Robert left for college in 1859. In February 1861, Lincoln closed the front door one last time, as he left his home in Springfield, Illinois for Washington D.C. as president-elect of the United States. Ahead was the task to govern a nation divided by slavery, and to preserve a government, as he later said, “whose leading object is, to elevate the condition of men – to lift artificial weights from all shoulders – to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all – to afford all, an unfettered start, and a fair chance, in the race of life.” Lincoln’s life in Springfield was the embodiment of that belief, the ideal that in a free society everyone should have a fair chance. Image (left): Black and white photo of Lincoln Home with view from southwest corner. Lincoln Home is a two-story Greek Revival style house. Two chimneys are visible on roof. Front door is in center of west face, flanked by two windows on either side and five windows on second floor. On south face, four windows are visible on second floor and three on first floor. Southeast corner occupied by covered porch, with railing on porch roof. House is surrounded by wooden fence and whole property is on raised brick retaining wall. Abraham Lincoln and child standing behind the fence in southwest corner of home. Caption: This picture was taken in 1860. Abraham Lincoln and his third son, Willie, are seen standing behind the fence. Tad, the youngest son, is hiding behind the fencepost. Image Credit: National Park Service. Timeline (bottom): 1839 The house was a one-and-a-half story cottage constructed for Reverend Charles Dresser; 1844 The Lincoln family (Abraham, Mary, and Robert) moved into the home; 1855-1856 The home was raised to two full stories. The bedroom was moved to the upstairs portion of the home, allowing for the creation of the rear parlor. The iron railing was added to the second-floor porch and a wall was put in place to separate the kitchen and dining room; 1861 The Lincoln family moved to Washington, D.C. Lucian Tilton, a railroad executive, and his wife became tenants of the Lincoln Home; 1887 The Lincoln Home was deeded to the State of Illinois by Robert Lincoln; 1972 The Lincoln Home officially became a National Historic Site.",

Although not as well known as the 16th president of the United States, Rosenwald had an enormous impact on this nation as president of Sears, Roebuck & Company and as one of the most generous and signifacant philanthropists of his time and arguably the nation's history, particularly playing a large role in supporting African American education in the rural south after the Civil war.

    "audioDescription": "Boyhood Home of Julius Rosenwald Noted businessman and philanthropist Julius Rosenwald (1862 – 1932) lived in this house as a boy between 1869 and 1879. The son of German Jewish immigrants, he left Springfield without completing high school to learn the clothing trade. In 1895, Rosenwald became a partner in Sears, Roebuck & Co., bringing managerial skill that made it into a retailing powerhouse and him a very wealthy man. A visionary philanthropist, Rosenwald contributed to a variety of charitable causes. In 1917 he established “The Rosenwald Fund” to help African Americans in the south where segregation and racism severely limited access to education and other opportunities. Under the initial guidance of educator Booker T. Washington, Rosenwald helped rural African American communities in the south build what came to called “Rosenwald Schools.” By 1932, 600,000 African American children benefited from the more than five thousand Rosenwald schools and related facilities located throughout fifteen southern states. Between 1928 and 1948, the Rosenwald Fund provided financial assistance to hundreds of primarily African American artists, writers, musicians, and scholars who could not otherwise afford to pursue their endeavors. Famous recipients include author W. E. B. Dubois, poet Langston Hughes, Doctor Charles Drew and opera singer Marian Anderson. Julius Rosenwald, and the people in whom he invested, made a powerful contribution to our country. This house was named the “Rosenwald House” in Public Law 116-336, “Julius Rosenwald and the Rosenwald Schools Act of 2020,” January 13, 2021.

    "audioDescription": "Day with the Lincolns The Lincolns were a family with the same hopes and challenges as many others in the neighborhood. The Lincolns lived a middle-class family lifestyle in nineteenth century Springfield. Abraham Lincoln spent long periods away from home on the Eighth Judicial Circuit. For Mary, that meant running a household on her own. On days when the whole family was at home, one could see movement from all windows of the house. Straight ahead is the kitchen window. Mary and the hired girl would have been cooking a delicious meal, maybe for Willie’s ninth birthday party. Look up! Willie and Tad might have been running on the second-floor hallway. It wasn’t uncommon to see Abraham Lincoln smiling and telling stories while walking down the sidewalk with one of his sons on his shoulders or holding on to his coattails. A neighbor, who lived to the east of the Lincolns, commented that “Lincoln would take his children and would walk out on the rail way out in the country—would talk to them—Explain things carefully—particularly.” Years later, Mary described her husband saying “It is my pleasure that my children are free, happy and unrestrained by parental tyranny. Love is the chain whereby to bind a child to its parents.” Image: Black and white photograph of face of 2 story house facing the backyard. Wooden boardwalk runs through yard and is shaped like a “Y” with 2 branches of the boardwalk splitting towards house. Left path goes to covered back porch, on left corner of house. Right path leads to another covered porch area set into the middle backside of house. Small window is in wall between porches and two windows are visible on second floor. Drainage pipes from roof run down sides of house then converge over first floor window to single pipe running downwards. Mature apple tree in yard on left.

    "audioDescription": "In Abraham Lincoln’s time, many residents of Springfield came from someplace else, whether a state or an ocean away. Southerners, northerners, and European immigrants came here to improve their lot in life, such as Lincoln had in 1837. Springfield’s African American immigrants included both freemen who owned their own homes and businesses, such as Lincoln’s neighbor Jameson Jenkins, and indentured servants who lived with their white employers. On Lincoln’s own street, occupations ranged from an elected state official to washerwomen; income levels varied widely; and houses ranged in size from modest dwellings to spacious two-story houses, such as the Lincoln Home. Image (top left): Aerial street map of Springfield, Illinois labeled “City of Springfield, Sangamon County: Springfield’s Diversity in 1860.” Blue dots indicated African-American residences, orange dots indicate households where African-American servants live with White employers, green dots indicate Irish immigrant residences, yellow dots indicate German immigrant residences, and red dots indicate Portuguese immigrant residences. Yellow dots are most numerous and orange dots the least. Red dots mainly located in northeast corner, green dots in east and northeast, and blue in the north. Caption: According to the 1860 Census, Springfield’s resident included Irish, German, Portuguese, and African Americans. Image (center): Scanned document of a page of 1860 Census for Springfield. Census table includes columns for name, age, sex, color, occupation, value of personal estate, place of birth, marriage status, and more. Places of birth include Illinois, Kentucky, Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Ohio, New York, and others. Image (bottom right): Aerial street map of Springfield, Illinois labeled “City of Springfield, Sangamon County: A Border City in 1860.” Blue dots indicate households from Northern states and red dots indicate households from southern states. No particular trends, though there may be slightly more northern households. Caption: By the time Lincoln left Springfield in 1861, Illinois typified a border state, with a slave-holding past, a desire to preserve the Union, and a mixed population of both northerners and southerners.",

    "audioDescription": "Lincoln understood the Important of making his image available for the presidential campaign. Springfield photographer Preston Butler captured several likenesses of Lincoln during the 1860 election. Image (far left): Black and white chest-up portrait photograph of clean-shaven Abraham Lincoln in black jacket, white shirt, and black bowtie. Arms are crossed. His face is thin with high, sunken cheekbones. Caption: Ambrotype of Abraham Lincoln, 1860, by Preston Butler. The portrait painter who commissioned this image of Lincoln later wrote: “There are so many hard lines on his face, that it becomes a mask to the inner man. His true character only shines out when in an animated conversation, or when telling an amusing tale.” Image (left): Scan of excerpt from Illinois State Journal, dated May 24, 1860. Excerpt reads: “Photographs of the Next President—P. Butler of this city, has a number of photograph likenesses of Hon. Abraham Lincoln. He will sell them for one dollar each. Persons at distance will have to send a one cent stamp (in addition to the price for the likeness) for every photograph ordered. Image (center top): Black and white photograph of Lincoln Home from southwest corner. Lincoln Home is two-story wooden Greek-Revival style home with two visible chimneys. Front door is on western face, with two windows on each side of door. Five windows are on second floor western face. Southern face has four windows visible on second floor and three on first. Southeastern corner is occupied by covered porch, with railing on porch roof. Property is on raised hill, with brick retaining wall in front. Streets are muddy. Lincoln and his son are seen standing behind fence surrounding front yard. Another man, child, and blurry smudge stand at corner of boardwalk at house corner. Caption: Lincoln Home, by John Adams Whipple, 1860. Young Isaac Diller, whose blurred figure appears on the street corner, later recalled the moment when he posed with Lincoln, Willie, and Tad: “I ran across the street from my aunt’s house to get in a free picture with the Lincolns, but I turned my head at the wrong moment to look at a farm wagon. Only the stripes on my socks and boots showed up.” Image (center bottom): Young boy with slicked hair in dark coat, striped pants, and holding a dark felt hat. Caption: Isaac Diller, 1860. Image (far right): Black and white photograph of Lincoln Home with huge crowd of people and horses crammed and standing in on steps of, in yard, and on street in front of Lincoln Home. On street is also parade cart of women wearing white. Behind cart someone holds sign saying “Won’t You Let Me In Kansas.” Lincoln is visible wearing white and standing right of front door. Caption: Republican Rally, by William Shaw, 1860. Lincoln offered the use of his own basement to serve as the darkroom for the development of this photograph. Isaac Diller, the young neighbor and playmate of the Lincoln Boys, later recalled that he ‘witnessed this parade...and all day wore a blue ribbon with a picture of Abraham Lincoln pasted on it.’”",

    "audioDescription": "“My Hand will Never be Given where my Heart is Not.” --Mary Todd to Mercy Levering, 1841 Mary Ann Todd was born on December 13, 1818 to a large and wealthy family from Lexington, Kentucky. Mary was six years old when her mother died. Her grandmother helped raise her and made sure she received several years of schooling, which she completed when she was about 20. Mary Todd was a charming and popular young lady. She enjoyed talking about politics and literature and she could speak and read French fluently. Abraham Lincoln was quickly attracted to her intelligence and elegance. They married and purchased their home in 1844 where they held many gatherings that increased Mr. Lincoln’s reputation for his political career. With Mr. Lincoln often away on business, Mary took charge of the home and family. When Mr. Lincoln became the Republican presidential nominee, Mary and her home became the center of national attention. One Republican official commented that “I shall be proud, as an American citizen, when the day brings her to grace the White House.” Image (right): Black and white photo of young woman. Her dark hair is pinned back with ringlets in the back. She is wearing a dark long-sleeved dress with lace on the bodice and collar. A broach with a drawing on a woman is at the close neckline.

Caption: In 1839, Mary moved to Springfield to live with her oldest sister, Elizabeth Edwards, in this house. Mary and Abraham Lincoln may have met at one of the many parties held at the Edwards home. They were married here on November 4, 1842. In her later years, Mary faced health issues and eventually returned to this home, where she died on July 16, 1882. Image Credit: National Park Service.

On August 8, 1860, an exuberant political rally parage passed by the Lincoln home, including 180 train cars of Lincoln supporters, 28 oxen pulling a mammoth wagon, 21 Wide Awake Clubs (groups of young pro-Lincoln men), 10 decorated caravans of ladies, 1 full rigged schooner with sailors, and 1 huge wagon, pulled by 6 horses, with power loom manufacturing jean cloth. On this day of fireworks, floats, and thousands of on-lookers, Lincoln asked supporters to “kindly let me be silent.” Throughout the election, Lincoln’s Democratic rival, Stephen A. Douglas, actively campaigned, while Lincoln followed tradition and let others represent him, including friend and neighbor, Jesse Dubois. A Good Neighbor, Friend, and Supporter Jesse K. Dubois served with Lincoln in the Illinois House of Representatives, welcomed Lincoln’s help in his 1856 bid for state auditor, and often campaigned for Lincoln in return. While working for Lincoln’s senate campaign in 1854, he voiced the thought others may have shared--“I am for you against the world.” Dubois served as a pallbearer at Lincoln’s funeral in 1865.

It was not an easy journey for the man who grew up in a humble log cabin to end up in the White House, but it is a journey that has come to represent the American Dream--that any American should have the opportunity to improve their lot in life as long as they put in the effort. <br /> <br /> On this wayside, trace Lincoln's life's journey from Kentucky to Illinois, and his inaugural journey from Illinois to Washington D.C. on the wayside map--both important routes on his \"Long Road to Washington.\"<br /> . <br /> Audio description of wayside (including text and images) is available through this application with a screenreader.",
    "audioDescription": "The Long Road to Washington In fifty-one years of life Abraham Lincoln had lived in three different states. He worked many different jobs including store clerk, store owner, postmaster, militia captain, surveyor, lawyer, and politician. He lived in a one room log cabin, the back room of a store, inns, taverns, and finally the house before you. Abraham Lincoln enjoyed victories and suffered losses. He persevered in an educated world despite never having been to college, and only possessed less than one year of formal education. Despite adversity he never stopped working towards bettering himself and achieving his goals. He believed that every American had the right to this. On March 6, 1860 he stated “When one starts poor, as most do in the race of life, free society is such that he knows he can better his condition. I want every man to have that chance—and I believe a black man is entitled to it—in which he can better his condition.” On February 11, 1861 Abraham Lincoln began his journey to the nation’s capital to lead a nation on the verge of civil war. A war over who could experience the same kind of road that Lincoln traveled. Should African Americans have the same chance in the race of life? On the way to Washington, Lincoln stopped at Independence Hall in Philadelphia to see where the nation’s road began. There he said “I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence. It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance.” Image (center): Sepia map of northeastern area of the United States.

    "audioDescription": "The People Lincoln Knew “To this place and the kindness of these people, I owe everything” --Abraham Lincoln The Lincoln neighborhood was a lively place with people of different ages, ethnicities, and religious beliefs. Like Lincoln, many people came to Springfield hoping to improve their lives. Lincoln formed a deep relationship with many of the people here. Ultimately, they helped Abraham Lincoln become the person we know today. Just down the street lived Jameson Jenkins, a free African American. On the day Lincoln left to start the presidency, Jenkins gave Lincoln a ride to the Great Western Depot train station. A few houses away, lived Mrs. Sprigg, one of Mary Lincoln’s closest friends. She was from Germany and her daughter sometimes looked after the Lincoln boys. On the street, you might find Abraham Lincoln playing with local children such as Lizzie Decrastos. Lizzie was the daughter of one of the Lincolns’ Portuguese hired girls. Lincoln would often give her piggyback rides to school. Faces from Many Places Inside the Lincoln Home Several of the Lincolns’ hired help were also African American or came from overseas. Of the hired girls the Lincolns employed, at least three were Irish, three were Portuguese, and six were African American.

    "audioDescription": "On May 1, 1844 Abraham, Mary, and nine-month-old Robert Lincoln moved to this newly developed area on the eastern edge of Springfield into a little house on the corner of Eighth and Jackson streets. It would become a vibrant, diverse, middle class neighborhood. This community was home to immigrants from Ireland; England; Germany; France; and the Madeira Islands, Portugal; as well as free African Americans and families from over ten different states. Each was looking to build their life here on the western frontier prairie. People had a variety of jobs including farmer, fireman, druggist, storekeeper, politician, photographer, and a future president. As you walk through the historic neighborhood, use your imagination to fill the now empty lots with houses that are no longer there. Hear the many dialects, languages, and accents as the neighbors would converse. Smell the variety of ethnic foods that would be cooking, wafting out of the open windows. Imagine the sounds of the songs and music coming from the parlors of the homes. See the never-ending comings and goings of the members of this vibrant and diverse community going about their daily business. As you walk in the footsteps of these long-gone people, you can feel a sense of wonder as you experience what Abraham Lincoln and so many others did many years ago.

Lincoln Home is two-story Greek Revival style home in a yellow-tan color with dark green shutters and two brick chimneys visible. West face has front door in center flanked by 2 windows on each side with 5 windows on second floor. South face has three windows on each floor that are visible, with a covered porch in house’s southeast corner. Porch roof has elaborate railing. Streets are mud/dirt with wood plank curbs and wooden ramps connecting street to boardwalks. Individuals in 1860s clothing are on the street and boardwalk, including a horse-drawn buggy.

    "bodyText": "<p>Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois, was established in 1971 by Public Law 92-128 (85 Stat. 347). Lincoln Home National Historic Site protects and interprets the home where Abraham Lincoln lived with his family from 1844 to 1861.<br /> <br /> Lincoln Home National Historic Site preserves 14 houses that date from the Lincoln era, including the Lincoln Home. The Lincoln Home neighborhood was diverse, representing many occupations and social and economic levels. Through neighborhood preservation and interpretive activities, the National Park Service seeks to recreate a vivid sense of the relationship of the Lincoln family to their neighbors and the broader Springfield community, enriching the experience of visitors at Lincoln Home National Historic Site.<br /> <br /> From 1834 to 1842, Lincoln represented Sangamon County in the Illinois General Assembly and helped move the capital from Vandalia to Springfield. Lincoln and Mary Todd married in 1842 and in their first year together, the Lincolns lived in a hotel boarding house, the Globe Tavern. In 1844, Lincoln bought the home on the corner of Eighth and Jackson Streets for $1,200 cash and a small lot worth $300. The young family, which now included Robert, born in 1843, lived on a tight budget. Lincoln himself chopped the wood, carried the water, and milked the cow.<br /> <br /> When the family moved to Washington, DC, for Lincoln's presidency, the home was rented rather than sold and their best furniture placed in storage for their eventual return. But on April 15, 1865, an assassin’s bullet took the life of President Lincoln. His home became the focus for mourners and the photographers who recorded these early visitors. Mary Lincoln faced a lonely future and wrote that she “could not bear to return to the scenes of the happiest times in my life without my family.”<br /> <br /> By the late 19th century, Lincoln’s home became a popular scene for rallies, ceremonies, and celebrations. The Lincoln Home remained rental property until Lincoln’s son, Robert, donated the home to the State of Illinois in 1887 to be protected and preserved for future generations. Robert Lincoln did so with the condition that the home remain well maintained and available to the public free of charge.<br /> <br /> The home was designated a national historic landmark in 1960, and it remained the property of the State of Illinois until 1972, when it was transferred to the National Park Service. Property within the national historic site boundary was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a district in 1976. The national register district boundaries encompass a smaller area contained completely within the boundary of Lincoln Home National Historic Site.<br /> <br /> As Lincoln’s reputation grew, his home became a powerful political symbol. Even today, presidents and presidential hopefuls make well-publicized pilgrimages to the home. There are a variety of visitor activities available at Lincoln Home National Historic Site, including exhibits, a park film, and guided tours of the Lincoln Home.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Lincoln Home National Historic Site is a 12-acre, 4-square block area, bordered by Capitol Avenue to the north, Edwards Street to the South, 7th Street to the West, and 9th Street to the East. 8th Street runs north-south and Jackson Street runs east-west through the middle of the site. The Lincoln Home is located at the northeast corner of the intersection of 8th and Jackson Streets. The Visitor Center is located on 7th Street, just north of the intersection of 7th Street and Jackson Street. The Visitor Parking Lot is located south of the visitor center, also along 7th street. Overall, 37 buildings are located within the site's boundaries, with most of them being along 8th street. 14 of these buildings are historic houses that date to the Lincoln era. In addition to buildings, there are also several empty lots located alongside 8th street in between buildings where historic houses once stood during Lincoln's time. Along 8th street are several outdoor wayside exhibit signs with interpretive information. In addition to the Visitor Center and Lincoln Home, the Dean House and the Arnold House are accessible to the public. The Dean House is a two-story dark brown house with green shutters, located north-west of the Lincoln Home and east of the Visitor Center, along 8th street.

Their son Julius was born one year later. The family quickly became involved in their community, and by 1867 Samuel Rosenwald served as president of their congregation B’rith Sholom.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{1c1b7e96-0403-410c-8f18-cc4f965d5779}{254}\" paraid=\"1040108337\">As an adult, Julius Rosenwald would go on to invest in Sears and Roebuck company, and quickly rose through the organization becoming president in 1908. With what he said was more money than he could ever spend, Rosenwald focused on philanthropy donating more than 60 million dollars in his lifetime.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{05493851-0f8b-456f-b7fd-397f802aa271}{23}\" paraid=\"1901161082\">Much of this philanthropy was to support the African American community through a variety of initiatives including YMCAs for African Americans, fellowships, and schools. One of his most impactful initiatives were <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-rosenwald-schools-progressive-era-philanthropy-in-the-segregated-south-teaching-with-historic-places.htm\">\"Rosenwald Schools\".</a> These schools were funded partly through Rosenwald but also required local community support. From 1917 to 1932 more than 5,000 Rosenwald schools were built across 15 states. By the time the last school was built more than 600,000 African American students had attended a Rosenwald school. <br /> <br /> Today the house is owned and operated by the National Park Service. </p>",

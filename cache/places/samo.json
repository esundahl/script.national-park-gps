At the same time, it offers a rare unspoiled view of California’s rich cultural and historic resources, including some structures designed for razor magnate King C. Gillette in the 1920’s by Wallace Neff, architect of California’s Golden Age.<br /> <br /> The broad meadows and low ridgelines serve as a wildlife corridor in the geographic center of the Santa Monica Mountains range. Several sensitive species are present. Raptors and other birds forage and nest among the plant communities of valley and coast live oak savannah, grassland, coastal sage scrub, chaparral, riparian woodland, and southern willow riparian vegetation. Park features include Gillette’s historic Spanish Colonial Revival style mansion and other structures that were part of the original landscape plan. These include a long tree-lined alleé and grand entry, a large constructed pond, a formal courtyard and terrace, bridges,and lawns.<br /> <br /> A short, somewhat steep hike leads to a knoll, known as Inspiration Point, with 360-degree views—including the famous rock formations of Malibu Creek State Park. Public interpretive programs, including weekly campfires in the summer, are offered by park staff.

    "bodyText": "With the rise of vertically integrated movie studios in late 1920s Hollywood, many motion picture companies sought out proprietary parcels of land to film outdoor scenes. Until this time, most studios either spent large sums to rent properties, or filmed outside gurerrilla-style, obtaining no rights or permits. The mild Southern California climate lent itself to year-round outdoor filming, and the large areas of undeveloped land around Los Angeles led movie studios to seek outdoor lots in their own backyards. With the boom in popularity of the western genre, studio backlots were unable to provide the wide-open undeveloped spaces in which to film. His-torical epics and battle scenes also required spacious outdoor locations to film. <br /> <br /> Paramount Studios was one of the predominant motion picture studios from the mid-1920s into the 1940s. Following popular convention, Paramount produced films and quickly and efficiently as possible, and a total of 162 movies were filmed at Paramount Ranch between 1927 and 1943, when Paramount Pictures sold the prop-erty. <br /> <br /> Many motion picture companies quickly sought to develop their own Southern California movie ranches, the earliest in 1912; with the heyday ending in the 1950s. Not all movie ranches were equal, but “Paramount built an extensive infrastructure - including a headquarters area, furnished with water, electricity, telephone, and sewage system - and a production facility, complete with set construction and prop storage buildings, a live-stock barn and corrals, that created a production-oriented facility at the ranch that was an important counter-part to Paramount’s central production studio in Hollywood.”<br /> <br /> However, it was the diversity of the landscape that made the Santa Monica Mountains an ideal backdrop for the film industry. Paramount Ranch’s variety of scenic qualities, landscapes, plant communities, and natural fea-tures offered a myriad of scenery available to represent outdoor landscapes nearly anywhere in the world<br /> <br /> Paramount Pictures sold the property in 1943, but continued filming at the ranch for several more years. Sev-eral long-standing sets were removed at this time, and a new era of recreation and television filming began. In 1953, Paramount Ranch was sold to William Hertz, who constructed a fictional “Western Town” at the location it stands today. <br /> <br /> Paramount Ranch was sold again in 1955, and renamed Paramount Sportsman’s Ranch. A track for car racing was built in 1956, and though abandoned only two years later due to high driver fatality, remnants from the racetrack exist today and remain an integral part of the current landscape. A summer camp for boys, Camp Longhorn, constructed a swimming pool, basketball court, and cabins southwest of the current Western Town in 1958. Other areas on Paramount Ranch include the North Gate Area, Marco Polo set, Salem Town Set, Macienda Set, German Street Set<br /> <br /> The National Park Service acquired Paramount Ranch in 1980, along with several parcels to the east of Cornell Road to protect the historic viewshed from the ranch. Through its integration into the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, both film and television production have continued at Paramount Ranch to this day. <br /> <br /> In November of 2018, Paramount Ranch was severely damaged by the Woolsey Fire.<br />   <p><strong>Directions</strong><br /> 2903 Cornell Road, Agoura Hills, CA, 91301<br /> <em>GPS Coordinates: N 34.1181 W -118.7525</em><br /> Take Ventura Freeway (U.S. 101) to Kanan Road exit. South on Kanan 0.5 mile. Left on Cornell Way and veer to the right. South 2.5 miles, entrance is on right side of the road.</p>",

    "bodyText": "Hidden amid houses, roads, and other signs of modern life, Rocky Oaks features a seasonal human ­made pond and a variety of plant communities that provide habitat for wildlife. While taking a gentle hike along our loop trails, enjoy vistas of the pond. Once used as a watering hole for cattle, the pond (when replenished with rainfall) now supplies drinking water to native animals such as rabbits, coyotes, bobcats, raccoons, and deer. Plants such as tule, cattail, and willow grow in and near the water, while water birds such as buffleheads, mallards, and coots perform take­offs and landings. Just as humans commute to and from work on roads and highways, animals use the area to rest and commute between other habitats in the Santa Monica Mountains.<br />   <p><strong>Directions</strong><br /> Located in the 31500 block of Mulholland Highway west of the Kanan Road intersection. The entrance is on the north side of Mulholland Highway.</p> <p><em>GPS Coordinates: N 34.0967 W -118.8141</em></p> <p>Take the Ventura Freeway (U.S. 101) to Kanan Road. South on Kanan Road to Mulholland Highway. Turn west (right) on Mulholland Highway and right again into the parking lot.</p>",

Upon arriving at our most popular feature, the Solstice waterfall, you will find the stone and brick ruins of The Roberts Ranch house designed by architect Paul Revere Williams in 1952.

    "bodyText": "Berry Falls are a beloved and well known stop for regular floaters of the Niobrara National Scenic River.<br /> <br /> The Berry Falls are located adjacent to Berry Bridge on Berry Bridge Road on the South bank of the river. These 8 foot tall waterfalls flow directly into the Niobrara River and are a welcome site for floaters. They signal the change from floating in the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge to floating through private lands. <br /> <br /> There are two private canoe, kayak, and tube landing/launches on the Northern bank of the river as well as a public restroom, a section for public parking, and great views of the Berry Falls from all angles.<br /> <br /> We love viewing the falls from the Berry Bridge in every season. The falls flow year-round and under the guise of a gentle snowfall bring a sense of calm and stillness. The sound of the falls feeding into the river with the echoes of laughter from floaters rings in the summer season. <br /> <br /> Floaters on the river take their time passing these waterfalls; it is rare to get so close to waterfalls while floating the Niobrara River. Many of the other waterfalls are tucked up and into canyons or are too high up on the river walls for visitors to feel the spray and splash of the flow. <br /> <br /> Climbing on the Berry Falls is not allowed. The land of that river bank is actually privately owned, and the owners would like to preserve the structure of the Berry Falls for many years and visitors to come. ",
    "audioDescription": "A bridge spans about 40 feet across a river from South to North, the river flows from East to West. About 20 feet off of the bridge, on the river's Southeast Bank, a 8 foot tall, 10 foot wide waterfall can be seen. It is convex in shape and sticks out, water flowing over it in three directions. The stone behind the fall is a mix of dark grey-brown and light tan stone. The sound of the water rushing over the falls is different that that of the river running past.",

The fort falls are spring fed and flow all four seasons of the year. The trail to the Fort Falls is short and allows visitors to walk down steel catwalks over the falls before they tumble over the ledge and down stairs through every layer of the forest's canopy.<br /> <br /> Cradled in a cool canyon, the Eastern deciduous forest ecosystem surrounds the Fort Falls with Aspen and along the stream-banks, visitors can observe a variety of riparian (stream-side) flora as well. ",

The sound of the fort falls is loud and the rustling of the trees in the wind can be heard. The water drops over 30 feet over a ledge and curves down the canyon wall, trees encroaching on both sides of the wet stone. The water lands in a wide pool and gathers into a stream about 4 feet wind and flowing past the landing adjacent to the trail, leading eventually to the river's banks. The canyon is cool and shaded by the tree canopy overhead.",

    "bodyText": "<h4>The Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge is home to elk, bison, deer and more than 230 species of birds. Once a <a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">frontier military fort</a>, the refuge was established in 1912 and is seated on 19,000 acres of protected land and represents a crossroads of biodiversity from the North, East, South, and West. </h4> <br /> The refuge encompasses 9 miles of Niobrara National Scenic River which cuts deep canyons into the sandstone beneath the Sandhills Prairie, that is prevalent in the region. The Niobrara River acts as a water source to many of the wildlife and plants, and is helped by the waterfalls that flow into it from the Ogallala Aquifer. <br /> <br /> Roaming Fort Niobrara, you might run into the 350 head American Bison herd that roams the prairie and grazes the grasslands. Elk and deer, both white-tail and mule, can also be seen roaming around the refuge. In addition to these big mammals, more than 75 other animal species and 230 birds inhabit the region, some unique enough to only exist here in the crossroads. <br /> <br /> The Fort Niobrara Refuge makes the biodiversity, scenery, and even recreation on the Niobrara National Scenic River accessible. A beautiful tree covered canyon, featuring many waterfalls, it is a popular 'putting-in' spot for floaters on the river.<br /> <br /> The refuge open year-round during daylight hours and has a Visitor Center that is open Memorial Day-Labor Day. Admittance to the Refuge is free. There is a $1 fee for launching tubes, kayaks, or canoes at the Fort Niobrara Launch site.",
    "audioDescription": "Standing at the Fort Falls Trailhead on the Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge, you feel the wind strongly blow and the smell of grass surrounds you. You can hear the prairie dogs bark from a distance as they pop in and out of their burrows. Following the paved trail down hill, the long prairie grass tickles your legs from the edge of the trail. You enter a forest canopy from above, slowly feeling the cool of the shade from their leaves encompass you in green. The trail turns and you step onto the suspended metal walkway, a stream flowing below and to your right. You hear the leaves blowing in the wind, and the water rushing, twisting, bubbling. The walkway crosses over the stream and you feel the cool of the water beneath you and continue to the metal stair case on the other canyon wall that leads to a lower area. You walk down what has to be over 30 stairs only to find yourself in a small cleared area surrounded by soil and rock canyon walls. It is cool, and looking back towards the creek, you see a waterfall flowing over the ledge adjacent to the stairs you walked down, a very steep incline. The fort falls fall and meet the wall half way down where upon contact they spray and spread out along the convex wall below, eventually consolidating again into a stream that flows steadily down further. The walkway now is dirt. Wide and clear, surrounded by water-loving plants on both sides. Smaller creeks join the bigger stream along the way. The stream ends abruptly at the riverside, joining the larger flow. The river runs smooth and blue despite the tumultuous and exciting pace of the stream. The riverside is warm and you stand on the sands at its banks. Cold water flowing past and wind still blowing the branches of the trees above your head.",

It is located North of the town of Bassett, Nebraska, where Highway 7 crosses the Niobrara National Scenic River. The landing is located on the down-river side of the North end of the bridge. <br /> <br /> The Niobrara River is very braided in this section and the deepest channel can be hard to locate for floaters. Many floaters have to get in and out of their vessels to find the proper channel and continue their float.<br /> <br /> The landing at Highway 7 is not maintained very often, but is usable for the floating season as both a launch and landing. Paddlers can park their vehicles at a small parkinglot near the bridge for their convenience.<br /> <br /> Primitive camping is available at Fred Thomas State Wildlife Management Area on the South side of the river after the bridge. It’s tricky getting a vessel up the hill on that side but if you have multiple people, getting the vessels up into the tree line is much easier. Please note that open campfires are not allowed at Fred Thoms SWMA.",
    "audioDescription": "From the landing, a river flows by from West to East and a paved road crosses over it from South to North, which is to the right when facing the river. The landing is sand and gravel and is about three feet wide. A trail leads from the water's edge to the road. The river bank is steep and sandbars are scattered across the river's width.",

Sergeant John Ordway observed that “the water Shoots in to the Missiouri verry Swift, & has thrown the Sand out, which makes a Sand bar & Sholes from the mouth a considerable distance.” The shoals and the rapids, according to William Clark, made the river “not navagable for even Canoos without Great difficulty.” Clark managed to eke his way a few miles up the river, however, where he saw an empty Ponca village (everyone was out on a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/independence-creek.htm\">bison hunt</a>). </p> <p paraeid=\"{36fecc61-40ec-4ffa-b7a1-850416b39500}{58}\" paraid=\"787271977\">To Ponca people, the rivers and surrounding landscape are a source of sustenance, physically and spiritually. This is their homeland.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{36fecc61-40ec-4ffa-b7a1-850416b39500}{80}\" paraid=\"1310773078\">Stories passed down by Ponca elders describe the area around the Niobrara as Wašé, or plenteous. The silty deposits in the river bottoms created fertile soil for cedar, oak, and elm trees. Ponca families farmed in the bottomlands, growing corn, squash, and pumpkins. Fish flourished at the confluence of the Missouri and Niobrara Rivers. The high bluffs and sheltered gullies teemed with mule deer, bison, geese, and other game.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{36fecc61-40ec-4ffa-b7a1-850416b39500}{92}\" paraid=\"1539239419\">Ponca camps and villages could be found as far north as the Black Hills of South Dakota and as far south as the Platte River. But, according to Ponca elder Louis Headman, the Niobrara “was the last area of land they considered theirs before the removal” to reservations in Kansas and Oklahoma.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

When flow is high, the chute can be flooded in water so high that even the stone ledges on each side are covered. We love the view in years when the walls can be seen and sometimes even walked out on. <br /> <br /> The Norden Chute is protected by both the National Parks Service and the Nature Conservancy organization that protect the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/niobrara-valley-preserve.htm\">Niobrara Valley Preserve</a> on the South side of the river at this location. <br /> <br /> Our recommendations for a great visit to Norden Chute are to take time to use five sense to experience this powerful river feature. What do you see, smell, taste, feel, hear?<br /> <br /> The Norden Chute looks like a waterfall in the middle of the Niobrara river, but is more accurately known as a \"hydraulic feature.\" Meaning that the force of the water falling over the ledge causes erosion when it \"lands,\" and a plunge pool that is deeper than the rest of the streambed is formed. The water falling into the plunge pool causes suction and vortexes that can pull other objects deep under the water like sediment, rocks, debris, and in extreme cases, a kayak or canoe. <br /> <br /> The hydraulic forces under the Norden Chute are dangerous and paddlers and floaters are required to portage around it, meaning that there is a location up stream on the North river bank where floaters get out of the water and carry their floating vessels further downstream past the chute where it is safe to float again.",
    "audioDescription": "There is a bridge running South to North that is about 40 feet long suspended over a river that flows East to West. From the bridge, looking to the West, there are two stone river banks that boarder the flow of the river. The ledges are approximately 40 feet long on both sides of the bank and the Northern bank is about 10 feet wide whereas the South bank is about 3-5 feet wide. At the very back of these banks, the river flow is narrowed and tumbles over what looks like a waterfall in the middle of a riverbed. The riverbed drops off in the middle, a section about 15 feet wide, and the water rushes over it with force down into a channel between the brown stone walls. The sound of the water is loud and the moisture can be felt at the bridge.",

It is the tallest waterfall in the state at 63 feet tall and has been a popular stop for floaters and visitors of the Niobrara River Valley for many years.<br /> <br /> Early settlers first knew the waterfall as Arikaree Falls, a tribute to the names that were given to the local bodies of water by the 21 Native American Tribes who called the Niobrara River Valley home.<br /> <br /> In 1896, the first homestead patent for the land where the waterfall resides was filed by Frederic Smith. Since then, the falls have been known as Smith Falls.<br /> <br /> In 1941 Fred Krzyzanowski purchased the land and his family has owned the parcel ever since; in 1992 the Krzyzanowski family leased the land to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission to form Smith Falls State Park. <br /> <br /> The Smith Falls State Park is 250 acres on the Niobrara National Scenic River corridor and boasts handicap accessible board walks to the Smith Falls viewing platform and the visitor center.<br /> <br /> Smith Falls State Park is a common landing location for kayaking, canoeing, and tubing on the Niobrara National Scenic River, and in the summer is a popular wayside excursion for floaters with a landing just 300 yards from the Smith Falls observatory.<br /> <br /> Not a floater? That's okay. The State Park offers hiking on the Jim MacAllister Nature Trail, fishing on the river banks, camping on the riverside, and other historic interpretive sites. These were first established by Fred Krzyzanowski in an attempt to accommodate the swelling public interest that the Smith Falls received before the park was leased to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission for management.  <br /> <br /> The Smith Falls are an area of unique biodiversity along the Niobrara National Scenic River where the Smith Aspen, a one of a kind aspen hybrid species, can be seen. The cool, wet canyons along the Southern shore of the Niobrara River, like the one where the Smith Falls flow, are a crossroads of ecosystems and to this day host the spruce and paper bark birch trees that began to die off when the last glacier retreated from the plains and the weather became warm and dry in the region. The unique flora are a reference to the Ice Age and and prehistoric history of the Niobrara River Valley. <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "A wood boardwalk hugs the left side of a ravine, leading gradually uphill. To the right, a stream flows downhill, the left is a wall of tan soil and rock. The trees from above the soil outcropping linger far above. Farther up the boardwalk, about 200 yards, the sound of water begins to drown out everything else. From the observatory, you feel the mist of the water surround you. The cool of it clinging to your clothes. The source of the stream is a very large waterfall flowing very quickly off of the top of the soil and rock walls that surround you from the observatory. The water falls 63 feet, tumbling over the convex soil and rock below it, making it ricochet into the air and splash you every so often. The water gathers in a shallow pool about 20 feet across before tapering and flowing down the stream you followed up the boardwalk. You follow its flow down hill and find that it meets the Niobrara River at a 15 foot wide mouth where the riverside is shallow and paddlers and tubers float by laughing and splashing.",

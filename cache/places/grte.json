    "audioDescription": "Host: As you look across to the west shore of Jackson Lake, you can see evidence of several fires that have burned over there-if you look carefully. Far to the south, you can see where the Waterfalls Canyon Fire burned almost 50 years ago, in 1974. Much of that area is now dense lodgepole pine forest or shrubs. The dark forested area that you see across the lake and extending south, which is left if you're facing the lake, is all regrowth from that fire. If you look directly across, you'll see that forest grow patchy and disappear, where a fire burned in 2000. Farther to the north, which is to the right, you can see burned trees on the ridgeline from the 2016 Berry Fire. Explore the fire history page on Grand Teton's website to see a map of how these fires overlap one another. Here's Diane Abendroth, the park's fire ecologist, and Ron Steffens, a fire analyst in the park, to discuss what we're seeing on the other side of the lake. Diane mentions the Moran fire in 2000, which burned even farther south than the Waterfalls Canyon Fire-you can see it from Colter Bay.<br /><br />Diane: You can see across the lake now that there are a lot of little trees out there, and some areas where shrubs still dominate, and some areas where the trees are actually getting bigger. And then if you look to the north of that fire and to the south, you'll see some fires that burned in the year 2000. That's the Moran Fire, the Wilcox Fire, and the Glade Fire. Those were lightning caused fires, but those weren't fires that the Park Service was attempting to allow to just burn. But they suppressed them in a way that included letting them go up into the rocks of the Tetons, while protecting some cabins and some values in the lower elevations. But Jackson Lake is a pretty good fuel break. And if you look at the whole area on the backside of the lake, people really haven't played a very big role in fire there. And it looks like maybe it looked before settlers came and started to interfere with the landscape.<br /><br />Ron: The other thing we learned with the waterfalls canyon fire and the fires afterwards is the value of. Diversity of a fire landscape. So the fire in 1974. 26 years later in 2000 there are fires burning from the south and from the north. And as those fires burned into the Waterfalls Canyon area, there was a younger forest. It is much more shaded because of the density of the regeneration of the forest, and both of those fires slowed and went out. So we're able to demonstrate and learn from the value of a diverse landscape with a diverse pattern of burns.<br /><br />Host: This type of area, where several different fires overlap like a patches on a quilt, creates excellent wildlife habitat. Many species appreciate recently-burned areas for the lush plant regrowth and the high populations of wood-boring insects and small mammals. Perhaps even more important is the juxtaposition of different habitats, where old growth forest opens out to a grassy clearing, or dense young lodgepoles border a shrubby meadow. Wildlife love these so-called \"edge habitats\", from elk and deer that want to graze in meadows but shelter in the forest, or raptors that want to nest in the trees and hunt rodents in the open. The series of fires we've seen on the west shore of the lake is ideal for creating this mix of habitats where wildlife can thrive. Here are Ron and Diane to explain more about what we can learn from this type of landscape:<br /><br />Ron: The landscape where you get a diversity of forest ages and a diversity of regeneration that supports the wildlife that people have come to cherish here. All landscapes have a cycle. Fire is such a dramatic way of resetting that cycle that I think it lets us humbly look around and learn that we need to learn from this place.<br /><br />Diane: When you have towns or people's homes or other kinds of developments in the mix, with the public lands and forests, it makes it kind of dangerous to have fire on the landscape too. But here in the Greater Yellowstone we have just enormous vast areas with nobody's house in the way. And so that makes it possible to see what nature can do on its own. And we don't have to try to interfere.",

Excerpt from \"Diary of a Dude Wrangler\": \"Some of the happiest hours I have ever spent and some of the most profitable, philosophically speaking, have been spent on the top rail of a corral fence, the favorite sitting-place of all Westerners if they have nothing else to do-and, sometimes, even when they have something else to do. I don't know which makes you the more homesick for the West when you are away from it: the thought of shadowy forests and cool water, or the recollection of warm dust and the top rail of a corral fence and, on Sunday afternoons, the shady side of a cabin or saddle-shed, where you sit with some chosen companions and converse at intervals.\"",

The lack of trees, however, reflects the well-drained soils and exposure to the sun.</p> <h3>Name Origin</h3> <p>Horace Albright introduced John D. Rockefeller, Jr. to the area that became Grand Teton National Park in 1926. Albright, as superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, met with local business people in 1923 in Maud Noble's cabin setting in motion the recruitment of Rockefeller to help preserve and protect this landscape.</p> <h3>Biography of Horace Albright</h3> <p>Horace Albright was born in 1890 in California. In 1913, Albright graduated from the University of California, Berkeley and moved to Washington DC to begin working as a clerk for the Secretary of the Interior. Although he worked on park issues right away, his focus became nearly exclusively their issues in 1915. That year he became the assistant of newly hired Stephen Mather. In fact, Mather would not join the department unless Albright agreed to be his assistant in order to “’keep me [Mather] out of jail.’” Together they worked to create a parks bureau that resulted in the creation of the National Park Service (NPS) on August 25, 1916.</p> <p>In 1917 Stephen Mather became seriously ill from what was likely bipolar depression. This made it so Mather was unable to do the duties as director of the newly formed NPS. During a span between 1917 and 1919, Albright served as acting director.</p> <p>After Mather could return, Albright took up the jobs of superintendent of Yellowstone and NPS field director. As superintendent, Albright wanted to make Yellowstone a flagship of the agency and demonstrate how a park would be managed under the new National Park Service. Many of the current agency and park-wide policies and functions have roots with Albright. Two of the functions he helped found were visitor services and park museums. He was also instrumental in achieving the enlarged Grand Teton National Park of today.</p> <p>After Mather suffered a stroke in 1929, Albright became the second director of the NPS. One of his most lasting contributions to the National Park Service was to get all the war department sites placed under NPS control. This solidified the agency’s place as the keeper of both the natural and cultural heritage of the United States of America.</p> <p>In 1933, Albright left the NPS to work for the United States Potash Company. He retired from the company in 1956. Although he went into the private sector, Albright was always interested and involved in the affairs of national parks. He was even awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1980 for his involvement with the creation of the NPS. Albright died in 1987.</p> <p> </p>",

He and other Mormon Row homesteaders cut an irrigation ditch to the Kelly Warm Springs allowing him to switch to raising cattle and hay.</p>",

It has a grey metal roof and grey, weathered, vertical plank siding on the flanks and smooth rounded logs at the center of the main structure. The peak of the roof extends over the front of the building to form a triangular projection. There is an addition to the barn extending out on the side facing the road, a one story structure with a lower sloped roofline.",

It looked as though you would have to travel straight across the valley for hot miles of sagebrush to those further mountains. Then suddenly came the second bench, a prehistoric riverbank, running neat as a dam north and south, then the steep road down a gully in the jolting wagon between larkspur and mules-ears, with perhaps a last decadent little snowbank still lingering in the draw-the whole panorama of river valley opening out below. Then finally you come down the first bench right into the ranch itself-the sod of tarpaper-roofed cabins, the corrals and saddle shed and barns and ditches and willows and big pines and aspen groves and the shining square of the swimming pool dug out of the flat between cabins and river. It was coming home with a vengeance.\"",

Blooms of blue camas blanket this moist meadow during summer. Shoshone Indians and other tribes gathered the \"quamash\" plant's bulbs and dried or roasted them. They waited for the plants to bloom, because the bulbs of a similar plant, death camas, are fatally poisonous. Indians ate the bulbs or ground them into flour to make cakes or biscuits-important additions to their diet of elk, trout, and berries.\"This meadow may once have been a pond. You may not see water today, but the ground is too wet for trees to grow. In the future, this meadow may become drier and a forest may flourish.\" In the lower left corner is an historic photo of an American Indian woman sitting beside a large pile of bulbs. She wears a kerchief on her head and has a stone pestle in her right hand. The caption reads, \"Annie Yellow Bear grinds camas bulbs into meal about 1890.\"",

Bring tablets or water filtration devices to purify water in the backcountry.</li> <li>Be prepared for rapid weather changes; bring rain gear and extra clothing. Thunderstorms occur frequently during the summer. </li> <li>High elevation may cause breathing difficulties; pace yourself. The best cure for altitude sickness is retreating to a lower elevation.</li> <li>Snow melts gradually, leaving valley trails by mid-June, canyon trails by late July. Be careful crossing snowfields and streams. Do not attempt crossing steep snow without previous experience and the proper equipment.</li> <li>Tell someone where you are going and when you expect to return.</li> <li>Solo hiking and off-trail hiking are not recommended. Check with a ranger for current information on trail conditions.</li> </ul> <h2>Avoid Crowds</h2> <p><br /> During July and August trailhead parking areas fill early, especially at South Jenny Lake, String Lake, Lupine Meadows, Death Canyon and Granite Canyon. Parking on natural vegetation results in permanent damage to plants; violators will be ticketed. In paved parking lots, parking illegally will also result in a ticket. An early start will help you avoid parking problems.</p> <p> </p>",

    "audioDescription": "This sign is located at the edge of a parking lot at the western end of Blacktail Butte. Immediately past the sign, trails climb up the end of the butte to a rock face used for climbing practice. Other trails branch off to the right, or south, to skirt the butte and climb the southern side. The panel shows a photograph of a woman scaling a rock face with a view of the Teton peaks in the background. Text reads, \"Blacktail Butte rises 1,100 feet above the valley floor and is the seasonal home to many animals. Follow the trail south to reach a summit elevation of 7,688 feet. Madison limestone outcrops provide a variety of challenges for the experienced climber. Glaciers sculpted this butte that is comprised of sedimentary rock.\" At the bottom of the panel is a side view of the butte with the western end, your current location, on the left. Dotted lines indicate the trails that climb the western end, go east about a mile to the Upper Blacktail climbing area and that on up to the summit. Down the right side of the panel are additional notices and trail tips. Text reads, \"No Pets On Trails. Pets are not allowed on hiking trails or away from developed areas. These measures help protect you, your pet and sensitive park resources. A good rule of thumb is that a pet may go anywhere a car may go. Pets, where permitted, must be restrained on a leash no longer than six feet. \"Wildlife Safety. Follow food storage regulations. Do not leave food, coolers, trash, backpacks, water bottles or any potential attractant unattended-not even for a second-including in an open truck bed or the exterior of any vehicle. Carry and know how to use bear spray. Keep it immediately available, not inside your pack. Hikers must be prepared for wildlife encounters. Do not approach or harass animals. Stay at least 300 feet from large mammals such as moose, elk or bison for your safety and theirs. Wildlife often bite the hand that feeds them-do not feed any animal, including squirrels, chipmunks and birds. \"Firearms & Hunting. Inquire at a visitor center for firearm and hunting regulations. Please note that firearms are not allowed inside visitor centers and most park buildings. \"Prevent Crime. Lock your car! Parked vehicles may attract thieves and vandals. To avoid theft or damage to your vehicle: Secure all valuables such as cameras, electronics, wallets or purses. Leave glove box and other storage areas open and empty. Lock your car with the windows closed. Do not leave notes or permits that announce your plans. We need your help. Report any crime, accident, fire or safety hazard to a park employee as soon as possible. In case of emergency, call 911! \"Trail Tips. Climbing is a technical sport that requires training, skill and proper equipment. Scrambling up steep slopes and on loose rock can quickly lead to tragedy. \"Follow low impact climbing ethics. Leave the rock in its natural condition. Avoid placing permanent protection. Motorized drills are prohibited. \"Beware of loose rock. When hiking use caution to avoid knocking rocks over cliffs onto climbers. \"Stay on established trails. Shortcutting switchbacks damages plants and causes erosion. \"Pack out all trash. Keep the park litter-free. Leave the park as you found it for others to enjoy. Picking wildflowers or collecting any object is prohibited. \"Vehicles, including bicycles and strollers, are prohibited on trails or off established roads. Wheelchairs and any type of assistive technology are allowed. \"Saddle and pack animals must stay on authorized trails and may not graze in the park. Find out more at a visitor center or ranger station.\"",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside sign is located a short walk down a dirt path going west from the parking area. There is a split rail fence at the end of the path. The sign is to the left of the fence, just past a trail that leads down a slope to the meadows and ponds below. West of the flat marshy area are woods with the mountain range in the distance. The background of the panel is a photograph of the view from the overlook with the various habitats identified. Text reads, \"See One, See Them All. Here, in one place, you can see examples of every biological community in the national park. The geologic landscape determines the types of plants and animals that exist in each community. Sunlight, water, soil, and wind all influence where different species find food and shelter to sustain their lives.\" Sets of three photographs illustrate each of these communities. In the upper left, near the mountain slopes are photos of a pika, a small mouse-like rodent, a marmot and tiny, bright blue alpine forget-me-nots. The caption reads, \"Alpine life above treeline adapts to minimal soil, intense sun, heavy snow, and fierce wind. Wildflowers cling to the ground. Pikas and marmots struggle to gather food.\" The next trio is just below, near the open meadow next to the treeline. The photos show a tortoiseshell butterfly, fireweed blossoms and a bison. The caption reads, \"Meadows contain grasses and wildflowers that provide food and shelter for elk and songbirds. Look for meadows interspersed in other communities.\" Bottom center on the panel are photos of a pronghorn, a uinta ground squirrel and a sage grouse. The caption reads, \"Sagebrush flats include shrubs, grasses, and wildflowers that can survive in dry, rocky soil and intense sunlight. Look for sage grouse and pronghorn.\" In the middle of the panel are three photos of a mule deer, quaking aspen and a black bear. The caption reads, \"Forests take root at all elevations from cottonwoods along rivers to dwarf trees at treeline. See any red squirrels, elk, or black bears?\" At the lower right of the panel are photos of a beaver, a moose and a yellow warbler. The caption reads, \"Wetlands consist of aquatic plants and shrubs and serve as buffers against floods. Look for waterfowl, beavers, and moose.\"",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside sign stands at the edge of a semicircular paved area with an accessible curb leading up from the parking area. Beyond the sign is a sagebrush meadow with dark green conifer woods behind. Beyond the trees a deep canyon extends back between Teewinot Mountain on the left and Mount St. John on the right. Further to the right is the jagged ridge of Rockchuck Peak and still further, the flat-topped peak of Mount Moran with two visible glaciers on its face. To the left of Teewinot the jagged central Teton peaks fade off in the distance. The background of the wayside shows a photograph of a close-up view of the mouth of Cascade Canyon between snow-dusted mountains, with a golden glow from a rising sun. Text down the left side reads, \"Cascade Canyon. Jagged peaks tower above Cascade Canyon reminding us that powerful Pleistocene glaciers carved this canyon and sculpted this range. From the shores of Jenny Lake, venture through forest communities, wetlands along Cascade Creek, high meadows filled with wildflowers, and up to the rocky windswept slopes of the alpine community. Both forks of Cascade Canyon once held glaciers. Schoolroom Glacier clings to a cliff at the head of the south fork, while Lake Solitude fills a glacial cirque at the head of the north fork. \"Alpine conditions are harsh. During the brief summer, splashes of colorful wildflowers accent bare rock. Winter brings deep snow, sub-zero temperatures and winds gusting to more than 100 miles per hour.\" Below the text is a photograph of a small, brown furry animal sitting on a boulder. The caption reads, \"American Pika. Many animals migrate or hibernate during winter, but pikas gather grass during summer to store as haystacks under rocks for winter forage. Yellow-bellied marmots, however, hibernate up to nine months of the year.\" Another photograph in the lower right shows thick green vegetation hugging the ground covered with small dark blue flowers. The five-petaled blossoms have a yellow center surrounded by a white band. The caption reads, \"Alpine Forget-me-not. Small, dense mounds of cushion plants grow slowly between rocky outcrops storing nutrients for years before blooming.\"",

At the bottom of the panel is an inset photo of a man sitting on a pile of rocks, wearing a plaid shirt. He has a coil of rope across his chest and holds an ice axe in his left hand. The caption reads, \"Fritiof Fryxell served as Grand Teton National Park's first park naturalist. As geologist, teacher, and mountaineer, he developed public education programs, trail maps, and safety rules for climbers. Fryxell's publications stand as classics of explanation and eloquence.\" At the bottom left of the panel is a quote, \"These peaks have been called the Cathedral Group . . . more evident here than in many of the great cathedrals of men is the gothic note. It is seen in the profiles of the countless firs and spruces congregated like worshippers on the lower slopes; it reappears higher in the converging lines of spire rising beyond spire; it attains supreme expression in the figures of the peaks themselves that, towering above all else, with pointed summits direct one's vision and thoughts yet higher.\" - Fritiof Fryxell. The sign on the left is titled \"Teton Fault.\" Its background is a color photograph of the base of the mountains visible beyond the sign. Running along the base a steep bank labeled \"Teton Fault Scarp\" is clearly visible. Text down the right side of the panel reads, \" Looking west toward Mount St. John, notice the steep slope or fault scarp near the base of the peak. This steep slope formed as several massive earthquakes broke the ground by more than 75 feet since the ice-aged glaciers last retreated 14,000 years ago. The Teton fault began moving roughly nine million years ago generating earthquakes that shook the landscape.Each earthquake, up to a magnitude 7.5, lifted the mountain block one part for every three to four parts that the valley block dropped building the range one step at a time. Future earthquakes will continue to shape this landscape but the geoscientists cannot predict when this will happen.\" Below the text is an illustration showing the Teton Range with an orange line along its eastern base indicating the line of the Teton Fault.

    "audioDescription": "This small log chapel sits near a paved parking lot at Menors Ferry Historic District. At the edge of the asphalt a sign hangs, covered by a peaked roof. The sign has a black and white photograph of the chapel with almost 30 horses tethered to a rail fence alongside. The text reads, \"A Spiritual Heart in the Park. This rustic Episcopal chapel, constructed in 1925, held the first services on July 26 of that year. Prior to its construction, worshipers traveled 12 miles over rough roads to the town of Jackson. Today, that is just a short car ride away, but in the 1920's roads were rough and automobiles rare. Once fully constructed, the Chapel of the Transfiguration served to provide spiritual refreshment to dude ranchers and tourists that flocked to the Chapel every Sunday to worship and gather as a community. Today the Chapel continues to draw people, and services are held every Sunday during the summer.\" Past the sign a broad asphalt path leads to an open roofed entrance arch which houses a large bell. Here the path turns to wood and leads on through an open area to the chapel itself, a small log building with a simple cross on the peaked roof. Just in front, a fork in the path leads to the right side of the chapel, where rows of benches sit outside. The front door of the chapel leads into a vestibule, with the small sanctuary beyond. Rustic log pews line the aisle leading up to the altar at the far end. Behind the altar is a large picture window, which provides a dramatic view of Grand Teton in fair weather.",

    "audioDescription": "The Visitor Center is a low, long building. Its vertical board-and-batten siding is painted a dark brown. The entrance is located close to the center of the building and may be accessed by a ramp or up a set of three steps just to the left of the ramp. There are benches to the left of the steps. Restrooms are located in a breezeway at the far left end of the building. A ramp leads up to the breezeway.The entrance leads into a large, airy lobby with walls and ceiling of natural-finished pine. An information counter is on the right wall and the entrance to an auditorium is on the left. To your immediate right as you enter is a wide doorway leading to the bookstore and gift shop and a small exhibit area which features American Indian objects from the David T. Vernon Collection including touchable exhibits. At the far right, past the counter is an area which hosts American Indian guest artists during the summer months.The far wall of the entrance lobby is glass and has an exit onto a large deck in the rear of the building. From here the land slopes down to the bay with views of Mount Moran beyond. The deck is surfaced with rough planking with wide, one-inch spacing between the planks and is edged with a wooden railing. Several benches are located long the railing. At the far left end stairs provide access to the waterfront.There are two wayside signs along the railing. The one on the right is titled, \"A Changing Landscape.\" Text reads, \"Alterations to a Natural Lake. Jackson Lake is the largest of the park's many lakes formed by glaciers. The lake expanded when the Bureau of Reclamation built a dam in 1907, creating a reservoir on top of the natural lake. The water behind the dam provides irrigation water to the communities in Idaho through the Minidoka Project.Jackson Lake Dam allows the Bureau of Reclamation to manage the lake's water level. Sometimes they keep the level low to capture meltwater. Other times, the level is low due to lack of precipitation.\"Lake Levels and Climate. The water level of Jackson Lake varies from year to year due to seasonal precipitation amounts, winter snowpack, and irrigation demands. In some years the reservoir may start completely full of meltwater from winter's deep snow but end the summer nearly empty, drained to meet water needs downstream. The National Park Service is committed to reducing its contributions to climate change through conserving energy and water, promoting alternative transportation, constructing green building, and minimizing waste.\"At the bottom center of the panel is a satellite view of Jackson Lake showing the extent of the pre-dam lake in a light blue color. The dam is located at the bottom left of the image and Colter Bay is located near the middle of the bottom ledge of the lake. The caption reads, \"Enhancing the Natural Resource. Jackson Lake Dam increased the lake's capacity by 30 percent and raised the water level nearly 40 feet. Reservoir levels vary, however the natural lake is always full.\"Two photos above the image show the difference in water level in the bay between high water and low water. The one on the left shows the marina's boat slips full of large power boats riding high on the water. The right one shows empty slips, many resting on mud flats.An image at the far right of the panel shows Teton Glacier. Red dotted lines below the glacier show how far it extended at various times I the past, with the outline for 1929 covering almost twice the current area. The caption reads, \"Climate change affects glaciers, too. Research indicates that the park's glaciers have receded significantly in the last 100 years.\"The wayside on the left reads, \"The Art of Making Mountains. A Landscape built up by Earthquakes. The spectacular Teton Range began to rise around ten million years ago when movement on the Teton fault generated a series of massive earthquakes. The block of bedrock west of the fault rotated skyward to form the mountains and the block east of the fault hinged downward to form the valley of Jackson Hole. One day, another earthquake will continue this process.\"Today the mountains tower more than 7,000 feet above the valley floor. Across Jackson Lake, the 40-mile-long Teton fault marks the abrupt transition between the steep mountain face and the flat valley floor.\"Worn Down by Glaciers and Erosion. Beginning some two million years ago, a series of glaciers flowed down from the high peaks and south from Yellowstone. These glaciers, their bases studded with rocky debris, ground and polished bedrock, carved U-shaped canyons, and dug out basins. The receding glaciers left behind moraines, ridges of boulders, gravel, and rock flour that form natural dams around the valley's lakes. Jackson Lake is more than 400 feet deep, evidence of the power of glaciers to change the landscape.\"Water, wind, and ice continue eroding the mountains, although with less power than during the ice age.",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside stands at the edge of a paved sidewalk area between the parking area and the road. Across the road from the sign can be seen a pasture with a buck-and-rail style fence with a long, low ranch building at the far side. Horses often graze in the pasture, which is backed by low hill wooded with conifers. Beyond the hills the mountains rise steeply with sharp-pointed Grand Teton in front of you and Mount Owen slightly to the right. Behind you, on the other side of the parking lot are picnic tables to the left and a unisex vault toilet to the right. In between is a dirt path that leads down a bank to the rocky creek bed below. The background of the sign has a photograph of the view of Grand Teton and Mount Owen. Text down the left side reads, \"Community Crossroads. You are at the crossroads of several natural communities. Cottonwood and Taggart creeks converge just south of here supporting a diversity of plants and animals in a wetland habitat. Somewhere nearby, wildlife finds shade in the cool of the creek, birds nest in the shelter of the cottonwood trees, and cutthroat trout thrive in the cold, snow-fed stream. A mosaic forest community covers the hillside across the road. This hillside is a glacial moraine: a pile of glacial sediments. A wildfire burned this area in 1985, a force of natural change that renewed the landscape. Since then, a patchwork of lodgepole pine forest, aspen stands, and brushy clearings has reemerged. At the bottom of the panel just to the right of the text is a photograph of a bright yellow bird. The caption reads, \"Yellow warblers flit through the willows along the stream.\" To the right of that is a photograph of a pair of elk standing together in a frost-covered meadow. The caption reads, \"Many species depend on several communities. Elk spend their day in the cool of the hillside forest and then graze in the sagebrush flats during morning and evening. Their daily movement illustrates one of many ties between the natural communities of the Teton landscape. Next to the wayside a smaller sign on a post reads, \"Manges Cabin - Two Stories. In 1911, homesteader James Manges built the distinctive cabin you see across the pasture - likely the first two-story structure in this area. A skilled craftsman, he designed the steep, overhanging roof to shed snow. The park now uses this cabin for storage and the pasture to graze horses and mules used for trail work and ranger patrols.\"",

    "audioDescription": "At the edge of the small gravel parking area is a wayside sign. The background image shows a color photograph of the historic cabin located here. A \"dogtrot\" style cabin, it has two small log rooms facing each other across a covered breezeway. Text on the panel reads, \"From Rancher to Conservationist. J. Pierce Cunningham settled here in Jackson Hole in the 1880s despite the hardships of winter. He initially opposed the expansion of Grand Teton National Park but later became an advocate. He teamed up with neighbor Josiah \"Si\" Ferrin to write a petition signed by 97 valley ranchers who agreed to sell their land to form a \"national recreation area.\" John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s Snake River Land Company bought Cunningham's land and other ranches. Rockefeller later donated over 33,000 acres to expand the national park. Cunningham called this cabin home from 1888 to 1895. After he and his wife, Margaret, completed their ranch house, they used this building as a smithy and barn.\" At the bottom of the panel is a quote from Cunningham: \"The destiny of Jackson's Hole is as a playground, typical of the West, for the education and enjoyment of the Nation, as a whole.\" In the upper right of the panel a sketch shows the various scattered ranch buildings as they might have looked in the late 1800s. To the right of the sign a path leads underneath a post arch with a sign that reads, \"Bar Flying U. J. Pierce Cunningham.\" The dirt path curves gently to the right, down through willow thickets, past wildlife-dug holes to the historic cabin 0.3 mile away. The cabin is long and low, the entrance to the breezeway being only a little over 5 feet high. The roof is formed of sapling poles laid side by side and covered with dirt. Low open doorways with large log sills lead off the breezeway into each of the two small rooms. Each room has two small open windows - one front, one back - and has a dirt floor. On the wall to the right of the breezeway is a plaque marking the cabin as being on the National Register of Historic Places.",

    "audioDescription": "The path to the river's edge here is gently sloped and covered with small, smooth river rocks. There is a large level area on this side of the river as the river flows right to left in a gentle curve around you. The far side of the river is faced with a tall bluff. This is an easy location to approach the river, feel the cold water and the river rocks. Like all river launch access points there is a large, three-panel sign located close to the river providing information on safety, river regulations, and details on this section of the river. The left hand panel reads, \"Snake River Safety. The Snake River, wild and dynamic, provides challenges that rapidly test the skill of boaters. Braided channels and shifting log jams present difficulties found on few whitewater rivers. \"Boaters floating the Snake River must watch for areas of swift current, blocked channels, and hazards such as submerged rocks or logs, sweepers and strainers. River water remains cold throughout most of the year, increasing the risk of hypothermia. \"Review river updates posted below, but be aware that river channels change course frequently and boaters must take responsibility for safety.\" Below this text there may be additional flyers posted with seasonally changing information. The right hand panel reads, \"Snake River Regulations. A National Park is a special place, created to protect resources while providing for visitor use and enjoyment; however, as more people explore the Snake River, increasing impacts harm fragile plant and animal communities. You can help prevent damage caused by human use by observing the following regulations. \"Boating. A park boating permits is required for all vessels floating the Snake River. Permits can be obtained at visitor centers. All vessels must carry a U.S. Coast Guard approved personal flotation device (PFD) properly fitted for each person on board. Motorboats and inner tubes are prohibited. \"Pets. Dogs and all other pets are not permitted on the river (or away from roads and parking areas) to avoid wildlife disturbance. Where permitted, pets must be leashed. \"Camping. Camping and fires are prohibited along the river. \"Resource Protection. Do not feed of disturb wildlife. You are disturbing an animal if you cause it to interrupt its natural activities or to move away from you. Stopping and bank use is prohibited in posted nesting areas. Collecting any natural or historic object(s) is prohibited. \"Fishing. A Wyoming state fishing license is required. Complete regulations can be obtained from visitor centers. Help preserve high quality angling for native wild fish.\" An inset reads, \" Stop Aquatic Hitchhikers! Prevent the transport of nuisance species. Clean all recreational equipment. Remove any visible mud, plants, fish or animals before transporting equipment.\"<br /><br />The middle panel shows a map of the Snake River within Grand Teton National Park with the section from Deadman's Bar to Moose Landing highlighted. Text reads, \"Advanced. This section is one of the most challenging river stretches in the park. Advanced boating skills are necessary to navigate fast moving water, braiding and logjams; careful route-finding and channel selection are critical. Moose Landing is the last take out inside Grand Teton National Park, the next take out after Moose is at the Wilson bridge, 14 miles downstream from Moose. In Case of Emergency Call 911!

To your right, the somewhat rocky trail heads up a slight slope through conifer trees.The center panel on the sign shows a map of the area around Phelps Lake and Death Canyon to the west of it, running between Prospectors Mountain to the south and Static Peak to the north. The map is oriented so that north is to the right. You are currently located towards the right side of the map, north of Phelps Lake. Dotted lines show the trails that can be accessed from this location. The panel reads, \"Explore Your Park. Glacial ice carved Death Canyon ending 15,000 years ago. Ice formed Phelps Lake leaving a prominent moraine-or rocky ridge of glacial debris-as it melted back.

The text reads, \"SAGEBRUSH COMMUNITY. The drought-tolerant plants of the sagebrush community thrive despite porous, cobbly soils and intense sunlight. These flowering plants form one of the most colorful and diverse communities in the park. Sagebrush provides a mosaic of food and shelter for a variety of animals.\" The panel on the left is titled \"Protect Your Park.\" In a light green color block at the top left there is a photograph of two people on bicycles on the path with Grand Teton in the background.

Persons with physical disabilities may use electric and battery-operated transportation. Horses are not permitted on the pathway, except on the Snake River bridge in Moose. Travel single file in the right-side lane; share the pathway. Notify other recreators before you pass. Be aware of others passing you. The use of portable audio devices is strongly discouraged. Obey all traffic signs. Yield to all vehicles. Yield to slower recreators. Wear a helmet. Stay on paved pathway; no shortcutting through vegetation. Absolutely no pets allowed. Respect the rights of all users.\" In the center of the panel is a photograph of a small herd of pronghorn . The caption reads, \"Help wildlife thrive. NEVER FEED, APPROACH OR HARASS WILDLIFE-especially large mammals. Stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from other animals. Be prepared for wildlife interactions; be prepared to stop.\" At the bottom of the panel is a photograph of two bears standing in snow at the edge of a pond, drinking. The caption reads, \"Be Bear Aware. Grizzly and black bears may become aggressive when surprised or in defense of young. Stay alert and make bears aware of your presence. Follow food storage regulations: never leave your backpack, pannier or any item with food unattended. Carry and know how to use bear spray.\" There are two smaller photograph in a border down the right side of the panel. The first one shows an elk with a full set of antlers. The caption reads, \"When to Ride. The multi-use pathway is CLOSED from dusk to dawn for wildlife and public safety.\" The bottom photo shows a single tree backlit by a sun low in the sky. The caption reads, \"Leave No Trace. The park PROHIBITS PICKING, COLLECTING OR DESTROYING park resources. Leave all plants, animals and artifacts as you found them for other visitors to enjoy.

    "audioDescription": "There is a large, three-panel sign located near the pathway providing information on safety, park regulations and a map. The center panel shows a map of the pathway between Moose Junction in the south and the southern end of Jenny Lake in the north. The pathway runs alongside the Teton Park Road for most of this stretch, only diverging slightly to the west as it approaches Jenny Lake Visitor Center. The title on the right hand panel reads, \"No Pets on Pathway\" and shows a picture of a dog with the universal not-allowed symbol of a red circle with a line across it. The text reads, \"PETS ARE NOT PERMITTED on the park pathway. Guide dogs-used for the sole purpose of aiding a person with physical disability-may travel on the pathway. The pathway travels through sensitive wildlife areas. \"Why Are Pets Not Allowed? For the wildlife and for your safety. Wildlife such as bears, wolves or coyotes may be drawn to pets and their owners. A surprise encounter with wildlife may result in death or injury to pets, wildlife or visitors. Pets may escape and quickly become prey. Dogs cause the same stress responses in prey species (such as elk and pronghorn) as predators do. Transmittable diseases, such as parvovirus, from infected feces may live in the soil for months, passing on to wildlife. \"WHERE CAN PETS GO? \"OUTSIDE THE PARK Jackson Hole Community Pathways except on the National Elk Refuge.

Pets must be in control and restrained on a leash no longer than six feet in length.\" At the bottom of the panel are photographs of a bull moose and a male sage grouse, its large white chest puffed up. The text reads, \"SAGEBRUSH COMMUNITY. The drought-tolerant plants of the sagebrush community thrive despite porous, cobbly soils and intense sunlight. These flowering plants form one of the most colorful and diverse communities in the park. Sagebrush provides a mosaic of food and shelter for a variety of animals.\" The panel on the left is titled \"Protect Your Park.\" In a light green color block at the top left there is a photograph of two people on bicycles on the path with Grand Teton in the background. Text reads, \"How to Ride. Only NON-MOTORIZED METHODS of transportation are permitted on the multi-use pathway. Persons with physical disabilities may use electric and battery-operated transportation. Horses are not permitted on the pathway, except on the Snake River bridge in Moose. Travel single file in the right-side lane; share the pathway. Notify other recreators before you pass. Be aware of others passing you. The use of portable audio devices is strongly discouraged. Obey all traffic signs. Yield to all vehicles. Yield to slower recreators. Wear a helmet. Stay on paved pathway; no shortcutting through vegetation. Absolutely no pets allowed. Respect the rights of all users.\" In the center of the panel is a photograph of a small herd of pronghorn . The caption reads, \"Help wildlife thrive. NEVER FEED, APPROACH OR HARASS WILDLIFE-especially large mammals. Stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from other animals. Be prepared for wildlife interactions; be prepared to stop.\" At the bottom of the panel is a photograph of two bears standing in snow at the edge of a pond, drinking. The caption reads, \"Be Bear Aware. Grizzly and black bears may become aggressive when surprised or in defense of young. Stay alert and make bears aware of your presence. Follow food storage regulations: never leave your backpack, pannier or any item with food unattended.

    "audioDescription": "Host: As Anglo-American settlers came into the West, they did not fully appreciate the role that both natural fire and indigenous burning practices played on these landscapes. Trees were generally seen as a resource and a commodity-something that people didn't want to burn. As national parks and land management agencies were founded, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, rangers put significant effort into suppressing fires whenever and wherever they started. This policy was formalized after massive fires in 1910, which burned millions of acres in the Rocky Mountain West. In just a few days in late August, over three million acres burned in Idaho and Montana. It was certainly a human disaster, with over eighty people killed in the blazes. But it was also seen as a disaster more broadly, by people who saw fire as an enemy and relied on logging for their livelihood. I asked Chip Collins, our Fire Management Officer, about early fire management by the government in the west:<br /><br />Chip: So I think when we first started managing fires in this part of the west, we looked at resources as commodities and valued them in that way. We didn't value ecosystem processes, and fire was seen as a destructive force to those resources when thought of in their economic value. So we put out fires as often as we could, regardless of its role on the landscape. The resultant policy was that all fires would be suppressed, and the end goal was that by 10am the morning after a fire was discovered it would be controlled and out.<br /><br />Host: In the wake of the 1910 fires, the U.S. Forest Service instituted the 10am rule, that Chip mentioned. Firefighters weren't always successful, but these efforts did suppress a significant proportion of fires over the next 50 years, particularly as firefighting technology improved. The mid-1900s also coincided with a wetter climatic period, which allowed crews to be more successful at suppressing fires. Across the country, Smokey Bear's famous campaign that \"only you can prevent forest fires,\" taught a generation of Americans that fires were something that needed to be removed from the landscape.<br /><br />This policy had different effects in different ecosystems. In places like Ponderosa pine forests, which were used to frequent, low-severity fires, the impacts of excluding fire were obvious: brush and small trees grew up and created a dense undergrowth that resulted in much hotter fires when they did burn. In contrast, places like the lodgepole pine and mixed conifer forests we have here in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem are used to seeing fire every 100-300 years-so 50 or 100 years with fewer fires does not have as dramatic of an impact. Even so, these forests did miss out on decades of fire, and we are now lacking the 40-100 year old forests that would have grown in the wake of those fires. Here's Chip to explain how we see those effects on the landscape here:<br /><br />Chip: So in Grand Teton Park we average twelve wildland fires a year. Over half of those we automatically suppress, whether it's due to the cause, human caused, or near values that would be negatively affected like a built area, visitor center, or campground. Every one of those fires we put out is a missed opportunity on the landscape, when we're looking at it from the resource side. The net effect over 100 years is pretty significant. And what we're missing in the park may be some very large fires that would have grown had we not put them out, but more likely is a whole range of small-medium size fires that would have broken up even-aged stands of trees, provided those younger habitats that species depend on, and would have provided resiliency across the park.",

    "audioDescription": "Host: Hopefully, this tour has helped you learn about fire in Grand Teton, the ways we manage it, and how that's changed over time: from Native American burning, to the era of fire suppression and Smokey Bear, to a more scientific understanding of fire ecology. Perhaps you may even see fire in a different way than you did before.<br /><br />The northern part of Grand Teton, and much of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, have large areas of undeveloped land where fire can play its natural role-however dramatic that might be. Part of the National Park Service mission is to support natural ecological processes, which includes wildland fires. Fire can be scary and destructive when it impacts our homes and communities, but this is a place where we can learn to tolerate and support its ecological role. It's also an opportunity to study fire, to better understand how it behaves and how we can adapt our communities to live with fire. Perhaps we can even come to appreciate the beauty of burned forests-the lush green regrowth, colorful, vibrant wildflowers, tiny new tree seedlings, silvery trunks of standing dead trees, and the open skies above.<br /><br />Andy Norman, the fuels specialist on the Bridger-Teton National Forest, has been working in fire since the 1970s, largely in Jackson Hole. I asked him how fire management has changed during his career:<br /><br />Andy: You know, traditionally it was forest service policy that you if you had a wildfire, no matter how it started, you would order enough resources so that by 10am the next morning, the fire would be controlled. That was in place into the 1970s, and taking that away and changing that of course was a huge milestone. And then since then it's been incremental. The funny thing is, you hear read some of the articles and some of the discussions in the 70s, and it's like people are saying the same thing now. 40 years later, you know, \"fire management has to be part of land management planning\" and \"fire management has to be integrated with other resources.\" All these things that we're saying now, and you go back, and we were saying them back then. So we're getting there. We may have some bumps, especially with a big fire season and we think we might have to readjust or go a different way. But I think we're still slowly headed in the right direction.<br /><br />Host: One of the hardest things when talking about fire is that people often tend to ascribe feelings to it-whether you see it as good, bad, scary, or sad. Honestly, it can be hard not to, when you see the power of this force on the landscape. But when we're trying to make decisions, as a society, that way of viewing things isn't particularly helpful. I asked Chip Collins, the park's Fire Management Officer, what he thinks about this perspective:<br /><br /><br />Chip: I think that's a legacy of our own success with say Smokey Bear's messaging about preventing fire. Certainly we don't want human-caused fires and external fires on the landscape. But to ascribe good or bad to a fire, I think, is just the wrong perspective to take. Fire is inevitable. All of our landscapes out here regularly burn, and we've already shown that we're unsuccessful at trying to suppress all fires. We simply can't do that. And it's not good for the landscape anyways. But generally it seems like we ascribe those feelings based on a fire's impact to the human built environment or to people. And I think from the, you know, the wilderness and the landscape's perspective, it's neither good nor bad-it just is.<br /><br />Host: Thanks for listening to this audio tour, and be sure to look for others in the Grand Teton National Park app. If you'd like to learn more about wildland fire, explore the fire pages on our website, at www.nps.gov/grte/learn/nature/wildlandfire.htm or at tetonfires.com",

    "audioDescription": "Host: Welcome to the \"50 years of fire history\" audio tour. I'm Peri Sasnett, and I work on science media and outreach for the park. I'll be your host for this tour. The northern part of Grand Teton National Park has a rich fire history, and it's a great place to see and learn about how fire management has developed over the last 50 years. It's a large and remote area with few buildings, and it's managed as wilderness. And it's surrounded by Forest Service lands that provide a large buffer of wildlands, so the park can often support natural fires on the landscape.Many of the changes in fire management here over the last several decades parallel broader shifts across the U.S., even though the specifics of various forests and ecosystems may differ. As climate change contributes to fires becoming larger and more frequent, communities throughout the country are going to have to adapt to withstand these fires-especially since, as we've learned in the past, it's both impossible and unwise to attempt to remove fire from the landscape. The more we can learn about fire, in places like this with few developed areas where it can behave more or less naturally, the better we can understand it and learn to live with it.In this tour, we'll hear from fire managers and scientists about their perspectives on this dynamic landscape. We'll begin at Colter Bay and then move north, toward Flagg Ranch. First, we'll learn a bit about what's called our â€˜fire regime', which is our natural fire cycle in the lodgepole pine and mixed conifer forests of Grand Teton-such as the ones that surround the visitor center here. Basically, these forests are adapted to large, intense fires every 100-300 years. Most of the mature trees die in those so-called â€˜stand-replacing' fires, but they regenerate from seed afterward. Lodgepoles are especially well-adapted to fire because they have serotinous cones, which open with the heat of a fire. The little seeds take root on the bare mineral soil, which is cleared of vegetation by the fire, and thousands of little lodgepole seedlings take root. Here's Diane Abendroth, the park's fire ecologist, to tell you more about the park's fire regime:Diane: Some people have learned about fire ecology and they've learned about the story that comes from those Southwest ponderosa pine forests or maybe the pine forests in Florida where the idea is that. Fire used to burn in the understory of the forest and kind of clean up the regeneration there and open up the understory. But the overstory trees would survive the fire, and it would be kind of an open forest with a nice, park-like atmosphere, and that kind of forest needed regular fires to maintain itself. But here in the northern Rockies, it's a different fire regime. Our trees, they don't necessarily survive a fire very well, and sometimes fire can be pretty dramatic. The trees will torch up, we have crown fire, and patches of trees will just be scorched and then they'll die the next year, or maybe they'll be completely consumed. So while our forests aren't adapted to survive fire like they are in the Southwest, they are adapted to come back after a fire. And so their specialty is seedlings-and having a stand replacing fire just means that they're setting the stage for another generation.Host: Another aspect to consider about fire here, in addition to the ecology of the forests themselves, is how indigenous people influenced the landscape before Europeans arrived. Tribes in different ecosystems across the continent used fire in many ways and for many different purposes, but almost all of them performed some sort of strategic burning. Ron Steffens, a fire analyst for Grand Teton, can tell us more:Ron: There is documented use by Native Americans, that includes a whole variety of burn patterns and reasons to burn. One researcher identified 70 different types of ways that Native Americans would burn. And they wouldn't do all of that here, but certainly to support travel they would burn in spring. And so they would open up the dry slopes, and that was a good time to do kind of these burns. They could travel for five to ten years after a fire. They burned ridges for the same reason they burn for hunting, and also to get rid of mosquitoes. And I've read-I don't know if it was practice here-but in parts of Arizona, they would set a spring fire which would get rid of the mosquitoes, and the elk would come in because there's no mosquitoes and they couldn't see the hunters. And they would have a little elk meal as well as no bugs. So that the utility of fire on this landscape has a long long history.Host: You might wonder how we know about fires and fire cycles that were occurring hundreds or thousands of years ago. It takes a bit of investigating, according to Diane, but it is possible to figure out:Diane: Fire ecologists know that when settlers came to the west they did some things that interrupted the fire regime. They had grazing animals and they did fire suppression.",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside sits at the end of a long concrete aggregate sidewalk that leads west from the parking area. Just past the sign, the ground falls steeply down to a sagebrush flat edged by a band of trees in the middle distance. Still further are the peaks of the Tetons. The background photograph on the sign shows a close up view of Grand Teton summit flanked to the left by Middle Teton and to the right by Mount Owen. Just below the gap between Grand Teton and Mount Owen is a patch of white labeled Teton Glacier, with a grey area below it labeled moraine. On Middle Teton a vertical black line falls straight down from the peak. This is the Black Diabase Dike. To the right of that is a vertical white band labeled Middle Teton Glacier. Text on the panel reads, \"Shrinking Teton Glaciers. In the past 40 years the Teton, Teepee, and Middle Teton glaciers on the peaks in front of you have lost 25 percent of their total surface area. Glaciers show us that our climate changes. They serve as icy reservoirs, accumulating snow and ice during wet, cool years when people need less water and releasing more water into rivers in warm, dry years. Water runoff from the Teton Range provides wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and even irrigation for thirsty crops along the Snake River in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. \"This exhibit was made possible with a generous gift from the Grand Teton National Park Foundation.\"",

It hangs from a large wooden post structure in a base built of medium-sized stones. At the edge of the sidewalk bordering the turnout is a large, two-panel wayside sign hanging in a wooden post structure. The left hand panel shows a photo of mountain peaks at the top. Text reads, \"Explore Teton Country. Discover the magnificent landscape and wild communities of Grand Teton National Park. Here the Teton Range rises abruptly from the high mountain valley known as Jackson Hole. From bare alpine rocks to lush meadows and floodplains, the national park is home to bald eagles, grizzly bears, river otters, and bison.\" Underneath the photo is a quote: \"Today, come to this national park with an open mind, open eyes, and an open heart ... walk the trails ... canoe ... you may see a moose or two ... a great blue heron, a pair of trumpeter swans ... These quiet adventures will remain with you always.-Margaret E. \"Mardy\" Murie\" A band of photos across the middle of the panel show, from left to right, several canoes being paddled on smooth water with reflections of autumn trees, a group of schoolchildren in a meadow with a park ranger, a mother elk with her calf and a bright blue tent near a lake. Below these an inset photo shows a large moose crossing a road and at the bottom two hikers in a meadow with the mountain range in the distance. Additional text blocks read, \"Plan Your Visit.

Stop at visitor centers for orientation information, ranger-led activities, and interpretive exhibits. \"Be Extra Careful. Drive carefully, obey speed limits, and watch for wildlife on roads. Drivers hit and kill more than 100 large animals on park roads each year. Animals are wild. Do not feed or approach them. Stay more than 100 yards away from all large animals. \"Be \"Bear Aware.\" Black and grizzly bears can be anywhere in the park. Protect your food and toiletries from bears, even toothpaste and sunscreen. It all smells to a bear. Please be careful. Follow food storage regulations. Do not leave food unattended. Keep pets on a leash six feet long or less. Pets are not allowed on unpaved trails, the multi-use pathway or in the visitor centers.\" The center panel shows a map of the JDR Memorial Parkway and Grand Teton National Park. Your current location at the boundary between the two parks is marked with a red flag. At the top right is a photo of a bald eagle in flight. At the bottom right is a photo of an elk.

    "audioDescription": "This is a three-panel sign covered by a small roof. To your right, the dirt trail winds through the surrounding meadow towards the trees beyond with the mountain peaks rising further to the west.The center panel on the sign shows a map of the area at the base of the mountains south of Phelps Lake and Granite Canyon running westward just south of Mount Hunt. The map is oriented so that north is to the right. Moose Wilson Road runs along the bottom of the map. Your current location is at the bottom of the map, towards the left hand corner. Dotted lines show the trails that can be accessed from this location. The panel reads, \"Explore Your Park. Enjoy aspen and conifer forests, wildflower meadows and dramatic views as you hike in Granite Canyon. Glacial ice formed Granite Canyon ending 15,000 years ago. Ice carved metamorphic rock walls-originally thought to be granite-giving this canyon its name.\"DID YOU REMEMBER?- Sunscreen: The sun burns quickly at this elevation.- Clothing Layers: Weather can change suddenly.- Plenty of Food & Water: Avoid the dangers of dehydration and fatigue.- Bug Spray: Don't let mosquitoes ruin your trip.- Map & Watch: Avoid spending an unplanned night in the backcountry with careful planning and routefinding.- Bear Spray: Both grizzly and black bears thrive in Grand Teton National Park.\"RECOMMENDED ROUTES- Valley Trail Junction - Trail travels through forest and open sagebrush meadows to the mouth of Granite Canyon. MILEAGE ROUNDTRIP: 3.2 miles; DURATION: 1.5 hours; TOTAL ELEVATION CHANGE: 400 feet; DIFFICULTY: easy.- Phelps Lake - Trail meets up with the Valley Trail then travels along the base of the mountains to meet up with the Phelps Lake Trail. MILEAGE ROUNDTRIP: 9 miles; DURATION: 4.5 hours; TOTAL ELEVATION CHANGE: 1,700 feet; DIFFICULTY: moderate to strenuous.- Marion Lake - Follow Granite Creek to spectacular Marion Lake. Hike through lush forests to subalpine meadows. MILEAGE ROUNDTRIP: 18.5 miles; DURATION: 12 hours; TOTAL ELEVATION CHANGE: 3,700 feet; DIFFICULTY: very strenuous.\"* Duration and degree of difficulty will vary individually. For more trip suggestions ask at a visitor center.\"Stock Users - Inquire at a visitor center, ranger station or entrance station for regulations and trails open to stock.\"Emergencies - The nearest telephone is located at the Granite Canyon Entrance Station, about 1 mile southwest of here.\"Did You Know? Other than a handful of homesteaders in the early 1900s, Granite Canyon remained relatively unappreciated until the development of the ski area in 1966. Today the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort tram provides easy access to the Granite Canyon backcountry. The trails in this canyon are some of the newest constructed in Grand Teton National Park.\"The left hand panel has a photograph of a climber on the side of a rock face with a jagged peak visible in the background. Text reads, \"Protect the Backcountry. \"HIKING, CAMPING & STOCK USE- All overnight stays require a backcountry camping permit. Permits are available year-round at the visitor center in Moose, and during the summer at Jenny Lake Ranger Station and Colter Bay Visitor Center.- Pack out all trash. Keep the park litter-free for all to enjoy.- Stay on established trails. Shortcutting switchbacks damages plants and causes erosion.- Backcountry campfires are allowed ONLY at designated lakeshore sites and must be confined to metal grates or with a permit below the Jackson Lake high water line.- Backpackers must use park-approved bear-resistant canisters or food storage lockers when camping below 10,000 feet.- Saddle and pack animals must stay on authorized trails and may not graze in the park. Find out more at a visitor center.\"CLIMBING & MOUNTAINEERING- Registration is not required for technical climbing or mountaineering; however, a permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry.- Tell a friend or family member your plans and when you expect to return.- During summer visit the Jenny Lake Ranger Station for details on climbing routes and current conditions.- Follow low impact climbing ethics. Leave the rock in its natural condition. Avoid placing permanent protection. Motorized drills are prohibited.- RESOURCE PROTECTION & FIREARMS- Leave the park as you found it for others to enjoy. Picking wildflowers or collecting any object is prohibited.- Hikers must be prepared for wildlife encounters. Do not approach or harass animals. Stay at least 300 feet from large mammals such as moose, bison, elk or bears for your safety and theirs.- Wildlife often bite the hand that feeds them-do not feed any animal, including squirrels, chipmunks and birds.- Vehicles, including bicycles and strollers, are prohibited on trails or off established roads or- designated pathways. Wheelchairs and any type of assistive technology are allowed on trails.- Inquire at a visitor center for firearm regulations.

    "bodyText": "<p>Fire is part of natural western landscapes. Fire helps regenerate the ecosystem by clearing dense underbrush and opening up the forest to sunlight. The Huck Fire was one of many fires during the summer of 1988 that burned across Yellowstone and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Today, notice younger, smaller lodgepole pines and subalpine fir interspersed with older, taller trees. Standing and fallen dead trees remind us that in these semi-arid environments vegetation decays slowly. The patchwork or mosaic here highlights the changes brought about by fire.</p> <h3>Name Origin</h3> <p>One of the many fires sparked during the summer of 1988 - the year of the large wildland fires in Yellowstone National Park. Gale-force winds blew a tree into power lines sparking the fire on Black Saturday, August 20, 1988. The fire was named for nearby Huckleberry Mountain.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Fire: A new Beginning. 247 words<br /><br />This Wayside faces a low ridge with a meadow at its base. Directly in front of you, the ridge has small conifers growing with some dead trees on the ground and some still standing. To your right is a clear line where an older conifer forest begins. <br /><br />The background photograph on the panel shows a blackened, burned section of forest with an elk grazing on patches of brown vegetation in the foreground. The caption reads, \"Animals, like this elk, frequent recently burned areas.\" Other text reads, \"Fire may seem like the death of a forest, but insects, birds and mammals return soon-just as they did after a wildfire swept through this area in 1988. Free from competition for nutrients and sunshine, new plants transform the mineral-rich soil into a lush carpet. Animals thrive in dense new meadows of native grasses and shrubs. They find shelter in burned tree snags and surrounding forested areas. Fires create new homes, such as snags and downed trees, for wildlife.\"<br /><br />In the upper right of the panel are two round, inset photos. The upper one shows an aerial view of a forest with both black and green areas. The caption reads, \"Fires burn with varying intensity, leaving a mosaic of burned and unburned vegetation. This combination provides forage and cover for a variety of animals.\"<br /><br />The other photo shows a great grey owl perched on a fallen log. It stares directly at us, its feathers fluffed out.<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>Jackson Lake is a 400 foot-deep natural lake with a dam added on top. The original log-crib dam constructed in 1906-07, failed in 1910. In 1916, the Bureau of Reclamation completed a concrete dam raising the pool level by 39 feet. The increased water level flooded the surrounding forest, drowning many trees. Young men from the Civilian Conservation Corps helped to clear the shores of Jackson Lake and burn the slash piles during the Great Depression. Today, enjoy the views across Jackson Lake or fish in the Snake River below the dam.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>A log crib dam first impounded water in 1906 with a storage capacity of 300,000 acre feet. The dam failed in 1910. An earthen dam replaced the log crib in 1916 to raise the natural lake level by 39 feet increasing the capacity to 790,000 acre feet. In 1917, the channel was dredged downstream to further increase the reservoir capacity to 847,000 acre feet. During the 1980s, engineers drained the reservoir and reinforced the dam to withstand a M7.5 earthquake.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This overlook is just south of Jackson Lake Dam, along the edge of the lake. As you face the lake, the dam lies to your right with the road crossing over it. From this angle you can see about 20 vertical concrete pillars supporting the roadway. The lake stretches out to your left. There are 5 wayside signs here. The first is on the edge of the lake near the road. The other four are in a covered pavilion along a paved path to the left.The first sign is titled, \"Hoist Those Gates!\" To the left and behind the sign is an actual historic gate hoist with its engine on a rolling cart. The cart is about 3 feet wide and 8 feet long, From the end nearest the lake, a gear shaft extends to the right connecting to multiple gears, the largest one being almost 3 feet in diameter. Feel free to touch this mechanism.Text on the sign reads, \"Gates Control Flow. Fifteen 2.5-ton gates at the base of Jackson Lake Dam control the reservoir level by controlling the amount of water released. This is done by raising and lowering the gates. The reservoir is not filled when there is flood danger, leaving room to store water. During summer, water is discharged at a controlled rate to benefit agriculture and recreation.\"Hoisting the Gates. Modernized now, this type of gate hoist was manually operated from 1911 to 1986. The dam tender moved the engine cart along rails on top of the dam to the chosen gate. The drive shaft on the hoist engine and the drive collar on the reduction gears were engaged. This series of gears served to either raise or lower the gate.\"Imagine manipulating these immense gates by pushing the cart to the gate, starting the engine with the crank, engaging the shafts, then raising the gate and watching the water shoot out the tunnels below the dam.\"Above the text in the upper left of the graphic is an aerial photograph of the dam with four of the gates open, water rushing down the spillway. Along the right side of the sign are three other photographs. The top one is a picture of workers replacing the sluice gate hoists in 1941. We look along the top of the dam, the gear shafts over the first four gates in a line. After those four, workers stand on the right with a crane on the left.The middle picture shows an engine cart from winter 1975. It stands on rails in the snow along the edge of the dam, the gears just visible in the far right of the photo.The bottom picture from the same time period shows the shaft engaging the gears.The pavilion along the path to the left is surrounded by waist-high stone walls with openings on either side and is covered with a shingle roof. There is a small step up to the concrete floor. On the lake side are mounted 4 wayside signs. On the opposite side is a bench. From left to right, the first sign is titled, \"Irrigating Idaho.\" Text down the left side reads, \"Creating Farmland. The Reclamation Act of 1902 provided the means for the government to fund, design and operate irrigation projects. The Reclamation Service was created to implement the program. Most early irrigation projects were built by private businessmen. Many lacked engineering expertise and enough funding.\"Sagebrush Alchemy. Today the Minidoka Project provided irrigation water to southeast Idaho. Jackson Lake Dam is one of 9 dams that irrigate over 1.2 million acres. Land, now fertile, once was sagebrush flats. The annual value of irrigated crops exceeds $500 million. Jackson Lake Dam is farthest upstream. Irrigators rarely draw their full share of water allowing Jackson Lake Reservoir to remain above natural lake level.\"In the center of the sign is a round inset with a drawing of snowflakes. Text reads, \"Snow Means Water. The biggest variable is unpredictable annual precipitation. Since 1919, snow surveys have helped predict the amount of water that will be available.\"The right side and bottom of the sign is filled with a map of the project, stretching westward from Jackson Lake Dam.The second sign is titled, \"Depending on Water.\" Text down the left side reads, \"Before irrigating downstream farm lands, Jackson Lake water provides great recreation. From power boating to sailing, recreation abounds. Fishing and rafting are popular below the dam. All activities are affected by the release of water.\"Fishing. Fish depend on insects for food year round. If winter water levels expose river gravels, insect populations can dry up. Winter reservoir operations help maintain flows supporting insects, fish and good summer fishing.\"Wildlife. The reservoir provides wildlife a reliable source of downstream water, even in dry years. Low water can expose beaver and muskrat dens or duck nests, making them accessible to predators.\"A large photograph filling most of the sign shows an aerial view of the dam taken in 1984. The dam itself lies at the bottom right of the picture with Jackson Lake extending out behind it to the base of the Teton Range.A small inset in the upper right shows a sketch of six people in a rubber raft. Text reads, \"Rafting",

Adjoining federal, state, and private lands increase the size of this ecosystem, which is essential to free-roaming wildlife.\" More text at the bottom left of the panel reads, \"Help Protect Park Resources. Wild animals are wild. Do not feed or touch them. Give animals plenty of space. Walk on trails to avoid crushing plants and flowers. Store food and dispose of litter properly. Drive carefully. Watch for animals on the roads. Pets must be leashed. No pets are allowed on trails or in the backcountry.\" Along the bottom of the panel are line drawings of two ground squirrels, a crane and a beaver.

The scale in the vertical direction has been exaggerated to clearly show the elevation differences of the different formations. A label marks your current location down in the valley at the northern end of Jackson Lake. Behind you to the east is the Absaroka Range, created by earlier volcanic activity. Across Jackson Lake the Teton Range rises. The caption reads, \"The Teton Range towers over the valley called Jackson Hole. Motion on the Teton fault generated massive earthquakes that lifted the mountains skyward and caused the valley to slip downward.\" West of the Tetons another caption reads, \"West of the Tetons, the Snake River Plain rises to meet the Yellowstone Plateau, concealing past volcanic explosions still evident in Yellowstone's landscape.\" At the upper left of the image is the Gros Ventre Range. The caption reads, \"To the southeast, compression thrust up the Gros Ventre Range long before the Teton Range formed.\" Text in the bottom right reads, \"Powerful geologic forces-including earthquakes, volcanoes, and glaciers-shaped this landscape. These mountain ranges formed in different ways, but ice-age glaciers scoured all of them and left behind lakes, U-shaped canyons, cirques, jagged ridges, and outwash plains.\" The wayside at the left end of the turn out is titled, \"Recognizing the Value of Fire\" It shows a photograph of large plumes of smoke billowing up over a conifer forest with mountain peaks in the background. The caption reads, \"The Waterfalls Canyon fire burned 3,672 acres. Since 1974, many wildfires have burned on these slopes. Some were fought, but most have been allowed to run their course.\" A photo in the lower left corner shows a person wearing a hard hat and a harness slung with a variety of equipment and instruments, facing a fire in a forested area. The caption reads, \"A fire-effects monitor collects weather data, documents fire behavior, and notes smoke dispersal-all important parts of managing a wildfire.\" Text at the top reads, \"After more than 50 years of putting out all fires in national parks, the National Park Service realized that natural fires promoted healthier forests. When a bolt of lightning struck the hillside across from you in July 1974, rangers allowed the fire to burn. Months later, winter snowfalls put it out. \"That summer-long Waterfalls Canyon fire sparked heated debates. People living near the Tetons called the new decision a \"scorched earth\" policy. Articles in The New York Times, Christian Science Monitor, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and Time drummed up controversy across the nation. Many people supported the science-based decision for natural fire. Allowing occasional natural fires opens the forest canopy and promotes plant growth. It removes dead trees and logs, and improves safety for people who live near places that are fire-prone.\"",

    "audioDescription": "Along side the paved parking lot at this turnout is a wide aggregate sidewalk bordered by a three-foot high stone wall. On the far side of the wall the land falls steeply down through dark green conifers to the edge of the lake. The lake here is small and oval-shaped, the water a bright blue on clear days. It nestles at the base of the Teton Range, with the mountains seeming to rise directly out of the water. Directly across the lake is a deep canyon extending back between Teewinot Mountain on your left and Mount St. John on your right. Towards the right end of the sidewalk is a wayside sign. About mid-way along the wall is an opening where paths lead to a lower walkway. In the sidewalk pavement at this point are footprints left by a wandering moose. The path down the bank splits into two paths. The right hand fork descends in broad, shallow steps. The fork to the left descends a long ramp. Both lead to a stone-edged sidewalk overlooking the lake with log benches along the side away from the lake. The background image on the wayside sign is a color photograph of the canyon and mountains in front of you. Text on the left reads, \"Jenny Lake. Across Jenny Lake from here, Cascade Canyon slices through the heart of the Teton Range. Before Pleistocene glaciers carved out the U-shape canyon we see today, streams initially cut a V-shaped canyon. Glaciers act like belt-sanders. Glacial ice flowing downhill picks up rocky debris that grinds away the bedrock broadening and deepening the canyon. \"Around 20,000 years ago, the last glacier flowed out of this canyon onto the valley floor bulldozing out a depression. As the ice melted, rocky debris carried by the glacier deposited as ridges called moraines. Today, moraines form the natural dams around lakes such as Jenny, Leigh and Jackson fed by remnant glaciers and snowmelt.\" Below the text is an historical photograph showing a man standing in front of a teepee on the left. He wears a beard and holds a long rifle. A dark-haired woman sits on the ground by the teepee along with three young children. An older child sits on one of a pair of donkeys at the right. The caption reads, \"Jenny was the Shoshone Indian wife of Richard \"Beaver Dick\" Leigh, a trapper who served as guide for the 1872 Hayden Expedition.\" At the bottom right corner of the panel is a drawing showing a three-dimensional cross section view of a mountainside with a glacier. At the right side a circular ice field below higher peaks is labeled a cirque. Further down to the left is a glacier shown as an icy river. Around its lower edge is a line of debris labeled as a moraine. Still further at the left edge of the drawing is a flat area showing branching water flow from the melting ice on the outwash plain. The caption reads, \"Jenny Lake is more than 250 feet deep indicating the power of glaciers to sculpt the landscape.\"",

    "audioDescription": "There is a large, three-panel sign located near the pathway providing information on safety, park regulations and a map. The center panel shows a map of the pathway between Moose Junction in the south and the southern end of Jenny Lake in the north. The pathway runs alongside the Teton Park Road for most of this stretch, only diverging slightly to the west as it approaches Jenny Lake Visitor Center. The title on the right hand panel reads, \"No Pets on Pathway\" and shows a picture of a dog with the universal not-allowed symbol of a red circle with a line across it. The text reads, \"PETS ARE NOT PERMITTED on the park pathway. Guide dogs-used for the sole purpose of aiding a person with physical disability-may travel on the pathway. The pathway travels through sensitive wildlife areas. \"Why Are Pets Not Allowed? For the wildlife and for your safety. Wildlife such as bears, wolves or coyotes may be drawn to pets and their owners. A surprise encounter with wildlife may result in death or injury to pets, wildlife or visitors. Pets may escape and quickly become prey. Dogs cause the same stress responses in prey species (such as elk and pronghorn) as predators do. Transmittable diseases, such as parvovirus, from infected feces may live in the soil for months, passing on to wildlife. \"WHERE CAN PETS GO? \"OUTSIDE THE PARK Jackson Hole Community Pathways except on the National Elk Refuge. Bridger-Teton National Forest trails-Shadow Mountain, Gros Ventre River, Snow King, Cache Creek, Phillips Canyon and Teton Pass. Snake River dike, at the intersection of highways WY 22 & 390 in Wilson. \"INSIDE THE PARK \"In general, leashed pets may go anywhere a car may go-roads and road shoulders, campgrounds, picnic areas, and parking lots. Pets must be in control and restrained on a leash no longer than six feet in length.\" At the bottom of the panel are photographs of a bull moose and a male sage grouse, its large white chest puffed up. The text reads, \"SAGEBRUSH COMMUNITY. The drought-tolerant plants of the sagebrush community thrive despite porous, cobbly soils and intense sunlight. These flowering plants form one of the most colorful and diverse communities in the park. Sagebrush provides a mosaic of food and shelter for a variety of animals.\" The panel on the left is titled \"Protect Your Park.\" In a light green color block at the top left there is a photograph of two people on bicycles on the path with Grand Teton in the background. Text reads, \"How to Ride. Only NON-MOTORIZED METHODS of transportation are permitted on the multi-use pathway. Persons with physical disabilities may use electric and battery-operated transportation. Horses are not permitted on the pathway, except on the Snake River bridge in Moose. Travel single file in the right-side lane; share the pathway. Notify other recreators before you pass. Be aware of others passing you. The use of portable audio devices is strongly discouraged. Obey all traffic signs. Yield to all vehicles. Yield to slower recreators. Wear a helmet. Stay on paved pathway; no shortcutting through vegetation. Absolutely no pets allowed. Respect the rights of all users.\" In the center of the panel is a photograph of a small herd of pronghorn . The caption reads, \"Help wildlife thrive. NEVER FEED, APPROACH OR HARASS WILDLIFE-especially large mammals. Stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from other animals. Be prepared for wildlife interactions; be prepared to stop.\" At the bottom of the panel is a photograph of two bears standing in snow at the edge of a pond, drinking. The caption reads, \"Be Bear Aware. Grizzly and black bears may become aggressive when surprised or in defense of young. Stay alert and make bears aware of your presence. Follow food storage regulations: never leave your backpack, pannier or any item with food unattended. Carry and know how to use bear spray.\" There are two smaller photograph in a border down the right side of the panel. The first one shows an elk with a full set of antlers. The caption reads, \"When to Ride. The multi-use pathway is CLOSED from dusk to dawn for wildlife and public safety.\" The bottom photo shows a single tree backlit by a sun low in the sky. The caption reads, \"Leave No Trace. The park PROHIBITS PICKING, COLLECTING OR DESTROYING park resources. Leave all plants, animals and artifacts as you found them for other visitors to enjoy. Stay on the designated pathway to help preserve the park.\"",

    "audioDescription": "The ranger station is west of the Northeast parking lot. The path leading to it is paved, but there are rough spots and breaks in the asphalt. The building is a one-room log cabin, painted dark brown with dark green trim. A white-lettered sign that reads \"Jenny Lake Ranger Station\" hangs from the peak of the roof in front. There are three steps up to the narrow planked porch across the front of the building. The door is in the middle of the front wall, directly opposite the steps. To the left of the steps stands a small sign. It has an historic photograph of a man in park uniform hiking across a snowy stretch near a mountain summit. The caption reads, \"Park Ranger Phil Smith on mountain patrol, 1930s.\" The main text reads, \"Mountain Rescue. In the 1930s, this rustic cabin served as the park's first ranger station and museum. This park's tradition of hiring skilled climbers to perform mountain rescues dates from the 1940s. Rangers still provide backcountry information here and, when necessary, rescue lost and injured hikers and climbers.\" Looking away from the Ranger Station you can see the Jenny Lake Visitor Center (Crandall Studio) to the west of the General Store. A log cabin similar in construction to the Ranger Station, this building is not accessible during the 2016-2017 seasons due to construction here at Jenny Lake.",

    "audioDescription": "This turnout is on the boundary between Yellowstone National Park to the north and the John D Rockefeller Memorial Parkway to the south. Young conifer woods and open meadows lie on either side of the road. The Snake River can be seen to the east of the road. At the edge of the sidewalk bordering the turnout is a large, three-panel wayside sign hanging in a wooden post structure. The left hand panel shows a photo of mountain peaks at the top. Text reads, \"Explore Teton Country. Discover the magnificent landscape and wild communities of Grand Teton National Park. Here the Teton Range rises abruptly from the high mountain valley known as Jackson Hole. From bare alpine rocks to lush meadows and floodplains, the national park is home to bald eagles, grizzly bears, river otters, and bison.\" Underneath the photo is a quote: \"Today, come to this national park with an open mind, open eyes, and an open heart ... walk the trails ... canoe ... you may see a moose or two ... a great blue heron, a pair of trumpeter swans ... These quiet adventures will remain with you always.-Margaret E. \"Mardy\" Murie\" A band of photos across the middle of the panel show, from left to right, several canoes being paddled on smooth water with reflections of autumn trees, a group of schoolchildren in a meadow with a park ranger, a mother elk with her calf and a bright blue tent near a lake. Below these an inset photo shows a large moose crossing a road and at the bottom two hikers in a meadow with the mountain range in the distance. Additional text blocks read, \"Plan Your Visit. Pick up a map and newspaper at any entrance station or visitor center to help plan your trip. Stop at visitor centers for orientation information, ranger-led activities, and interpretive exhibits. \"Be Extra Careful. Drive carefully, obey speed limits, and watch for wildlife on roads. Drivers hit and kill more than 100 large animals on park roads each year. Animals are wild. Do not feed or approach them. Stay more than 100 yards away from all large animals. Be \"Bear Aware.\" Black and grizzly bears can be anywhere in the park. Protect your food and toiletries from bears, even toothpaste and sunscreen. It all smells to a bear. Please be careful. Follow food storage regulations. Do not leave food unattended. Keep pets on a leash six feet long or less. Pets are not allowed on unpaved trails, the multi-use pathway or in the visitor centers.\" The center panel shows a map of the JDR Memorial Parkway and Grand Teton National Park. Your current location at the northern boundary is marked with a red flag. At the top right is a photo of a bald eagle in flight. At the bottom right is a photo of an elk. At the top right of the third panel is a photograph of John D. Rockefeller and his first wife Abby with the Tetons in the background on a visit in 1931. At the bottom of the panel is a photo of the mountains with a small wooden building in the foreground. Text on the panel reads, \"Enjoy Rockefeller's Legacy. Had it not been for John D. Rockefeller, Jr., this park would not include much of the Jackson Hole valley. He donated over 33,000 acres, bringing Grand Teton National Park to 310,000 acres of land preserved for all to enjoy. \"Concerned that development threatened the spectacular views of the Tetons and lakes, Rockefeller formed the Snake River Land Company to buy property in the valley to donate to the National Park Service. His gift served as a catalyst for Grand Teton National Park's expansion in 1950. In recognition of his philanthropy here and at other national parks, the U.S. Congress created the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, which links Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. \"The marvelous scenic beauty of the Teton Mountains and the Lakes at their feet ... this valley is the natural ... feeding place for the game which inhabits ... the surrounding region. - John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s \"two reasons\" for purchasing lands in the valley.\" Across the middle of the panel is a band of historic photos. The first one on the left shows a long ranch house of log construction. The caption reads, \"The Snake River Land Company purchased the Hogan ranch in 1930 and used it as its local headquarters and residence.\" Next is a photo of National Park Service Director Horace Albright, who worked closely with Rockefeller, speaking at the dedication of the national park in 1929. The third photo shows two men and a woman, sitting on the ground, roasting bits of food over a camp fire. The caption reads, \"Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller enjoy a picnic in 1931 with Samuel Woodring, Grand Teton's first superintendent.\"",

Finally, we boarded [another] train up to Victor, arriving in the morning for the total excitement of the Teton Range emerging, turned backwards, over the Idaho foothills; and then at last came the disembarkation to the waiting wagon, or, later on, the truck. The trip was miserable, enthralling, exhausting-an experience. And finally, the blessed clean, cool quietness of the ranch, loud at night with the sound of the river, brilliant by day with flowers and butterflies. No wonder that when Easterners went through all that, they felt that they had gotten somewhere-somewhere important, exotic, isolated and special, well worth the trip-but on the other hand, made worthwhile by that trip.\"",

    "bodyText": "<p>The spring averages only 80 degrees Fahrenheit, cool compared to hot springs. Families often picnic on the grassy meadow surrounding the pool. Entering the warm spring is not recommended. In spring, bison and elk linger by the pool since the grass greens up early. Over the years, people have released their unwanted tropical fish into the pool disrupting the ecosystem. Some of these non-native species thrive and out-compete native species. Please do not release non-native fish into the spring. Be aware the pool contains high levels of <strong>E. coli</strong> and the presence of <strong>Naegleria fowleri</strong> .</p> <h3>Name Origin</h3> <p>Founded by William Kelly when he built a sawmill in 1907. The town was nearly voted the county seat for Teton County in 1925. That same year a massive landslide dammed the Gros Ventre River forming Lower Slide Lake. Two years later the natural dam failed, flooding the town and killing six people. Only two buildings remained standing.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This wayside sits at the edge of a gravel parking area separated from the road by round logs. As you face the sign, the pond is across the road in front of you. The narrow, two-laned road is paved, with no curbs. On the other side of the road a grassy path leads through a split-rail fence down a gentle slope to the water. Large patches of algae grow on the surface.<br /><br />The background image on the sign is a photograph of the pond showing the algae growth. Text reads, \"Protect Kelly Warm Spring. Kelly Warm Spring is a relatively new feature on the Jackson Hole landscape. While the source of the thermal water is geologically quite old, the pools came into existence during the past century. When the dam created by the Gros Ventre slide failed in 1927 and flooded the town of Kelly, the hydrology of this area drastically changed.<br /><br />\"In recent years, non-native species-including pet fish and amphibians such as bullfrogs-have been released into Kelly Warm Spring. Non-native species may seem innocuous, but they damage much more than the water feature in front of you. Kelly Warm Spring flows directly into Ditch Creek-a tributary of the Snake River and home to the ecosystem's only native trout, Snake River cutthroat trout. Non-native aquatic nuisance species can out-compete native organisms, introduce diseases, degrade habitat, and prey on eggs and larvae of native species. As non-native species spread into other waters, they threaten the existence of the Snake River cutthroat trout and other native plants and wildlife.<br /><br />\"The National Park Service is committed to protecting the Kelly Warm Spring and other thermal features for generations to come. Federal law prohibits the introduction of non-native species. Please help protect these waters by never releasing exotic species here.<br /><br />\"Warning: Periodic water tests at this location have shown high levels of the bacteria E. coli. Swim at your own risk.\"<br /><br />A photograph to the left of the text shows a gold fish that measures 12 inches long. The caption reads, \"When released into the wild, aquarium fish grow to enormous sizes and become unwanted predators on native fish.\"<br />",

He settled in the south part of the Jackson Hole valley in the 1880s. Before 1900, he established Leek's \"clubhouse\" on the north end of Leigh Lake and then Leek's Camp on the east shore of Jackson Lake as hunting and fishing camps. Later, Leek took photographs of starving and dying elk during the winter of 1908-09. He used these images in lectures, articles and tours to help publicize the dilemma. In 1912, Congress established the National Elk Refuge to provide wintering grounds for elk.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Host: Over the past ten or so years, fire managers across the West have been seeing larger fires and more extreme fire behavior. This is largely driven by a changing climate, which brings hotter temperatures, drier summers, and longer fire seasons. Here in Greater Yellowstone, we are see not only larger, but more frequent fires. Earlier in this century, managers could rely on areas that had burned in the last 50 years or so to stop or slow the progression of a new fire. But now, they're observing that forests that burned just 10-30 years ago can carry fire, under the right conditions-and we're getting those conditions more and more often. Here's Monica Turner, a fire ecologist from the University of Wisconsin who's studied these forests since 1988, to tell us what this may mean for the future:<br /><br />Monica: Why would more frequent fires be a problem for forests in Grand Teton? It takes some time for the trees to grow big enough to start producing the cones that provide the seeds that allow forests to recover after a wildfire. If the forest burns again before it has had enough time to grow big enough and produce enough of a cone crop, we might not have enough seeds to regenerate the forest. We've seen the effects of that in the 2016 Berry Fire in Grand Teton, where it re burned areas of the Glade Fire. We've seen a drastic reduction in the number of seedling trees that have come back into those areas where we had only 16 year old trees burn, primarily because they haven't had enough time to build up that seed crop.<br /><br />Host: Another factor that Monica has observed is that in some locations, even when a mature forest burns and there are plenty of seeds, it's becoming too hot for those seedlings to germinate and survive.<br /><br />These changes will not only impact these ecological processes, but also how we manage fires, and how we understand the presence of past fires on the landscape. Here, Ron Steffens, a fire analyst for the park, discusses how the Berry Fire, in 2016, interacted with areas that had burned in 1988. Up until that year, very few fires had re-burned any of the regrowth from â€˜88.<br /><br />Ron: We learned on the berry fire that our ability to utilize past fires as areas that slow a fire can sometimes be overcome by the intensity of the weather conditions and the fuel. So in that case some of the prior burned areas were burned through again, and this was with multiple days of high winds of 25-35 miles per hour, and fires that were crossing parts of the Snake River, burning into particularly the 1988 fires and slowing there, but in areas that had burned more recently the fire did not slow down. And it became a different type of fire when it was burning in younger fuel. But it slowed some but it did not stop. So we're seeing now. At a time when we're tracking and monitoring change in the climate that we may be seeing more frequent fire potential in our ecosystem and our bio region because we have more days that are drier. The days may stay drier at night and less humidity recovery, so that the fires are burning further into the night than we've seen in the past. And that may be one of the effects of a change in the climate.<br /><br />Host: As the way fires behave on the landscape changes, that will affect the way staff make decisions about how to manage them. Here's Diane Abendroth, the park's fire ecologist, reflecting on what they might look like:<br /><br />Diane: When I started my career in western Wyoming in fire, we used to think that fire was scarce, and in order to have a properly functioning ecosystem we needed to introduce more of it on the landscape. That maybe we'd been suppressing it too much and changing the vegetation to the point where there's just not enough of that early forest out there. And so in my work, we really encouraged people to allow some fires to burn where it was safe to do so, and also we did a lot of prescribed fire. And 20 to 25 years later, it seems like with the climate and with the way fires are burning, maybe we need to start thinking about the unburned forests being the rarity on the landscape. And I think that's a...kind of interesting but daunting change.",

There is perhaps no climbing area in the country that can match the Teton Range for alpine mountaineering with excellent rock, moderate snow and, above all, accessibility. Every year thousands of climbers begin their journey here to the Grand Teton summit. Whether you came to hike or climb, these trails provide some of the best views of the range's central peaks.\"DID YOU REMEMBER?- Sunscreen: The sun burns quickly at this elevation.- Clothing Layers: Weather can change suddenly.- Plenty of Food & Water: Avoid the dangers of dehydration and fatigue.- Bug Spray: Don't let mosquitoes ruin your trip.- Map & Watch: Avoid spending an unplanned night in the backcountry with careful planning and routefinding.- Bear Spray: Both grizzly and black bears thrive in Grand Teton National Park.\"RECOMMENDED ROUTES- Valley Trail - Hike through forest and meadow to meet with the Valley Trail, continue south to Bradley Lake. MILEAGE ROUNDTRIP: 6.4 miles; DURATION: 4 hours; TOTAL ELEVATION CHANGE: 1,350 feet; DIFFICULTY: moderate.- Surprise and Amphitheater Lakes - Hike along a moraine and up switchbacks through forest and meadows to two alpine lakes. Watch for bears, frequently seen along this trail. MILEAGE ROUNDTRIP: 10 miles; DURATION: 6 hours; TOTAL ELEVATION CHANGE: 3,150 feet; DIFFICULTY: strenuous.- Garnet Canyon - Trail climbs up switchbacks to Garnet Canyon for excellent valley views and access to the central peaks. MILEAGE ROUNDTRIP: 8.2 miles; DURATION: 5 hours; TOTAL ELEVATION CHANGE: 2,650 feet; DIFFICULTY: strenuous.\"Risk and Responsibility - Like other recreational pursuits, climbing carries inherent personal risk. It is the responsibility of the individual climber to minimize risk by exercising good judgment and making sure he/she has the proper mountaineering skills necessary to survive in an alpine environment.\"* Duration and degree of difficulty will vary individually. For more trip suggestions ask at a visitor center.\"Stock Users - Inquire at a visitor center, ranger station or entrance station for regulations and trails open to stock.\"Emergencies - The nearest telephone is located at the Jenny Lake Visitor Center, about 2 1/2 miles north of here.\"Did You Know? Paul Petzoldt began guiding aspiring climbers within days of his own first ascent of the Grand Teton in 1924. Early clients that year included William Owen - who in 1898 claimed the first documented ascent of the Grand. Petzoldt and his partner Glenn Exum established an American guiding tradition, teaching climbing techniques to clients rather than shepherding them to the top.\"The left hand panel has a photograph of a climber on the side of a rock face with a jagged peak visible in the background.

Permits are available year-round at the visitor center in Moose, and during the summer at Jenny Lake Ranger Station and Colter Bay Visitor Center.- Pack out all trash. Keep the park litter-free for all to enjoy.- Stay on established trails. Shortcutting switchbacks damages plants and causes erosion.- Backcountry campfires are allowed ONLY at designated lakeshore sites and must be confined to metal grates or with a permit below the Jackson Lake high water line.- Backpackers must use park-approved bear-resistant canisters or food storage lockers when camping below 10,000 feet.- Saddle and pack animals must stay on authorized trails and may not graze in the park. Find out more at a visitor center.\"CLIMBING & MOUNTAINEERING- Registration is not required for technical climbing or mountaineering; however, a permit is required for all overnight stays in the backcountry.- Tell a friend or family member your plans and when you expect to return.- During summer visit the Jenny Lake Ranger Station for details on climbing routes and current conditions.- Follow low impact climbing ethics.

The alarmed meeting participants discussed ways to save the valley from tawdry exploitation. They agreed that some sort of preserve would be necessary to protect the \"Old West\" character of the valley, though their concept of a preserve was different from a national park. The group decided to seek a wealthy individual who would be willing to buy private land to donate to the preserve -- that person was John D.

    "audioDescription": "From the parking lot at Dornans Service District a paved trail leads down to the east side of the river and the ferry crossing. There are three wayside signs along the trail. From the first sign at the edge of the parking lot, a brushy meadow stretches out in front of you to a thin line of trees at the waters edge. The right side of the sign shows a map of the area with the Teton Range to the west, the valley of Jackson Hole to the east and Menor's Ferry along the Snake River in the middle. An inset photograph shows a historic image of the ferry crossing the river carrying a wagon and team of horses.Text on the left reads, \"Menor's Ferry Historic District. This area was settled by two brothers, Bill and Holiday Menor, originally from Ohio. Bill settled on the west side of the river in 1894 and established an important river crossing with his ferry. Holiday followed in 1905 and eventually homesteaded on the east side, just across the river from his brother.\"Jackson Hole was one of the last areas of the West to be settled, probably because its geographic isolation, harsh climate, and high elevation were not conducive to agriculture. The first settlers came in 1884, and by 1888 Jackson Hole had a population of 20 men, two women, and one child. During the 1890s Mormon settlers came from Idaho and Utah. Many of them crossed the Snake River at Menors' Ferry and settled just east of here in an area the called Grovont, now known as Mormon Row. The census of June 1, 1900 revealed that 638 people lived in the valley of Jackson Hole; the major occupation was farming.\"At the bottom left are small portraits of two men. Bill Menor is on the left and Holiday Menor on the right.About halfway down the gently sloped paved trail is another wayside just to the right of the walkway. It looks out over a scrubby meadow with a high bank on the right and the trees lining the river on the left. The background image on the panel shows a historic photograph of the same view. A dirt tack runs along the base of the bank towards three small log buildings with a larger, framed barn in the background. Text reads, \"Holiday Menor's Homestead. Holiday Menor first came to Jackson Hole in 1905 after working as a gold prospector in Montana. He lived with his brother Bill until 1908, when he established a 160-acre homestead on this land. He grew wheat, barley, and alfalfa, which he sold to ranchers to feed to their cattle during the long harsh winters.He also built a limekiln that was used for several days each year to burn the limestone he quarried from Blacktail Butte. Lime was important to settlers; they mixed it with sand and water to make mortar for chinking log cabins and for laying bricks and stonework. Lime was also used as a whitewash (see Bill's cabin across the river) and to reduce odors in outhouses. About 250 bushels of lime, which sold for 50 cents a bushel, were produced each year.\"At the top right of the panel is a small historic photo of a man wearing a hat ad a black vest, leaning against a log wall. The caption reads, \"Holiday sold his homestead to the Snake River Land Company in 1928 and joined Bill, who had already retired and was living in San Diego, California.\"At the bottom left of the panel is an illustration of a lime kiln. A tall shaft, surrounded by dirt, is full of white stones. At the bottom a stack of wood burns. The caption reads, \"From Limestone to Pure Lime. Cooking lime involved an enormous amount of work. Holiday Menor dug his frontier-style kiln into the edge of a dirt bank. Lined with bricks and rocks, the rounded chamber rose 30 feet. Limestone was loaded in from the top. Inside a second chamber housed the fire. A limestone \"burn\" required round-the-clock vigilance. Stacks of firewood were fed through a draw door to maintain white hot temperatures. Once the ashes were cooled, this pure lime could be packed in barrels.\"Close to the water's edge, near the bottom of the trail, just past a row of benches to the left of the walkway, is an open roofed structure covering an old boat-shaped, wooden pontoon. It is supported by a wooden frame and surrounded by a fence. The pontoon is about 30 feet long and is mostly intact, its sides covered with weathered green paint. A small sign at the front of the structure shows an historic photograph of an old automobile full of people being carried across the river on the ferry. Text reads, \"Water Powered. Bill Menor began operating a ferry here in 1894. Menor's ferry provided one of the most important points of access to the land west of the Snake River until 1927. This wooden pontoon (ca. 1910) is the last remaining part of the ferry that operated during this period.\"A few yards past this structure, the walkway takes a switchback to the left, then back to the right to end at the water's edge. The paved landing is edged with a wooden curb and benches line the side nearest the bank. Across the wide river you can see the white-washed Menor's Ferry General Store and other buildin",

    "bodyText": "<p>This homestead once belonged to William D. (Bill) Menor. He moved from Montana to the valley in 1894 and took up this homestead on the banks of the Snake River.

    "audioDescription": "This sign sits at the edge of the paved parking lot. To its right, a paved path leads towards the Snake River with a sign indicating that the Menors Ferry Boat, the General Store, Maud Noble Cabin and Restrooms are located in that direction. <br /><br />The wayside features an historic photograph of the Menors Ferry buildings, viewed from the far side of the river with the mountains rising behind them. Text on the panel reads, \"View Bill Menor's original 1892 homestead along the Snake River. Follow the loop trail and learn about the early days of Jackson Hole.<br /><br />In 1969, the National Register of Historic Places designated this place an historic district.\"<br /><br />A map on the right side gives an overview of the area. North is behind you and slightly to your left. The \"You are here\" label indicates the position of this wayside at the edge of the parking lot at the bottom of the map. The Snake River runs across the map from left to right two-thirds of the way up. A dotted line labeled \"Ferry Crossing\" crosses the river in the center of the map. From your current location a dashed line shows the path extending up 50 yards to the restrooms. At that point, the path splits to form a triangular loop. The left hand path leads to Menor's General Store, smokehouse, storehouse and well. The right hand path leads to Maud Noble Cabin. The path connecting those two points runs along the river and passes the transportation barn.<br /><br />Along the bottom of the sign are four blocks of text and photos. At the left, text reads, \"Shop at the General Store. Shop at the Menor's Ferry General Store for turn-of-the-century style goods while viewing an exhibit of period furnishings and historic photographs (summer only).\" The image shows sample goods, including a bottle of pop and a pottery pitcher.<br /><br />The second block reads, \"Learn About Park History. Visit Maud Noble Cabin to see exhibits on Jackson Hole history. Noble hosted a landmark meeting at this cabin in 1923.\" A photograph shows an historic photograph of the cabin.<br /><br />The third block reads, \"Ride Menor's Ferry. Join a ranger for a trip across the Snake River on the Menor's Ferry replica. Rangers operate the ferry from mid- to late summer depending on Snake River flows.\" A color photograph shows a park ranger wearing a life jacket, at the wheel of the ferry with the mountains in the background.<br /><br />The right-most block reads, \"Join a Ranger for a Guided Walk. During the summer rangers lead guided walks in the Menor's Ferry Historic District.<br />Dates and times are posted at this trailhead or see your park newspaper, the Teewinot for more information.\" A color photograph shows a group of people listening to a park ranger with the mountains in the background.<br />",

The pathway runs alongside the Teton Park Road for most of this stretch, only diverging slightly to the west as it approaches Jenny Lake Visitor Center.<br /><br />The title on the right hand panel reads, \"No Pets on Pathway\" and shows a picture of a dog with the universal not-allowed symbol of a red circle with a line across it. The text reads, \"PETS ARE NOT PERMITTED on the park pathway. Guide dogs-used for the sole purpose of aiding a person with physical disability-may travel on the pathway. The pathway travels through sensitive wildlife areas.<br /><br />\"Why Are Pets Not Allowed? For the wildlife and for your safety.<br />o Wildlife such as bears, wolves or coyotes may be drawn to pets and their owners. <br />o A surprise encounter with wildlife may result in death or injury to pets, wildlife or visitors.<br />o Pets may escape and quickly become prey.<br />o Dogs cause the same stress responses in prey species (such as elk and pronghorn) as predators do.<br />oTransmittable diseases, such as parvovirus, from infected feces may live in the soil for months, passing on to wildlife.<br /><br />\"WHERE CAN PETS GO?<br />\"OUTSIDE THE PARK<br />o Jackson Hole Community Pathways except on the National Elk Refuge.<br />o Bridger-Teton National Forest trails-Shadow Mountain, Gros Ventre River, Snow King, Cache Creek, Phillips Canyon and Teton Pass.<br />o Snake River dike, at the intersection of highways WY 22 & 390 in Wilson.<br /><br />\"INSIDE THE PARK<br />\"In general, leashed pets may go anywhere a car may go-roads and road shoulders, campgrounds, picnic areas, and parking lots. Pets must be in control and restrained on a leash no longer than six feet in length.\"<br /><br />At the bottom of the panel are photographs of a bull moose and a male sage grouse, its large white chest puffed up. The text reads, \"SAGEBRUSH COMMUNITY. The drought-tolerant plants of the sagebrush community thrive despite porous, cobbly soils and intense sunlight. These flowering plants form one of the most colorful and diverse communities in the park. Sagebrush provides a mosaic of food and shelter for a variety of animals.\"<br /><br />The panel on the left is titled \"Protect Your Park.\" In a light green color block at the top left there is a photograph of two people on bicycles on the path with Grand Teton in the background. Text reads, \"How to Ride. Only NON-MOTORIZED METHODS of transportation are permitted on the multi-use pathway. Persons with physical disabilities may use electric and battery-operated transportation. Horses are not permitted on the pathway, except on the Snake River bridge in Moose.<br />o Travel single file in the right-side lane; share the pathway.<br />o Notify other recreators before you pass. Be aware of others passing you.<br />o The use of portable audio devices is strongly discouraged.<br />o Obey all traffic signs. Yield to all vehicles. <br />o Yield to slower recreators.<br />o Wear a helmet.<br />o Stay on paved pathway; no shortcutting through vegetation.<br />Absolutely no pets allowed. Respect the rights of all users.\"<br /><br />In the center of the panel is a photograph of a small herd of pronghorn . The caption reads, \"Help wildlife thrive. NEVER FEED, APPROACH OR HARASS WILDLIFE-especially large mammals. Stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from other animals. Be prepared for wildlife interactions; be prepared to stop.\"<br /><br />At the bottom of the panel is a photograph of two bears standing in snow at the edge of a pond, drinking. The caption reads, \"Be Bear Aware. Grizzly and black bears may become aggressive when surprised or in defense of young. Stay alert and make bears aware of your presence. Follow food storage regulations: never leave your backpack, pannier or any item with food unattended. Carry and know how to use bear spray.\"<br /><br />There are two smaller photograph in a border down the right side of the panel. The first one shows an elk with a full set of antlers. The caption reads, \"When to Ride. The multi-use pathway is CLOSED from dusk to dawn for wildlife and public safety.\"<br /><br />The bottom photo shows a single tree backlit by a sun low in the sky. The caption reads, \"Leave No Trace. The park PROHIBITS PICKING, COLLECTING OR DESTROYING park resources. Leave all plants, animals and artifacts as you found them for other visitors to enjoy. Stay on the designated pathway to help preserve the park.\"<br />",

Text on the right side of the panel reads, \"Mount Moran. Mt. Moran reflects all the geologic forces shaping the Teton Range. Formed of a massive block of metamorphic gneiss, cut by dikes of igneous granite and diabase, capped by sedimentary sandstone, and flanked by glaciers, this formidable peak dominates the park's northern skyline. \"The gneiss and granite are among the oldest rocks in North America, 2.7 and 2.5 billion years old respectively. These resistant rocks form the core of the Teton Range. The vertical \"Black Dike\" of 775 million year old diabase is about 150 feet wide and juts from the mountain's face because the surrounding gneiss has eroded away.\" An inset photo in the lower left hand corner shows a close view of the tan-colored rocky summit of the mountain with a brown vertical strip down the middle. The caption reads, \"Tan sandstone caps the summit of this massive peak the remnant of a 510 million year-old beach that stretched for hundreds of miles north and south of here. Sandstone overlies the Black Dike and other ancient igneous and metamorphic rocks.\" To the right of that another photo shows an icy patch below the summit, labeled \"Falling Ice Glacier.\" The caption reads, \"Five glaciers - Falling Ice, Skillet and Triple - flank Mount Moran. These glaciers formed during a cool period called the Little Ice Age that ended around 1850 AD. Over the past 40 years, the park's glaciers have shrunk by more than 20 percent due to our changing climate.\"",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside sits at the edge of a paved semicircle with an accessible ramp from the parking area. The sign looks out over a meadow dotted with patches of dark conifers and the flat summit and rocky sides of Mount Moran in the background. The background of the sign has a photograph of Mount Moran, the rocks tinged red by the sun with patches of snow and glaciers on its slopes. Text on the left side of the panel reads, \"Young, Restless and Still Rising. Imagine the Teton Range and the valley in front of you like two parts of a giant hinge. The Earth's crust stretches and breaks into two blocks along the 40-mile long Teton fault. Fractures generate large earthquakes along the fault. The western block hinges up and becomes the Teton Range.\" \"The eastern block tilts down and forms the valley. As the mountains rise, wind, water, and ice wear down the jagged skyline and erode away sandstone and limestone layers from the east side of the range. The landscape continues to change. Geoscientists predict future earthquakes up to a 7.5 magnitude.\" In the bottom left is an illustration showing the Teton Range with an orange line along its eastern base indicating the line of the Teton Fault. A vertical cutaway shows the land underneath the range rising and the land to the east subsiding. In the bottom right hand corner is a drawing showing a close-up view of Mount St. John and Mount Moran with the Teton Fault line at their base marked in yellow. A caption reads, \"Young Range, Old Rocks. The Teton Range is one of the youngest mountain ranges in North America, but the rocks are some of the oldest. The stretching-cracking-tilting that formed the Tetons began about nine million years ago. In contrast, geologic forces squeezed the Earth's crust and thrust up the Rockies ending around 55 million years ago.\"",

His findings ignited a controversy by stating the value of all species and condemning the ongoing practice of killing coyotes in the park.<br /> <br /> Adolph served as Grand Teton National Park's only biologist throughout the 1950s.

Geologically speaking, an oxbow forms when a meander channel is cut off from the main stream forming a pond. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "This turnout sits on top of a high bank overlooking the Snake River below. The river sweeps away from you in both directions, forming a sharp bend called an oxbow. The other side of the river is thickly wooded. The side you are on has more open flat land with shrubs and a few trees on the bank in front of you. There is a large meadow to the left, to the right is a stand of Aspen trees. In the distance to the right Mt Moran towers over the landscape.<br /><br />There are two wayside signs along this turnout. The one on the left has a large picture of two moose in the river, one with antlers. Text reads, \"Spot Any Wetlands Wildlife? This oxbow bend in the Snake River provides food, water, shelter, and nesting sites for wildlife. Plants thrive in the sediments and shallow waters. Moose browse on willows and tender plants. Mergansers, teals, and white pelicans feed on aquatic life. Playful otters swim and dive. Ospreys and bald eagles soar above the river searching for food. Beavers gnaw on saplings to build lodges or dams. In the quiet backwater, cutthroat trout rise to the surface, and great blue herons fish in the shallows.\"<br /><br />In the upper right corner is an inset photo of an American White pelican. In the lower left are 4 inset photos, left to right of two beavers, Trumpeter swans and Canada geese, a river otter, and a cutthroat trout. <br /><br />Towards the right end of the paved area another wayside is titled \"11,000 Summers in the Tetons.\" The background shows a black and white picture of Indians on Jackson Lake, a 1930s oil painting by Herbert A. Collins. The painting shows about fifteen American Indian figures, men, women and children at a camp on the edge of a lake with the mountains in the background. Some of the people are around a large campfire; others dress an antelope carcass. Two tee-pees stand on the edge of the lake. Text reads, \"This slow-moving channel of the Snake River at Oxbow Bend sustains many different animals. Every year thousands of visitors come here to see them. Like you, Indian tribes such as Shoshone, Bannock, Blackfoot, Crow, Nez Perce and Gros Ventre have been drawn to places like this for more than 11,000 years. American Indians ventured into this valley as glaciers receded. They came to Jackson Hole in the spring to hunt game, harvest roots and berries. They collected soapstone for bowls, obsidian for projectile points and quartzite for tools and roasting hearths. As winter approached they left their summer home in the Teton Range for warmer places.\"<br />",

The Snake River, wild and dynamic, provides challenges that rapidly test the skill of boaters. Braided channels and shifting log jams present difficulties found on few whitewater rivers.<br /><br />\"Boaters floating the Snake River must watch for areas of swift current, blocked channels, and hazards such as submerged rocks or logs, sweepers and strainers. River water remains cold throughout most of the year, increasing the risk of hypothermia.<br />\"Review river updates posted below, but be aware that river channels change course frequently and boaters must take responsibility for safety.\"<br /><br />Below this text there may be additional flyers posted with seasonally changing information.<br /><br />The right hand panel reads, \"Snake River Regulations. A National Park is a special place, created to protect resources while providing for visitor use and enjoyment; however, as more people explore the Snake River, increasing impacts harm fragile plant and animal communities. You can help prevent damage caused by human use by observing the following regulations.<br /><br />\"Boating. A park boating permits is required for all vessels floating the Snake River. Permits can be obtained at visitor centers. All vessels must carry a U.S. Coast Guard approved personal flotation device (PFD) properly fitted for each person on board.

After spending summers in the sagebrush flats along the base of the Teton Range, they migrate up to 150 miles south and east up the Gros Ventre drainage and down past Pinedale, WY. Fences are a significant barrier to migration. Pronghorn are reluctant to jump fences and will generally crawl under them.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This wayside overlooks a sweeping sagebrush flat flanked by hills and mountains in the distance. The left side of the sign shows a map of the pronghorn migration route. At the bottom right of the sign is a photo of a pronghorn's head, clearly showing the horns with a sharp curve at the ends. The caption reads, \"Pronghorn are named for their forked, hollow horns, being the only animal to annually shed a branched horn. Pronghorn are the fastest land mammal in North America.\"<br /><br />The main text in the upper right of the sign reads, \"The pronghorn that summer in Jackson Hole make the longest terrestrial mammal migration remaining in the contiguous United States. Pronghorn use migration as an adaptation for surviving the long Wyoming winters by moving to where they can find food and avoid deep snow.<br /><br />\"The southward fall migration usually occurs during November, with animals returning to northern summer ranges in late April and May. Round-trip migration distances for this her range from 200 - 300 miles annually.<br /><br />\"A Threatened Migration? History has shown that migrations are fragile. Three quarters of pronghorn migrations in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem have already been lost to land development. Further development could threaten the future of this remaining corridor.\"<br /><br />The map on the left shows a red area covering the eastern side of Grand Teton National Park marking the pronghorn's summer range. This wayside is located on the eastern edge of that range, about two-thirds of the way down. From this point the migration path is shown as a red line moving east and then south, into the Green River Basin past the intersection of US Highways 189 and 191. There the winter range is shown as another red area. The caption reads, \"Jackson Hole pronghorn migrate along an ancient corridor to Green River basin wintering areas near Pinedale, Wyoming. Archaeological evidence of pronghorn at Trapper's Point dates back 6,000 years.\"<br /><br />Smaller photos show a small herd in a meadow during summer and a larger group moving through belly-deep snow in winter.<br />",

    "listingDescription": "The Burt family lived in this cabin for many summers on the ranch. Their son, Nathaniel, was even born on the kitchen table one winter. Several other people and families cared for the Bar BC over the decades, including Horace Carncross, Struthers Burt's original partner; Irving Corse and his family, who took the ranch over from the Burts; Peggy Conderman of the neighboring 4 Lazy F Ranch; and Margaretta Sharpless, Irving Corse's widow. The Western Center for Historic Preservation and Grand Teton National Park, in partnership with the Grand Teton National Park Foundation, are working on a multi-year project to stabilize and preserve this cabin and other buildings here, so that visitors can continue to enjoy them and learn about the Bar BC.<br /><br />Though the families who lived here and the guests who came to stay are gone, their legacy remains in these buildings, the beginnings of tourism in Jackson Hole, and the formation of Grand Teton National Park. Visitors to the valley today experience the same wonder and joy at the high peaks, the cool swimming holes, and the novelty of Western life. Though the dudes and wranglers have left, and these cabins are now empty, you can still explore the Bar BC and imagine the experiences they had here.",

Text reads, \"Moose thrive in wetlands abundant with willow, marsh grasses, and aquatic plants. Solitary by nature, some moose stay in this habitat year-round. Others migrate seasonally, traveling into mountain canyons to feed on summer vegetation and return to the valley as winter approaches.<br /><br />\"Moose are not the only inhabitants that live here, however. This habitat provides a living place for other animals that directly benefit from moose occupying this space. The antlers on a bull moose reach full size in late summer, but after the autumn rut, they shed their antlers in early winter. Rodents and other animals gnaw on the fallen antlers providing a valuable source of calcium critical to their survival.<br /><br />\"The largest member of the deer family, moose may weigh more than 1,000 pounds and stand seven feet tall. Moose may appear docile, but they are unpredictable and powerful. Rutting bulls may charge people and cows fiercely protect their calves.\"<br />",

From the west side of the parking lot, the wide dirt and gravel path leads down a gentle slope to the water's edge. To the left a beaver dam crosses the river. To the right, a trail heads north along the river's edge. The wide trail is lined on either side with logs. Across the river are spectacular views of the central peaks of the Tetons, the sharp points of the Cathedral Group. The long, bumpy ridge of Rockchuck Peak lies more to the right, and still further is the rounded summit of Mount Moran.",

Continuing to the left, there is a gap for the chin and neck before rising to a rounded peak where the folded arms would be. The ridge then continues smoothly to the left, representing the rest of the body, until it disappears below tree line.",

Below this point, rafters access the Snake River at Deadmans Bar coming downstream from Pacific Creek or continuing on to Moose.</p><h3>Name Origin</h3><p>The headwaters for the Snake River are in the Teton Wilderness just outside of Yellowstone National Park. After flowing into Yellowstone briefly, the river cuts through Grand Teton National Park, across Idaho and flows into the Columbia River in Washington.<br /><br />Previous names include the Lewis River (after Lewis & Clark), La Maudite Riviere Enragee (The Accursed Mad River by French fur trappers), the Mad River, Sho-sho-ne-pah (or Shoshone Indians) that lead to the final name Snake River.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This overlook provides stunning views of the Snake River and the mountain range beyond from the top of a high terrace of land. From the parking lot, a maze of concrete aggregate paths leads to a broad walkway along a 3-foot high stone wall at the edge of the steep bluff. Down below the river comes from the right, makes a U-bend, then curves back to the left. Beyond the jagged peaks of the Tetons rise.<br /><br />There are three wayside signs along the stone wall. The one at the far right is titled \"Tetons Inspiring Creativity.\" The right side of the sign shows a painting by Thomas Moran of the Teton range from the west. In the foreground a river runs through a boulder-filled channel. Behind it is a snow-covered mountain peak. In the lower left of the panel is an historic photograph of Moran sitting on a boulder beside a stream cascading down the steep hillside. He has a long beard and wears a hat and high boots.<br /><br />The main text on the panel reads, \"Thomas Moran found the Tetons awe-inspiring even though he, unlike you, was facing the range's western slope. Moran created a series of watercolor field sketches in 1879 and later used them with William H. Jackson's photographs to compose large idealized oil paintings. His images conveyed the vastness and beauty of the West to easterners and helped promote the establishment of national parks. His iconic artwork hangs today in major museums and the U.S. Capitol. Moran first visited this region in 1871 with Ferdinand V. Hayden's Yellowstone geological survey expedition.\"<br /><br />Along the bottom of the panel is a quote from Moran: \"The Tetons ... loomed up grandly against the sky. From this point it is perhaps the finest pictorial range in the United States or ever.\"<br /><br />The middle wayside along the wall is titled \"Capturing Nature in a Box.\" The right side of the panel shows a famous black and white photograph of the Snake River made by Ansel Adams. The view in the photograph is very close to the view from this overlook, with the river winding below and Grand Teton peak dominating the mountain range behind.<br /><br />At the bottom left of the panel is an historic photograph of Adams in Yosemite Valley in 1942. He stands on a wooden platform built on top of a Pontiac station wagon with his large-format, bellows camera in front of him.<br /><br />The main text reads, \"Ansel Adams stood here in 1942 and took this photograph of the vast unspoiled beauty of the Snake River and jagged Teton Range. The National Park Service hired Adams in 1941 to capture nature as exemplified by national parks. At the time local ranchers were battling a proposal to include the Jackson Hole valley in Grand Teton National Park. Adams's photographs helped promote and protect western U.S. landscapes.\"<br /><br />Along the bottom of the panel is a quote from Adams: \"The grand lift of the Tetons is ... a primal gesture of the Earth beneath a greater sky.\"<br /><br />The leftmost wayside is titled \"Meandering Snake.\" It is filled with a color photograph of a sharp U-bend in the river, the water very smooth, reflecting trees and sky. Text reads, \"The Snake River twists and turns as it flows over 1,000 miles from Yellowstone National Park through Grand Teton National Park and ultimately to the Pacific Ocean. From Jackson Hole the Snake turns west into Idaho and eventually joins the Columbia River, which flows into the Pacific. This designated Wild and Scenic River attracts river otters, bald eagles, osprey, moose-and human anglers and rafters.<br /><br />A caption tells us the Snake River was named for a serpentine gesture the Shoshone Indians use to describe themselves.<br /><br />An inset in the upper right of the panel shows a large rubber raft filled with people floating on the river. The caption reads, \"Float the Snake River for excellent views of the Tetons and wildlife.\"<br /><br />To the right of that a smaller photo shows a bald eagle perched on a tree branch. The caption reads, \"Look for bald eagles soaring over the Snake River as they prey on fish and waterfowl. Since the 1972 ban on DDT pesticide, the once-endangered bald eagle has recovered in most of the nation.\"<br />",

    "audioDescription": "This turnout is on the southern boundary of Grand Teton National Park. There are paved sidewalk areas on either side of the parking lot. On either side are broad, flat sagebrush covered meadows. The Teton Range rises to the left, or west, and lower mountain ranges lie to the right in the east. Also towards the east is the high, wire and wood post fence which borders the National Elk Refuge.<br /><br />On the west side of the turnout is a large wooden sign for Grand Teton National Park with the mountains outlined in white at the top. It hangs from a large wooden post structure in a base built of medium-sized stones.<br /><br />On the east side of the turnout are three wayside signs, two smaller ones at either end and a larger, two-panel sign hanging in a wooden post structure in the middle. <br /><br />The wayside on the far left is titled \"The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.\" On the right side of the panel is a map of the region around the point where the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho meet. Yellowstone National Park is in the northwest corner of Wyoming with the smaller Grand Teton National Park just south of it. A pale green area indicating the extent of the ecosystem extends well up past Yellowstone in to Montana, west into Idaho and further east and south into Wyoming. The text reads, \"You are standing within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest nearly intact natural area remaining in the contiguous United States. Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks, seven national forests and two national wildlife refuges comprise most of its acreage, but federal, state, and private lands also provide essential buggers to this ecosystem and its free-roaming wildlife.<br /><br />\"Bison, elk, bears, and eagles once thrived nationwide. Now, these and many other species survive in this island of hope. Preservation of this ecosystem and the wildlife it supports will mean much to future generations.\"<br /><br />At the top of the panel are the outline shapes of native animals and plants, such as bison, eagles, elk and bear. At the bottom is a sketch showing the different habitats, ranging from alpine on the tops of the mountains, down through spruce and fir forest, then pine forest, flat sagebrush plain, and low wetlands.<br /><br />The middle wayside has two panels. The left hand panel shows a photo of mountain peaks at the top. Text reads, \"Explore Teton Country. Discover the magnificent landscape and wild communities of Grand Teton National Park. Here the Teton Range rises abruptly from the high mountain valley known as Jackson Hole. From bare alpine rocks to lush meadows and floodplains, the national park is home to bald eagles, grizzly bears, river otters, and bison.\"<br /><br />Underneath the photo is a quote: \"Today, come to this national park with an open mind, open eyes, and an open heart ... walk the trails ... canoe ... you may see a moose or two ... a great blue heron, a pair of trumpeter swans ... These quiet adventures will remain with you always.-Margaret E. \"Mardy\" Murie\"<br /><br />A band of photos across the middle of the panel show, from left to right, several canoes being paddled on smooth water with reflections of autumn trees, a group of schoolchildren in a meadow with a park ranger, a mother elk with her calf and a bright blue tent near a lake. Below these an inset photo shows a large moose crossing a road and at the bottom two hikers in a meadow with the mountain range in the distance.<br /><br />Additional text blocks read, \"Plan Your Visit. Pick up a map and newspaper at any entrance station or visitor center to help plan your trip. Stop at visitor centers for orientation information, ranger-led activities, and interpretive exhibits.<br /><br />\"Be Extra Careful. Drive carefully, obey speed limits, and watch for wildlife on roads. Drivers hit and kill more than 100 large animals on park roads each year. Animals are wild. Do not feed or approach them. Stay more than 100 yards away from all large animals. <br /><br />\"Be \"Bear Aware.\" Black and grizzly bears can be anywhere in the park. Protect your food and toiletries from bears, even toothpaste and sunscreen. It all smells to a bear. Please be careful. Follow food storage regulations. Do not leave food unattended. Keep pets on a leash six feet long or less. Pets are not allowed on unpaved trails, the multi-use pathway or in the visitor centers.\"<br /><br />The panel on the right is titled \"Mapping Your Teton Adventure.\" It shows a map of Grand Teton National Park and the JDR Memorial Parkway north of the park. Your current location at the southern boundary is marked with a red flag. At the top right is a photo of a bald eagle in flight. At the bottom right is a photo of an elk.<br /><br />The far right wayside is titled \"Elk Migration.\" Text reads, \"The National Elk Refuge. In the high country, deep November snows cause elk to migrate to their winter range on the National Elk Refuge. In strings of 200 or more, thousands of elk arrive, some after traveling more than 65 miles from southern Yellowstone National Park and surround national forests.<br /><br />Settlement and development eliminated nearly three-fourths of the elk's natural winter range. The 23,000-acre National Elk Refuge was established in 1912 to protect the remaining winter habitat. Throughout the year, several different national and state agencies manage the herd and its habitat.\"<br /><br />At the top right of the panel is a drawing of a line of elk moving left to right with mountains in the background. In the lower right hand corner is a map showing the paths of the migration in green. The map is oriented with south at the top where the National Elk Refuge is marked. Many paths from the northeast, north, and northwest converge into a broad path leading to the refuge.<br /><br />At the bottom left of the panel is a photograph of a mother elk nursing a tiny calf. The caption reads, \"The elk (properly called wapiti) leave the Refuge in April when winter snows begin to melt. Calves are born in late May and June as the elk migrate to their summer ranges.\"<br /><br />Next to that another photograph shows a large group of elk in a snowy landscape, some standing, some lying down. The caption reads, \"The winter herd on the National Elk Refuge exceeds 7,500 animals. About one-half of these elk summer in Grand Teton National Park. The elk are not confined; the Refuge fence protects them from the road.\"<br />",

He settled in the southern part of the Jackson Hole valley in the 1880s. Before 1900, he established Leek's \"clubhouse\" on the north end of Leigh Lake and then Leek's Camp on the east shore of Jackson Lake as hunting and fishing camps. Later, Leek took photographs of starving and dying elk during the winter of 1908-09. He used these images in lectures, articles and tours to help publicize the dilemma. In 1912, Congress established the National Elk Refuge to provide wintering grounds for elk.</p>",

The sign looks out a gravelly sloped clearing in a wooded area. About 20 yards away, slightly to the left is a stone fireplace with a broken stone chimney.<br /><br />The background image on the sign shows a historic photograph of a dozen dead elk, lying on the ground next to the wall of a log cabin. Two other elk stand in the background. Text along the bottom of the sign reads, \"Stephen Leek pioneered the first conservation movement in Jackson Hole. Starting out as a fishing and hunting guide, he later became a passionate campaigner for the Jackson elk herd. Leek's glass plate photographs of starving and dead elk nationally publicized the tragic effects of winter habitat loss. In 1912, Congress approved the creation of the National Elk Refuge.<br /><br />\"The establishment of the National Elk Refuge marked an important change in attitudes about land use here. Once opposed, homesteaders began supporting the government purchase of land for conservation.\"<br /><br />In the lower left hand corner is a smaller photo of a man with a white mustache, wearing a broad brimmed hat.

More than any other erosional force, powerful glaciers sculpted the Teton Range peaks and carved the U-shaped canyons.<br /><br />\"Beginning two million years ago, at least two periods of glaciation swept across this landscape. The ice last retreated around 14,000 years ago, unveiling an ornate tapestry of cirques, arÃªtes and horns.

Since 1967, the Teton Glacier has lost 15 percent of its surface area. Meltwater helps support rich communities along valley streams, but today's glaciers are producing up to ten percent less run-off. If current trends continue, the glaciers of the Teton Range will disappear. Their passing will be one of many transformations this landscape will experience in the face of climate change.\"<br /><br />At the bottom right corner of the panel is a drawing showing a three-dimensional cross section view of a mountainside with a glacier.

    "audioDescription": "Host: If you remember 1988, you probably remember the Yellowstone fires that occurred that year. It was an extremely dry and windy summer, and huge fires burned about a third of Yellowstone National Park-about 800,000 acres within the park, in addition to other fires in surrounding areas and in Grand Teton. These fires were on the national news every night, and sensational coverage implied that the park was being destroyed, or that the entire park was burning. The perception was that the park was just letting the fires burn-though some were monitored initially in the early summer, there was a huge firefighting effort that involved thousands of crewmembers once it became clear how extreme the fire season would be. But even so, the conditions were such that those efforts had little effect on the total acres burned, even though they did succeed in saving iconic structures like the Old Faithful Inn. Check out Yellowstone's website to learn more about that summer.<br /><br />Though 1988 was an extreme year, dramatic fires are part of the ecosystem here, as we've discussed. Ecologists that study past fires, with methods that Diane mentioned in our first stop, note that there were similar magnitude fires in the 1700s in this area. Regardless of this history, the 1988 fires were a huge focal point for the public, and drew national attention to fire management and the new programs that tolerated and supported fire as a natural process. Though there were reviews of these policies after the fires, they concluded that the ecological basis for fire on the landscape was sound.<br /><br />At this stop, if you look to the east, you can see the regrowth from the 1988 fires, and where the Berry Fire reburned part of that young forest in 2016. If you drive through Yellowstone, look for the contrast between these homogenous stands of lodgepole pine that are about 30 years old, versus the larger, taller stands of older trees with a variety of species. Here is Andy Norman, fuels specialist from the Bridger-Teton National Forest, discussing the significance of those 1988 fires and their legacy:<br /><br />Andy: We had 1988 where Yellowstone had the big fires, and there was a lot of thinking about whether we were doing the right thing and whether these fires were good or bad. And really the lesson of â€˜88 is it reaffirmed that here in the Northern Rockies, large stand-replacing fires are the norm. And we need to be able to allow those to burn.<br /><br />I think the legacy is that we did acknowledge that large standard placing fires are part of the process. It took a lot of effort on the parts of the people that managed those fires, even from the superintendent of Yellowstone. His career was never really the same after that, even though he made the right decision. And so now we just keep paving the way.<br /><br />Host: Next, we'll hear from Monica Turner, who is a fire ecologist at the University of Wisconsin. Her first field season in the Yellowstone area was 1988, and she's been studying fire and forests here ever since:<br /><br />Monica: The 1988 fires were really a watershed summer for fire in the West and for fire in our national parks. The fires were enormous. They were of high severity. They surprised all of us, scientists and managers alike. One of the most surprising results that we have found from many, many years of research was just how the forests rebounded. And they rebounded without any intervention from humans the ability to just regrow and regenerate after the fires was probably the most impressive lesson.",

    "audioDescription": "Host: After the 1988 fires, there was some hesitancy about having fire on the landscape again, which took several years to fade. The 90s were relatively quiet fire years in Grand Teton, though the park's fire program became more formalized and began to use more prescribed fire. In general, the fire regime here is quite sporadic-in many summers, only a few acres burn. To have large fires, a very dry summer must coincide with lightning to start them and wind to spread them. The 2000s saw more fires, including some along the Grassy Lake Road, west of Flagg Ranch, and two prominent fires on the west shore of Jackson Lake. These burned both north and south of the Waterfalls Canyon Fire, and they are visible as shrubby slopes across the lake. There's an interactive fire history map on the park's website, if you'd like to see where they're located in more detail. But the biggest fire in park history came in 2016.The Berry Fire was started by a lightning strike in late July, a few miles west of the lakeshore on the far side of Jackson Lake. Managers decided to monitor the fire and allow it to play its natural role, given the remoteness of the location. The nearest developed area, Flagg Ranch, was about ten miles away, and fire staff had spent years thinning vegetation around it to protect it in case of a fire. The Berry Fire grew slowly for a few weeks, then high winds pushed it down to the lake and across it. The fire crossed the highway as well, which was closed for five days during the National Park Service centennial celebration.The weather and the fire behavior calmed for another few weeks and the road reopened, then another wind event in September pushed the fire six miles in an afternoon up toward Flagg Ranch and the South Gate of Yellowstone. Preparations in the area, both in past years and by crews during the fire, allowed the fire to pass through the developed area without burning any structures. Snow and rain dampened the fire by mid-September, after it burned over 20,000 acres. Here are Diane Abendroth, the park's fire ecologist, and Ron Steffens, a fire analyst in the park, discussing how those preparations, called \"fuels reduction\" or \"fuels treatments\" helped protect buildings at Flagg Ranch. When Ron says \"mechanical\" fuels treatments, he means that they were thinned with tools, instead of by a prescribed fire or other means:Diane: We do have some developed areas in the parks and forest here, and even though there aren't very many of them, they're still important to protect. And so we do take action to thin the trees around these developed areas and create a buffer of lighter fuels, to try to make it possible for firefighters to safely engage a fire to protect those resorts and homes.Ron: And an example of that was the Berry Fire. It was making the second of two 2-3 mile runs, so in a day it had crossed Jackson Lake and burned three miles. Three weeks later, the conditions were very similar. Two years earlier we had prepared Flagg Ranch and Headwaters by doing mechanical fuel reduction, where we trim away the trees that would become ladder fuels, and we reduce the amount of fuel on the ground that would create the heat that would then allow the fire to burn into the crowns. With all of that years of work, we assigned a significant number of resources to protect the developed area. And as the fire came through, they could safely keep that fire on the ground near the structures and protect the structures. Because that landscape directly adjacent to the developed areas had been pre-treated and the fuel was reduced.Host: Something that's unique about managing fires today, as opposed to decades ago, is that you can manage the fire to accomplish multiple goals. You don't have to choose to either put it out or not put it out - you can mostly allow it to play its natural role, while also taking some suppression actions to protect buildings or infrastructure. We also have the benefit of learning from all the fires we've managed before. Here's Chip Collins, the park's Fire Management Officer, to discuss how those past fires benefit us now:Chip: I think the success of those earlier fires in the 70s and 80s eventually are what led to a-I think-a more enlightened policy that we have now, that recognizes that you might do any number of things on any one fire at any one time during the season, based on values that are being threatened, or not, and how the fire is burning. And so I think you can draw a direct line from the successes of the 70s and 80s to the ability that we had at the Berry Fire to take action when it went across the highway and closed the roads. So we worked on that to keep road access open when the fire started to threaten Flagg Ranch. We took suppression actions to protect the cabins around there, and yet still we're able to manage the rest of the fire over the long term. So I think it was a direct line from that. And also the more fire you have on the landscape. So looking back in the area of t",

In such a remote location-a day's wagon ride from Jackson, in the 1920s-they had to make their own entertainment. <br /><br />Excerpt from \"Diary of a Dude Wrangler\": \"A friend of ours, a rancher from many miles away, came to visit us unexpectedly and found us in the midst of a fancy-dress party. I was dressed in some sort of a silly costume, and the doctor, my partner, was dressed in something even more silly. We give these parties every now and then, usually on the spur of the moment. The neighbors drop in, and it is all very colorful and amusing-the big log cabin lit with candles, the fire smoldering in an open fireplace, the fiddlers over in one corner, and, unlike most fancy dress parties, the cowboys real cowboys. But the visiting rancher, being a simple man of cattle and arriving after dusk when the party was at its height, was taken aback and for a while imagined himself, I dare say, in a place where the inmates had overpowered their keepers.\"",

    "audioDescription": "The ferry is a wooden platform with a railing, which rests on two, narrow boat-hull-shaped pontoons.

Ropes extend from either side of the front of the ferry to pulleys, which run along the cable that stretches over the river. <br /><br />A wayside to the right of the cable anchor point explains the operation of the ferry. On the right side of the sign is an historic photograph of a man, standing at the wheel of a ferry. He wears a long-sleeved shirt, and a black hat and vest. Text reads, \"Menor's Ferry. Bill Menor recognized this single channel of the Snake River offered an ideal crossing point.<br /><br />\"This \"reaction ferry\" design dates back to ancient times, using the river current to propel the boat. The ferry you see here is a replica.\"<br /><br />The left side of the sign shows an illustration of how the ferry works. The west bank of the river where you are is along the bottom, the east bank is at the top. The cable line is stretched across the river. At the bottom, the ferry is shown at right angles to the line. A rope goes from each of the front corners of the ferry, keeping it parallel to the river's current. In the middle the ferry is shown with the front tilted slightly towards the east bank. The caption explains that the captain turns the pilot wheel to shorten the rope on the right side of the boat, causing the current to push against the pontoons and moving the boat eastward. The top picture shows the boat again parallel to the current, stopped on the east bank, after the captain turns the pilot wheel back left.",

The ranch has been run for generations by the Turner family.<br /><br /> <a href=\"http://trianglex.com/\">Visit Triangle X for more information.</a> </p><h3>History</h3><p>John S. and Maytie Turner ran the Lost Creek Ranch outside of Morgan Utah. During the early 1900s, they ventured north to visit Yellowstone and Jackson Hole and loved the area. Turner purchased a homestead from Bill Jump in 1926 and moved his family from Utah.<br /><br />Turner and his sons began building their home, first finishing the basement that summer. They hosted hunters that fall - housing them in the basement. The ranch began hosting dudes - wealthy Easterners who wanted to experience the old west. Dudes would often stay for more than a month at a time living and working on the ranch.<br /><br />In the late 1920s, the family sold the dude ranch to the Snake River Land Company, but continued to operate the ranch. The land became part of the expansion of Grand Teton National Park in 1950. Today, the fourth generation of Turners continues to operate the ranch as a concession within the park.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The buildings here at the ranch are a mixture of log construction and vertical board and batten. At the edge of the parking lot is a building housing the office, ranch gift shop and restrooms. Its pine boards are stained a dark mahogany. It has a covered porch extending the length of the front with benches and chairs for sitting. From there, moving in a clockwise direction is the main building, a two-story log building with a green metal roof and a chimney at the end facing you. Behind that is a series of small cabins. More cabins lie directly behind you, along the entrance road. This side of the entrance road is small log cabin with a green metal roof and a porch in front with white wicker chairs. Between that cabin and the office is the corral, surrounded by a wood rail fence.",

    "audioDescription": "Host: After decades where land managers viewed fires negatively and tried to remove them from the landscape, scientists started to see negative impacts in some forests from this lack of fire. In the Sequoia forests of California, for example, there had been no new sequoia seedlings for decades. Eventually, scientists learned that those trees have serotinous cones, like lodgepole pines, which need fire to open them and release their seeds. Florida and the Southeast U.S. had a long cultural history of intentional burning, and institutional perspectives started to shift there as well. The 1960s and 70s were a time of change throughout the fire world, where people started to realize that perhaps fire wasn't the enemy they had thought it was.<br /><br />This shift in understanding took shape in many different ways across the country, including in Grand Teton National Park. One of the first fires in a national park that managers allowed to continue burning naturally, rather than trying to put it out, was on the west shore of Jackson Lake in Waterfalls Canyon. This is the canyon due west across the lake, with the large, prominent waterfall partway up-much of the area that burned in 1974 is now dense, dark green regrowth of lodgepole pines that you can see from here. Diane Abendroth, our park fire ecologist, will share a bit about the Waterfalls Canyon Fire:<br /><br />Diane: In the 1970s fire ecologists in the Jackson area started to realize that burned areas were kind of a rarity on the landscape here and our wildlife habitats and landscapes were missing out on the recently-burned, early successional stages of vegetation. And they started to do some prescribed fire on the Forest Service and they also thought about ways to maybe allow some of these naturally caused fires to do good work on the landscape to introduce the regrowth of forests into the mixture. The Waterfalls Canyon Fire was one of the first fires in the National Park Service where this was allowed to happen. And one of the reasons it was possible to do here is because Jackson Lake was a really big fuel break.<br /><br />Host: Allowing these natural processes to take place is part of the National Park Service mission statement. And it also allows scientists to learn from the landscape and better understand the ecology we have here. With fire specifically, managers learn new things from each incident about how fires behave in this place and how best to manage them, so that we can support those natural processes while also protecting people and property. Here's Ron Steffens, a fire analyst for the park, to explain more about this process:<br /><br />Ron: The west side of Jackson Lake has been a landscape where fire has taught us a lot of lessons. In 1974 the Waterfalls Canyon Fire was ignited by lightning. There was a new policy in the park service that allowed us to manage fires for resource benefit so that fire was monitored and tracked to ensure that there was no values threatened by it. It burned for a good part of the summer and became a lesson on how fire is a part of the Northern Rockies, and as it burns it will teach us what we need to think about when we're managing large landscapes and managing fire.<br /><br />Throughout the U.S. American West and internationally, I think people a lot of people have learned from it. The publicity wasn't positive. People were concerned about the smoke, concerned that it might impact tourism-but people drove by and looked at it and learned from it and it became a part of the visit to the park. And since then we've continued to evolve our strategies and our management and numerous fires have burned on the west side of the lake and elsewhere in this ecosystem where we can manage the fire with while limiting the threats to the values at risk.<br /><br />Host: The Waterfalls Canyon Fire was certainly controversial at the time, but in retrospect it was the right thing to do, ecologically speaking. I asked our Fire Management Officer, Chip Collins, what he had to say about the legacy of that decision, and about the people who made it:<br /><br />Chip: I think they were bold decisions, and I applaud them for doing that. It was certainly different than the norm, and I think it's easy to look at it rationally and understand why a fire is a natural disturbance regime-why having that absent from the landscape would be a bad thing in a natural setting. But then to actually go and not put fires out when you've done that for decades, and all of your partners around you have done that for decades...I think that was a pretty bold decision. Especially as the season went on and the Waterfalls Canyon Fire did burn for many weeks and received a lot of negative press, both locally and nationally. I think those managers stuck to their guns and did it for the right reasons, and I think had they not been able to do that, we wouldn't have the program here that we have today.",

The view faces eastward over broad sagebrush plains edged by distant mountains, with here and there a solitary tree. To your left in the west the Teton range rises with the Grand Teton in the middle. The ground near the signs is pebble-covered with low patches of vegetation.<br /><br />The wayside sign on the right has a color photograph of Grand Teton and surrounding peaks rising behind sagebrush plains. Text along the bottom of the panel reads, \"Foundations of a Community. Geology shapes the ecosystem. Jagged mountains harbor the alpine community and glacial outwash plains support the sagebrush community. Beginning two million years ago, ice-aged glaciers repeatedly covered this landscape carving valley lakes, U-shaped canyons and leveling the valley floor. As these glaciers retreated, meltwater stripped soil from the landscape leaving behind sand, gravel and cobbles.<br /><br />\"Sagebrush thrives in these rocky, well-drained soils in addition to antelope bitterbrush and many grass species. Arrowleaf balsamroot, lupine and skyrocket gilia add spring color. Small mammals, Greater Sage-Grouse and pronghorn find food and shelter here, while raptors search for prey.\"<br /><br />In the bottom right corner is an inset photograph of a sagebrush branch held between a thumb and forefinger. The caption reads, \"Big sage, Artemisia tridentata, is both a vital and iconic part of this western landscape. Take a moment to touch and smell (but do not pick) the soft, aromatic leaves of a nearby sagebrush plant.\"<br /><br />The panel on the left has a black and white photograph of Grand Teton summit, snow covered, with the peak shrouded in misty clouds. Text reads, \"Geologic Drama. The Teton Range towers over Jackson Hole. Powerful geologic forces began stretching this area less than 10 million years ago cracking the Earth's crust to form the 40-mile long Teton fault. Movement on this fault generates massive earthquakes up to magnitude 7.5. Each earthquake hinges the mountain block skyward and drops the valley-block leaving no foothills.<br /><br />\"Ancient granite and gneiss, 2.5 to 2.7 billion years old, form the core of this youthful range. These rocks resist erosion but over time wind, water and ice slowly shape the landscape. Ice, in the form of glaciers, carved and sculpted the dramatic landscape forming jagged arÃªtes, U-shaped canyons and deposited moraines.\"<br /><br />In the upper right of the panel is a quote: \"The grand lift of the Tetons is more than a mechanistic fold and faulting of the earth's crust; it becomes a primal gesture of the earth beneath a great sky.\" - Ansel Adams.<br />",

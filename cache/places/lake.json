    "bodyText": "<h2>Explore Boulder Beach</h2> <p>Located in the western part of Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Boulder Bay is just minutes from Las Vegas and stretches more than a mile along the shoreline of the Boulder Basin of Lake Mead.<br /> <br /> When you visit Boulder Beach, you’ll have access to many recreation opportunities. Boulder Beach, Special Events Beach, Canoe/Kayak Beach, and PWC Beach are 1-2 miles away. At these locations you can kayak and jetski. If you prefer to explore the park on land, the River Mountains Loop Trail passes right by the campground. This paved trail is more than 30 miles long and leads to the Historic Railroad Trail.<br /> <br /> Nearby Hemenway Harbor offers a fishing pier, boat launch ramp access, and Lake Mead & Las Vegas Bay Marinas. You can rent a boat for a few hours or dine at the docks. Lake Mead Cruises provides cruises on the lake to the Hoover Dam and back.<br />  </p> <hr /> <h3><strong>Boating</strong></h3> <h4>Lake Level Changing: Keep Alert & Launch At Your Own Risk</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Boaters should excercise caution and be watchful of unexpected underwater and exposed water hazards.</strong></li> <li><strong>Hazard buoys do not mark every hazard on the water.</strong></li> <li><strong>Be prepared for longer wait times for launching and recovery</strong></li> <li><strong>Ongoing maintenance/construction at ramps may require temporary closures.</strong></li> </ul> <p>The nearest motorized boating access from Boulder Beach is at Hemenway Harbor launch ramp. Rental boats are located nearby at <a href=\"https://boatinglakemead.com/rental-reservation/all-rentals/\">Las Vegas Boat Harbor</a>. Water-access fuel is located at the Las Vegas Boat Harbor (Hemenway Harbor), which is located near Boulder Beach.<br /> <br /> Visitors may launch personal watercraft from the rocky beaches south of the swim area. These locations include: Boulder Beach, Special Events Beach, Canoe/Kayak Beach, and PWC Beach.<br />  </p> <hr /> <h3><strong>Camping</strong></h3> <p>Boulder Beach Campground is open year-round and features large paved sites that can accommodate tents or large RVs, along with tables, fire pits and/or grills. Restrooms and water spigots are located throughout the campsite.<br /> <br /> Temperatures usually surpass 100F (37C) degrees June-August. In May and September, daytime highs are around 90F (32C). October-April, temperatures are much cooler. Lows can dip to freezing temps December-February. The area averages 4 inches of rain each year.<br /> <br /> Lush vegetation provides shade, and many sites have pristine views of the lake. Boulder Beach is about a 15-minute walk from the campground.</p> <h3>NPS Operated Campgrounds</h3> <em>*50% discount with Senior/Access Pass<br /> **RV's may park in any NPS campsite; however, there are no hookups.<br /> ***WiFi in campgrounds is operated by a concessionaire service.

each season bringing its own exciting opportunities.<br /> <br /> Due to low water conditions, Hemeway Harbor no longer has a fishing pier, however shore fishing at Hemenway Fishing Point is allowed in the designated area marked by bouys.<br /> <br /> In order to be considered wading, a person fishing must be standing with their feet on the bottom and not capable of free flotation through the use of any device. As water recedes, be aware of the potential for soft mud.<br /> <br /> All other water-oriented activities, such as boating, fishing from vessels and floating devices, swimming, snorkeling, and SCUBA diving, are prohibited in this designated area.<br /> <br /> Fishing equipment, bait and supplies are available at the marina store. A convenient fish cleaning station is located at the top of the launch ramp parking lot.<br />  </p> <hr /> <h3><strong>Beaches & Coves</strong></h3> <p>Boulder Beach has a variety of multi-use beaches, including North and South Swim Beaches at Boulder Beach which is popular for families and triathletes alike. The surface is graded regularly, but tends to be rocky.<br /> <br /> Be aware that as the lake levels get lower silty mud becomes exposed and people and vehicles have been known to get stuck. Always carefully test the ground before committing - even if it looks dry on top.<br /> <br /> To the south, visitors can setup for the day with their watercraft and enjoy boating in the Boulder Basin.<br /> <br /> Open dawn till dusk.</p> <p><br />  </p>",

Located on the eastern edge of the park near a Joshua Tree forest, South Cove is one of the park's lesser known getaways. From here, you can launch onto the lake and venture out to numerous sandy coves.<br /> <br /> The general area includes: <ul> <li>Pearce Ferry</li> <li>Meadview Scenic Overlook</li> </ul> <br /> The primary boat ramp is closed due to low water levels. Launching is available off the dirt road south of the launch ramp. Four-wheel-drive is recommended. <hr /> <h3>Boating</h3> The primary boat ramp is closed due to low water levels. Launching is available off the dirt road south of the launch ramp. Four-wheel-drive is recommended. <hr /> <h3>Beaches & Coves</h3> Follow the dirt road to the south of the paved launch ramp (which is closed due to low water) to recreate along the water, or launch on the dirt ramp (4wd recommended) and venture out to one of the many secluded coves along the river. <hr /> <h3>Nearby Attractions</h3> Pearce Ferry is about 17 miles upstream from South Cove. Although you can't access it from South Cove by boat, due to intense rapids, you can travel to it by car. It's this point where Lake Mead National Recreation Area borders Grand Canyon National Park.<br /> <br /> Meadview is a small town about 10 miles from South Cove that offers dining, RV parking, lodging and a few stores. <h3> </h3>",

    "bodyText": "<h2>Discover Temple Bar</h2> <p>Temple Bar is located in the Temple Basin on the Arizona side of eastern Lake Mead. The area around Temple Bar is especially well known for two things: the massive rock formation that gave the area its name and its 20 mile-long unobstructed water ski runs that have every water sports enthusiast rushing to grab a lifejacket and a rope! Temple Bar Marina has all the fun and amenities that you'd expect from Lake Mead.</p> <hr /> <h3><strong>Boating</strong></h3> <h4>Lake Level Changing: Keep Alert & Launch At Your Own Risk</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Boaters should excercise caution and be watchful of unexpected underwater and exposed water hazards.</strong></li> <li><strong>Hazard buoys do not mark every hazard on the water.</strong></li> <li><strong>Be prepared for longer wait times for launching and recovery</strong></li> <li><strong>Ongoing maintenance/construction at ramps may require temporary closures.</strong></li> </ul> <p>The nearest motorized boating access from Temple Bar is at the Temple Bar launch ramp. Rental boats are located nearby at <a href=\"https://templebarlakemead.com/\">Temple Bar Marina</a>. Water-access fuel is located at the Temple Bar Marina.<br />  </p> <hr /> <h3><strong>Camping</strong></h3> <p>Boulder Beach Campground is open year-round and features large paved sites that can accommodate tents or large RVs, along with tables, fire pits and/or grills. Restrooms and water spigots are located throughout the campsite.<br /> <br /> Temperatures usually surpass 100F (37C) degrees June-August. In May and September, daytime highs are around 90F (32C). October-April, temperatures are much cooler. Lows can dip to freezing temps December-February. The area averages 4 inches of rain each year.<br /> <br /> Lush vegetation provides shade, and many sites have pristine views of the lake. Boulder Beach is about a 15-minute walk from the campground.</p> <h3>NPS Operated Campgrounds</h3> <em>*50% discount with Senior/Access Pass<br /> **RV's may park in any NPS campsite; however, there are no hookups.<br /> ***WiFi in campgrounds is operated by a concessionaire service.

    "bodyText": "<h2>Discover Willow Beach</h2> Surrounded by steep canyon walls along the Colorado River, Willow Beach is a paddlecrafter's dream destination. Many visitors choose to take a guided raft or kayak trip from the base of the Hoover Dam to Willow Beach, stopping at coves, hot springs and waterfalls along the way. Others drive straight to Willow Beach where you can rent boats or paddlecraft and fish from the accessible pier.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Georgia, Times, \"Times New Roman\", serif; font-size: 1.5625rem; letter-spacing: -0.25px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\">Boating</span><br /> Willow Beach offers a range of boating services; including a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/boating.htm\">launch ramp</a>, fuel on land and water, along with a variety of <a href=\"https://www.willowbeachharbor.com/watercraft-rates\">boat and equipment rental options</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.willowbeachharbor.com/paddlecraft-rentals\">paddlecraft</a>.

Willow Beach has an <a href=\"https://www.willowbeachharbor.com/willow-beach-campground-and-rv-park\">RV Park and Campground</a> with 28 full-service (water, sewer, electric) RV sites and nine tent sites. All sites have fire rings, picnic tables and 24-hour shower and laundry access. You can also camp in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/backcountry.htm\">backcountry</a> as you kayak up and down the river. <h3>Resteraunts and Picknicking</h3> You may choose to dine while viewing the water at the Willow Beach Grill, or the on-site <a href=\"https://www.willowbeachharbor.com/marina-and-camp-store\">store </a>sells a variety of snacks, drinks and charcoal. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/picnicking.htm\">Picnic</a><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/picnicking-old.htm\"> </a>tables and grills are available throughout the area. <h3>Hiking</h3> While there aren't any hiking trails at Willow Beach, you can hop in a canoe or kayak and paddle up river to access the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/hiking.htm\">Arizona Hot Springs</a>. This trail is located in a dramatic slot canyon that joins the river just downstream of Ringbolt Rapid. <h3>Fishing</h3> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lake/planyourvisit/fishing.htm\">Fishing</a> is a year-round activity in Lake Mohave; each season bringing its own exciting opportunities. For those without a boat, there is an accessible fishing pier, and many enjoy fishing right from the shore. Fishing equipment, bait and supplies are available at the marina store. A convenient fish cleaning station is located east of the marina parking lot.<br /> <br /> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/southwest/fisheries/willow_beach/index.html\">Willow Beach Fish Hatchery</a> is located north of the marina near the fishing pier. They routinely release rainbow trout on Fridays. You can also tour their facility. <h3>Beaches and Coves</h3> The riverfront along Willow Beach Harbor includes a mixture of sandy and smooth rocky beaches with a few picnic tables and grills. If you travel by water north or south along the river, you will encounter many coves. Some offer special wonders of nature, including an emerald cave, hot springs and waterfalls.  <h3>History</h3> <p>From artifacts found along the Colorado River, Willow Beach might have been a prehistoric trading center. The Basketmaker Indians from Lost City started camping at Willow Beach around 250 B.C. In more modern times, Willow Beach became a well-known fishing camp on the Colorado River, and once Davis Dam was built, creating Lake Mohave, more amenities were added like pictured here in 1954.<br /> <br />  </p>",

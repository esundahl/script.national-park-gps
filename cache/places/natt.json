You can experience them all at this overlook that combines everything the Natchez Trace Parkway is about. <br /> <br /> Folks interested in nature and recreation can fish in the pond, watch turtles pile up and warm their shells in the sun, or imagine back more than 11,000 years ago and picture mastodons ambling to the creek.<br /> <br /> Walkers can stretch their legs on a short jaunt into the woods or down to Town Creek. Hikers can access the Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail and walk a little more than 2 miles south to the Chickasaw Village Site, or head northward for little less than two miles to the Beech Springs Trailhead. <br /> <br /> Over time, people have used this area in many ways. The human history of Old Town started with American Indians who settled here. The name Old Town was what the English called a large established Chickasaw village. <br /> <br /> Old Town was not always a peaceful bottomland. The 1914 DAR marker indicates that the Battle of Ackia took place near here, which is debatable, but we know that during the Civil War's Battle of Tupelo, on July 15, 1864, an intense battle was fought in the bottoms at the creek. <br /> <br /> Standing on the north side of the overlook, there are views of both natural and cultivated land protected by the Natchez Trace Parkway. The agricultural land is leased and planted with traditional crops to help conserve the rural beauty of the Parkway. ",
    "audioDescription": "The overlook road branches in two directions. From one side, the bottomland of Town Creek and part of the Belt Belt prairie can be seen from this overlook, along with agricultural land and the Parkway road. A trail passes by the site and a DAR marker from 1914 is prominent next to the interpretive sign. On the other branch of the road, there is a picnic table, and a pond situated between the overlook and the Parkway.",

    "bodyText": "Called \"the Rocky Spring\" by early travelers, the town later became Rocky Springs, a rural community covering about 25 square miles. Settlement of the area began in the late 1790's and continued until about 1860, reaching a peak of approximately 2600 people. Several businesses were established at different times, among them carpenters, wheelwrights, a well digger, cabinet makers, a cotton gin maker and blacksmiths. By the mid-1800's there was also a church, post office, a Masonic Lodge, and possibly a school.<br /> <br /> During the four years that the Civil War raged, many areas in both the North and the South would experience its devastation. A letter written in 1863 stated, \"My slaves, horses, and mules are carried off, my fences torn dowand my crops destroyed...\" <br /> <br /> In the summer fall of 1878, yellow fever struck the area. Pastor J.W. Sandwell on November 18, 1873, wrote that there were 180 yellow fever cases and 43 deaths. Although Rocky Springs tried to recover after the yellow fever epidemic, in the early 1900's boll weevil struck, a beetle that feeds on cotton buds and flowers, devastating the cotton crop. After this final disaster, the population declined rapidly and the last store in the area closed its doors during the 1930's.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the nearby spring no longer flows and today only the church and cemetery, two rustling safes and several abandoned cisterns remain of this once prosperous rural community.",
    "audioDescription": "The Rocky Springs Town Site Trail is about a mile past the entrance of the Rocky Springs Campground on that road. The parking lot is small and can only fit six cars and loops around to take you back towards the campground. There is a paved sidewalk in the of a triangle that takes you to an informational bulletin board on the right of the trailhead. After that there is a short trail that leads to the abandoned town that includes an old church, cemetery, two rustling safes and several abandoned cisterns.",

    "audioDescription": "This pull off is located on the west side of the Natchez Trace Parkway. There is a paved parking lot with space for 4 or 5 cars. Near the parking lot there is two interpretative wayside exhibits. One wayside exhibit is about Choctaw Indian removal and has audio so you can hear from modern Choctaw people. This exhibit, titled “Broken Promises,” features an illustration of a group of Choctaw walking in the snow, away from their Eastern homeland. A map shows the lands ceded by treaties, and a photograph of a commemoration of Choctaw removal. The route the Choctaw took is in the distance, beyond the panel. The landscape is now mixed forest and fields. [Text] After 1800, treaties between the Choctaw and the US government whittled away tribal rights and lands. Finally, in 1830, the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was negotiated at a council house near this spot. All the remaining Choctaw homeland— nearly 10.5 million acres—was taken. From 1831 through 1834, thousands of Choctaw trekked over 500 miles to “Indian Territory.” The US War Department had promised in 1830 to “be kind and brotherly to them…to furnish them with ample corn and beef, or pork for themselves and their families.” Instead, the Choctaw had inadequate clothing and supplies. Heavy rain, blizzard-like snowfall, and a shortage of wagons turned the forced removal deadly. On the map, Choctaw land is flanked by the Mississippi River on the west and extends into portions of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Natchez Trace runs northeast to southwest across the Choctaw homeland to the port of Natchez on the Mississippi River. Treaties in 1801, 1802, 1805, 1816, and 1820 took two thirds of the Choctaw homeland. The 1830 Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek took the remainder. You are standing along the Natchez Trace in the Choctaw’s land ceded in 1820. [Text] Choctaw artist Gwen Coleman Lester captures the harsh conditions and tribal determination to survive at the core of Choctaw removal. In her painting, the Choctaw, most staring ahead, walk forward on snow-covered ground. They are wrapped in blankets, and wear moccasins. Leafless trees surround them. A man in front uses a walking stick. To the left of the man, a child carries a bundle on its back. To the right, a woman with down turned eyes holds a baby in a blanket. Two uniformed soldiers on horseback watch the Choctaw pass by. The group stretches across a creek in the distance. At the back, livestock pull wagons. A photo shows a uniformed honor guard leading a crowd down a paved road. The honor guards wear red berets. Two carry flags and two have shouldered rifles. The day is bright and sunny. The trees are in full leaf. [Text] Tribal members from the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma walk each year to memorialize their ancestors who survived and perished on the Trail of Tears. The exhibit panel has a black band across the top. The band contains the National Park Service arrowhead on the right and the words National Park Service and U.S. Department of the Interior. On the left, the band contains the words Natchez Trace Parkway. Several yards to your right, there is a group of three, routed wood signs with more information about the Choctaw homeland and treaties.",

And following the victory of the Battle of New Orleans, most of the Americans who fought the battle returned on the Trace. Volunteers marched hundreds of miles often in severe weather with little food and inadequate equipment. Natchez Trace inns served as hospitals. Soldiers who did not survive the marches are buried in unmarked graves along the Trace.

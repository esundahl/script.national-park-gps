It is not accessible to wheelchairs. In winter, there may be snow or icy conditions; we recommend traction devices for hikers.</li> <li><strong>Dogs are not allowed on this trail</strong>. Service animals are allowed in national parks. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/service-animals.htm\">What is a service animal?</a></li> </ul> <p>Descendants of these people still live in the region and consider the spring a sacred place. Help protect our heritage by not entering the spring. <strong>Do not touch or mark the rock markings. It is a violation of federal law to deface pictographs.</strong></p> <h2>Canyon Country</h2> <p>The geology and climate of Canyonlands have created an unusual landscape characterized by maze-like canyons, sheer cliff faces, strange rock formations, deep crevices, and alcoves. Some areas are hospitable to life; some are not. Water plays a major role in determining suitable habitat for humans as well as plants and animals. As you hike Cave Spring Trail, notice how the presence of water has affected each area. Plants, animals, and people have all played a part in shaping the environment we see today. In turn, the canyons have molded the behavior, adaptations, and character of the inhabitants.</p> <h2><strong>Cowboys</strong></h2> <p>In the late 1800s pioneering <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/cany/learn/historyculture/minersranchers.htm\">cattlemen</a> settled in canyon country and carved successful cattle operations out of this desert.</p> <p>Widespread ranching required cowboys to stay on the open range with their cattle. They lived in isolated outdoor camps such at this one near Cave Spring. They used these camps from the late 1800s through 1975, when cattle ranching ended inside the park. Many original items left by the cowboys remain. Please do not enter the camp, touch, or remove the objects.</p> <p>The cowboys cooked over an open fire, using Dutch ovens and other simple cookware. Usual cowboy fare included beans, bacon, potatoes, canned goods, sourdough biscuits, and the ever-present coffee.</p> <p>Cowboys established the camp at Cave Spring because of the reliable water source. Rainwater percolating through layers of porous sandstone forms these seeps. Moisture hastens erosion of the rock face and carves alcoves.</p> <h2>Sacred Water</h2> <p>Springs are rare in the desert. In the alcove beyond the cowboy camp, you may notice soot-blackened ceilings, handprints, & painted figures. These tell us that this precious resource also attracted earlier people. Ancestors of today's <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/cany/learn/historyculture/nativeamericans.htm\">Native Americans </a>occupied these canyons six millennia before the cattlemen arrived, about 6,000 to 700 years ago.</p> <p>Before the adoption of corn agriculture, Native Americans kept on the move. They followed the annual migrations of their prey and camped near areas with fresh water and plants they could use. Once they domesticated foods like squash, corn, and beans, they moved less and began farming. They left the area when the water table dropped following prolonged drought, making farming difficult.</p> <h2>Plants and Animals</h2> <p>Few plants can survive the intense heat and dryness of bare rock. Shallow pockets of soil support the growth of <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/articles/seug-soil-crust.htm\">biological soil crust</a>. This crust is made up of cyanobacteria, lichens, moss, fungi, and algae, and it is an essential component of the desert ecosystem. It protects soils from wind and water erosion and enriches them with nitrogen and other nutrients. Biological soil crust can take years to grow, and careless footsteps can crush it. Tracks remain visible for decades. Please stay on established trails or bare rock.</p> <p>You can learn about plants and how people have made use of them over time. Signs mark specific plants along the trail.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Horseshoe Canyon contains some of the most significant ancient rock markings in North America. The Great Gallery, the best known pictograph panel in Horseshoe Canyon, includes well-preserved, life-sized figures with intricate designs. Other impressive sights include spring wildflowers, sheer sandstone walls, and mature cottonwood groves along the intermittent stream in the canyon bottom. Horseshoe Canyon was added to Canyonlands National Park in 1971.</p> <p>The archeology of Horseshoe Canyon spans thousands of years of human history. Artifacts recovered from sites in this area date back as early as 9000-7000 BCE (Before Common Era), when Paleoindians hunted large mammals like mastodons and mammoths across the southwest.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cany/learn/historyculture/nativeamericans.htm\">American Indian</a> rock markings found in Horseshoe Canyon are most commonly painted in a style known as “Barrier Canyon.” This style is believed to date to the Late Archaic period, from 2000 BCE to 500 CE (Common Era). During this time, nomadic groups of hunter-gatherers made Horseshoe Canyon their seasonal home.</p> <p>During later periods, the Fremont-era and Ancestral Puebloan cultures left their own distinctive rock markings in the canyon, but their presence was brief in comparison, and final abandonment occurred by 1300 CE.</p> <p>The Great Gallery is the best known and most spectacular of the Horseshoe Canyon panels. This well preserved site includes both pictographs (painted figures) and petroglyphs (figures etched in the rock with a sharp stone). The tapered, life-size figures lack arms and legs but frequently contain intricate designs. These designs are characteristic of the Barrier Canyon style.</p> <p>Though Horseshoe Canyon is most famous for its rock markings, the canyon’s history has many chapters. After centuries of indigenous peoples passed through, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cany/learn/historyculture/non-indigenous-settlement-and-exploration.htm\">European Americans</a> arrived. Outlaws like Butch Cassidy made use of Horseshoe Canyon in the late 1800s, taking refuge in the confusing network of canyons, especially those around Robbers Roost to the southwest.</p> <p>In the early 1900s, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cany/learn/historyculture/minersranchers.htm\">ranchers</a> built several stock trails into Horseshoe Canyon so livestock could reach water and feed in the canyon bottom. Eventually, the ranchers constructed a pumping operation to fill water tanks on the canyon rim. Many of these modifications are still visible today.</p> <p>Prospectors explored the area in the mid-1900s, improving many stock trails to accommodate vehicles and drill rigs. Though they searched the rock layers for oil and other minerals, no successful wells or mines were ever established around Horseshoe Canyon.</p> <p>After being added to Canyonlands National Park in 1971, grazing and mineral exploration in Horseshoe ended. Today, park visitors descend the old ranching trail and marvel at the history of this magnificent canyon.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cany/planyourvisit/horseshoecanyon.htm\">Visiting Horseshoe Canyon</a> requires driving on unpaved roads, which can become impassable with changing weather. Visiting the rock painting and pecking panels requires a hike of up to seven miles roundtrip.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "This heritage area landscape is distinguished by its rugged terrain, diverse rock features and geology, and unique small communities connected along Highway 89. There is a variety of geological and geographical features, such as rocky terrain, red cliffs, forests, and rivers.The Colorado River (including its tributaries), wind, and rain have physically shaped this region, which helped to create its canyons, arches, and gullies. Also of interest are Native American sites and cliff drawings, highlighting the years before settlement of Mormon Pioneers.",

Look for signs of upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, heavy panting, or disorientation and confusion. Rest in the shade, give pets cool water or ice cubes, cool them with a wet towel or with water, and seek medical attention if necessary. Avoid walking pets during the hottest parts of the day. </p> <p>When walking leashed pets in designated frontcountry areas, keep in mind that pavement can get dangerously hot. Try this test. Place your hand on the pavement for 7-10 seconds.

Dogs are predators that can chase, scare and transmit diseases to local wildlife. Even their lingering scent can disrupt an animals’ natural movement and behavior. In such a harsh desert environment, expending energy in this way threatens the survival of species that the park aims to protect.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pets can disturb or destroy natural resources, such as native plants and fragile desert soils. Sensitive cultural and archeological sites may be inadvertently damaged by inquisitive pets.</p> </li> <li> <p>The safety of your pet should be a top priority. Canyonlands is a harsh desert environment with many hazards, including sharp rocks, cliff edges, rattlesnakes and scorpions that can harm your pet. Dogs can easily become the hunted. Your pet may become prey for wildlife like coyotes and mountain lions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Not all visitors are comfortable around pets. Dogs can bite humans. Even if your pet follows instructions and is well behaved, others do not know this and may feel uneasy when encountering you.

    "bodyText": "<p>A short, 0.9 mi (1.4 km) drive past the Island in the Sky visitor center leads to a breathtaking view of the Shafer Trail. <br /> <br /> The Shafer Trail at the Island in the Sky district of Canyonlands National Park is an iconic road that descends 1,500 feet (457 m) through a colorful, massive sandstone cliff. Its function has changed through the years; from a route made by Native Americans to access resources on the mesa top, to a trail for sheep herders moving flocks to better foraging in winter time, and then a road for trucks moving loads of uranium from the backcountry to market. Today, the Shafer Trail is a challenging, unpaved backcountry road for recreational users seeking the experience of a lifetime.</p> <h4>Shafer Trail History</h4> <p>The Shafer Trail is named after the Shafer family, who were Mormon pioneer settlers. Starting in 1916, John “Sog” Shafer, used this trail to move cattle from summer pastures on the mesa top to winter ground on the White Rim sandstone, several rock layers down into the canyon. John Shafer is credited for improving the trail and making access into the canyon easier. Many other trails at Island in the Sky also bear names for the families who worked them.<br /> <br /> Expanding upon the work of Sog Shafer, the Atomic Energy Commission widened Shafer Trail and extended it to the White Rim Road to accommodate trucks moving loads of uranium-bearing rock from the backcountry and down to Moab for processing. Many backcountry roads in the Moab area used for recreation today were improved by the Atomic Energy Commission.</p> <p>After Canyonlands was established in 1964, ranchers were granted a ten-year extension of ranching in the park. </p> <h4>From Ranching to Recreation</h4> <p>Overtime, the use of Shafer transitioned from ranching to recreation. Today, hundred of visitors every year experience the thrill of a lifetime driving down the sandstone cliff to the basin below.<br /> <br /> For more information on driving the Shafer Trail, check out the Scenic Drives section under Things to Do. </p> <h4>Accessibility</h4> <p>This small roadside pullout is paved with enough space to accommodate a handful of cars. A short, but unpaved and uneven trail leads to a fenced viewing area. </p> <h4>Driving Tips</h4> <p>Driving the Shafer Trail is something that you’ll never forget, however, it is important to do it safely.</p> <ul> <li> <p>High-clearance 4WD vehicles with a low range gear (4LO) are <strong>strongly </strong>recommended. ATVs, OHVs, or UTVs are not permitted inside the park.</p> </li> <li> <p>Backcountry driving conditions can change rapidly after rain or snow. Check the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cany/planyourvisit/weather.htm\">weather report</a> before starting your trip and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cany/planyourvisit/road-conditions.htm\">current road conditions</a> before heading out. </p> </li> <li>Buckle up! Seatbelts are required on all roads.</li> <li>Obey the 15 mph (24 kph) speed limit.</li> <li>Watch for low overhanging rocks.</li> <li>Uphill traffic has the “right-of-way.” Use berms and pull-outs to allow uphill traffic to pass safely.</li> <li>Please stay on the trail so as not to disturb biological soil crust. Damaged soils are prone to erosion and invasive species.</li> </ul>   <h4> </h4>",

Emigration into the Canyonlands area increased. Both groups were farmers, seeking locations that provided water, arable land, building sites, and a variety of wild plants. One of those productive locations was the nearby Salt Creek drainage.</p> <p>The ancestral Puebloans practiced full-time farming, but the Fremont split their time between farming and foraging. They raised corn, beans, squash, and cotton and gathered seeds, roots, and fruits. They also hunted deer and bighorn sheep and trapped or snared small animals and birds.</p> <p>Climate change and regional droughts in the late 1200s made farming difficult. By the end of the century most farmers had emigrated south to what is now New Mexico and Arizona. They joined other groups that would become the Hopi and Zuni tribes. Others stayed and adapted to the colder climate by relying on wild plant gathering. These groups would become local Ute and Paiute tribes.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>This unusually circular and tilted geologic formation is a bit of a mystery, obviously different from what's around it. For the best view, hike the one-mile roundtrip (1.5 km) trail to the first overlook (climbing 100 feet/30 meters).</p> <h4>What Happened Here?</h4> <p>Canyonlands is a place of relative geologic order, with rock layers that have not been altered, tilted or folded significantly in the millions of years since they were laid down by ancient seas, rivers or winds.</p> <p>In the area of Upheaval Dome, approximately three miles (5 km) across, rock layers are dramatically deformed. In the center, the rocks are pushed up into a circular structure called a dome, or an anticline. Surrounding this dome is a downwarp in the rock layers called a syncline. What caused these folds at Upheaval Dome? Geologists do not know for sure, but there are two main theories which are hotly debated.</p> <h4><strong>Salt Dome Hypothesis</strong></h4> <p>A thick layer of salt, formed by the evaporation of ancient landlocked seas, underlies much of southeastern Utah and Canyonlands National Park. When under pressure from thousands of feet of overlying rock, the salt can flow plastically, like ice moving at the bottom of a glacier. In addition, salt is less dense than sandstone. As a result, over millions of years salt can flow up through rock layers as a \"salt bubble\", rising to the surface and creating salt domes that deform the surrounding rock.</p> <p>When geologists first suggested that Upheaval Dome was the result of a salt dome, they believed the land form resulted from erosion of the rock layers above the dome itself. Recent research suggests that a salt bubble as well as the overlying rock have been entirely removed by erosion and the present surface of Upheaval Dome is the pinched off stem below the missing bubble. If true, Upheaval Dome would earn the distinction of being the most deeply eroded salt structure on earth.</p> <h4><strong>Impact Crater Hypothesis</strong></h4> <p>When meteorites collide with the earth, they leave impact craters like the well-known one in Arizona. Some geologists estimate that roughly 60 million years ago, a meteorite with a diameter of approximately one-third of a mile hit at what is now the Upheaval Dome. The impact created a large explosion, sending dust and debris high into the atmosphere. The impact initially created an unstable crater that partially collapsed. As the area around Upheaval Dome reached an equilibrium, the rocks underground heaved upward to fill the void left by the impact. Erosion since the impact has washed away any meteorite debris, and now provides a glimpse into the interior of the impact crater, exposing rock layers once buried thousands of feet underground.</p> <h4><strong>Upheaval Dome Today</strong></h4> <p><a href=\"http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/36/3/227.abstract\">Recent research findings</a> support the meteorite hypothesis, but questions still remain. Within Canyonlands National Park, Upheaval Dome serves as a protected geologic laboratory where all can learn about, and be inspired by, the mysteries of nature. Perhaps, with time, we may solve the mystery of this crater and others on our planet.</p>",

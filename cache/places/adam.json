    "bodyText": "Abigail Adams brought these White Roses of York to Quincy (then Braintree) from England. They were planted in 1788. Abigail’s great-grandson, Brooks Adams, moved the roses to this location where they continue to thrive.  The roses bloom to this day, using the same original root system, around mid-June. Abigail had also brought with her some Red Roses of Lancaster which unfortunately died many years ago.",
    "audioDescription": "A trellis of roses. Toward the top is a sign that reads, \"Yorkist Rose Tree Set Out By Abigail Adams In 1788.\" The roses bloom in mid-June and are white. Following the bloom, red berries take up the place where the rose was. The green leaves will remain through the summer.",

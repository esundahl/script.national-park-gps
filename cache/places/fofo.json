    "bodyText": "<p>The sheer immensity of the two Rodman guns at Fort Foote made them objects of curiosity wehn they were first brought to the Fort. Visitors frequently came to see them. The 15-inch Rodmans weigh about 49,000 pounds, and required 300 to 400 soldiers to move them up the bluff from river to fort. The balls fired by the smooth-bore Rodmans weigh 500 to 600 pounds and took about fifty pounds of black powder, a type of gunpowder.</p> <p>It was a special occasion each time the big guns were fired. On February 27, 1864, three shots were fired from the 15-inch Rodman. Crowds of visitors beheld the occasion. Again, on April 1, 1864, a large party from Washington came to witness the workings of the big guns. The Rodman was fired at a 25-degree elevation at a range of three miles. Because the guns put off an intense concussive force, it was noted that observers would raise their toes and open their mouths to lessen the effects.<br /> The cannon closest to the river is of particular importance. Engraved on its 15-inch muzzle is 'No. 1' and the initials 'TJR'. The 'No 1' is in reference to the fact that this cannon was the first produced by Cyrus Alger and Company. The initials are of the individual who inspected the gun, in this case Brigadier General Thomas J. Rodman who also designed the weapon. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Spaced about 70 yards apart two massive cannons point out over the water.

    "bodyText": "<p><span>In October 1862, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton appointed a commission to examine the efficiency of the Defenses of Washington. The commision evaluated each of the forts, and made recommendations for improvement. Toward the end of the account, one gap was noted in the defensive arrangement:</span></p> <p>\"The commission furthers their opinion that the Defense of Washington cannot be considered complete without the defense of the river against an enemy's armed vessels. Foreign intervention would bring against us always in superior naval force on the Potomac, and we are, even now, threatened with Confederate iron-clads fitted in English Ports. The Commission believe on Jones' Point near Alexandria, a battery of six guns of the heaviest caliber, say four 200-pounders and two 15-inch guns in casements, and by constructing a battery of ten guns and a covering work on the opposite shore of the Potomac, at the near Roziers Bluff. An examination had been made, revealing a most favorable and strong position on that side, easily communicated with by water. Surveys are in progress.\"</p> <p>The suggestion of the committee was accepted, and the work on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fofo/learn/historyculture/index.htm\">Fort Foote</a> began at Rozier's Bluff in 1863. </p> <p>The grand earthwork was first constructed in 1863 by the 9th New York Heavy Artillery, commanded by Colonel William Seward, Jr. The site, together with Battery Rodgers in Alexandria, Virginia, was designed for river defense. Their massive 15-inch Rodman guns (Columbiads) and 200-pounder Parrott rifles possessed the firepower to penetrate enemy ironclad ships. The Federal engineers had perfected earthwork construction around Washington D.C. by this point in the war. Brigadier General John G. Barnard, Chief Engineer Defenses of Washington, described the two sites as \"model works.\"Fort Foote was named in honor of Rear Admiral Andrew H. Foote, who distinguished himself in the actions against the confederate forts on the Mississippi Rivers and died of wounds on June 26,1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote's guns became a tourist attraction for government officials, military officers, and well-connect civilians, who traveled on river transports from the city to the Maryland shoreline to see the 49,000 lbs Rodmans test fired. General Barnard invited President Abraham Lincoln to visit the fort in late 1863.<br /> <br /> Fort Foote remained an active military installation until 1874. The U.S. Army performed a number of tests and experiments with cannons, carriages, and stone magazines at the site. <br /> <br />  </p> <p><span> </span></p>",

A black Rodman Gun sits on a gray concrete foundation dug into the earth. The gun is about 15 feet long by 8 feet tall, or 5 meters long by 2 and a half meters tall. The reddish-brown dirt is cut away to show the underground supporting structure. The gun consists of a large horizontal carriage with a bottle-shaped cannon on top. The gun points to the left, toward the river. Below ground, are stacked gray counterweights to balance the gun for raising and lowering it. On the right, four soldiers stand at the base of the gun, ready to push it up and over the fort wall to fire. On the left, two soldiers stand on top of the fort wall. The fort wall is built of upright logs and topped with green grass. One soldier points towards the river. Over the color illustration, is a ghosted illustration of the Rodman Gun in firing position. To fire, the soldiers pivot the enormous gun on its mount to raise it over the fort wall. At the same time, the counterweights below drop into a deep pit. After firing, the gun’s recoil slides it back down the mount to its resting position. [End of message]",

The gun is about 15 feet long by 8 feet tall, or 5 meters long by 2 and a half meters tall. On the top left, is black text on a blue and purple background: Load. Ready. Fire! Loading the 15-inch, Rodman Gun required a team of over a dozen men working in sync on separate tasks. From start to finish, each shot took 5 minutes. A crew in the front rammed the powder charge down the barrel, followed by the 450-pound, or 204-kilogram, cannonball. The gunner called out orders for the crew below to adjust the aim: “Left. Stop. Elevate!” The wheels of the massive gun turned toward its target. Pulling a long lanyard ignited the friction primer. As the soldiers cleared for safety, a flame shot into the powder bag and ignited the powder. End of Text A color illustration fills the panel. In the center of the panel, is a large black Rodman Gun, just like the one in front of you. It stands on a round gray concrete platform with circular tracks so the Rodman Gun can rotate. Its bottle-shaped cannon is mounted on a black steel carriage. Behind the gun, are the fort’s brown log and earthen walls, topped with green grass. The ground around the concrete platform is brown. The sky above is blue with purple across the top. There are 14 soldiers in blue Union uniforms around the Rodman Gun. At the far left, 2 soldiers hold a beige wooden box, filled with gunpowder. A soldier stands at the left end of the steel carriage. Another soldier stands on the carriage and holds the aiming ring on top of the cannon. In front of the gun, 4 soldiers hold a shell hook to lift a cannonball. A shell hook is a wooden log with arched metal tongs that hook into the cannonball. Behind them, are 2 more soldiers working to ready another cannonball. To the right of the gun, is a neatly stacked pyramid of cannonballs, each twice the diameter of a person’s head. At the right end of the gun, is a group of soldiers. 1 lifts a bag of gunpowder to give to a second soldier. A third soldier holds the sponge, which is a long staff with sheep fleece at the end. On the top right, is black text on a blue background: The Rodman Guns were the largest weapons developed during the Civil War. The technological marvels in front of you are 2 of only 25 left of the 15-inch, or 38-centimeter, model. End of Text [End of message]",

In metric, that is about 1 meter wide by a half meter tall, and about 1 meter off the ground. The trail continues to your right and your left. To the right, is where the barracks used to stand. To the left, is the trail toward the fort. Behind you, on the other side of the trail, is a concrete horse trough, which is about 6 feet long by 1 foot wide and 2 feet tall. In metric, that is about 2 meters long by a quarter meter wide by a half meter tall. Ahead of you, is a dense forest. A color illustration fills the panel. The illustration shows a busy fort, the Potomac River with many ships, and Alexandria in the distance. On the left, is the six-sided earthen fort. The fort is longer than it is wide. To the right, is a grassy landscape with several buildings. The buildings are labeled with white text on green backgrounds. From left to right, are the hospital, horse trough, barracks, and officers’ quarters. Around the horse trough and barracks, horses pull covered wagons with supplies. A dirt road runs from the bottom left corner of the panel, up and to the right, and past the fort. It ends at a rectangular dock on the top right edge of the landscape. Across the middle of the panel, is the light blue Potomac River. The other side of the river is Virginia, which was Union occupied. On the top right, is the City of Alexandria, made up of red-roofed buildings. To the right of the dock, is black text on a blue background: Distances are exaggerated for interpretive purposes. End of Text Across the top of the panel, is dark text on a light background: New Forts for a New War. As the Civil War loomed, Union forces battened down the hatches of Washington, DC.

Attached to the panel, is a table 3 feet wide by 1 and a half feet deep, and 3 feet off the ground. This table supports a bronze model of the fort. The panel is at the edge of the parking lot. Ahead is a dirt path, that leads to the fort. The background is a red map of Washington, DC, and the surrounding area. At the top, is the text quoted in this entry's body text, in yellow and white. Under the text, is a black-and-white photograph of 9 Boy Scouts sitting or standing on a Rodman Gun, lying in the grass. Students and scouts used the site in the early 1900s. The National Park Service took over the fort in 1931, changing the fort’s mission from defense to recreation and conservation. At the right, is a large black-and-white portrait of a standing Union Rear Admiral Andrew Hull Foote. He is bearded and dressed in military uniform, with prominent epaulettes, or decorative fringe, on his shoulders. His left arm wraps around his sword hilt. He died in 1863. He is known for his heroic actions on the Mississippi River. Across the bottom of the panel, is a black-and-white photograph of the fort under construction in 1863-1864. In the center, is a large earthen mound with wooden footings. To either side of the mound, is a flattened path. On the outer sides of the path, are earthen walls and wooden structures. Most of the structures are finished with round, earthen roofs, but some are still being built. The surrounding area is devoid of trees, unlike today. Across the bottom, is a transparent yellow banner. Within the banner, on the right, is the quote by Alfred Seelye Roe in red text. The other side of the panel is filled with a blue, green, and off-white map. Virginia is at left, Maryland is at right, and the Potomac River is in between. Washington, DC is at the top. Several National Parks Service sites are located in this region along the river. On the map, they are shaded green and labeled by name. The map shows hiking trails, off-road bicycle trails, on-road bicycle routes, food services, marinas, boat ramps, and canoe or kayak launches. Across the bottom, is a color photograph of a farm. This is Oxon Hill Farm at Oxon Cove Park, which is 4 and a half miles, or 7 kilometers, north of Fort Foote. At left, are 2 brown cows lying on green grass. In the background, at right, is a red barn with a gray roof. A red hay loader sits in front of the barn. In top left corner of the photograph, is white text: Your Adventure Continues End of Text At the right end of the photograph, is the image caption in white text on a green background. On the left side, in the middle, is a color photograph of Fort Washington Park. The fort is a gray stone and concrete building on a grassy hill. It was built on the east bank of the Potomac River. Fort Washington is 6 and a half miles, or 10 kilometers, south of Fort Foote. Under the photograph, is the image caption in white text on a green background. In the top left corner of the panel, is a color photograph of Piscataway Park. A man stands among driftwood on the banks of the Potomac River.

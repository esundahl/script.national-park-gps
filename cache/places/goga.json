This scenic and underutilized piece of property, known to locals as \"Black Point\" because of the bluff's dark laurel trees, offered refuge from the rapidly growing city. Black Point was exceptionally desirable to opportunistic real estate developers and because the U.S. government had trouble enforcing its property claims, a few entrepreneurial civilians moved in and claimed the land for their own.<br /> <br /> By 1855, San Francisco real estate developers had constructed five large, private residences at Black Point. Some of San Francisco's most influential citizens moved into these elegant homes and over the next nine years, Black Point became a prestigious community of well-educated bankers, merchants, and literary figures. Fortunately, three of these civilian, pre-Civil War homes still stand: Quarters 2 (Brooks House), Quarters 3 (Haskell House), and Quarters 4 (Palmer House, located a little further up north) are the oldest Fort Mason buildings and reflect the popular mid-19th century Italianate Style.</p>",

To the right is an open grassy field and across it, 75 feet away, another picnic table.<br /> <br /> PANEL #1: Exploring the Coast...and Beyond<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: This panel features an aerial photo of a stretch of beach with part of the coastline forming a concave arc, like a half-circle. Part of the coast is low-lying beach, most is hilly terrain covered in lush, green plants. Further east is a depression that forms a valley. To the left of the photo are ocean waters that go from blue in deeper sections, to an aquamarine green next to the beach.<br /> <br /> MAP DESCRIPTION: A map showing the lands north of the San Francisco Peninsula up to Healdsburg. Red lines represent state highways and interstates, and major cities and towns are labeled in black. Most of the map is an off-white, but a section on the western coast from the Marin Headlands north to Tomales Bay is represented in two shades of green. The darker green, which includes part of northern San Francisco and continues north to include areas east of Point Reyes National Seashore, represents Golden Gate National Recreation Area land. The lighter green, from Bolinas to Tomales Bay, represents other open land spaces.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Golden Gate National Recreation Area preserves a rich diversity of natural beauty and interesting history. Some of the Park's most breathtaking landscapes lie along the Marin coast. Hawks, terns, cormorants and many more winged species soar above rugged cliffs, sheltered valleys, redwood forest, rolling grasslands, chaparral, old military fortifications and other historic sites. You can explore the same terrain on the Park's many miles of trails.<br /> <br /> TEXT: What to See and Do<br /> <br /> LIST: 2 trails.<br /> <br /> TRAIL #1: The Overlook Trail is a short walk along the cliff's edge to the breathtaking vista point. On clear days you can see south to San Francisco's Ocean Beach, north to Bolinas and Point Reyes, east to the peak of Mount Tamalpais, and west to the Farallon Islands.<br /> <br /> TRAIL #2: The Owl Trail, named for the great horned owls that roost in the area's cypress trees, begin at the north end of the parking area. Approximately 1.5 miles long (one way), and mostly easy, the trail leads to a small rocky beach and tide pools where you might see crabs, anemones, and other sea creatures. Along the way, about a mile from here, you can see cows, goats, and other farm animals at Slide Ranch-a non-profit teaching farm. Beware that sections of the Owl Trail can be slippery, particularly the steep stretch above the beach.<br /> <br /> TEXT: For more trail information contact the Marin Headlands Visitor Center at (415) 331-1540. Or visit our website at w w w . n p s . g o v / g o g a.<br /> <br /> CAUTION: Please stay on designated trails-the cliffs are unstable, constantly eroding and dangerous to climb on.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: The railed path down to the overlook with green coastal scrub to either side in the top left corner. Below the photo of the railed path is one of a signposts for Owl Trail, which runs parallel along the coast.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Wildflowers. Yellow bush lupine and other beautiful wildflowers color these bluffs and slopes in spring and summer. Please remember that everything is protected in a national park. Take pictures, not wildflowers.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photograph of yellow blossoms arranged vertically along stalks, nestled in the green grass.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Whale watching. The Muir Beach Overlook is a great place to watch for grey whales migrating north in spring and south in fall and early winter.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photo of a grey whale breaking the surface of the water with its head. Its sleek, glossy skin glistens in the sun, reflecting off the water.<br /> <br /> TEX: Picnicking. Pick a table out in the open and enjoy a panoramic view with your meal or take a table in the trees for a little shelter from the wind.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Dog Walking. In national park areas where dogs are permitted, federal law (36 CFR Part 2) requires that dog owners observe leash requirements, keep your pets under control at all times, and pick up after your pets. For current information about areas open to dogs, visit www.nps.gov/goga/planyourvisit/pets.htm, or call (415) 561-4732.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Beyond the Park.<br /> <br /> LIST: Points North...And East<br /> <br /> - Stinson Beach. A white sand beach 3.5 miles long, with lifeguards on duty during the summer, and plenty of picnic tables, make Stinson Beach popular in the summer.<br /> <br /> o DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Stinson Beach with a long, straight coastline and a white, sandy beach.<br /> - Mount Tamalpais State Park. Approximately 80 miles of trails wind through the park's redwood and oak forests, passing many beautiful little waterfalls, up and around Mount Tamalpais (2,571 feet/784 meters), to the peak's incredible views of the Bay Area.<br /> <br /> - Point Reyes National Seashore. Point Reyes National Seashore includes 32,000 acres of coastal wilderness, featuring 70 miles of trails. This is another great place for hiking in diverse terrain, beach strolling, and whale watching. You also can visit the historic Point Reyes Lighthouse and a life-size copy of a Miwok Indian village at the Bear Valley Visitors Center.<br /> <br /> - Wine Country. Sonoma and Napa Counties are renowned for vineyards and wineries. But there's plenty for the whole family to explore-Sonoma's town square where California's Bear Flag was first raised when Alta California was wrested from Mexican rule...the haunting ruins of writer Jack London's stone house in the woods...and much more.<br /> <br /> LIST: Points South<br /> <br /> - Muir Beach. Muir Beach is located just off Highway 1 about one mile south of here. You can enjoy a stroll on the beach or a hike up the trail at the southern end for sweeping views of the beach and coast.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photo of Muir Beach to the right. It appears to have a smaller coastline than Stinson, and steep rising cliffs on either side, covered in rocks and trees.<br /> - Marin Headlands.<br /> - Point Bonita Lighthouse. Located in the Marin Headlands about a half hour drive from here. Built in 1855 and relocated in 1877 to its current rocky perch high above the crashing surf, the Point Bonita Lighthouse is still active-and open weekends to visitors willing to walk the heart-stopping suspension footbridge.<br /> - Battery Spencer. The army completed this gun battery in 1897 and used it until 1943, along with many others, to guard San Francisco's harbor entrance. Located on Conzulman Road just off Highway 101, the battery offers stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge.<br /> <br /> LIST: Park Regulations.<br /> - Camping is allowed only in designated areas by reservation. Fires are prohibited in backcountry areas.<br /> - Emergency Information. In an emergency call (415) 561-5656 or dial 911. You may also contact the Park Communications Center at (415) 331-1540.<br /> - General Park Information. Learn more about the Golden Gate National Recreation Area at www.nps.gov/goga or call (415) 331-1540.<br /> <br /> PANEL #2: Muir Beach Overlook<br /> <br /> TEXT: The grand sweep of the continent's edge-from the top of Mount Tamalpais to this bluff above the sea and out to the Farallon Islands-is a seamless span of interdependent plant and animal communities. Habitats converge, species from one habitat feed upon species from another. Dry land gives way to ocean, but the web of life is rich in complexity, crossing harsh boundaries.<br /> <br /> QUOTE: \"When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.\" - John Muir<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photo of the coastal view to the north from Muir Beach Overlook. Green, rolling hills with black rocks dotting the dark blue waters in front of them all the way north into the distance.<br /> <br /> TEXT: While the grizzly bears that once roamed this landscape are gone, most of what you see looks as it did 10,000 years ago. This area is wonderfully preserved. Coyote brush and other vegetation provide cover and food to bobcats, monarch butterflies, and other mammals, reptiles, birds, and insects. The tide pools at the water's edge and the deep waters teem with marine plants and animals, including migrating whales.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: An artist's colorful illustration of the northern coastline at Muir Beach Overlook teeming with life. A flock of brown pelicans fly westward over the ocean in the top left corner, while in the foreground a bobcat peers over hillside at a red, white black towhee bird perched above a cluster of whitish pink seaside daisies with yellow center. Coastal scrub plants half-hide an orange and black monarch butterfly in the bottom right corner, and behind it, a coyote steps out amongst green leaves. In the distance a black turkey vulture hovers over the cliff, while a red-tailed hawk soars upwards with the green hills that extend to the north.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. The Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary supports 33 species of marine mammals, including half of California's harbor seal population. Countless fish, invertebrate, and plant species live in the sanctuary's waters. The Farallon Islands are home to the largest colony of seabirds in the lower 48 continental states.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Cooperation between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which manages the sanctuary, and the National Park Service, has ensured stewardship that serves the sanctuary and park's interdependent communities.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photo of several dark brown sea lions on a dark rock outcropping with grey ocean waters behind them. To the right of the first photo is a photo of a cormorant; a black bird with a long neck, webbed feet and a dark yellow beak perched on a rock near the surface of the water.<br /> <br /> MAP: A map of the California coast from Point Reyes National Seashore to the north, down to the San Francisco Peninsula Watershed south of Sweeney Ridge. The map also shows both the San Francisco and San Pablo Bays to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Labeled in the ocean waters are several protected water areas, including Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary to the north, off the coast of Point Reyes, Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary along the lower half of Point Reyes down to just south of San Francisco. Furthest south, is the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, which includes waters that dip below the map.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Peoples of the Coast. The Miwok people once hunted, fished, and gathered plant foods along this coast. In the 19th century, ranches were established by Spanish and Mexican colonists, and then by American settlers with roots from many parts of Europe-including Portuguese ranchers and fishermen who settled in this area.<br /> <br /> Having survived successive waves of colonization, the Coast Miwok today, together with the southern Pomo people, make up the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria. Today, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area preserves thousands of acres of historic ranchland and historic sites.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Men, women, and children dressed in work clothes standing facing the camera amidst cows and horses. Behind them are three large, white buildings. Most prominently is a white building with an A-frame roof.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Dairymen and their families, isolated from neighbors and from town, worked seven days a week, from before dawn to sunset.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Did you know...<br /> <br /> TEXT: John Muir was the driving force behind the concept of preserving wilderness areas as national parks. He swayed five American presidents with his passionate vision, including Theodore Roosevelt, who established five parks during his administration, (1901-1909), including Yosemite.<br /> <br /> TEXT: In 1905, the redwood trees at nearby Muir Woods were threatened to be cut down for lumber. The land was purchased and preserved by Congressman William Kent, who encouraged President Theodore Roosevelt to create Muir Woods National Monument in 1908, naming the park after John Muir.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photo of two men wearing brimmed hats, waistcoats, ties and jackets posing for the camera. The man on the left is the taller of the two, clean-shaven and thin. To his right is a man with a long, white beard and pocket watch chain hanging from his breast pocket. They are William Kent and John Muir, respectively, standing outside the Muir Woods Inn in 1910.</p>",

Originally constructed in 1902 as an army hospital for 12 patients, this building's future was set in 1912, when the army established a major troop and cargo depot along Fort Mason's shoreline. The former hospital became headquarters for a shipping center of crucial importance during World War 2. The shipping depot, known as the San Francisco Port of Embarkation, supplied the Pacific war effort, dispatching over 1.6 million soldiers and 23 million tons of supplies in 1945 alone. Logistics directed from this modest building into the 1960 played an important role in the nation's rise to international power.

It's designed to give visitors an overview of the natural history, ecology, and social history of this area. It also provides visitors with a chance to purchase memorabilia that relates to the stories we tell here. Staff at the desk can tell you more, and help you make purchases if you want.<br /> <br /> The tour lasts about 35 minutes.<br /> <br /> Right now, you're standing at the east end of the room. If you face west, you may see, high above you, a series of rectangular, corrugated cardboard art works suspended from the ceiling. Their laser-cut designs depict scenes of life here over time, including native flora and fauna, Native American artifacts, means of transport, recreational activities, and landmarks like the windmill and the Cliff House.<br /> <br /> Now we'll proceed counterclockwise around the room. We'll walk almost to the other end of the room. Stand so your back is to this counter. Turn right and walk carefully straight ahead about eight to ten steps, to the far wall. You'll be passing the entrance, so be aware that people may be in your path. When you touch the wall, turn left. Now, walk straight ahead again. You'll have shelves on your right, and counters on your left. In ten or twelve steps, you'll come to a wide, cement doorway that leads into the café. Keep going straight past it, then stop just on the other side. Reach out and touch the large panel attached to the wall.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>WAYSIDE TITLE: Restoring Habitat<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: Standing in front of the kiosk facing south, away from the parking lot, a row of brown recycling and trash bins is to your left. Directly behind you is a 3-D topographic model of Muir Beach and the surrounding area, and, on the edge of the parking lot, a bathroom building. Just past the row of recycling bins is a metal and wood boardwalk that spans the distance over the wetlands and leads to the beach. Beyond the boardwalk are two wooden benches that face the willows in the wetlands and in the distance, the ocean.<br /> <br /> <br /> TEXT: As you journey across this bridge, consider how the health of people and wildlife are linked. Who benefits from the restoration of Muir Beach and how? For over a century agriculture, recreation and construction severely degraded the floodplains, wetlands and aquatic habitat. The creek stopped flowing freely. As a result, sediment built up, causing poor water quality, and flooding was common. Big Lagoon almost vanished. Wildlife dependent upon the creek system for survival dramatically declined in population.<br /> <br /> From 2009 to 2013, concerned local volunteers and professionals from the National Park Service, Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy and community groups came together to restore this dynamic environment. Relocated buildings and parking now allow the creek, riparian woodlands, tidal lagoon and dunes to return to their natural functions. The restoration created habitat critical for the survival and ongoing resilience of native plants and animals. Dedicated park stewards will continue to care for the site as plants take hold and weather events shape the land.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A wet river otter perched on a rock in a water.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A close up of a golden-colored coho salmon smolt with dark stripes along its sides.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A red-winged blackbird resting on a branch among white and purple flowers.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A glossy, dark-brown California newt and a great blue heron, its neck bent in the shape of an â€˜S', walking among the reeds.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A teenage girl with long, dark hair wearing work gloves crouched in tall grass inspecting a small plant in her hands.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A young boy with short, dark hair and glasses holding a large bunch of weeds in both hands.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Transformations for the 21st Century. Caring stewards continue to restore the deteriorated environment at Muir Beach and to implement climate-smart 21st century modifications. Consider how the following changes made by the National Park Service allow the landscape to be resilient against bigger floods, erosion and sea level rise far into the future.<br /> <br /> LIST OF CHANGES:<br /> - Redwood Creek moved back to its natural location and reconnected to the lagoon floodplain.<br /> - Parking lot relocated out of the floodplain.<br /> - Installation of a new 450-foot long pedestrian bridge over the floodplain.<br /> - Re-establishment of seasonal wetlands in the open flood-plain once bisected by a road now attracts migrating birds and other animals.<br /> - Re-vegetation of dunes once blocked by a trail to the beach now support native plants attractive to insects and birds.<br /> - Creation of pools, ponds, wood, and off-channel features for endangered coho salmon and threatened California red-legged frog to find shelter and breed.</p>",

The turbines are arranged in a line straight out from the wayside within a grassy lawn bordered on all sides by well-maintained trails. To the east, or right as you face the wayside, is a path that leads to the steps up to the Crissy Field Center. To the left is the parking lot. Straight ahead on the far side of the lawn is more parking and the San Francisco Bay Trail, which hugs the edge of the bay.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Golden Gate National Recreation Area is going greener. National parks are experimenting with innovative green technology and this climate-friendly park is working toward a goal of being carbon-neutral by 2016. Carbon neutrality is achieved through advances such as adding electric vehicles to the park fleet, incorporating renewable energy features and designing energy-saving buildings. There are plenty of places in the park where you can experience cutting edge sustainable technology.<br /> <br /> Crissy Field Center is one of the nation's greenest park-based buildings. This high performance modular educational facility is a model of sustainability where youth learn from the building itself.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: An aerial photograph of the Crissy Field Center and the surrounding campus complete with lawns and terraced walkways. The Center has elaborate arrangements of solar panels on three roof sections, and glass front walls and doors.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: In the lower right hand corner of the panel is an aerial photo of the main cellhouse on Alcatraz Island. The remains of the warden's house as well as the lighthouse are visible, as are the solar panels on the roof of the cell house.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Alcatraz has a number of sustainability challenges, from generating electricity on the island to shipping the sewage back to San Francisco. One major improvement was to add solar panels to the cell house reducing the amount of diesel fuel needed to run the generator.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>WAYSIDE PANEL TITLE: Marsh Dynamics<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: This panel overlooks the Crissy Field tidal marsh. There's a fenced-off section of dune plants and coastal scrub before a sandy shore that encircles the blue waters of the marsh. On the far shore is a large white two-story building. Cypress trees and thick bushes surround the building, obscuring it somewhat from this vantage. Further in the distance, you can see the domed top of the Palace of Fine Arts. To the left, east, the trail takes you to East Beach. Right, takes you to Crissy Field, Fort Point and the Golden Gate Bridge.<br /> <br /> TEXT: How a Coastal Wetland Works. This tidal marsh was designed and engineered to mimic a natural system. Like the dunes that front the wetland, the system thrives on natural disturbance. Freshwater and storm runoff drain from the land into the marsh, bringing sediment that settles or is flushed out to the bay. Tides continually ebb and flow, importing mineral and organic materials. Constant movement and mixing foster a biological storehouse of organisms that can tolerate fluctuations in salinity, dissolved oxygen levels, water temperature and moisture.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Three small, puffy birds on a sand dune. The birds have white underbellies and brown backs, heads and wings. Their heads are turned so that they're looking over their backs.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Sandpipers in winter plumage.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Original Mud Pie. Twice a day receding tides unveil nutrient-rich mudflats that serve up a feast to multitudes of shorebirds. Algae, fungi and decaying organic debris nurture countless invertebrates--insects, worms, crabs, clams and myriad others--that float, swim, settle to the bottom or bury themselves in the mud. This tidal menu refuels many shorebirds that stop over here during their long migration between the Arctic and South America. Though many species of shorebirds appear to eat together, their different feeding habits assure they seldom compete directly with one another for food.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Illustration of a brown and white bird with a very long, thin needle-like beak. The bird is walking in shallow water with its head down, its beak near the water's surface. It's labeled, \"Marbled godwit.\"<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Long-legged wading birds ply the shallows for swimming creatures or sweep or probe the muddy bottom with their slender bills for burrowed worms, mollusks and crustaceans. Similar species such as sanderlings pick up tiny prey from the exposed mud surface or just below it.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Map of the Presidio. Included is a section of the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the San Francisco Bay to the north. Also labeled is a section of the Presidio beginning at a small body of water just inland from the shore of the bay and continuing down to the southeast corner of the Presidio is Tennessee Hollow watershed.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Freshwater laden with organic nutrients and minerals drains from the Tennessee Hollow watershed to merge with tidal inflows in the Crissy Field marsh. The mixing of freshwater with saltwater creates an estuary, a rich habitat for a diversity of plants and wildlife.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Located below the map. Yellow bulldozers in front of the reddish-brown dome of the Palace of Fine Arts. In the background, is the San Francisco skyline.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Construction of the Crissy Field tidal marsh in 1999 was supported by mitigation funds from the San Francisco International Airport. About 230,000 cubic yards of soil and rubble were excavated to create the marsh.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT STOP: Walk west one fifth of a mile to reach the next wayside located on the northern side of the trail.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><em>Transcription of accompanying audio with additional text and description at the very end.<br /> Woman's Voice.</em><br /> <br /> This is stop 10.<br /> <br /> It’s called, “San Francisco's Seaside Playground: Going to the Cliff”.<br /> <br /> The text begins, “they made their way across the endless sand dunes on foot, on horseback, in horse-drawn buggies and steam trains.\"<br /> <br /> Beneath this text is a black-and-white photograph of eight men and women dressed in Victorian clothes seated in a large open automobile. Behind them is a mounted policeman. The caption reads, “Cliff House motor coach, circa 1906.\"<br /> <br /> The Yelamu were the first, walking to Lands End to hunt and fish. Their children ran and played games in the sandy cove below, and at sunset, families gathered around bluff-top fires to sing, laugh, and tell long-remembered stories.<br /> <br /> To the right of this text, is a drawing of a laughing woman with a child, with dunes and seagulls in the background. The caption reads, “Ohlone mother and child.”<br /> <br /> Next to it, is a newspaper drawing of two people on horseback and a carriage racing along the beach at high tide, with another couple seated on the dunes. A small building sits above on the cliff. The caption reads, “Ocean Beach, Appletons' Journal, 1870.\"<br /> <br /> The text reads, “Later, the Americans came to look at the sea lions on Seal Rocks and race their spirited horses along Ocean Beach's hard-packed sand. They were the swells, the sports, the big-money class of Gold Rush San Francisco, and by the 1860s, several taverns had opened to accommodate their needs, like Seal Rock House, Lakeside House, and, most famous of all, Cliff House.”<br /> <br /> To the left of this text, is a black-and-white image of a crowd of people, some wearing costumes, at what appears to be a formal party with entertainment. The caption reads, “Cliff House dinner party, circa 1910.”<br /> <br /> Beneath it, the text continues, “The gentry gave way to working-class families who came to picnic on Ocean Beach, gaze at the sea lions, and spend their hard-earned nickels and dimes. Adolph Sutro began opening his fabled attractions in the 1880s-gardens at Sutro Heights, a lavishly rebuilt Cliff House, Sutro Baths and its museum. San Franciscans referred to a day at these entertainments as ‘going to the Cliff.’”<br /> <br /> At right is a black-and-white image of a group of men and women in old-style bathing costumes with the caption, “Happy bathers at Sutro Baths, October 1906.”<br /> <br /> Automobiles and streetcars brought a new generation seeking seaside recreation, and a collection of arcade games and rides evolved into Playland at the Beach. But by the 1950s, most of the aging attractions had begun their slow decline. Sutro Baths, which had been transformed into an ice rink, shut down in 1966 and later burned in a spectacular fire, and Playland was demolished in 1972.<br /> <br /> Left of this text, is a black-and-white photo of two men in suits and hats perched inside a mocked-up automobile. The caption reads, “Tintype portrait with backdrop, circa 1910.”<br /> <br /> Right of the text, is another black-and-white image, this one showing three women in white ice skates crouched on the ice near a wall. Captioned, “Sutro ice skaters, 1952.”<br /> <br /> Next are two color photos.<br /> <br /> The one on the left, showing a couple doing the tango and the one on the right showing a jogger. The captions are, “Tango dancers at Merrie Way and Jogger at Lands End.”<br /> <br /> When it became clear that some of the city's last stretches of undeveloped shoreline were at risk, a movement arose to protect them. By 1980, the entire Lands End/Ocean Beach area had been acquired by the National Park Service and became part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area.<br /> <br /> <em>ADDITIONAL TEXT AND DIRECTIONS:</em><br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION: A large photograph of a labyrinth outlined with stones.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO VISITOR CENTER: Walk straight ahead about three steps. You'll find yourself at the reception desk. If you want to learn more about Lands End-related merchandise here, just ask one of the staff at the desk.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT STOP: 3D TACTILE MODEL: To get there, turnaround from the desk and walk ahead to exit the visitor center. Once outside, take 4 steps and turn left. Take 10 steps and you'll find yourself on the sidewalk that runs beside the Lands End Lookout. Turn left and walk 28 steps until you reach a low cement wall. From here, turn right and follow the wall walking 34 steps. Turn right. Walk 8 steps and you'll find the model at waist height.</p>",

Beyond the Great Meadow is Headquarters Building 201, Officer's Quarters, and skyscrapers in the far distance. The Palace of the Fine Arts is visible in the far distance to your left. The loop trail extends to either side of you.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Was it Joy or was it Exploitation? The Panama Pacific International Exposition proclaimed a full recovery from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire to the world. The fair promoted the Panama Canal's opening, but also coincided with the army's new shipping facility at lower Fort Mason. To showcase San Francisco's economic potential and the nation's global expansion, the city built glittering pavilions and palaces on 635 acres of filled marshland between Fort Mason and the Presidio.<br /> <br /> The nine-month fair highlighted new innovations, such as airplanes, electric lighting, telephones and mass production. But an amusement-style \"Joy Zone\" in at Fort Mason also featured \"Native Villages\" with stereotypical natives from places like Samoa, the Philippines, and Somalia. Wild West shootouts, idealized slave quarters and a dangerous \"Underground Chinatown\" were also portrayed, but their offensive nature and poor sales led to replacement by gambling parlors and explicit shows.<br /> <br /> TEXT: What are the consequences of using stereotypes?<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: A black and white photo in the bottom left corner of this panel depicts the \"Joy Zone\" in 1915. There are more people walking down the promenade than can ever possibly be counted. Amusement-themed buildings border either side of the street, including a tower topped with a smiling clown's head and a figure of a man with a drum for legs. Photo credit San Francisco History Center, San Francisco Public Library.<br /> <br /> MAP: A map of the world's fair is in the bottom right corner of this panel. It is a detailed sketch that includes what is now Crissy Field with a complex grid of paths and buildings stretching east all the way to Fort Mason. An orange circle indicates that \"You Are Here\" at Fort Mason. Some of the buildings are labeled \"palaces,\" each with different themes such as: horticulture, liberal arts, education and social economy, food production, transportation, mines and metallurgy, and machinery and manufacturers. The palace that is furthest west has a natural arc to its construction and is labeled \"Palace of Fine Arts.\" A section south of Fort Mason is labeled \"The Amusement and Concessions Zone.\" The caption reads: The Palace of Fine Arts (orange dome in distance) is the only remaining building from the 1915 fair.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: The illustration is titled \"Indian Village in the Santa Fe Grand Concession on the \"The Zone,\"\" credited Bob Bowen Family Collection. It is a recreation of a pueblo-style buildings in the Joy Zone of the 1915 World Fair. One of the buildings is adorned with wooden awnings and a ladder. The other building has windows cut into its walls, and a single bell hangs from a bar spanning the width of each window. A cross tops this building.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #3: A black-and-white photo of the 1915 World's Fair is below this image. Many domed buildings that resemble the Palace of Fine Arts line San Francisco's shore. The tops of these palaces are shrouded in fog.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Continue straight down the Great Meadow Loop for 404 feet. Watch for cyclists and stay to the left. At the three-pronged fork, stay on the leftmost side of the trail to continue on the loop. Walk 425 feet, and you will reach the next wayside.</p>",

Their tendrils spread over the sand, extending their reach across the dune.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Adapted to desert-like conditions of low nutrients, high winds and extreme water loss, native plants stabilize the dunes. Growing in a patchwork, the plants capture moving sand and their lengthening root systems help hold the sand in place.<br /> <br /> TEXT: \"CPR\" for Dunes. The development and use of Crissy Field destroyed its natural dunes and decimated its native plant communities. Ecological restoration of the native dune system here has included the reintroduction of native plants grown in park nurseries and planted by park volunteers. A generous grant from the California Coastal Conservancy helped fund this project, and sustained CPR--community-based preservation and restoration--will assure long-term protection and care for these improvements.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A young woman and boy crouching on bare soil, facing each other. They're wearing work gloves, and the woman has a baseball cap on that's shading her face from the sun. They're both holding onto a small plant with long, thin tendrils above a small dug out hole in the soil. Behind them are more people crouching in the dirt, which extends far into the distance.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Thousands of volunteers helped restore Crissy Field. They removed countless invasive exotic plants and placed more than 100,000 native plants in the ground to help the ecosystem get established.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Illustration of a plant with a white blossom with six petals around a light-yellow center. Its green leaves grow in threes and are rounded except for the front edge which is serrated. It grows along a pinkish-red vine.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Beach strawberry spreads rapidly by runners and forms dense mats that stabilize the soil. Its waxy leaves retard water loss.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Illustration shows a plant that also grows on a vine, but has a more vertical structure to its blossom. The blossom is pink and round like a sphere, the petals growing in more of a three-dimensional pattern. The green triangle-shaped leaves with rounded edges grow above and below the flower.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The pink sand verbena's sticky succulent stems store water and trap windblown sand. Sand buildup stimulates the continued growth of this mat-forming perennial.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Illustration shows a vertical plant with five small, round blue blossoms at the top of its stalk. Lower down on the stalk are five crinkly looking leaves, and at the very bottom, a dense section of smaller leaves growing close together.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Silky hairs on the silver bush lupine's leaves reflect heat and protect them from drying out. Capable of fixing nitrogen from the air, an advantage in nutrient-poor sand, these plants can live many decades.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Illustration is of a plant with a long stalk with small round blossoms growing on both sides all the way to the tip, which is bent slightly to the right. At the plant's base are green, serrated leaves and spiky, yellow blossoms growing at intervals along the center of the stalk.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The thick roots of the beach bur stabilize the sand that builds up around the fast-growing stems. Its seeds have spines that resist movement in the shifting sand and enable the seeds to take root.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT STOP: Walk west a little over one tenth of a mile and you'll arrive at the next wayside on the southern side of the trail.</p>",

Imagine Alcatraz as a barren rock. That’s what the island was until the 1860’s, when the first residents planted gardens in pockets of imported soil. Sent to live on this cold, gray island, Army families took refuge in a Victorian-style flower gardens around the Citadel.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{501f4f99-eed7-4e9d-905e-060b661ea458}{219}\" paraid=\"1040176396\">Prisoners also gardened. Army prison crews, and later, a few closely watched penitentiary inmates, created a manicured landscape that bloomed until the prison closed in 1963. The flowering terraces, rose beds, and lawns then grew wild for 40 years. Luckily, hundreds of garden species brought to the island by a century of gardeners managed to survive and even thrive.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{501f4f99-eed7-4e9d-905e-060b661ea458}{227}\" paraid=\"499370971\">In 2003, the Garden Conservancy, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, and the National Park Service began a joint effort to preserve and restore the historic gardens.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{501f4f99-eed7-4e9d-905e-060b661ea458}{231}\" paraid=\"1189276152\">DESCRIPTION: Colored photograph of a volunteer tending to plants in the garden with a view of the bay in the background.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{dd02b8ef-683f-49ee-82dc-991ef5583d82}{71}\" paraid=\"1618094006\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">CAPTION: Volunteers have helped to rebuild and replant the Alcatraz gardens.

Accessible restrooms are further down the trail on the righthand side.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: The wayside faces the Great Meadow, a large grassy expanse dotted with a few palm trees. People and dogs often mill about on the meadow. Monterrey cypress line the distance, accompanied by the red roofs of lower Fort Mason's landmark buildings. The Golden Gate Bridge expands over the rooftops of San Francisco's buildings to your left. The Great Meadow Loop trail extends to either side of you, and also branches off into a larger extension of the loop trail directly behind you.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Land of Many Uses. The open area before you has seen many historic events over the years. After the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the army pitched a tent camp that housed thousands of refugees. In 1915 the scene looked entirely different, as people from across the nation enjoyed the Panama Pacific International Exposition, a spectacular world's fair that spread west from here to the Presidio.<br /> <br /> Following the fair, the army built over the area and by the end of World War 2, buildings and roads covered almost every inch of the present meadow. The palm trees you see today once stood beside MacArthur Avenue.<br /> <br /> With the advent of the urban national parks movement, Fort Mason became part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1972. This site was again transformed as overgrown foundations and roads were replaced with lawns and paths. Re-named the \"Great Meadow,\" the area is now open space for all to enjoy.<br /> <br /> TEXT: How has a place in your community changed?<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: In the lower left corner, there is a photo, dated 1915, of a large walking promenade bordered by whimsical amusement-themed buildings, including a striped spire and a two-story depiction of a carnival-goer with a top hat and cymbal<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The world's fair amusement area, known as the Joy Zone, spilled onto Fort Mason. The Zone included a five-acre model of the Grand Canyon near this spot.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: An aerial photo of Fort Mason, dated 1940, is in the lower right corner. There is an orange circle with the text \"You Are Here\" indicates that you are currently in the lower left of this image, near the former site of large warehouses. The area is heavily developed, and lacks the open, green spaces that characterize Fort Mason today.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: During World War 2, you would have seen MacArthur Avenue ahead of you. Barracks, mess halls, warehouses, offices, and other facilities packed both sides of the street. These buildings supported critical shipping of soldiers and supplies to the Pacific.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #3: Dated 1906, this photograph shows lines of cloth tents pitched in an open field. People mill about these tents, and some of them wear suits and top hats.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: This site was an emergency relief camp for San Franciscans after the 1906 earthquake and fire, including this temporary camp set up for Chinese refugees as they were pushed progressively away from the ashes of Chinatown. Their camp eventually ended up at the west side of the Presidio.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Follow the trail for 252 additional feet. Turn right at the fork and walk 222 feet, and you will reach the next wayside.</p>",

The statue is encircled by gray bricks and is accessible by an additional walking path that cuts through the Great Meadow. The bronze statue of Burton is larger than life, suggesting something of his famous will and persona. Viewed from the side, Burton stands tall, with one leg slightly bent. His left arm is bent at the elbow, the fingers on his hand spread wide, his open palm facing towards him. His right arm is fully extended to his side, with his hand gesturing as if allowing someone to enter a room or pass by him. His hair is wavy and parted to the side. His mouth is open, and his brow furrowed, lending the impression that he is mid-speech. Headquarters building 201 and accessible parking is to your right, and accessible restrooms are to your left.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Powerful, Profane, Brilliant, Fierce. Phil Burton wasn't a moderate man. Elected to Congress from San Francisco in 1964, he fought for workers' rights, for seniors and people with disabilities, and for the impoverished and under-privileged. Once convinced that creating national parks close to where people live would improve their lives, he fought for park legislation. He fought and he won.<br /> <br /> In 1972, Burton authored the bill that created this park, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. He went on to author expansive national parks and recreation acts in 1978 and 1980. The 1978 bill more than doubled national park lands, nearly doubled the wild and scenic river system, and tripled the number of national trails.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Today, you can enjoy stunning landscapes and historic landmarks on both sides of the Golden Gate Bridge because Phil Burton protected them from development. Across the country, Burton's vision has forever influenced the way we, as a nation, view, value, and preserve our national heritage.<br /> <br /> How can we work to improve our community?<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: To the left side is the statue of Phillip Burton in the Great Meadow of Fort Mason. He stands with one arm outstretched, and the other reaching out towards the viewer, as if he is in the middle of delivering a speech. He wears a suit, and an expression of concentration.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Standing 11 feet high, this bronze memorial statue of Phillip burton was dedicated on June 15th, 1991.<br /> <br /> QUOTE: \"Phillip Burton was a great intellect and a passionate voice for workers, the poor, the elderly and people with disabilities, and was a protector of human rights and the environment. Through his work, the world has been endowed with a lasting legacy of gifts. Years from now, people will continue to benefit from his dedication to a better future.\"<br /> <br /> TEXT: \"His Unmatched Legacy.\"<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black-and-white photo of Phillip Burton is placed at the top of this panel.

There's a brief but steep slope leading up from the trail to the flat, unspoiled grassy field. To your right is a path that cuts diagonally west across Crissy Field.<br /> <br /> TEXT: U.S. Army Coast Defense Air Station. From 1921 to 1936, Crissy Field was at the forefront of military air operations. Home of the U.S. Army Air Corps' Coast Defense Air Station, the site included a grassy landing strip and the barracks, offices and hangars that typified the era of barnstormers and biplanes. Limited space for expansion and frequent fog eventually prompted the Air Corps to move north to Hamilton Field in Marin County.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Black and white photo of a biplane in mid-flight, close to the ground. Its propeller is a whirring blur, but the double-decker wings, with sections above and below the cockpit are clear, as are the support poles holding them together.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: This is the earliest known photograph of Army flight operations at Crissy Field.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Black and white photograph of several men in flat-topped Army hats and uniforms, standing under the shadow of a biplane's wing, that, at its full height, is about three feet over the men's heads. The wheel of the plane is in the lower right-hand corner, and the supports connecting the two sections of the plane's wings are visible behind the men.<br /> <br /> TEXT: In 1921, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, commander of the victorious allied armies in World War I, inspected this new installation and pronounced it, \"The last word in airfields.\" Left: The Chief of the U.S. Army Air Service, Major general Mason Patrick, inspects the airfield.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT STOP: Walk west one third of a mile from and you'll arrive at the next wayside on the southern side of the trail.</p>",

The Alcatraz water tower is one of the most visible landmarks in San Francisco Bay. As such, it was an ideal place for American Indians who occupied the island to broadcast their message of “peace and freedom” to the world. Standing on each other’s shoulders to paint the letters, they staked their claim to the land.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{05997aae-66fd-4a45-96e9-69c09ff9ccd3}{67}\" paraid=\"1381706859\">The 19-month protest from 1969 to 1971 became the longest occupation of Federal land in the US history, and is credited with launching a national American Indian civil rights movement. When the National Park Service (NPS) restored the water tower in 2012, original occupiers and family members were invited to repaint the historic message. The NPS continues to work with the occupiers to restore their inscriptions around the island.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{05997aae-66fd-4a45-96e9-69c09ff9ccd3}{75}\" paraid=\"675910999\">DESCRIPTION #1: Colored photograph of NPS staff and original occupiers atop the water tower.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{05997aae-66fd-4a45-96e9-69c09ff9ccd3}{81}\" paraid=\"1179756119\">DESCRIPTION #2: Colored photograph of some of the original occupiers talking.

Installed in 1940, the water tower stored 250,000 gallons (950,000 liters) of fresh water brought by boat twice weekly. Today the island uses approximately 1500 gallons of water a day that is stored in a nearby cistern.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{05997aae-66fd-4a45-96e9-69c09ff9ccd3}{109}\" paraid=\"173131693\">DESCRIPTION: Black and white close-up photograph of the reinstated messages on the water tower.

Like information technology today, aviation grew by leaps and bounds during Crissy Field's heyday. In the 1920s, the Air Service promoted military aviation with many news-making flights that involved Crissy Field, including aerobatic stunts and air races. Most significant were a series of long-distance flights. By 1936, airliners were crossing the nation regularly, and aviation was no longer only for daredevils.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph at the center of two biplanes flying in profile with Crissy Field in the background.

In October 1919, the Army launched 61 fabric-covered, open-cockpit biplanes on a transcontinental flight to test the limits and potential of air power. Fifteen \"ships\" lifted off this field to fly east, and 46 departed Long Island westbound for San Francisco. Only nine planes finished, and nine men died trying, one was Major Dana H. Crissy. These pilots' courage and the risks they took helped pave the way for future commercial air travel.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT STOP: Walk west 280 feet to arrive at the next wayside on the northern side of the trail.</p>",

A two-story building, and a tall palm tree with a thick, dark trunk obscure the view of the water. From here, you can see the side of the building, which is shaped a bit like a barn, with a multi-angled roof that comes together at a single point at its highest section. The main entrance is to the right, preceded by a small landing accessible by four small stairs. A balcony, supported by columns extending down to the landing, frames the entrance. The building is the office for the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, Ocean Climate Center.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Fort Point Life-Saving Station. Activated in 1890, this U.S. Life-Saving Station was built to aid endangered seafarers in the days when San Francisco was one of the world's busiest ports. \"Surfmen\" braved wind and waves to rescue victims from distressed sailing ships and steamships off the central California coast and in the bay's treacherous waters. Nearly a dozen shipwrecks still lie buried along the Presidio shore.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph showing the perspective of being out over the water looking back to shore from a long, wooden pier. On land are several two-level buildings and a flagless flagpole.<br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph of a small ship with a smokestack, half submerged in water. The Golden Gate Bridge is visible in the background.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Surfboats were launched from a \"maritime railway\" to ensure quick response to a call from a vessel in distress, such as the oil tanker S.S. Frank Buck.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Five men are standing in a row in front of a large building with a second-floor balcony. The men are dressed in sweaters and dark coats and hats.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Finding a Safer Haven. In 1990, the U.S. Coast Guard, the successor of the U.S. Life-Saving Service, moved its operations across the Golden Gate to the Horseshoe Bay at Fort Baker, where its tradition of lifesaving continues. Nonprofit organizations now use the former boathouse (to your right) and the farther commandant's quarters (to your left).<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT STOP: Walk west just over one tenth of a mile to arrive at the next wayside on the northern side of the trail.</p>",

During the military era, soldiers who died here were buried on Angel Island or in the National Cemetery at the Presidio of San Francisco. Later, during the Bureau of Prisons years, deceased inmates were taken to the city morgue in San Francisco.

A small, sandy beach with medium-sized rocks scattered about leads down to the bay. In the distance you can see the L-shaped pier, Torpedo Wharf, the Golden Gate Bridge and Marin Headlands. Behind you are several picnic table and barbecues. Trash cans are 30 feet behind you and to the left, on both sides of a sidewalk that cuts between the picnic tables.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Landmark Flights Help Shrink the World. Crissy Field was the site of several record-breaking flights that helped make the world a smaller place. Given its strategic location on the West Coast and its capacity to accommodate both land and sea planes, Crissy Field influenced the expansion of military air power and the rise of commercial aviation. As the San Francisco Chronicle noted in 1925, \"It is here in the Pacific that the future drama of our expanding commerce will be enacted. The play of rival forces now finds the Pacific for its stage...\"<br /> <br /> TEXT: An Air Corps Aloha. In 1929, two PN9 seaplanes made the first attempt to fly from the mainland to Hawaii. Both aircraft were forced down short of their goal. One of the crews was adrift for 12 days before the men were rescued. Two years later an Army modified Fokker C-2 flew from the shoreline here at Crissy Field to the new Oakland Airport, then on to Hawaii. Charles Lindbergh called it \"the most perfectly organized and carefully planned flight ever attempted.\"<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Black and white photograph of a propeller plane from the front at a three-quarter angle. Its wings are straight and flat across the top of the cockpit, and the wheels below its undercarriage are small, resembling the black and white wagon wheels of a Radio Flyer. The propeller is barely visible because of a dark shadow. In the background is half of a building with an angled roof, and a large bay door left open. The plane is on display on a gravel lot next to a field of grass.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Specially modified to carry extra fuel and the latest navigational equipment, this Fokker C-2 transport, the Bird of Paradise, completed the first California-to-Hawaii flight in 1927 in less than 26 hours.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph shows a plane from a three-quarter rear angle. This plane has two-tiered wings, supported by thin vertical bars. It's resting on a short ramp that leads into the water and is surrounded by water on all sides. Several individuals are standing on the dock beside it.<br /> CAPTION: A PN9 amphibious aircraft sits on the seaplane ramp. At low tide you can see the ramp at the water's edge.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Black and white photograph of two men, one is dressed in a bomber jacket with large breast pockets and wings pinned above the pocket on his left. His head is covered in a dark cowl, and goggles rest on his forehead above his eyes. He is smiling and writing in an open ledger laid out on a wooden table before him. To his left is a man in a dress Army uniform, complete with a flat-topped, brimmed hat. He's also smiling, as he looks over the shoulder of the man writing in the ledger.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Major Hap Arnold watches Lieutenant Lowell H. Smith sign in upon his return from a transcontinental flight in 1919. Five years later, Army aircraft were the first to circumnavigate the globe.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT STOP: Walk west 340 feet to arrive at the next wayside on the northern side of the trail.</p>",

Geologic forces have been shaping the San Francisco Bay Area landscape for 4 million years. The block of rock between the San Andreas and Hayward faults, under the bay itself is slowly sinking, and the mountains on both sides of the bay are being uplifted. Climate change and human activity have further altered the bay. The filling of wetlands has shrunk the bay's size, and human-caused silting has made it shallower. Only in narrows, such as the Golden Gate, does tidal flow maintain deep channels.<br /> <br /> MAP DESCRIPTION: Map of the bay's underwater topography. Most of the image is a brown mass that represents depressions in the bay. Areas marked in green, on top of and surrounding the depression, indicate raised ridges.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Geologic structures, prior river courses and the shifting of sediments by currents are evident in the bay floor's topography.<br /> <br /> MAP DESCRIPTION: A map with a thin, blue body of water running top to bottom with dark green coastlines on either side.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The present San Francisco Bay began to form only about 8,000 years ago when melting glaciers caused sea level to rise and flooded the bay floor. Movement along faults in the earth's crust causes earthquakes that shift land upwards, downwards or laterally and continually change the bay's size and shape.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Golden Gate's River. Cold climatic episodes within the last two million years captured ocean water in inland glaciers, lowering sea level and moving the coastline westward. Just 14,000 years ago, a glacier fed river flowed through the Golden Gate and crossed 20 miles of coastal plain before meeting the Pacific Ocean where the Farallon Islands are today. Subsequent warming has melted polar ice and raised sea level to create the largest estuary on the West Coast, San Francisco Bay.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: An illustration of a brown, muscly bear walking along a rock ledge and in the background, a craggy mountain range with a river at its base.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The Bay Area has supported different plants and animals as conditions have changed over<br /> millions of years.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT STOP: Walk 355 feet west and 15 feet south to arrive at the next kiosk and wayside on the western side of the Warming Hut.</p>",

To your left is a wayside and giant globe painted to look like it's made of woodgrain. Past the globe is a two lane road. To the right is the bay, and Torpedo Wharf, an L-shaped pier. Behind you is the Warming Hut, a cafe and souvenir shop inside a converted army building with cream-colored siding and a red roof. Its entrance is to your right, along its northern-facing wall.<br /> <br /> PANEL #1: Enjoying Crissy Field<br /> DESCRIPTION OF PANEL: This panel has a map, text, and a list of regulations.<br /> TEXT: The National Park Service invites you to enjoy all that Crissy Field, the Presidio and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area have to offer. Crissy Field has been designed to accommodate a variety of uses. For the safety and enjoyment of all visitors and the protection of national park resources, please obey park rules.<br /> <br /> MAP DESCRIPTION: A map of the San Francisco Bay coastline, from the San Francisco side, that includes Marina Gate and Entry Grove to the east and stretches all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge to the west. Several areas within the parkland are labeled, including the Warming Hut to the west near Fort Point, then moving east: Golden Gate Promenade, the Tidal Marsh and East Beach.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Please:<br /> - Obey all posted regulations.<br /> - Adhere to special regulations for the wildlife protection area.<br /> - Note that bicycles are subject to all motor vehicle laws.<br /> The following are prohibited:<br /> - Glass bottles and containers<br /> - Fires on beach<br /> - Organized sports<br /> - Camping<br /> - Collecting plants and other natural objects<br /> - Removing historic artifacts<br /> - Feeding or disturbing wildlife<br /> - Parking in unpaved areas except as designated.<br /> <br /> <br /> PANEL #2: A Place of Renewal<br /> DESCRIPTION OF PANEL: The panel faces north west. There are 3 colored illustrations at the bottom of the panel.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The land known today as Crissy Field has undergone many changes. once a rich salt marsh and homeland of Ohlone people, it was later a landing site for Spanish and Russian explorers, a venue for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition and a pioneering United States military airfield.<br /> <br /> Along with the entire Presidio, Crissy Field was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962. With generous community support, Crissy Field has been transformed into a spectacular 100-acre shoreline park at the center of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Revitalizing Crissy Field. Sponsored by the National Park Service and its nonprofit support partner, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, the revitalization of Crissy Field owes its success to community support and stewardship. The Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund provided the lead gift for site restoration, and many other individuals and organizations from throughout the Bay Area generously contributed time and funding.<br /> As part of the site restoration effort in 1998-2000, individuals and groups from schools, corporations and civic organizations planted more than 100,000 native plants to help restore natural habitat at Crissy Field. Community volunteers continue to play an important role in sustaining long-term stewardship of this national parkland.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #1: Pink sand verbena, a plant that also grows on a vine, with a vertical structure to its blossom. The blossom is pink and round like a sphere, the petals growing in more of a three-dimensional pattern. The green triangle-shaped leaves with rounded edges grow above and below the flower.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #2: There is an illustration of Indian paintbrush, a plant with teardrop-shaped leaves alternating their way up its stalk to a red blossom.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #3: There is a vertical plant with five small, round blue blossoms at the top of its stalk: silver bush lupine. Lower down on the stalk are five crinkly looking leaves, and at the very bottom, a dense section of smaller leaves growing close together.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Silky hairs on the silver bush lupine's leaves reflect heat and protect them from drying out. Capable of fixing nitrogen from the air, an advantage in nutrient-poor sand, these plants can live many decades.<br /> <br /> PANEL #3: The Bounty of the Bay-Panel Description<br /> DESCRIPTION OF PANEL: The panel faces north east. There are illustrations and a list of crabbing regulations.<br /> <br /> TEXT: San Francisco Bay abounds with fish. Striped bass, sturgeon, surfperch, anchovy, flounder and herring, among others, depend on the bay's shallow waters for food or to spawn. Chinook salmon and steelhead require highly productive ocean waters for growth. These two species, now in dwindling numbers, migrate from the ocean through the bay to their upstream spawning grounds. Steelhead spawn several times, but adult salmon make this journey only once. They die after spawning, and their newly hatched offspring migrate downstream to the ocean. Each generation of salmon lives there for three to six years before repeating the cycle.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #1: A Chinook Salmon and Steelhead Trout are illustrated in a profile view. Steelhead have a more greenish coloring, while the Chinook are a darker blue. The mouths of Chinooks are slightly more pronounced, with a pointed, beak-like upper jaw.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: These illustrations show differences in the jaws and gums of the similar steelhead and Chinook salmon. Should you catch a fish that looks like one of these, check these features. You must release steelhead, a threatened species.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #2: Illustrated depiction of 3 crabs. On the far left is a crab with a dark gray shell, and lighter gray pincers and legs. A Dungeness Crab, <strong>Cancer magister</strong> . Trapping Dungeness crabs is illegal. In the center is a red crab, <strong>Cancer productus</strong> . Its pincers are much larger than those of the Dungeness. The crab has a dark gray shell and pincers, and light purple legs. A brown rock crab, <strong>Cancer antennarius</strong> .<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Please observe these crabbing rules:<br /> - Crabs must be at least 4 inches across the widest part of the shell.<br /> <br /> - The limit on crabs is 35 crabs per person per day.<br /> <br /> - No Dungeness crabs may be taken. Born in the ocean, Dungeness crab larvae drift into the bay. The larvae transform into young crabs in food-rich shoreline areas. Since these crabs don't reach maturity until long after they return to the ocean, it is illegal to trap them in the bay.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: The next wayside is directly to the left of the kiosk if you're facing west, about 8 feet.</p>",

To the right, the Golden Gate Bridge stretches off to the right across the bay, with the rolling hills of the Marin Headlands behind it.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Fort Point Mine Depot. The Fort Point Mine Depot was created to defend the West Coast's greatest harbor from enemy attack. Here, U.S. Army personnel assembled mines, loaded them on ships and planted them in minefields outside the Golden Gate. An enemy ship attempting to enter San Francisco Bay would have had to maneuver through a deadly obstacle course. Completed in 1910, the depot remained in the service through World War II.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph of a building with an angled roof, a double door entrance and two identical windows on either side of the doors, highlighting the symmetry of the building. A curved path leads up to the entrance.<br /> CAPTION: Soldiers inserted explosives into the mines in their loading rooms. Extreme care was taken to ensure that no accidents occurred.<br /> <br /> MAP DESCRIPTION: A map showing the coast you're standing on now, with a brown L-shape extending out over the water representing Torpedo Wharf, and white, rectangular blocks on the green area representing land. These blocks represent buildings, including the explosive storage facilities and the mine loading rooms.<br /> DESCRIPTION IMAGE: Illustration of two devices side-by-side. Each has several sections, arranged in a vertical line, and tethered together by a rope at the bottom connecting them horizontally. The device on the left has a tan rectangular prism labeled \"Planting Buoy\" that looks like a brick with a ring through its center tied to a rope that descends and attaches to a gray sphere, labeled \"mine case.\" Below the mine case is a metal clasp that attaches to the rope tether, labeled \"mine shackle.\" Below the shackle, are two rope tethers running parallel to one another. One rope is short, and goes straight down, connecting to a gray circular prism, the shape of a hockey puck and labeled, \"anchor.\" The other rope, which is knotted to the anchor, runs horizontally to the right, and is tied to a dark gray device shaped like a pie plate, with multiple cables sticking out from its sides like spokes on a wheel. This device is labeled \"distribution box.\" On top of the distribution box, at its center, is an upside-down \"U\" shaped ring, like the top portion of a combination lock to which a rope is tied, extending upwards to a device, labeled \"distribution box buoy\" which resembles a barrel turned sideways, to which it is tied.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: This schematic shows an underwater mine and distribution box, with temporary buoys that were placed during planting operations. Throughout the modern era of American harbor defenses (1890-1950), mines were considered to be one of the primary harbor defense weapons.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: The next kiosk is one fifth of a mile away. To reach it, first walk 50 feet to the south to get around the Warming Hut, then turn left to start back east. In 100 feet you'll encounter a path to your left. Follow it 90 feet then turn right to head east along a cement path for 750 feet, or, just over one tenth of a mile to a kiosk on your right.</p>",

In 1969, six years after the penitentiary closed, a group of American Indians claimed Alcatraz for “Indians of All Tribes.” For almost 19 months, they occupied the island to call attention to the plight of the Native Americans and make a stand for native peoples’ fundamental right to their cultural identities.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c4724dc8-09ee-426a-b18b-ca20a7639328}{65}\" paraid=\"1566343691\">The occupiers hoped to establish several institutions on Alcatraz. Their vision included a center for American Indian studies, a job training school, a spiritual center, an ecology center, and a museum.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c4724dc8-09ee-426a-b18b-ca20a7639328}{73}\" paraid=\"1769442023\">The occupiers did not achieve their goals for Alcatraz. However, the occupation of the island was a historical turning point for American Indians across the country. Public sympathy generated by the occupation played a key role in ending the U.S. government’s policy of terminating tribal governments, and the relocation of Indians from their reservation lands and communities. This led to an official government policy recognizing tribal self-rule, which protects Indian lands, languages, culture, and identity.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c4724dc8-09ee-426a-b18b-ca20a7639328}{77}\" paraid=\"1015830757\">SECOND COLUMN:  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c4724dc8-09ee-426a-b18b-ca20a7639328}{81}\" paraid=\"166423103\">QUOTE: “In the name of all Indians...we reclaim this island for our Indian nations...” The Alcatraz Proclamation, Indians of All Nations, 1969. </p> <p paraeid=\"{c4724dc8-09ee-426a-b18b-ca20a7639328}{89}\" paraid=\"659195835\">DESCRIPTION #1: Black and white photograph of a tipi on Alcatraz Island with the bay and the city visible in the background.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c4724dc8-09ee-426a-b18b-ca20a7639328}{95}\" paraid=\"788115761\">CAPTION: The occupiers erected this tipi, symbolic of traditional American Indian life, as a sign of their reclamation of the island.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c4724dc8-09ee-426a-b18b-ca20a7639328}{101}\" paraid=\"860565764\">DESCRIPTION #2: Black and white photograph of Native American women standing behind a table filled with cooking supplies and various containers.

Along the southern edge of the road are several long, two-story buildings with matching red roofs and cream-colored exteriors. There is a crosswalk to reach the southern side of the street 40 feet to the east, anticipated by a textured surface. On the northern side of the road is a paved path for cyclists and pedestrians that runs the length of Crissy Field. North of the kiosk is a small, grassy field separating the sidewalk from the San Francisco Bay Trail further north. The trail has a bench about 60 feet due north of the kiosk. The bench overlooks a sandy beach and the San Francisco bay, with a view of Alcatraz Island and the Marin Headlands. To the west is a row of picnic tables and barbecues set along a grassy field. The first table is 50 feet from the kiosk, and the barbecue is right of the table.<br /> <br /> PANEL #1: Protecting Wildlife<br /> <br /> TEXT: The western end of Crissy Field embraces rich and varied wildlife habitats-rocky shoreline, sandy beach, open water and piers. Designated a wildlife protection area, this site hosts many resident and migratory birds, which rest and feed here. Offshore, pelicans and terns plunge headlong into the water for fish. Grebes and cormorants gracefully dive for small fish and invertebrates. In the tidal zone, willets, plovers and sandpipers glean and prove the sand for worms, insects, mollusks and crustaceans.<br /> <br /> Watercraft and pets are not permitted in the wildlife protection area, but you may enjoy jogging, fishing, picnicking-and watching birds without disturbing them. Protecting wildlife, and providing you the experience of seeing them wild, is part of the mission of the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: An illustration of three birds in flight. They have light gray feathers with a bluish hue along their backs, with black-tipped wings and heads. Their beaks are thin and pointed.<br /> CAPTION: Least terns, <strong>Sterna antillarum</strong> .<br /> <br /> MAP DESCRIPTION: A map of Crissy Field and marsh. On the western portion of the map is a line indicating your position on the map, just south of the waterfront. Along the sandy shore just to the east of where the \"You Are Here\" marker is on the map, and for a small distance further east past where the beach ends, is an area colored in with tan lines that stretch past the shore line into the shallow waters of the bay. This area is labeled \"Wildlife Protection Area.\"<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The National Park Service has designated the shoreline and coastal waters indicated above as a wildlife protection area. This part of Crissy Field offers a safe haven for birds and other wildlife.<br /> <br /> TEXT: How Crissy Field Got Its Name. In 1919, the U.S. Army sent 61 airplanes racing in short hops across the continental United States to test aircraft reliability and endurance. Major Dana H. Crissy led the west-to-east contingent which left from the still-unnamed airfield at the Presidio. He died in a crash on the first day out. In 1921, Major Hap Arnold, pioneer military aviator and later a five-star general, saw to it that the air base was named in Crissy's honor.<br /> <br /> PANEL #3: A Place of Renewal<br /> <br /> TEXT: The land known today as Crissy Field has undergone many changes. once a rich salt marsh and homeland of Ohlone people, it was later a landing site for Spanish and Russian explorers, a venue for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition and a pioneering United States military airfield.<br /> <br /> Along with the entire Presidio, Crissy Field was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962. With generous community support, Crissy Field has been transformed into a spectacular 100-acre shoreline park at the center of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.<br /> <br /> Revitalizing Crissy Field<br /> <br /> Sponsored by the National Park Service and its nonprofit support partner, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, the revitalization of Crissy Field owes its success to community support and stewardship. The Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund provided the lead gift for site restoration, and many other individuals and organizations from throughout the Bay Area generously contributed time and funding.<br /> <br /> As part of the site restoration effort in 1998-2000, individuals and groups from schools, corporations and civic organizations planted more than 100,000 native plants to help restore natural habitat at Crissy Field. Community volunteers continue to play an important role in sustaining long-term stewardship of this national parkland.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #1: An illustration of pink sand verbena, a plant that also grows on a vine, with a vertical structure to its blossom. The blossom is pink and round like a sphere, the petals growing in more of a three-dimensional pattern. The green triangle-shaped leaves with rounded edges grow above and below the flower.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #2: An illustration of Indian paintbrush, a plant with hairy, teardrop-shaped leaves alternating their way up its stalk to a red blossom.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #3: A vertical plant with five small, round blue blossoms at the top of its stalk: silver bush lupine. Lower down on the stalk are five crinkly looking leaves, and at the very bottom, a dense section of smaller leaves growing close together.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Silky hairs on the silver bush lupine's leaves reflect heat and protect them from drying out. Capable of fixing nitrogen from the air, an advantage in nutrient-poor sand, these plants can live many decades.<br /> <br /> PANEL #3: Enjoying Crissy Field<br /> DESCRIPTION OF PANEL: Text, illustrations and a list of regulations.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The National Park Service invites you to enjoy all that Crissy Field, the Presidio and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area have to offer. Crissy Field has been designed to accommodate a variety of uses. For the safety and enjoyment of all visitors and the protection of national park resources, please obey park rules.<br /> <br /> MAP DESCRIPTION: A map of the San Francisco Bay coastline, from the San Francisco side, that includes Marina Gate and Entry Grove to the east, and stretches all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge to the west. Several areas within the parkland are labeled, including the Warming Hut to the west near Fort Point, then moving east: Golden Gate Promenade, the Tidal Marsh and East Beach.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Please:<br /> <br /> - Obey all posted regulations.<br /> <br /> - Adhere to special regulations for the wildlife protection area.<br /> <br /> - Note that bicycles are subject to all motor vehicle laws.<br /> <br /> The following are prohibited:<br /> <br /> - Glass bottles and containers.<br /> <br /> - Fires on beach.<br /> <br /> - Organized sports<br /> <br /> - Camping<br /> <br /> - Collecting plants and other natural objects<br /> <br /> - Removing historic artifacts<br /> <br /> - Feeding or disturbing wildlife<br /> <br /> - Parking in unpaved areas except as designated<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: The next wayside is just over a quarter mile to the east. To reach it, take the sidewalk next to the road all the way. The road will be on your right and Crissy Field to your left. The wayside will be on the left, or, northern side of the path.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The devastating earthquake and subsequent fires of 1906 displaced tens of thousands of city residents. Some 75,000 San Franciscans simply left after the disaster, but an even greater number, 250,000 homeless, stayed in the city and formed makeshift communities. During the crisis, the US Army managed 21 of the 26 emergency camps including four on the Presidio. Fortunately, the army had a large supply of tents on hand from the Spanish American War, which they provided as immediate shelter.<br /> <br /> <br /> As winter approached, 5,300 'earthquake cottages' were built. Modest though these structures were, they were an attractive offer that housed over 16,000 refugees at the height of their popularity. Trying to avoid permanent settlements of the cottages, the $2.00 a month rent went towards the purchase price of $50.00. Once purchased, residents were required to relocate their cottages from the camps. In today's SF housing market, two bucks a month to own in two years is quite the attractive rental offer, even without electricity.<br /> <br /> <br /> The 1906 earthquake left more than half of San Francisco's citizens homeless. Roughly 500 square blocks of downtown were reduced to rubble, including the decades-old immigrant neighborhood, Chinatown. Amid chaos and tragedy, city officials attempted to displace the Chinese community from the neighborhood they had called home since 1870 to the less desirable Hunter's Point area.</p> <h3>Chinese and the 1906 Earthquake</h3> <p>The 1906 earthquake left more than half of San Francisco's citizens homeless. Roughly 500 square blocks of downtown were reduced to rubble, including the decades-old immigrant neighborhood, Chinatown. Amid chaos and tragedy, city officials attempted to displace the Chinese community from the neighborhood they had called home since 1870 to the less desirable Hunter's Point area.<br /> <br /> The earthquake's leveling force was so devastating that of the 15,000 Chinese living in Chinatown before the quake, only 400 remained in the aftermath. Most moved to Oakland to start over. In the days immediately following the disaster, the army rounded up the Chinese that remained in San Francisco and relocated them to a windy section of the Presidio near the area where Fort Scott stands today.<br /> <br /> After a drawn out battle, the plan to permanently relocate the Chinese community never came to pass thanks to community resistance and the realization by city officials that they stood to lose lucrative trade with the far East and tax revenue if they went through with the move. The Chinese community returned to and rebuilt Chinatown, an enduring San Francisco icon.</p>",

Several nations have claimed this site. For thousands of years the Ramaytush Ohlone lived in permanent and seasonal villages along the San Francisco Peninsula. Cooking hearths and other cultural remains were discovered not far from where you stand.<br /> <br /> In 1776 Spanish soldiers, settlers, and missionaries claimed the San Francisco Peninsula for Spain. By 1801 all of the Ramaytush Ohlone had been incorporated into Mission San Francisco de AsÃ,s, and about eighty percent of their population had died from disease and from poor living and working conditions.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Spanish military used this bluff as a lookout for ships, and in 1797 built a small gun battery, Batteria de San Jose, to protect a ship anchorage on the east side of the point. Eventually, California passed from Spain to Mexico and then to the United States.<br /> <br /> In 1850 President Millard Fillmore reserved this area, known as Black Point, for military use. The U S Army ignored the site for many years but hurried to fortify the point in 1863 when the Civil War raised concerns about a Confederate or British invasion of San Francisco's harbor. Renamed Fort Mason in 1882, the post remained an active military installation for over a century.<br /> <br /> MAP: of Yelamu Ohlone, Spanish, and early U S Army sites in San Francisco. The map is oriented so that north is at the top.<br /> <br /> LEGEND: Designated military areas of 1851 are shaded dark green. Presidentially designated military boundaries of 1850 are marked by a dashed line. Spanish establishments of 1800 are represented as a star. Circles are used to demarcate Ohlone settlements pre 1776.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF MAP FROM NORTH TO SOUTH: The southernmost site was an Ohlone Settlement called Chutchui. It was positioned in central San Francisco. The Spanish establishment \"Mission Dolores\" was almost adjacent to this site. There was another Ohlone settlement further up and closer to the bay called Sitlintac, on the eastern side of San Francisco. The next site up was a spanish establishment named Yerba Buena, which was positioned near the coast in what is now San Francisco's financial district. Every other site is separated on the map by a dashed line that depicts a presidentially designated military boundary. This boundary ran northeasterly across the top of San Francisco. It also cut around the Presidio and Fort Mason. In the Presidio, there was one Ohlone site called Petlenuc, and two spanish establishments named El Presidio and Castillo de San Joaquin. At what is now Fort Mason, there was a spanish establishment named Batteria San Jose. A \"You Are Here\" circle indicates that you are currently just below Batteria San Jose.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black-and-white photograph of Black Point and the terrace gardens.

General Arthur MacArthur Junior lived in Quarters 1 at Fort Mason from 1903 to 1907. MacArthur's career spanned the Civil War through the Philippine American War. As military governor of the Philippines in 1900 to 1901, MacArthur persuaded captured Filipino leader Aguinaldo to swear allegiance to the US, turning the war around. MacArthur and his son, General Douglas MacArthur, who also briefly lived at Quarters 1, were the first father and son to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Arthur Macarthur Junior stands facing the left, so that he is in profile. He has short hair, a thick mustache, and wears a monocle. He is in an officer's dress uniform, with thick shoulder pads, a sash, and two rows of brass buttons. He is decorated with various medals.<br /> <br /> TEXT: David Colbreth Broderick. 1820 to 1859. U S Senator David Broderick died at Fort Mason in the home of his friend Leonidas Haskell after his political enemy David Terry shot him in a duel. Broderick opposed the expansion of slavery and worked closely with political friends, including Haskell, to support the anti-slavery movement. Terry was Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court and advocated extending slavery into California. When Terry lost a re-election bid because of his pro-slavery views, he challenged Broderick to a duel at Lake Merced and mortally wounded him. Broderick's friends brought him back to Fort Mason before he died.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: David Colbreth Broderick wears a suit and bowtie. He is heavily bearded with short brown hair.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Frederick Funston. 1865 to 1917. General Frederick Funston stood only five feet tall, but was a giant of American military history. Medal of Honor winner, outspoken advocate for U S imperialism, and captor of Filipino leader Emilio Aguinaldo, Funston was as colorful and controversial a figure as anyone in the US around 1900. After the great earthquake of April 18, 1906, Funston ordered soldiers to assist in disaster response and relief efforts from Fort Mason for more than a week, until General Adolphus Greely assumed control. Most San Franciscans considered Funston a hero, but others thought he had overstepped his authority.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Frederick Funston stands facing the right, so that he is in profile. He wears an officer's service cap and uniform. His hair is short, and he is lightly bearded.<br /> <br /> TEXT: John L. Dewitt. 1880 to 1962. Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt lived at Fort Mason from 1939 to 1943 and was the U S Army officer in charge of protecting the West Coast from Japanese attack during the early part of World War 2. DeWitt relied more on information from biased politicians than military intelligence or F B I reports. He decided to enforce President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order 9 0 6 6 by relocating over 120,000 Japanese Americans and Japanese immigrants from the West Coast to hastily constructed concentration camps across the western states and as far east as Arkansas.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: John L. DeWitt wears a heavily decorated officer's uniform and looks to the left. He is bald, and wears eyeglasses.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Haskel House. The Leonidas Haskell house was originally built in the 1850s. Seen here as officers' quarters in the 1930s, it is now known as Quarters 3 and still serves as a residence today.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Photo of the Haskel House. It is a large boxy home with bay windows, two chimneys, and a porch. Trees and shrubs surround the home.<br /> <br /> LIST:<br /> - Caution. Bring layered clothing.

SANDY WILDERNESS SURROUNDED EARLY FORT MASON.<br /> <br /> TEXT: You are standing in a vastly transformed landscape, on a broad bluff that projects out into the bay. Try to picture the miles of sand dunes that once stretched to the south and west, giant mounds sculpted by northwesterly winds. Imagine the tidal marsh and natural cove that the native Ohlone people knew on the bluff's west side-long since filled in, built over, and bordered by a modern marina.<br /> <br /> All of San Francisco has been profoundly altered. The dunes have disappeared beneath buildings, roads, and nonnative plants and trees. The shoreline along the bay-both east and west of here-has been reshaped with fill and construction. Fort Mason's steep rocky shoreline preserves a small remnant still in a natural state. It supports intertidal habitats that look much as they did when the Ohlone harvested shellfish from them centuries ago.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A historic painting of Fort Mason. In the foreground, coastal dunes are intercepted by a large dirt road. Red buildings, one with a high smokestack, line this road. In the background, Fort Mason is green and heavily vegetated. A few buildings are interspersed within the thick shrubs. The American flag flies high over San Francisco's bay.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: \"Spanish soldiers and settlers that arrived here in 1776 called this bluff Punta Medanos de Arenas-Sand Dune Point. This painting depicts the American army post as it appeared in 1866 and was renamed Fort Mason in 1882.\"<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Natural side of Fort Mason.<br /> <br /> TEXT: A variety of trees and plants grow at Fort Mason today, providing habitat for birds, butterflies, and other creatures. Here are just a few of the species you might see today.<br /> <br /> Maybe you've caught sight of Fort Mason's brilliant green parrots and wondered whether your eyes deceived you. They didn't. A flock of wild parrots, descended from escaped pets, moves between Fort Mason and other San Francisco neighborhoods. Most of the birds are red-masked conures, but the flock also includes mitered conures and hybrid offspring.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photo of two white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophyrs) is in the top left corner, credit Mark Bitner. The male sparrow has a black cap with white streaks, whereas the female sparrow has brown streaks on her head.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Anna's hummingbird (Calypte anna) is in the top right corner, credit Peter Latourrette. The adult male hummingbird has a brilliant red crown, with a green sheen to the rest of his feathers. He hovers in the air near a red flower. His wings are beating so quickly that they appear blurry.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A red-headed conure (Aratinga erythrogenys) is below these photos, credit Mark Bitner. The parrot has a bright red crown, a green body, and green tail feathers. It has white eyespots. Its beak looks thick and powerful.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A Brandt's cormorant (Phalaerocorax penicillatus) is to the right of this photo, credit John Martini. The black bird has a long, slender neck and an oval body. It sits on the edge of a rock and looks down at water.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A buckeye butterfly (Junonia coenia) is below this photo, credit Robert A. Behrstock. The butterfly rests on the ground with its wings outstretched. The wings are brown, with orange stripes and large eyespots along the edge. The butterfly's body is brown and fuzzy.<br /> <br /> TEXT: A rugged landscape. When the US Army claimed this area in 1850, dense scrub, California buckeye and bay laurel trees crowded the shoreline. The dark trees contrasted so sharply with the area's sand dunes, civilian residents called the bluff's eastern edge (below) Black Point. The laurels and all but one buckeye are gone.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: An image of Black Point. The steep topography is covered in dense vegetation. A path along the water's edge cuts into the vegetation. In the background, the hills are not as dense with trees. A few buildings are scattered throughout the coastal prairie.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The city filled the cove and marsh west of this bluff to provide a site for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915. You can get a sense of the vanished landscape by visiting the restored marshland and dunes at Crissy Field, west of the San Francisco Yacht Club.<br /> <br /> MAP: A map of Crissy Field and Fort Mason's past and present shoreline. In 1856, the shoreline did not extend as far into the bay. An inlet of water also wove its way into Crissy Field. The present shoreline extends much farther, and includes manmade piers and docks.<br /> <br /> LIST:<br /> - Caution. Bring layered clothing. Weather can turn windy, foggy and cold very fast.

Putting Down Roots.<br /> <br /> Beneath this title is a large color photo of a shoulder of hillside covered with white wildflowers and green grasses. The hillside drops down to white waves lapping a rocky shore. The sky above is streaked with clouds. <br /> <br /> Though Lands End has a wild side, it is also a surprisingly urbanized landscape, a complex mixture of native vegetation and imported, non-native trees and plants. An environment of dense fog, westerly winds off the Pacific, and blowing sea spray has created a system of native, salt-tolerant, low-growing plants well adapted to their setting.<br /> <br /> Aside from the willows, most of these headlands were essentially treeless until the 1930s, when Depression-era landscaping created an artificial urban forest of pine, cypress, and eucalyptus trees. These non-native species, which adjusted rapidly to the marine environment, soon expanded beyond their original boundaries and crowded out many of the native plants and grasses.<br /> <br /> National Park Service policies call for the preservation of both the area's natural and historic legacies, and habitats with native species as well as introduced vegetation are now protected.<br /> <br /> Rehabilitation efforts include limiting the spread of the non-native pine, eucalyptus, and cypress forests; thinning stands of trees to create meadow areas; and replanting native species.<br /> <br /> At the bottom of the panel are nine color images of native species. They include toyon, Douglas Iris, seaside daisy, silver bush lupine, San Francisco wallflower, Ithuriel's spear; California poppies, cobweb thistle, and California blackberry.<br /> <br /> Face the panel you just heard about, then turn left and walk straight ahead. You'll pass another cement doorway, smaller this time. Walk right past it. Just on the other side, you'll find another large panel attached to the wall. That's our stop.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>WAYSIDE PANEL TITLE: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle<br /> <br /> PANEL DESCRIPTION: The wayside faces east in front of the Crissy Field Center.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: Facing east, the Beach Hut is to your left, and the Crissy Field Center is to the right. Both are part of the same building, which features an all-glass facade and reddish-orange siding reminiscent of the Golden Gate Bridge. The building is segmented, with alternating sections with tall ceilings that draw back at a downward angle towards the back of the building and linking corridors with lower ceilings. In front of the entrance to the Beach Hut is a patio area with several large, green chairs and tables. Beyond the wayside across the lawn is a water fountain.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Crissy Field Center is an environmental education and leadership center for youth and their communities. Programs encourage new generations to become bold leaders for thriving parks, healthier communities and more environmentally just society. Through this partnership of the National Park Service, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy and the Presidio Trust, the Center also works to provide park opportunities for underserved audiences.<br /> <br /> This green building is on its way to attaining LEED Platinum status and the Center has been a Certified Green Business since 2010. From building construction to sustainability in its future--for people, and for the planet. \"Reduce, reuse, recycle\" are demonstrated here in many ways.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION: A simple illustration of the Crissy Field Center. The diagram shows the outline of the building's floor plan, as well as its walls, but not the roof. The result is an outline that shows the basic contours of the space. On the right side of the outline in the space where the roof would be is a yellow grid of squares that together, make up a rectangle, and above this, the sun, rendered as a yellow circle with lines radiating from it in a ring.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: Below the illustration of the Crissy Field Center several photographs along the bottom. The first is of a large solar panel mounted on a trailer. The panel appears to be one rectangular piece, but is broken up into 14 smaller black rectangles.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Because building components were manufactured off-site, construction waste was greatly reduced. The advanced pre-engineering substantially slashed the demand for raw materials and made the construction site virtually waste free.<br /> During construction, electricity from the grid was used as little as possible. Contractors had a solar generator on site that provided the electricity for their tools.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: A long tunnel with a rounded roof made of wood panels. To the right of this photo is another photo, a close-up of several light brown wood planks.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The Center abounds with creatively reused and repurposed materials. The raised flooring, for example, came from a Hewlett-Packard facility. The redwood siding is re-milled from lumber salvaged from an old railway tunnel in Marin County.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #3: The frame of a building under construction. Only two wood frame panels have been installed along one side of a wall. Two workers are in the midst of lowering and placing a windowpane next to them.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Every effort was made to incorporate recycled materials in the Center. More than 35% of the building is made of recycled content. This includes the steel frame (up to 95% recycled), light gauge steel walls, roof panels, ceiling tiles (77% recycled), and carpet tiles.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Walk 72 feet to the west, down the steps behind you and continue walking straight until you nearly reach the edge of the plaza and East Beach parking lot. To your left is a wayside.</p>",

You can see the long, manicured expanse of green grass that extends from here all the way to the coast of the San Francisco Bay. You're standing at the edge of Mason Street, between two paths that cut different trajectories across Crissy Field. To your right, a trail cuts north east across the field, and to your left, another trail cuts straight north across the field. To the left of this trail are trash and recycling bins. Off to the left in the distance behind a row of palm trees and white colored buildings with red roofs is the Golden Gate Bridge. An asphalt trail borders the field, you can take it east towards East Beach or west towards Fort Point.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The 91st Observation Squadron. Crissy Field was home to many daring pilots who made their mark on aviation history. Among these famous flyers were Major Dana H. Crissy, who died in a crash attempting to fly to the East Coast from here, and Major Hap Arnold, who later led U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. In 1924, Lieutenant Russell L. Maughan flew from the East Coast to Crissy Field in one day from \"dawn to dusk,\" and Lieutenant Lowell H. Smith landed here after flying around the world.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: A black and white photograph of young man with a receding hairline and subdued smile wearing an elaborate uniform with gold, braided epaulets, a stiff, high collar and twin rows of brass buttons running from his chest to his belt. The sleeves of his uniform are decorated with three loops like a clover, and two small lines that cross each other in an \"X\" with a circular button at their center, just above a broad stripe marking the cuff.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The airfield's namesake, Major Dana Crissy, commander of Mather Field in Sacramento, crashed while attempting a transcontinental flight that left here in 1919. The airfield was named in his honor in 1921.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: A photograph of two men dressed in heavy coats down to their thighs with thick fur collars, knee high boots and cowls with goggles resting on their foreheads standing at opposite ends, holding a white, tubular sheet in front of the tail end of a biplane. The sheet has several prominent circular tears, as though something has punched through it.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Air Corps members show off a target sleeve after a practice mission with antiaircraft gunners.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #3: To the right of the photo of the Air Corps members, is one of many women dressed in long coats, cowls, goggles and boots. Several of them are holding small children, all of whom are wearing winter hats and coats. Behind the women, clearly visible above their heads, is the propeller of a plane, upon which sit three toddlers in pullovers and shorts.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Behind the Flight Line. Officers and their families were housed on the bluff by the Golden Gate. Enlisted men lived in the three-story barracks behind you. The mothers, wives and children of the aviators were authorized to go aloft on special occasions to \"eliminate worry\" about the risks their daring men were taking. Their happy expressions suggest the strategy worked.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Walk east just under one half mile to reach the next wayside located on the northern side of the trail.<br />  </p>",

A rope fence runs through wooden posts along the edge of the trail, separating it from thick coastal scrub growing long along the ground. Further back, you can see the a row of willows with slender oval leaves, a light shade of green, all of which surround the bright blue waters of the Crissy Field marsh.<br /> <br /> TEXT: A Model of Diversity and Richness. Wetlands swarm with life and produce more food per square inch than the richest California farmland. Their complex food webs are based on detritus, the decaying remains of dead plants, rather than on living green plants as in terrestrial ecosystems. Flooded by bay tides twice daily, salt marshes serve as nurseries for countless marine fish and invertebrates, many of them food sources for people. Wetlands offer shelter, breeding habitat and abundant food for an array of animals, from microscopic plankton to large animals. Tidal estuaries also filter out pollutants and prevent flooding by capturing storm runoff.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #1: An illustration of 6 different marsh plants growing in a sand dune near water.<br /> PLANT #1: The first plant is the tallest, with long, thin green leaves and wispy, wheat-like tops. It's labeled \"cordgrass.\"<br /> PLANT #2: Next on the dune are three green stalks growing vertically, with smaller stalks stemming from the main one. The tops droop slightly. The plant is labeled, \"pickleweed.\"<br /> PLANT #3: Following the pickleweed is a rendering of arrow grass, which has several green, vertical tendrils that grow halfway up the plant, around a taller center stalk.<br /> PLANT #4: To the right of the arrow grass is a plant that creeps along the surface of the dune, Jaumea. With little yellow flowers and alternating little leaves, Jaumea grows more horizontally than the other examples of dune plants.<br /> PLANT #5: To the right of the Jaumea is a rendering of salt grass. These two plants share a certain resemblance. Both have yellow flowers and thin leaves that alternate up the stalk. Salt grass, however, has more of a vertical structure.<br /> <br /> PLANT #6: The last image is of a plant with many oval-shaped green leaves at its base, and and many forking stalks with blue blossoms at their tips. It resembles a miniature tree, with many branches. It's labeled \"sea lavender.\"<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Salt-marsh plants tend to grow in distinct bands parallel to the shoreline. Tide levels determine soil salinity and how long plants are submerged, thus defining where each species can grow. A mere inch or two of elevation can make a significant difference in the vegetation mosaic. Marsh plants grown in park nurseries from seeds collected in six neighboring wetlands were planted in and around the Crissy Field marsh.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: A photograph of tall, thin stalks growing thickly in a marsh. The stalks are a healthy, dark green.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: California cordgrass, common in salt marshes, excretes excess salt that crystallizes on its leaves. Because cordgrass grows in waterlogged, oxygen-deprived mud, its stems, containing specialized tissue, transport oxygen to the roots.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF #2: Photograph close up of a marsh plant, only this one has a brown and white patch of dead and dying stalks, which are shorter and resemble elk antlers, with small, branching sections coming off a main stem.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The succulent tissues of pickleweed maintain an internal salt level equal to that of the surrounding soil or water. The plant absorbs freshwater and concentrates excess salt in the tips of its fleshy leaves.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Build it and They Will Come. The Crissy Field tidal marsh and lagoon restore vital natural habitat and ecological diversity within an urban setting. Birds began frequenting the site even before the marsh was fully excavated. Opening the marsh channel in 1999 brought together bay saltwater with freshwater runoff, attracting yet more birds in dramatic numbers and variety, some for the first time in almost a century. The calm waters and dense foliage of the fully evolved wetland will offer a feeding and roosting refuge for both resident bird species and migrants on the Pacific flyway.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #2: On the far right of the panel is an illustration of the American continents, with an icon of a flying bird running the length of the West Coast, the southern tip of Argentina up to Alaska.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Every spring and fall about 11 million birds of more than 100 species migrate along the Pacific coast to or through the Bay Area. Nearly three-fourths of them rest and feed in the region's tidal marshes, many for the entire winter. Sanderlings, for example, nest on the Arctic tundra and winter as far south as Tierra del Fuego. They linger at Crissy Field to feed and rest during their migratory flights of up to 15,000 miles.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Walk east just over one tenth of a mile to reach the next wayside, located on the northern side of the trail.</p>",

Twenty feet away is a small fence barring access to the marsh waters and a tall, bushy willow and other coastal plant species. There is a small clearing directly in front of the wayside. Three feet to your right is a trash can.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Presidio Quartermaster Depot. From the 1870s until the early 1900s, the Presidio Quartermaster Depot at this site stored provisions and equipment for the soldiers stationed here. Two wharves gave supply ships access to the depot. Warehouses and stables covered the area and trash was dumped in the adjacent marsh, considered a wasteland at that time. In 1912, the marsh was completely filled, creating a foundation for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915 and subsequently for the Crissy airfield.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: To the right of the text at the top center of the panel is a black and white photo of several men standing next to six overturned carriages with wooden spoke wheels. Behind them are three long, two-story buildings at the intersection of a wide street.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Barracks and supply buildings at the northern-most end of the Quartermaster Depot area, ca. 1898.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: At the bottom of the panel are three photos of objects side by side. On the left, is a clear, glass bottle with raised lettering that reads, \"Rubifoam for the Teeth, Put Up by E.W. Hoyt & Co., Lowell, Mass.\" To the right of the bottle is an advertisement with the image of a blonde woman with a headband covered in daisies on her head, with long, curly blonde hair. Around her neck is a white silk scarf and she's holding two kittens and four pink flowers in her lap. She's smiling so that her top row of teeth shows. She's encircled by an oval frame, which sits in the middle of a portrait-oriented rectangle. The rectangle has a green trim, with the words \"The Teeth, their care and preservation,\" at the top, and \"E.W. Hoyt & Co., Lowell Mass\" along the bottom. To the right of the advertisement is a white bowl with a gold ring around its outer lip. On its base is the image of a crossed sword with hilt, and a shovel. The characters \"4\" and \"B\" appear above and below the space where the sword and shovel cross, respectively.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Archaeological artifacts are important remnants of historic sites, buildings and landscapes and help tell the stories of earlier people. Removing them damages culturally significant sites piece by piece. Artifacts are protected under federal law. Please leave them in place!<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE IN #3: In the bottom right corner of the panel is a photo of two men in coats, sunglasses and brimmed hats standing facing one another with a table between them. They're both facing down at the table, sifting through several small, metal objects.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: During construction of the new tidal marsh in 1999, archaeologists recovered much of the historic refuse dumped in the former marsh. These artifacts enhance our understanding of daily life at the Presidio.<br /> <br /> TEXT: A Strategic and Useful Site. Long before the Presidio became a U.S. military post, this waterfront site hosted a succession of human events. Originally a system of marshes, it was a seasonal home to native Ohlone people for thousands of years. In the 18th century, Spanish sailors came ashore here. Russian, English and Boston traders negotiated deals on this shore in the early 19th century, and in 1846, Americans led by John C. Fremont landed on this waterfront to silence the cannon at the Mexican Castillo, where Fort Point was later built.</p>",

The banner reads “Golden Gate National Recreation Area” on the left and the National Park Service logo on the right. The panel features a small paragraph, a faded background image of the skyline view, a quote, and multiple images spanning the width of the panel.  <br /> <br /> TEXT: City Skyline. “So close, yet so out of reach” On a clear day or night, the view of San Francisco from Alcatraz is surely one of the world’s most beautiful cityscapes. Some inmates wanted none of it – seeing the free world so close, and yet so out of reach, was too painful.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGES: A painting done by an inmate shows the city skyline as seen from Alcatraz and is broken down into 7 separate images. The paintings feature the docks, different landmarks like Coit Tower, the Palace of Fine Arts and ends with the Golden Gate Bridge on the right.<br /> <br /> CAPTIONS: San Francisco, circa 1950s. Inmate John Paul Chase made notes of the view when he was in the exercise yard at work detail and created these paintings from his cell, working from memory. Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill, the Palace of Fine Arts, and many other landmarks were part of Chase’s view in the 1950’s. Much has changed in San Francisco since Chase was here. Can you spot the differences between his paintings and the current view? Or the areas where his memory was faulty, causing him to misplace landmarks?<br /> <br /> QUOTE: “It was all there for you to see…everything I want in my life, and it’s there. It’s a mile and half away and yet I can’t get to it.” – Jim Quillen, inmate from 1942 to 1952.",

The second column has two rows, the first row has two images and the second row has three images. There is a faded image of Alcatraz Island from the water, in the background of the wayside.<br /> <br /> FIRST COLUMN:<br /> <br /> TEXT: New Homes from Old: Wildlife live among prison remnants. The overgrown piles of rubble below, near the island’s edge, are all that remain of apartments and cottages that once housed Alcatraz Prison guards and their families. Demolished after standing empty for nearly a decade following the penitentiary’s closure in 1963, the ruined structures are home to other residents now. Deer mice, California slender salamanders, and banana slugs reside here. Black-crowned night-herons nest in the tumbled housing. Pigeon guillemots’ nest in old pipes.All over the island many species of birds breed and raise their young in and on what’s left of the prison structures. Some species seek cover in the nooks and crannies of the vegetation that has spread from old garden beds. Others prefer concrete surfaces, building their nests in plain sight.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A gray fuzzy western gull chick, with black webbed feet, stands on a concrete surface.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Western gull chick. The effects of human presence on Alcatraz’s wildlife has decreas4ed since the prison closed in 1963. Seasonal closures of nesting areas and careful management of the island by the National Park Service have allowed bird colonies to thrive here. Please respect Alcatraz’s wildlife – avoid disturbing any animals you encounter.<br /> <br /> SECOND COLUMN:<br /> <br /> FIRST ROW:<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Black birds sitting on their nests are scattered along cement ledges on Alcatraz Island.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Brandt’s cormorants (<i>Phalacrocorax penicillatus)</i> nesting on cement ledges. Seabirds have recolonized Alcatraz so thoroughly that the diversity of species is possibly greater than it was before the island was developed and the original avian populations were displaced.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Close of image of an adult Pigeon guillemot feeding their chick near an old pipe that now serves as the bird’s nest.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Pigeon guillemot (<i>Cepphus columba)</i> nesting in a metal pipe. Islands are naturally great habitat for sea birds because they are entirely surrounded by water, with food sources nearby. With increased options for cover, including vegetation that has spread from old garden beds, and planted trees, Alcatraz has become even more attractive habitat since the prison closed.<br /> <br /> SECOND ROW:<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A close-up photo of a small brown and white speckled bird stands on a post, mouth slightly open, as if singing.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: This song sparrow, along with hummingbirds, house finches, and other common birds live at home on Alcatraz.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A close-up photo of a small, brown mouse with large ears stands on gravel.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Deer Mouse (<i>Peromyscus maniculatus)</i>. Biologists have noted a fascinating adaptation among Alcatraz’s deer mice population: 20% have evolved fur coloring that camouflages them on cement.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A close-up photo of a long black, thin salamander resting on cement.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The California Slender salamander can occasionally be seen in shallow pools of water in the rainy season.",

The banner reads “Golden Gate National Recreation Area” on the left and the National Park Service logo on the right. The panel has two main columns of content. The first column has text and an image. The second column has two rows of images with two images in each row. <br /> <br /> FIRST COLUMN:<br /> <br /> TEXT: Seabirds: At home on the rock. Alcatraz, nicknamed “The Rock,” devoid of fresh water and surrounded by the salty bay, might not be an ideal home for some wildlife, but it’s great for seabirds. Several species are seasonal or permanent residents, including cormorants, oystercatchers, and pigeon guillemots. Because seabirds drink saltwater and take much of their food from oceans and bays, this is rich habitat for them. Alcatraz also has few predators and, because of park management policies, relatively little human disturbance. To coexist peacefully on Alcatraz, resident seabird species have developed contrasting feeding and nesting patterns. For example, cormorants feed from deep water and build their nests on the island’s cliffs, while oystercatchers feed from the tide pools and nest near the water. <br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: An illustration of the cliffs on Alcatraz showing the variety of birds that visit the island. The image features birds with text next to them. Text lists the following birds, from top to bottom: Snowy egrets, Black crowned Night Herons, Western Gulls, Brandt’s Cormorants, Pelagic Cormorants, Pigeon Guillemot, and Black Oystercatchers.<br />  <br /> CAPTION: The National Park Service carefully manages activity on Alcatraz to protect the island’s birds. Please stay on established walkways. <br /> <br /> SECOND COLUMN:<br /> <br /> FIRST ROW:<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A medium sized bird stands on a rock like surface. The bird is completely black and has a small greyish white patch on its wings, a short black pointed beak, and bright orange webbed feet.  <br /> <br /> CAPTION: Pigeon guillemot (Cepphus columba). The San Francisco Bay estuary is home to just one colony of pigeon guillemots, and they breed here on Alcatraz. Pigeon guillemots build their homes in holes in the sides of the island’s cliffs, in discarded pipe, and other hollows. Sixty-one adult pigeon-guillemots and 21 nests were counted on Alcatraz in 2007. <br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A medium sized bird sits on a rock surface. The black oystercatcher is completely black bird with a bright orange ring around its eyes, and a long, thin bright orange beak.  <br /> <br /> CAPTION: Black oystercatcher (Haematopus bachmani). Alcatraz’s nesting population includes large and small colonies, and both year-round and seasonal residents. The island’s one pair of black oystercatchers, first sighted in 1995, live here full-time. But they’re elusive, so consider yourself lucky if you see them! <br /> <br /> SECOND ROW:<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A close up image of about 20 black birds scattered along a rocky surface. The birds are black, have black webbed feet and a long black beak with a bright blue pouch attached to their bottom beak, like a chin. Some of the birds are sitting on nests made of dried grasses. <br /> <br /> CAPTION: Cormorant nests. Note the blue throat pouches on the male cormorants, which are used to attract females. <br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A wider photo of the cormorant nesting area showing hundreds of birds scattered along the rocky cliffs of the island. <br /> <br /> CAPTION: Brandt’s cormorant breeding colony can be seen during the spring and summer. ",

Alcatraz’s tide pools, formed from both natural rock and rocky rubble thrown off the island during excavation projects, are habitat for more than 50 species of invertebrates and 80 species of algae.

The tall, metallic vertical-axis wind turbine poles line the edge of the lawn in front of the sidewalk that borders the East Beach parking lot. Immediately to your left is an asphalt path that leads to stairs up to the Beach Hut Cafe. Go up the stairs and continue straight to go to the Beach Hut, or turn right, then left, for the entrance to the Crissy Field Center. Before the stairs that lead to the Beach Hut and Crissy Field Center is another path to the right, which takes you to several wooden benches on the left-hand side of the path. Directly behind the wayside about 30 feet away, are trash and recycling bins.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Using Nature's Gifts to Achieve Sustainability. What if each building was able to supply its own energy and water? What will our world be like? And what will our future look like? There are many ways to reduce a building's impact on the environment. One way is to maximize the use of natural elements: sun, wind and rain. Crissy Field Center harnesses nature to \"off-set\" the resources the building would otherwise need from the grid (the network of electricity, gas and water lines). For more information about all of the Center's green features and to see how its systems are performing, check out the interactive building dashboard for real-time data: http://frogdashboard.com/crissy/home.htm<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: A photograph of a row of three black, rectangular solar panels on the roof of a building set at a 45-degree angle with the roof.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Off-Setting Electricity. Five vertical-axis wind turbines (of three designs) capture the wind that rushes through the Golden Gate. Wind speeds average 10.5 miles per hour in this area. This experimental 5.4-kilowatt (5,400 watts) system is wildlife safe, quiet and operates at relatively low wind speeds. The turbines along with the 28kW solar panel array help to off-set the electricity needed from the PG&E grid.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Off-Setting Natural Gas. The cafe utilizes a solar thermal hot water heater. The energy from the sun preheats water, which then moves to a standard gas heated water tank. Pre-heated water reduces the amount of gas needed to keep water hot in the tank.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: A large, dark green tank with a domed cover and a metal pipe connected to it on its right side surrounded by creosote bushes. In the background, part of a building is visible on the right.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Off-Setting Water. A 5,000-gallon catchment tank collects rainwater for use in the facility's restrooms. More than 50% of the water used to flush toilets is reused greywater.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #3: In the top right corner of this panel is a photograph of a long building with many windows that alternates between two-story and single-story sections, the Crissy Field Center. In front of the center, the photo captures the image of three metal poles with different shapes at the tops.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: The next wayside is a little under two tenths of a mile west. Facing the Natural Off-Set wayside, walk to your right, or west, along the grassy edge of the lawn bordering the parking lot 70 feet. To your right is a crosswalk across the parking lot to the San Francisco Bay Trail waterfront path. The crosswalk takes a diagonal jog north west across the parking lot to the edge of the San Francisco Bay Trail. From where you stand, walk 18 feet to your right to cross the parking lot in the crosswalk, then, change your trajectory slightly left for 30 feet to stay in the crosswalk, then slightly right for 18 feet until the parking lot ends. Then, walk straight, or north, 30 more feet. Now you are on the San Francisco Bay Trail, a wide area for bikers, joggers and pedestrians to walk along the edge of the Bay from East Beach to Crissy Field and further west to Fort Point. The trail periodically has benches on its southern edge.</p>",

To the north, the coast curves around to a point, forming a half-circle in the space between where you stand and the point, before curving a second time, forming another half-circle further up the coast.<br /> <br /> PANEL TITLE: A Geologic Tale. This is the panel located on the right<br /> <br /> TEXT: Reading the landscape. This in-and-out, scalloped coastline holds clues to both ancient and ongoing stories. The landscape around you contains coastal bluffs, rocky coastline, sandy beaches, mountain ridges, valleys, and peninsulas extending out into the sea. Each part tells a geologic tale.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Rocks. Sticking out of the water, near shore, jagged \"sea stacks\" of hard basalt have endured pounding waves for millennia, as the sea eroded the bluffs around them. On land, much of the landscape is mÃ©lange, part of the defining geology in the Bay Area, the Franciscan complex formation. Melange is a crushed jumble of ancient sea floor deposits and lava erupting along cracks underwater. Massive boulders dotting the rolling landscape are its clues. Like nuts in cookies, these harder greywacke sandstone and greenstone basalts emerge from undistinguishable rubble of crushed rock and softer seabed materials to create the picturesque California coastal landscape.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photograph of rocky, coastal cliffs on the right and blue ocean waters stretching out to the left.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: View from here looking north. Bolinas juts out into the sea in the upper middle of the picture. You are standing on the North American Plate; Bolinas and Point Reyes, faintly visible on clear days, are on the Pacific Plate.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Dark, craggy rock jutting out from calm ocean waters.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Basalt \"sea stacks\" near shore.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Light-colored rocks on a hillside nestled amongst green scrub plants.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Boulders of greenstone basalt and greywacke sandstone stick out of the eroded surface rock.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photo of a woman wearing a white blouse and dark full-length skirt standing in profile on a ridge next to a long, straight crack in the ground stretching into the distance.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Well-known local naturalist, Alice Eastwood, standing next to crack in the earth at Point Reyes, about thirty miles north of here, shortly after the famous 1906 earthquake.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Moving Land. On a clear day, you'll see Point Reyes to the far north, past the Bolinas peninsula. Both of these pieces of land have been inching their way north from Monterey for twelve to fifteen million years. Bolinas and Point Reyes sit on the Pacific Plate. Here at Muir Beach Overlook, you are standing on the North American Plate. On its slowly grinding path, the Pacific Plate scrapes its edge along the North American plate while it also pushes up from beneath, forming the coastal mountains.<br /> <br /> The famous San Andreas Fault separates the two plates and lies just offshore from here, coming onto land at Stinson Beach, about ten miles to the north. Driving along Highway 1 for forty miles north from here, you can follow this famous fault along Stinson Beach and Bolinas Lagoon, through the Olema Valley and along Tomales Bay.<br /> <br /> MAP OVERVIEW: A map of the California coast from Point Reyes National Seashore to the north down to San Mateo County south of San Francisco. The map also includes the San Pablo and San Francisco Bays to the east. San Pablo Bay is to the north of San Francisco Bay.<br /> <br /> MAP DESCRIPTION: The land areas on the map are mostly a light tan, with some areas colored two distinct shades of green. The darker green represents NPS-managed Golden Gate National Parks lands, and includes areas north of Bolinas Ridge, the eastern side of Olema Valley as well as areas further south including Muir Woods, the Marin Headlands, Tennessee Valley, Muir Beach, Muir Beach Overlook and a northern section of the San Francisco Peninsula. The lighter green represents land within the authorized boundary of the Golden Gate National Parks and includes areas around Mount Tamalpais State Park north of Muir Woods, as well as land to the north and east including the Marin Municipal Water District and areas east of Bolinas Ridge. To the south, in the middle of San Mateo County, is a swath of light green with a small strip of darker green in the north western section. Running diagonally north west to south east is a red dotted line representing the San Andreas Fault. The fault line cuts between Point Reyes and Bolinas Ridge, through the center of Olema Valley on down along the ocean, just west of Stinson Beach, Muir Beach Overlook, Muir Beach, Tennessee Valley and the Marin Headlands. The fault continues through the ocean until it comes aground again just south of San Francisco and continues its path down through San Mateo County.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The San Andreas Fault lies under the water just offshore. The fault line comes on land just north of here at Stinson Beach, and proceeds north through the Olema Valley and Tomales Bay.</p>",

Wild in the City.<br /> <br /> A large color photo shows a coyote, with tawny fur and a long tail, looking intently at something in tall grass.The caption reads: From its coastal bluffs and forests to its offshore waters and the sky overhead, Lands End is a haven for wildlife. The native vegetation and human-planted forests provide refuge and hunting grounds for birds and ground-dwelling animals, while just offshore, pods of marine mammals find shelter and food during their epic migrations along the west coast of North America.<br /> <br /> The land mammals are mostly nocturnal. Raccoons are among the largest, weighing between 10 and 25 pounds. Occasionally, a gray fox or coyote can also be seen moving through the dense cypress groves and along cliffside trails.<br /> <br /> The intertidal zone, located at the wave-swept base of the rocky shoreline, hosts a rich marine community that includes sea stars, limpets, barnacles, and mussels.<br /> <br /> Resident and migratory birds make up a large part of Lands End's population. The bluffs are in the path of the Pacific Flyway, and during fall and spring migrations thousands of raptors, waterfowl, shorebirds, and others can be seen passing overhead.<br /> <br /> Seabirds flock to the coastal shallows and cliffs of Lands End, fishing offshore and nesting on protected rocks. They even make use of the ruins of Sutro Baths, splashing in the brackish water to clean accumulated salt from their feathers.<br /> <br /> An array of nine color photos below this text shows a flock of cormorants, a raccoon, a red-tailed hawk, a Pacific white-sided dolphin, a Townsend's warbler, a California sea lion, a flock of brown pelicans, a western gull, and a sea star.<br /> <br /> Now we’ll find out about geology. Face the panel you just heard about and turn. You'll be facing the western windows. At about waist height, reach out and touch the slanted panel. Turn left again and walk along that panel and another just like it, to the farthest end of the second one.</p>",

They lived in more than 600 small family settlements along the coast where creek and ocean resources were most abundant. The Coast Miwok hunted, fished and harvested many of the plants growing in the area for food, medicine and other conveniences. They created a harmonious connection with nature through acute management of the landscape and by aligning their activities with the seasons.<br /> <br /> Through keen observation, experimentation and patient long-term relationships with plants and animals, the Coast Miwok developed deep ecological knowledge-which they passed down from generation to generation. Although European settlement in the late 1700s forced them off the land, and their traditional society came to an end, they are actively engaged with the site today. Descendants of the Coast Miwok participate in research, education and preservation of sacred sites.<br /> <br /> IMAGE LAYOUT: At the bottom of the panel is a series of three images.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: An illustration of a fish dam composed of a triangular fence with a pointed net at its tip. The net and fence are in the water. Several fish are swimming inside the trap.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Coast Miwok families built uyu (communal fish dams) to catch kaasi (salmon) to share. The dams also allowed fish to move through the tcok (creek).<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photograph of man wearing sunglasses in front of tall marsh grass holding a plant.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Nick Tipon, of Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria leads an indigenous plant tour. FIGR gained federal tribal status recognition in 2000.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photograph of a basket with a spiraling pattern of dark rectangles being held by two hands.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Plentiful sapa (tule) and luma (willow) enabled women and men to create cooking and seed collecting baskets, kole-kotcha (shelters), boats and mats. today these plants are re-emerging in the landscape as part of the restoration work.</p>",

It is 23 feet from the gate at Fort Mason's southeast's border.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: The wayside stands just off of a brick square that extends from the sidewalk. It faces a tree, and a sign that says the hostel is 0.3 miles away, park headquarters is 0.2 miles away, and the Fort Mason Chapel is 0.2 miles away. The sign says to leash pets, and to clean up any pet litter. There is parking along Macarthur Avenue, to your left. To your right there is lawn that extends to a large fence separating you from Van Ness Avenue.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Protector of Empires (1797 to 1966). Over the centuries, different cultures have occupied this strategic bluff overlooking San Francisco Bay. Remains of Ohlone cooking hearths not far from this site indicate their presence before Spanish colonists of the Juan Batista de Anza Expedition arrived from Mexico in 1776. The colonists established a military presidio to the west and a mission to the east. The Spanish Army built Battery San Jose on this bluff in 1797 to deter attack from foreign ships at this northernmost frontier of their empire.'<br /> <br /> When California became a state, the US Government set this land aside for a military reservation but did not occupy it until the Civil War, when the Union Army re-armed the old Spanish battery. The army post remained active as the US established its own empire across the Pacific, starting with the Spanish-American War of 1898. Fort Mason eventually became the primary logistics center for sending army troops and supplies into the Pacific into the 1960s.<br /> <br /> TEXT: What makes a piece of land valuable?<br /> <br /> MAP: A map of Yelamu Ohlone, Spanish, and early US Army sites in what is now San Francisco. The map is oriented so that north is at the top.<br /> <br /> LEGEND: Designated military areas of 1851 are shaded dark green. Presidentially designated military boundaries of 1850 are marked by a dashed line. Spanish establishments of 1800 are represented as a star. Circles are used to demarcate Ohlone settlements pre-1776.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF MAP FROM NORTH TO SOUTH: The southernmost site was an Ohlone Settlement called Chutchui. It was positioned inland in San Francisco. The Spanish establishment \"Mission Dolores\" was almost adjacent to this site. There was another Ohlone settlement further up and closer to the bay called Sitlintac, on the eastern side of San Francisco. The next site up was a Spanish establishment named Yerba Buena, which was positioned near the coast in what is now San Francisco's financial district. Every other site is separated on the map by a dashed line that depicts a presidentially designated military boundary. This boundary runs northeasterly across the top of San Francisco. It also cuts around the Presidio and Fort Mason. The southernmost site past this boundary was an unnamed Ohlone site in what is now Lands End. In the Presidio, there was one Ohlone site called Petlenuc, and two Spanish establishments called El Presidio and Castillo de San Joaquin. At what is now Fort Mason, there was an unnamed Ohlone settlement and a Spanish establishment named Batteria San Jose. A \"You Are Here\" circle indicates that you are currently just below Batteria San Jose.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: An aerial black-and-white photograph in its lower right corner of lower Fort Mason's warehouses and military buildings. A large steam ship passes by in the bay. Photo is from 1970.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: \"San Francisco Port of Embarkation buildings crowd Fort Mason.\"<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black-and-white photograph of a cannon and rows of cannon balls. The scene looks out to the bay, Alcatraz Island, and the Marin Headlands in the distance. The photo is dated 1869.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: \"Cannon balls and field artillery overlook Alcatraz at Fort Mason.\"<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Walk north and follow the sidewalk for 520 feet. Cross the driveway that leads to the General's Residence. The next wayside will be along the sidewalk and five feet from the end of this driveway.</p>",

To the east, is the Crissy Field Center.<br /> <br /> PANEL #1: A Place of Renewal<br /> <br /> TEXT: The land known today as Crissy Field has undergone many changes. once a rich salt marsh and homeland of Ohlone people, it was later a landing site for Spanish and Russian explorers, a venue for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition and a pioneering United States military airfield.<br /> Along with the entire Presidio, Crissy Field was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962. With generous community support, Crissy Field has been transformed into a spectacular 100-acre shoreline park at the center of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.<br /> Revitalizing Crissy Field. Sponsored by the National Park Service and its nonprofit support partner, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, the revitalization of Crissy Field owes its success to community support and stewardship. The Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund provided the lead gift for site restoration, and many other individuals and organizations from throughout the Bay Area generously contributed time and funding.<br /> As part of the site restoration effort in 1998-2000, individuals and groups from schools, corporations and civic organizations planted more than 100,000 native plants to help restore natural habitat at Crissy Field. Community volunteers continue to play an important role in sustaining long-term stewardship of this national parkland.<br /> <br /> <br /> ILLUSTRATIONS: In the lower portion of this panel are three illustrations of plants.<br /> ILLUSTRATION #1: An illustration of pink sand verbena, a plant that also grows on a vine, with a vertical structure to its blossom. The blossom is pink and round like a sphere, the petals growing in more of a three-dimensional pattern. The green triangle-shaped leaves with rounded edges grow above and below the flower.<br /> <br /> ILLUSTRATION #2: An illustration of Indian paintbrush, a plant with teardrop-shaped leaves alternating their way up its stalk to a red blossom.<br /> <br /> ILLUSTRATION #3: An illustration shows a vertical plant with five small, round blue blossoms at the top of its stalk: silver bush lupine. Lower down on the stalk are five crinkly looking leaves, and at the very bottom, a dense section of smaller leaves growing close together.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Silky hairs on the silver bush lupine's leaves reflect heat and protect them from drying out. Capable of fixing nitrogen from the air, an advantage in nutrient-poor sand, these plants can live many decades.<br /> <br /> PANEL #2: Enjoying Crissy Field<br /> <br /> TEXT: The National Park Service invites you to enjoy all that Crissy Field, the Presidio and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area have to offer. Crissy Field has been designed to accommodate a variety of uses. For the safety and enjoyment of all visitors and the protection of national park resources, please obey park rules.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF MAP: A map of the San Francisco Bay coastline, from the San Francisco side, that includes Marina Gate and Entry Grove to the east and stretches all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge to the west. Several areas within the parkland are labeled, including the Warming Hut to the west near Fort Point, then moving east: Golden Gate Promenade, the Tidal Marsh and East Beach.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Regulations. Please:<br /> <br /> - Obey all posted regulations.<br /> <br /> - Adhere to special regulations for the wildlife protection area.<br /> <br /> - Note that bicycles are subject to all motor vehicle laws.<br /> <br /> The following are prohibited:<br /> <br /> - Glass bottles and containers.<br /> <br /> - Fires on beach.<br /> <br /> - Organized sports<br /> <br /> - Camping<br /> <br /> - Collecting plants and other natural objects<br /> <br /> - Removing historic artifacts<br /> <br /> - Feeding or disturbing wildlife<br /> <br /> - Parking in unpaved areas except as designated<br /> <br /> PANEL #3: Fog & Wind at the Gate<br /> TEXT: The San Francisco Bay Area is noted for its microclimates. The Maritime climate at Crissy Field is one of moderate temperatures-averaging between 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit year-round-with a total precipitation of 20 inches annually. However, the wind that funnels continually through the Golden Gate creates harsh conditions here. The salty ocean wind dries and blows the sand ashore, fashioning dunes, blasting and covering plants and perpetually remodeling the shoreline landscape.<br /> During summer the wind causes colder deep seawater to surface. The cold water condenses the moist air to form fog. As heated air inland rises, the fog is drawn eastward through the Golden Gate and over the coastal ridges, making San Francisco summers typically cool.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photograph of a windsurfer, leaning at a 45-degree angle with arms outstretched, holding on to the white sail of his board.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The wind at Crissy Field can be not only invigorating to walkers and runners, but it also offers boardsailors one of the most challenging sites in the world. The best boardsailing conditions occur between March and October, when the wind blows strongly onshore.<br /> <br /> TEXT: How Crissy Field Got Its Name. In 1918, the U.S. Army sent 61 airplanes racing in short hops across the continental United States to test aircraft reliability and endurance. Major Dana H. Crissy led the west-to-east contingent, which left from the still-unmanned airfield at the Presidio. He died in a crash on the first day out. In 1921, Major Hap Arnold, pioneer military aviator and later a five-star general, saw to it that the air base was named in Crissy's honor.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: In the bottom left corner of the panel is a black and white photograph of Major Crissy, standing in profile with his arms behind his back, wearing full aviator uniform with hat and goggles resting on top of his head.</p>",

This setting of wind, waves and rocks inspires us to appreciate the watery world's relationship to the continent's edge. On clear days, you can view an expanse of forty miles up and down the coast and look inland toward the crest of 2,640-foot high Mt. Tamalpais. Other times, enshrouded in fog, you can only imagine the coastal edge while you smell the briny air and listen to the rhythmic waves rolling against the cliffs far below.<br /> <br /> The California coast includes a puzzle-like collage of natural habitats: rocky coastline, sandy beaches, coastal scrub, coastal prairie grasslands, willow-lined streams, rocky outcrops, a scattering of native oak and pine trees, tide pools along the water's edge, and a variety of marine habitats. Each habitat has its own particular, best suited, plants and animals.<br /> <br /> IMAGE LAYOUT: This panel features three photographs of wildlife in its bottom right hand corner.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Furthest left is a photo of a bird with long, brown wings stretched high overhead flying in profile. The wings are longer than its body is long, though it has a long yellow beak.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: The central photo is of a small bird with brown and white feathers perched on a branch in front of green leaves. He has a brown body and white neck with a dark stripe along the crown of his head.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: The photo on the right is of a large mammal with a reddish-brown coat, walking on all fours over a white rock. From left to right they are examples of a brown pelican, a white-crowned sparrow and a coyote.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: This land of various coastal habitats is the home of numerous animals, most of which are small, quiet and reclusive.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Hidden Life in the Brush and Rocks. Listen to the white-crowned sparrow as it sings from a miniature forest of coyote brush, while the scrub jay sounds an alarm at our intrusion. Brown pelicans glide above the water. Swallows swoop after insects. Coyotes prowl for mice. A bobcat hunts where the shy brush rabbit hides.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Nature's Colors. In spring and summer, a tapestry of flowers blanket these rugged bluffs and rolling hills: pink seaside daisies, gum plant in gaudy yellow, pastel tints of Wight's paintbrush, golden sticky monkey flower, and purple bush lupine-names as colorful as the hardy plants themselves.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Above the text is an artist's colorful illustration of the northern coastline at Muir Beach Overlook teeming with life. A flock of brown pelicans fly westward over the ocean in the top left corner, while in the foreground a bobcat peers over hillside at a red, white black towhee bird perched above a cluster of whitish pink seaside daisies with yellow center. Coastal scrub plants half-hide an orange and black monarch butterfly in the bottom right corner, and behind it, a coyote steps out among green leaves. In the distance a black turkey vulture hovers over the cliff, while a red-tailed hawk soars upwards with the green hills that extend to the north.</p>",

The first panel is called: Geology at the Edge: A Land in Motion.<br /> <br /> A color photo at far left shows the rocky coast of the Pacific, with some green cliffs at left.<br /> <br /> Land’s End is aptly named. This is the westernmost tip of San Francisco, the place where the land ends and the vast Pacific Ocean begins.<br /> <br /> To the right, is another section. It shows a map of Marin County and San Francisco, with the San Andreas Fault and the Pacific Ocean. The maps is titled, \"Northern California's Shifting Coastline\".<br /> <br /> Two miles offshore, the San Andreas fault runs in a north-south direction beneath the Pacific Ocean. The North American and Pacific plates meet along this famous fault, slipping slowly past each other at the rate of two to four inches, or five to ten centimeters, each year.<br /> <br /> In geological terms, San Francisco's coastline is relatively young. Once part of the ocean floor, the coastal mountains were raised above sea level several millions of years ago as the Earth's crust was compressed along the San Andreas Fault. As sea levels rose and fell during past glacial periods, Lands End was repeatedly covered by, and then exposed to, the ocean's force.<br /> <br /> Twenty thousand years ago, during the last ice age, the California coastline was more than twenty-five miles farther west, about where the Farallon Islands are today. When the ice melted, sea level eventually reached today's Lands End and flooded the inland valley, which became San Francisco Bay.<br /> <br /> On the right side of this panel are three photographs. The largest titled, “Greywacke sandstone outcrop at Lands End”, shows outcroppings of rock along the ocean's edge, rising up into cliffs.<br /> <br /> The next two, are one on top of the other. The top photo shows the Golden Gate Bridge at right, the Marin County hills on the horizon, and a close-up view of greenish rocks near the shore on the San Francisco side.<br /> <br /> The photo is titled: Serpentine outcrop near the Golden Gate.<br /> <br /> The lower photo shows a close-up of much darker, charcoal-colored shoreline rocks. It’s captioned: Pillow basalt at Lands End.<br /> <br /> Now we’ll talk about the slanted panel, to the right of this one.</p>",

It is in the shade of trees. It faces rows of ivy, two palm trees, and a eucalyptus tree. A long stretch of lawn connects these plants to the General's Residence. The two-story building has white walls and a green roof. An awning frames the entrance, and the windows are narrow and trimmed with brown panels. A historic cannon is displayed on the lawn. To your left, there is a sign stating that the hostel is 0.2 mile ahead, the park headquarters are 0.1 mile ahead, and the chapel is 0.1 mile ahead. Accessible parking lines the other side of the sidewalk.<br /> <br /> TEXT: A Home of Local and National Significance. From 1877 to 1943, Army generals in charge of the vast western territory of the Division of the Pacific lived here in Quarters 1. As the residence of the federal government's most prominent representative in the West, this building hosted military and civilian meetings, dinners and parties of both local and national significance. Designed to be the post's most impressive home, this Italianate style building is based on the stately stone villas of northern Italy. However the fort's limited resources necessitated using wood construction with minimal ornamentation. Almost all other buildings of this age in San Francisco burned after the 1906 earthquake and fire.<br /> <br /> What does a house say about who lives in it?<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black-and-white photograph underneath the text of the large two-story house surrounded by a well-manicured lawn and trees. The photo is dated 1893.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: A succession of more than forty generals lived in Quarters 1 during the western Indian Wars and every overseas campaign until 1943.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: In the lower right hand corner, there is an aerial black and white photograph of the General's Residence and the chapel in the distance. The house includes a rounded and windowed section with wings going off to either side. The photo is dated 1970.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: McDowell Hall was converted to an Officers' Club in 1943. The building's eastern side was transformed over time by periodic renovations, including the addition of a social hall (on the left) and a larger dining room (on the right).<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A color photograph in the top right corner, dated 1910, depicts the entrance to Quarters 1 at Fort Mason. A large arch curves over the road leading the residence, framed by two columns. Each column is topped with a light. The red gates are open, and a soldier in a blue army uniform with white gloves and a brimmed hat stands guard at the entrance.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The boxy shape, low sloping roof, and decorative overhanging eaves of Quarters 1 are typical of the Italianate style of the period.<br /> <br /> SIDEBAR: 1906 Earthquake.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph of four men standing on the lawn outside of the General's Residence, near the awning. One is dressed in a dark army uniform with brass buttons and a peaked cap. The rest are wearing coats and hats.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: General Frederick Funston (center) at Quarters 1 after the 1906 earthquake.<br /> <br /> TEXT: After the disastrous earthquake of April 18, 1906, Brigadier General Frederick Funston rushed to Quarters 1. From there, he directed disaster response and relief efforts for more than a week, until his superior, Major General Adolphus Greely, returned from a trip and assumed control. As fires ravaged San Francisco, army troops worked with civilian firefighters to save what they could, and thousands of homeless citizens flooded refugee camps at Fort Mason.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph of men in dark uniforms standing behind tables laden with rations. People in plainclothes stand in line across the table - men in dark jackets, pants, and hats, and women in long skirts, white blouses, and hats. A cannon is positioned to the left of the scene.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Soldiers dispensing food at Fort Mason.<br /> <br /> QUOTE: \"While conditions improve slightly, the miserable situation may be indicated by the statement that all the food for three hundred thousand people in San Francisco is yet necessary cooked on the public streets.\" - from Major General Adolphus Greely in a telegram to the Military Secretary, Washington D.C., May 9, 1906<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Follow the sidewalk ahead for 225 feet. Turn right before the crosswalk on Franklin Street. Travel north 150 feet to the next wayside.</p>",

Dark green lupin and coyote brush grow in round bunches amongst tall, yellow-green dune grasses. A row of tall willows grows 100 feet away, their bright green, slender leaves shimmer in the wind.<br /> <br /> IMAGE LAYOUT: This panel features several color photographs of red-legged frogs in different stages of development superimposed on a background of a lagoon. Still, blue waters surrounded by tall green marsh grass.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: In the top left of the panel is a photo of a fully matured red-legged frog. As its name suggests, the frog's skin is a distinctive rust-red. Its legs are banded with black stripes, and black markings are present the length of its body.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Although small in size, California red-legged frogs are important animals that tell us about the health of our environment. As native inhabitants, they live in shrubby creek corridors and densely vegetated floodplains with deep pools. Their life cycles are tied to the yearly rhythms of the California climate. However, just a few years ago, not a single frog lived here. During the past century urban development destroyed their habitat and decimated their population, prompting the federal government to list them as threatened in 1996. Since that time, because of efforts by local environmentalists and public agencies, the frogs are beginning to flourish once again.<br /> <br /> The return of the red-legged frog indicates that the water and ecosystem are becoming healthier. To help these and other imperiled species thrive, the Redwood Creek Restoration at Muir Beach created this pond as a place of refuge. As the native plants and natural wetland processes re-establish themselves, the frog population will continue to grow.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photograph of a small green and orange frog resting on a dark brown patch of dirt.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Muir Beach is also home for the Pacific treefrog. This much smaller frog is more vocal-making a \"rrrri-bit\" sound at night and when mating during the day.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGES: At the bottom of the panel are four photos depicting frog development. The first image is of a bunch of blue and black egg sacs floating in water, the second is of a black tadpole, the third is of a juvenile red legged frog, who has developed the reddish hue of an adult, but lacks the black spots and banded legs like the ones on the fully mature specimen in the next photo over.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Wet season: When rains cause creeks to flow and puddles to form, California red-legged frogs become more active. At night they move through dense vegetation to mate and lay masses of 2,000-5,000 eggs.<br /> <br /> Dry season: As rains taper off and ponds recede, frog tadpoles develop into juveniles. When days are long and dry, the adult frogs move about the floodplain seeking moist plants to help them endure the arid fall.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>WAYSIDE PANEL TITLE: A Story of Sustainable Living.<br /> <br /> PANEL DESCRIPTION: The wayside faces east, on the east side of the trail.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: Facing east, to the left, or north, is a path to the East Beach parking lot and the San Francisco Bay Trail. The trail goes east to East Beach and the Crissy Field Center, and west to Crissy Field. Directly behind the wayside and to the right are several picnic tables and barbecues. There are more picnic tables and barbecues on the right of the path to the left. Visible in the distance to the north west is the Golden Gate Bridge. A large willow stands directly in front of the wayside, and a few feet to the right across the trail are both a trash and recycling bin. Cypress trees offer some shade to cars in the parking lot near East Beach, to the right of them, you can see the bathroom building at the far end of the grassy field that starts to your right.<br /> <br /> NOTE: This exhibit was prepared in collaboration with the Ohlone community. Illustrations and text courtesy of Linda Yamane, Rumsien Ohlone.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Traditional Uses of Native Plants. Ohlone people used plants for food, tools, building materials, boats, baskets, twine, medicines, musical instruments, games and more. Their small population and their understanding of plants made it possible for them to use resources without depleting them. Today, we must be careful not to overuse what remains. We can, however, learn from Ohlone tradition, seeing native plants with renewed respect and appreciating the resourcefulness of this area's first people. As part of the restoration of Crissy Field, the National Park Service reintroduced many native plant species, including several shown here, which were traditionally used by the Ohlone.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #1: An illustration of a wispy, feathery-leafed plant next to a woven basket. The basket is two-toned, with a ring of black triangles pointing downward along the top and inside lip of the basket. A similar pattern is continued further down, with a solid black ring making its way around the basket, with a series of angled quadrilateral shape, like a trapezoid, extending down from it. The space between these four-sided shapes forms a rectangle, the bottom edges of which, serve as the base of another row of black triangles.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Bracken Fern, <em>Pteridium aquilinum</em>, Spanish: Manita, Rumsien Ohlone: Witt (pronounced: WEET). Traditionally, bracken fern fronds were used as umbrellas, roof-thatching and the lining of earth ovens or acorn-leaching basins. The underground runner contains a dark band of material that is used to create patterns in basketry.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #2: An illustration of the basket and fern is another illustration of a plant, one with slender oval leaves and a light green coloration.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Arroyo willow, <em>Salix lasiolepis. </em>Spanish: Sauz de la oja finite. Mutsun Ohlone: Tarhasan (pronounched TAR-hah-sahn). Willows have served Ohlone people for countless generations, providing framework for thatched houses, a pain reliever found in the bark, and material for weaving the various baskets so important in everyday life.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #3: An illustration of another plant and its root bulb. The plant has long, curling leaves that all stem from the center of the plant, just above the bulb. Next to this is an illustration of a hand holding a thick paint brush going over a woven basket.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Soap root,<em> Chlorogalum pomeridianum</em>. Spanish: Amole. Mutsun Ohlone: Torow (pronounced: to-RO). The bulb of this plant, when mixed with water, lathers into a fine soap or shampoo. The brown fibers that surround the bulb are tied into sturdy little brushes that are used when preparing acorn meal. In the past, the edible bulbs were baked into underground ovens or crushed and placed in water to stupefy fish for an easy catch.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #4: A plant with a long, tall stalk with pairs of round leaves growing at intervals to its top. The leaves are fairly round but come to a point at their end and are a bluish-green color.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Yerba Buena, <em>Satureja douglasii</em>. Spanish: Yerba Buena. Rumsien Ohlone: Tcawricim (pronounced: CHOW-reesh-eem). The city of San Francisco was first named for this aromatic little mint, which means \"good herb\" in Spanish. Ohlone people have long valued the medicinal properties of yerba buena, drinking it as a tea for good health.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #5: The second plant illustration shows a bright orange bowl or bell shaped flower rising above the green stalks below. Two orange cones, unopened blossoms, are visible lower on the plant.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: California poppy, <em>Eschscholtzia californica</em>. Spanish: Amapolla. Rumsien Ohlone: Cululuk (pronounced: SHOO-loo-look). While it is well known today as the state flower, did you know that Ohlone people once brewed poppy flowers into a remedy for head lice? They also placed these flowers beneath a child's bed to encourage sleep.<br /> <br /> TEXT: What is a Dune Swale? The area in front of you is known as a dune swale. Lying below the water table between sand dunes, these depressions seasonally pool freshwater that seeps up through the soil. The freshwater sustains plants, such as those shown here, that are less tolerant of the salty dunes and tidal marsh.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: To the right of the wayside, follow the path right as it curves around the trash cans and heads north west. You'll pass four picnic tables and barbecues on the right. Walk 280 feet until you reach the next wayside to the left of the path facing west.</p>",

Within its nine square miles are expansive grasslands, dense tangles of coastal chaparral, shady redwood forests and refreshing riparian woodlands in which water flows and empties into the Pacific Ocean. Caring people are actively working together to protect and support the health of this precious watershed system.<br /> <br /> One hundred years of logging, grazing, construction, trail and road building in the past century left the watershed in a severely degraded condition. To restore and manage the watershed as one continuous system, federal, state and local agencies, non-profits and others adopted a Vision for the Future. This innovative and collaborative document includes a set of guiding principles to protect the watershed and offer hope to endangered species such as the coho salmon and California red-legged frog.<br /> <br /> IMAGE LAYOUT: At the bottom of the panel are a series of four images.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A three-quarter view colored map of the Redwood Creek Watershed.

An offshoot of Franklin Street cuts horizontally just ahead of you towards the General's Residence.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: The wayside stands on a small brick square that extends from the sidewalk into the surrounding lawn. The sidewalk continues north and is lined by lawn and trees. The chapel is across the street to your left. It is a white building with a terracotta clay roof. The windows are narrow and ornately paned. Officers' quarters extend up the street past the chapel. The walls are white and horizontally paneled, and the roofs are green. They are like the General's Residence in style, but they are smaller. The sidewalk is lined by parallel parking spaces to your left. The lawn stretches to your right, intersected by a path and dotted with trees. The General's Residence is on the other side of this lawn.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Preserving a Unique Army Post. Look ahead and picture an unpaved road with mule-drawn carts, soldiers on horseback, and strolling wives and children. This was Fort Mason's main street in the 19th century. The post's historic headquarters and first hospital stand ahead to the left. Sergeants lived in the modest quarters across the street and officers lived to your right in elegant homes facing away towards the bay. Ordinarily, military posts have living quarters surrounding and facing a central parade ground. But when the army arrived to build a post in 1863, \"genteel squatters\", as they were called, were already living here in homes overlooking the bay. The army forced these civilians to move on, and then converted many of their homes to officers' quarters, setting the stage for a unique army post.<br /> <br /> What makes something worth preserving?<br /> <br /> MAP: A map titled \"Late 1800s layout of Fort Mason\" is placed underneath the text. The map is oriented with north at the top and features an orange circle with the text \"You Are Here\" in the Southwest corner. From the \"You Are Here\" circle, one would be able to walk north from the Sergeants Quarters, to Post HQ, and then to the Hospital. Walking east from the Hospital leads to the Parade Grounds, Barracks, and the Stables. From here, walking south along the Parade Grounds would loop down to more barracks, and then walking southeast brings the path back past the Sergeants Quarters and to the \"You Are Here\" circle. Steep topography lies to the west of the \"You Are Here\" circle. There are three separate areas in this western region of the map labeled as \"Officers' Quarters.\"<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black-and-white photo titled \"Sergeants' Housing\" and dated 1893 is in the bottom right corner. There are two simple buildings side-by-side. They are surrounded by a picket fence and a lawn. A horse drawn carriage waits on a wide road lining the fence.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The small homes across the street were army bachelor quarters converted to family housing. They look much as they did in the 1860s - except for the color. In the 1930s, many of the fort's buildings were repainted white and roofed with red shingles to suggest the then-popular Mission Revival style architecture.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black-and-white photo titled \"Officers' Housing\" and dated 1908 is in the top right corner. The house is three stories, with a large porch and a balcony. The stately home is surrounded by grass, flowers, and trees.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Three of Fort Mason's oldest buildings still overlook the bay to your right. Built by private developers for prominent San Francisco citizens in the 1850s, the army confiscated the homes during the Civil War and modified them for officers' quarters. Today, the houses are leased as residences.<br /> <br /> SIDEBAR: Heart of the Post.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: An illustration depicts several soldiers, hats off, as a bugler plays in front of a flagpole flying the American flag.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Fort Mason's flagpole once stood near the end of this road-the tree-covered circle in the street's center. The raising and lowering of the flag is a solemn ceremony on army posts. A lone bugle sounded as soldiers sent the flag up and down each morning and evening. On formal occasions, the post band performed. If you were within sight of the flagpole when the moment came, you would have stopped and turned your attention to the stars and stripes.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black-and-white photo beneath the text is dated 1906. Women in fine dresses and hats, men in suits, and children stand in line as a soldier looks on. There are large crates stacked in front of Fort Mason's military houses in the background.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: San Francisco citizens line up around the Fort Mason flagpole waiting for food rations after the 1906 earthquake.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Turn right from the sidewalk to travel northeast down the 60-foot stretch of the driveway for the General's Residence. Exercise caution and be aware of approaching cars. The sidewalk resumes on the left side of the road. Continue on this sidewalk for 169 feet, and then make a right and walk 6 feet. Make a left and walk 42 feet to the next wayside.</p>",

They performed skits and watched movies, bowled, played pool, and visited at the soda fountain. For three decades, until the penitentiary closed in 1963, this was the center of the island’s social scene.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{5af0ac81-9ce3-4ded-a152-f6fbc0bdb671}{217}\" paraid=\"1947460278\">Earlier, between 1910 and 1933, while Alcatraz was a military prison, army families stationed on the island came here to the Post Exchange – the island’s general store, cafeteria, barbershop, and post office.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{5af0ac81-9ce3-4ded-a152-f6fbc0bdb671}{229}\" paraid=\"1593683200\">DESCRIPTION: Black and white photograph of a gathering of people at a party or dance.

    "bodyText": "<p><em>Transcription of accompanying audio.<br /> Woman's Voice.</em><br /> <br /> This is stop 5.<br /> <br /> This is called: Rocks at the Edge.<br /> <br /> It begins with this text, at left: The forces that helped build Lands End are now tearing it down. Wind, rain, and waves relentlessly chew at the bluffs, washing away softer rocks while leaving behind the more resistant outcroppings of harder rocks. Isolated harder blocks form the solitary \"sea stacks\" that dot the shoreline. Seal Rocks are good examples of sea stacks.<br /> <br /> As the cliffs erode, some of their debris is carried by southbound ocean currents along Ocean Beach and deposited there as sand. However, most of the sand at Ocean Beach originated in the Sierra Nevada, where rain and freezing weather erode stone and rock, and a system of streams and rivers carries the particles hundreds of miles to San Francisco Bay and then through the Golden Gate Strait.<br /> <br /> Climate change may well bring a further rise in the sea level. Many low-lying areas of San Francisco-along with the entire Pacific Coast-are at risk of inundation.<br /> <br /> To the right of this text is a color photograph of \"sea stacks\" in the ocean, the tall, hard rocks left behind after softer rocks erode.<br /> <br /> Next to this is, a photo on top and a chart below.<br /> <br /> The photo is titled, “Layered chert in a road cut”. It shows rows of brick-like rocks compressed on a hillside.<br /> <br /> The chart is titled, \"Subduction Process from 160 to 70 million years ago.\" It shows the ocean with different rock types beneath the surface, the lithosphere and the earth's mantle, as well as the sierra arc.<br /> <br /> The caption reads: \"Ocean rocks were added to the continent's edge as the Pacific seafloor slid, or subducted, under the North American Plate. The plates now slide past each other along the San Andreas Fault, causing California's notorious earthquakes.\"<br /> <br /> The rest of this panel shows and describes four types of rocks.<br /> <br /> The first is basalt. An igneous rock formed by rapid cooling of lava on the sea floor. Usually grey or black, it is sometimes found in smooth, rounded, pillow-like formations. Ohlone people used chunks of heated basalt for cooking.<br /> <br /> Next is Serpentinite rock. A metamorphic rock sometimes called “serpent rock”. Shiny green, it contains asbestos in its natural mineral form. Serpentinite is California's state rock.<br /> <br /> Next is a reddish rock called chert. A sedimentary rock from the ancient sea bottom. It is composed of layers of silica formed from the skeletons of microscopic, one-celled ocean animals called radiolarians.<br /> <br /> The last rock is Greywacke rock. A sedimentary rock made up of ancient, cemented grains of sand, susceptible to erosion by rain and wind. Greywacke sandstone is the most common rock at Lands End.<br /> <br /> Before we leave here, touch the window in front of you. Our windows are state-of-the-art, specially designed to deflect heat in summer and hold it in winter. Beyond them is one of the world's best views: Seal Rock towards the southern end, cypresses to the north, and the Pacific Ocean reaching to the western horizon.<br /> <br /> Now for the next stop on the tour, turn left and walk to the far end of the farthest slanted panel.Take another step, reach out, and touch a vertical wood wall.Go around it to the waist-high counter.Take just two steps and stop.Then turn so the counter is at your back. Walk forward five or six steps and stop at another waist-high counter. This is a merchandise counter.</p>",

It is the third of three panels located here and faces south west out over the wide expanse of the Pacific Ocean.<br /> <br /> PANEL TITLE: Soldiers Guarding the Coast.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: Behind the waysides across the path is a WWII fire control station dugout. The dugout, or \"gopher hole\" is a partially submerged cement structure big enough for two men to stand inside. It has a pill-like shape, a rounded top with a gentle curve. A one-quarter section of \"the pill\" is missing, so that men could climb in and look out at the ocean. There is a concrete lip around the bottom of the dugout's opening about a foot high. Opposite the dugout to the south west are three interpretive wayside panels. Inside, the dugout has smooth sides and a cement pole on the left-hand side.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Relics of tense times. Early in World War Two, the United States was reeling from Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and moved to augment the defense of San Francisco Bay from enemy ships. Base end \"fire control\" stations proliferated along the coast in those fearful times. Built to house soldiers on the lookout for enemy ships, and equipped with a very powerful spotting scope, they could relay ship coordinates to a central communications and plotting center, so powerful guns in nearby batteries could take accurate aim at their targets.<br /> <br /> Here you can investigate four historic base end stations, nicknamed \"gopher holes\" by the soldiers. Two of them served gun batteries in the Marin Headlands. One served Fort Miley south of Ocean Beach in San Francisco, and the fourth was assigned to a minefield, which paralleled the shipping channel along the Marin shore.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: In the top center section of the panel is a profile diagram of a gopher hole. It shows two men for scale. One is peering through a sighting scope on the left, the other is climbing down into the dugout via ladder under a hatch. Two small bunks are suspended one over the other from the back wall.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The soldiers' main duty was to scan the ocean for enemy ships. Each base end station had two men on duty at all times. Most base end stations were a single room, furnished with bare necessities. Two narrow bunks and a stove made them livable, but duty in these \"gopher holes\" could be cold and miserable. In an old motor court at nearby Muir Beach village, the Army leased cabins for a cookhouse and to house soldiers stationed in this area.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: To the right of the diagram is a black and white photo of two soldiers, one wearing a brimmed hat and a jacket open in the front with a dark t-shirt underneath. One of his eyes is closed, as the other peers through a large sighting scope on a mount that swivels side-to-side. The other soldier is only partially visible, obscured as he is by the sighting scope. He's looking at his partner staring through the scope and wearing headphones.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: A powerful mounted spotting telescope was used to scan for enemy shops and track targets during target practice. The telescope sat on a steel pedestal bolted to the floor.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Wearing Parkas in Summer. On many days, this was a cold, damp, windy, foggy, isolated place to be stationed during World War Two. During the summer of 1944, an officer commanding one of the stations here put in a supply request for cold weather parkas and fur lined boots for the men. A few days later, he received a call from a supply sergeant at an army depot. Why, the sergeant wanted to know, did the coast artillery need Arctic-type clothing...in California? He had just shipped an order of summer-weight shorts and shirts to the Army air force base at Hamilton Field. Weren't the two posts just a few miles apart? The lieutenant replied: \"You'd have to be from the Bay Area to understand.\"<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A diagram is located in the bottom right hand corner of two black and white crosshairs. These represent base end stations on either side of a red dot, representing a gun battery. The three structures, the two base end stations and battery are arranged in a straight line labeled \"base line\" at the bottom of the image, parallel to a coastline. At the top of the diagram at its center, is a purple rectangle with one pointed end like a pencil labeled \"target\" in a blue field representing the ocean. Radiating from the target out to the three respective structures are three dotted lines.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Using a method called \"triangulation\" and data provided by two lookout posts (base end stations) positioned in key spots along the coast, a plotting crew could pinpoint targets miles out to sea.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: In the bottom center of the panel is a black and white photograph of five men in uniforms huddled around a table in a room Four of the men wear headphones while a man with light hair and glasses is bent over a table with a pencil to paper, with three straight edges scattered overtop the page.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Plotting room crews received base end station sightings and computed firing instructions for gun batteries in the Marin Headlands.</p>",

The most prominent row is full of flowering plants with purple, white red and orange blossoms. On the left of the garden photo is a superimposed image of leafy chard, with green leaves and a veiny, magenta stalk.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Within the Redwood Creek Watershed, there are many examples of people living compatibly with the native landscape while cultivating the rich riparian soils. For thousands of years Coast Miwok created shelter and found sustenance in this fertile floodplain. When Europeans took over the land, they leased parcels to Portuguese dairymen who sailed here from the Azores in search of a better life. The immigrants settled and worked in small agricultural communities nearby and established dairy ranches.<br /> <br /> George Wheelwright, a wealthy entrepreneur, purchased the Green Gulch pasture adjacent to Redwood Creek in 1945. He modified the creek, constructed a levee and grazed cattle here until he sold the land to the San Francisco Zen Center in the 1960s. The Zen Center ended the grazing, enabling the native landscape to return. The Center now runs Green Gulch Farm, growing organic produce for local businesses and farmers' markets.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white illustration of a Coast Miwok woven basket with a triangle pattern running. A row of reeds and a few trees are in the background. The era is 'over 6,000 years ago.'<br /> <br /> CAPTION: As food came into season, the Coast Miwok moved about to sustainably harvest the abundant resources of the ocean and creek.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photo of men, women and children in the 1870s. Some are standing, others on horseback, all are facing the camera which captures several heads of cattle and a white farm building with an angled roof behind them.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The Azorean dairy farmers worked on local ranches. Their efforts helped Marin County become California's largest milk and butter producer.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A color photo of several brown cows grazing in a green pasture with a stream in the background, Eucalyptus trees in the distance and fog rolling in over a green hillside. The era is listed as 'the 1940s to the 1960s.'<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Intensive cattle grazing eroded the land and degraded the creek.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A color photo three kids and one adult in a green field, their eyes trained on a beehive behind clear glass at Green Gulch Farm.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The Green Gulch Farm practices strive to balance human uses and natural processes.</p>",

Traditional creation stories place the origins of the Ohlone people to \"a time out of memory.\" The Yelamu, an Ohlone tribe, inhabited the tip of the San Francisco peninsula at the time Spanish colonization began in the 1770s. These lands bordering the bay provided the Yelamu with a rich array of plants and animals that supplied food, tools, ornaments and shelter.<br /> <br /> An abundance of plants and animals in this estuarine location sustained the Yelamu. In limited archeological excavations at this site, the remains of at least 84 species were found. These include shellfish, surfperch and various other fish (huyi in Ohlone); birds, chiefly seabirds, waterfowl, shorebirds, birds of prey, ravens and crows; marine mammals and assorted terrestrial mammals, including sea otters (shuushch), harbor seals (asks), tule elk (tiwu) and grizzly bears (ores).<br /> <br /> These Ohlone words are from the well-documented southern Rumsien and Mutsun dialects. Only a few words from the Ramaytush dialect spoken here were ever recorded.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #1: A detailed illustration of an Ohlone dwelling. Shaped like a bell, the structure is made of woven natural fibers, with a rounded opening on one side.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The most common type of Ohlone house (illustrated here by Linda Yamane, Rumsien Ohlone) along the bay shore was a domed structure made from the wood of willows and thatched with tule.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATION #2: To the right of the illustration of the Ohlone house is a drawing of three Ohlone people in a small canoe. Two of them are men, shirtless with their long, black hair tied on top of their heads and headbands around their foreheads holding long, pointed paddles in both their hands over their shoulders. Between the men is a woman dressed in a white, hooded cloak. The waters are calm, and the hilly land formations behind them plainly visible.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Ohlone people made boats of tule, which they used for transportation, fishing and hunting.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: On the right hand side of the panel is a photograph of an empty dirt patch with a brown sign with white lettering that reads, \"Crissy Field Project.\"<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Preserving an Ohlone Cultural Site Together. Buried remnants of a seasonal Yelamu village were discovered here before the reconstruction of the Crissy Field marsh began. In consultation with Ohlone tribes, individuals from the Ohlone community and archeologists, the National Park Service redesigned the marsh to preserve this native heritage. This decision reflected the preference of the National Park Service and the Ohlone community to preserve this site rather than disturb it.<br /> <br /> Middens--accumulations of bones, shells, food refuse, fire pits and discarded and lost materials--mark the locations of ancient encampments. Some middens contain the remains of human burials, although none were found here.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: A photograph of a black, obsidian stone arrow, with one smooth and one serrated edge.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Arrowhead styles signify specific time periods. This obsidian projectile point, along with shell beads, the remains in soil layers and scientific dating methods, indicates this site was occupied 200 to 600 years ago.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: From the wayside, walk to your left about six feet where you will find a boardwalk and gated fence. The latch to the gate is on the top left. Proceed through the gate onto the boardwalk about 400 feet until you reach a wayside on the right.</p>",

Throughout the military and penitentiary years, Alcatraz was much like a small town. Keeping the town going – and the convicts under control – depended on the uninterrupted service of the power plant to your left and the warehouse straight ahead. Because of the vital nature of these facilities, they were strictly off-limits to prisoners, unlike some operations on the island that relied on inmate labor.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81433fce-0523-4922-aae8-b9e445c8ba0c}{200}\" paraid=\"1371888732\">Completed in 1912, the power plant generated the island’s electricity and powered the pumps that provided fresh and salt water for all needs, including cooking, drinking, bathing, producing steam heat, irrigating the gardens, and fighting fires. The warehouse, built in 1921, stored essential supplies and equipment brought from the mainland, and provided workshop space. Today, both buildings serve many of the same functions.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81433fce-0523-4922-aae8-b9e445c8ba0c}{204}\" paraid=\"1347292261\">SECOND COLUMN:  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81433fce-0523-4922-aae8-b9e445c8ba0c}{208}\" paraid=\"1261573467\">DESCRIPTION #1: Black and white image of the power plant engine room.

Lands End is rich in attractions, but many are threatened by human and environmental forces.<br /> <br /> Beneath this text, is a large, colorful picture of a woman and child digging in the dirt to plant ground cover.<br /> The caption says: Volunteerism starts early.<br /> <br /> Underneath are three more pictures.<br /> <br /> At left, a young woman works with plants. The caption reads, “Weeding at native plant nursery”.<br /> <br /> In the middle, three people in hard hats stand in a cement structure. The caption says, “Surveying Sutro Baths ruins”.<br /> <br /> At right, for people in rain slickers work on a path, with the caption, “Building trails”.<br /> <br /> Today, the entire offshore area of Lands End is part of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, a thirteen-hundred-square-mile preserve that protects one of the most diverse and bountiful marine environments in the world. On land, ongoing stewardship efforts are directed at safeguarding the area's resources. The Golden Gate National Recreation Area and its nonprofit partner, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, support the work of a dedicated group of volunteers who do everything from planting native species to rehabilitating Native American sites. These efforts are in keeping with the great mission of the National Park Service, mandated by Congress in 1916: To protect the wildlife and the natural and historic objects, and manage them in such a way as to leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.<br /> <br /> Now, for directions to the next stop, to get there, turn so the counter is on your left. Walk a few steps to the end of the counter. Now, walk diagonally to your right for three or four steps. Reach out and touch a cement pedestal. It has a cement statue on it, which you can also touch. This is a reproduction of a sculpture of the goddess Diana, hunting, with a little stag at her side. Stand on the side of the pedestal with the glossy text panel. </p>",

The General's Residence is to the right, and a private residence is to the left.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: The wayside is underneath a eucalyptus tree and is surrounded by fallen leaves and peeled bark. You are overlooking the edge of upper Fort Mason. This seaside bluff drops down to Aquatic Park below, which is lined by the large, C-shaped Municipal Pier. Many people fish, bike, and run this pier. The San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park is in this section of the bay, and the historic ships are docked past the Municipal Pier. Alcatraz Island, the Marin Headlands, and stretches of East Bay are visible from here. Behind you is a windowed section of the General's Residence. There may be people milling about inside, likely attending a conference.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Bringing Back a Lost Landscape<br /> <br /> TEXT: People have long wanted to fashion the natural landscape to their desires. In the 1850s, prominent citizens like explorer John C. FrÃ©mont and author Jessie Benton FrÃ©mont built homes atop this bluff overlooking the bay. They also created terraces with scenic walks down to the waterfront past stone walls, winding stairs, benches, fruit trees and flowers. Protected from the ocean winds, this was a rare spot for gardening.<br /> <br /> The hillside was long a favorite place to meet, stroll, take in the views and garden, but in the 1970s, maintenance lapsed after the Army left. The gardens vanished under overgrowth, and illegal campers took over the empty walks. The National Park Service eventually closed the public paths. Beginning in 2018, volunteers began to clear and maintain the terrace gardens, bringing back this lost landscape for the public to enjoy.<br /> <br /> Why do we grow ornamental plants?<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A large black-and-white photograph of Black Point and the terrace gardens. Simple houses are built along the water, and the General's Residence sits up on a hill with dense vegetation.<br /> <br /> QUOTE: \"The waters of the great bay washed the rocks of our headlands and we looked down over roses and geraniums to the decks of passing ships...\" Jessie Benton Frémont, Far-West Sketches, 1890.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black-and-white photograph showcasing the officer's housing engulfed by shrubs and trees. It is dated 1870. Small pathways, lined with low shrubs, wind through the garden.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: \"General's residence overlooks the bay at the top of the terrace gardens.\"<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A color photograph of volunteers maintaining the terrace gardens in 2019. The sun shines brightly and the garden is green and full.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Volunteers help restore the historic landscape of the terrace gardens.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Travel back 42 feet in the direction you came. Make a left and walk 6 feet. Make a right and walk 169 feet along the sidewalk. Walk on the road for 50 feet and rejoin the sidewalk on the right side of the road. Once you have reached the sidewalk, continue north for 620 feet. Turn left and walk 10 feet. You have arrived at the next wayside.</p>",

After purchasing a modest home across from the Cliff House in 1881, he converted the rocky hilltop on which it sat into a lavish estate with lush gardens and shady forests. He also imported concrete replicas of Greek and Roman statuary to decorate his flower beds and educate visitors about classical art. Storybook characters and garden gnomes dotted the grounds.<br /> <br /> After Sutro's death in 1898, the estate became neglected, and many of the decorations were lost to vandalism. This replica statue of Diana was cast from the original 1880s statue, as were the others on display here and at Sutro Heights. All surviving Sutro-era statuary is now in safe storage.<br /> <br /> Two black and white photographs illustrate the story. At left, the photo shows the sculpture in situ, standing tall above garden plants, with a gardener standing next to her pedestal. The caption is, “Diana statue at Sutro Heights, 1886”.<br /> <br /> At right, the photo shows a back view of another sculpture, a full-sized nude with a cherub, and other sculptures in the background. Three men stand in the park-like setting. The caption reads, “Statues and fountain. Adolph Sutro is at far left. 1886”.<br /> <br /> Now for directions to the next stop, make sure you're standing at the glossy panel side of the Diana statue.Now, walk around the left side of the sculpture and find Diana's left foot. Turn so your back is to it and walk forward one or two steps. You will find a free-standing display.</p>",

He would become known as \"the Pathfinder,\" the man who mapped the West. His wife, Jessie Frémont, compiled accounts of his adventures, stirring the nation's fervor for a coast-to-coast empire that was the United States' \"Manifest Destiny.\" This destiny would eradicate the cultures of indigenous peoples across the continent.<br /> <br /> During his expeditions, Frémont was responsible for the brutal killing of native peoples, including the slaughter of up to 1,000 Wintu in the Sacramento River area in 1846. Yet John Frémont, who was elected as US Senator from the new state of California, supported numerous bills against the extension of slavery. In 1856, he was selected (over Abraham Lincoln) as the first presidential candidate of the Republican Party, running on an anti-slavery platform.<br /> <br /> What are two seemingly contradictory views that you might hold?<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black-and-white photograph dated 1860 lies adjacent to this text. In it, a woman in a large dark dress and hat stands on a porch and gazes out past the garden to the bay.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Jessie Frémont looks towards Alcatraz from the porch of the home that she shared here with John. The cottage, which stood on the bluff below you, was confiscated by the U S Army during the Civil War to make way for a gun battery.<br /> <br /> SIDEBAR: Titled \"The Frémonts' Legacies.\"<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Titled John Charles Frémont (1813 to 1890) and is dated 1860. The illustration depicts a middle-aged John Frémont in a suit and bowtie. He has dark hair that extends past his ears, and a full beard. He looks off to the left.<br /> <br /> TEXT: John Frémont gave the Golden Gate its name in 1846. That same year, he assisted American settlers in a revolt against Mexican rule and declared California an independent republic after raising their Bear Flag. He was a Senator and the presidential candidate before serving the Union as a general during the Civil War. But he is most remembered as an explorer of the West.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: Titled \"Jessie Benton Frémont (1824 to 1902) and dated 1860. Jessie Frémont wears a large dark dress and sits on the floor as she reads a book. Her hair is pulled back tightly. She is accompanied by an ornate tea set, and the walls of the room are heavily patterned. Ivy encircles the doorway above her head.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Jessie Frémont joined John in California in 1849, traveling with their young daughter by ship and crossing Panama. Jessie befriended Reverend Thomas Starr King, a Unitarian minister known for his powerful sermons and advocacy for the rights of free Blacks. At her Black Point home, Jessie invited King to write his fiery abolitionist speeches in her study, and the two hosted literary and political salons with influential figures of the period, including Bret Harte and Herman Melville.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: To reach the next wayside, turn left and walk 63 feet along the cement sidewalk.</p>",

Beyond the marsh are sand dunes butting up against the waters of the San Francisco Bay, and further north, the Golden Gate Bridge in front of the Marin Headlands.<br /> <br /> TEXT: This recreated tidal marsh and lagoon recoup a fragment of a luxuriant 130-acre marsh system that once stretched along this shoreline. Abounding in life, the marsh offered the native Yelamu people an ideal place for fishing, hunting and gathering. The U.S. military regarded it as an unhealthy wasteland and dumped the Presidio's trash into this rich estuary before it was filled for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The Army developed Crissy airfield several years later and used the site for housing and industrial operations until transferring it to the National Park Service in 1994.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF MAP: A black and white map in the bottom left corner depicting Crissy Field and the San Francisco Bay to the north, at the top of the illustration. On land, many paths cut east to west, paralleling the shoreline. It also shows a large and elaborate body of water that feeds into the bay. This map shows the extent of the original Crissy Field marsh in 1870.<br /> <br /> IMAGE LOCATION: At the top center of the panel are two black and white photographs, one on top of the other.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: The top-most photo shows a sandy, low-lying area with a very low water level. In the foreground, a pile of wood can be seen, and in the distance, a row of buildings.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The original marsh here was considered worthless for military purposes. The Army used the wetland as a dump and later paved over and built on much of it after the marsh was filled.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: A section of muddy, land with areas inundated by water. In the foreground is a building with an angled roof and in the distance, a larger building along a coast, surrounded in low-lying water. To the left of the frame, a ship sits just off the coast.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: An ocean-going dredge pumped sand and mud from the bottom of San Francisco Bay into the salt marsh in 1912 as the first step in construction of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition.<br /> <br /> TEXT: \"Wastelands\" No Longer. Like wetlands everywhere, Bay Area tidal marshes for years were viewed as wastelands best suited for dumping, diking, draining and filling. More than 90% of the bay's 200,00 acres of perimeter wetlands were lost to urban growth by the early 1960s. As people began to recognize the ecological values of marshes, lawmakers passed laws to protect California wetlands and require replacement of wetlands damaged or destroyed by development. About 11,000 acres of wetlands around the Bay Area were restored or enhanced between 1995 and 2000; an additional 60,000 acres is the goal for the ensuing three decades.<br /> <br /> MAP: The panel features a map of the San Francisco Bay to the south, and San Pablo Bay to the north. To the west, the bays feed into the Pacific Ocean through the narrow Golden Gate separating the peninsula containing San Francisco, and the Marin Headlands to the north. Areas within the bays are marked with different shades of blue; a lighter blue represents areas that were tidal marsh from 1770-1820. The darker blue shows modern day tidal marsh habitat. Areas to the south of San Francisco Bay are the marshiest now, in San Pablo Bay, the same is true for areas to the north.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Over about two centuries, people converted many acres of wetlands around San Francisco Bay to other uses.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Turn right from the wayside and go back the way you came. When you pass through the gate, turn left and take the path as it curves around the marsh to the north west about 150 feet until you reach a wayside to the left of the path.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>WAYSIDE PANEL TITLE: Black Point Fortifications (1797 to 1909)<br /> <br /> PANEL DESCRIPTION: The wayside faces north and is placed along a cement path that overlooks the bay.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: The wayside is positioned on the bluffs of Fort Mason and overlooks the San Franciscan Bay. Ivy clumps in the foreground but gives way to a hillside that descends into Black Point. A low brick parapet lines the point, and a black canon is visible to the left. Further in the distance, one can see Piers 2 and 3 at lower Fort Mason. The Marin Headlands, including Hawk Hill and Fort Baker, and Sausalito are beyond the bay, connected by the Golden Gate Bridge. Dense shrubs and trees are to the right, and a mix of grass and feral blackberry vines blanket the slight hill behind you. The path continues to your left.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Defending from an Enemy that Never Came<br /> <br /> TEXT: Both Spanish and American militaries defended the deep water harbor just east of here with artillery mounted on this strategic bluff overlooking the harbor and bay. Neither ever fired a shot in anger; perhaps because of these defenses?<br /> <br /> The Spanish first installed artillery here in 1797 to deter invasion by English, Russian or other potential enemy ships. In 1863, as the Civil War raged back East and concerns of Confederate or British raids mounted, Major General Henry Halleck ordered this bluff refortified with heavy artillery. A dozen large guns were placed at Black Point batteries to augment guns at Fort Point, Angel Island, and Alcatraz Island.<br /> <br /> What are the impacts of protecting the things we value?<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A large black-and-white photo spans over the area below this text. Dated 1865, it features two cannons mounted and pointed out towards the bay over a parapet. The cannons are equipped with wheels, so that they can be rotated. Two soldiers stand on the parapet and look out towards the bay.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Six 10-inch caliber cannon, like the one you see mounted here today in the West Battery, were aimed at the Golden Gate. They could shoot 128 pound cannonballs up to 2 miles. Six cannons in the East Battery were aimed north to overlap with fire from Alcatraz Island.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A smaller black-and-white photograph is positioned in the right-hand corner of this image. It is dated 1880 and displays five of the mounted cannons at Black Point framed on either side by low hills. A path leads up to them from behind.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The guns here fired salutes during special occasions, but never fired on an enemy vessel. San Francisco harbor was never raided during the Civil War or later, and eventually the cannons were removed. In the 1980s the battery was restored.<br /> <br /> SIDEBAR: Protecting the Harbor.<br /> <br /> MAP: An informational map of Golden Gate Straits, framed by San Francisco in the south, the Marin Headlands and Marin in the north, and Angel Island in the east. Arrows extending from bodies of land represent the range of artillery at various coastal defense sites. The ranges conglomerate in the center of the bay. From west to east, the coastal defense sites are: Fort Point at the tip of San Francisco, Angel Island, Black Point at Fort Mason, and Alcatraz Island.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: If an enemy vessel had entered San Francisco Bay during the Civil War, it would have faced fire from four directions.<br /> <br /> TEXT: When the Spanish-American War broke out in 1898, Black Point's Civil War batteries were in poor shape. Rather than repair their rotting wooden platforms, two concrete gun mounts were built beside the West Battery. Two Rodman cannon like the one you see here today were placed on the new platforms to protect against attack from Spanish ships.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black-and-white photo, dated 1902, features soldiers standing behind cannon as billows of white smoke protrude into the bay. Alcatraz Island can be seen in the distance.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Soldiers practice firing cannons.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: There are two routes to the next wayside. One involves stairs, and the other does not.<br /> <br /> STAIR ROUTE: To take the route with stairs, continue down the cement path for 67 feet. Turn left and walk up the set of stairs. Turn left and walk 144 feet, or until you meet a set of descending stairs. The path branches a bit here. They will all lead to the same place, but the most direct route is to stay straight on the path you are currently on. Walk down the stairs. Turn right and walk 113 feet. Turn right and walk 25 feet. The sidewalk ends here, and you will now walk along the road bordering the International Hostel for 343 feet. At the edge of the hostel, you can turn right and walk 138 feet, and then make a left turn and walk 135 feet. Make a slight left to continue on this large asphalt road and walk 414 feet downhill under the shade of eucalyptus trees. You have arrived at the next wayside.<br /> <br /> NO STAIR ROUTE: Walk back the 63 feet to the Manifest Destiny wayside. Take a slight right at the fork and walk 213 feet. Turn right and walk 25 feet. The sidewalk ends here, and you will now walk along the road bordering the International Hostel for 343 feet. At the edge of the hostel, you can turn right and walk 138 feet, and then make a left turn and walk 135 feet.

The area includes a wooden bridge over a shallow body of water with a sandbar protruding at its center. Closer to the fence is a sandy dune dotted by green coastal scrub plants. Much of the dune remains exposed, with a pile of discarded wood lying in the grass.<br /> <br /> To the right is a path leading to the San Francisco Bay Trail, which runs east to west. East takes you to East Beach and Crissy Field Center. West takes you to Crissy Field, Fort Point and the Golden Gate Bridge. To the left is a path that leads to picnic tables and barbecues.<br /> <br /> TEXT: The Native People of the Peninsula. The Yelamu were one of 50 independent Ohlone tribes related through culture and language. Ohlone peoples have lived in the Bay Area for several thousand years. The Yelamu, whose territory included today's Crissy Field, moved seasonally from the winter villages of Tubsinte, Sitlintac and Petlenuc to the summer/fall villages of Chutchui and Amuctac. Archeological study of remains found at Crissy Field indicates the Yelamu lived here when plants, fish and other animals were available for harvest.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF MAP #1: Small map shows the San Francisco peninsula, labeling Yelamu sites circa 1770. Petlenuc is the furthest north, in the same area as the Presidio, followed by Sitlintac a little south and further east, Chutchui in the center of the peninsula, then Amuctac further south along the eastern coast and further south and inland from there, Tubsinte.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF MAP #2: A larger map showing the entirety of the Ohlone territory circa 1770, an area that stretched from a small area just north of the bay all the way down the coast past Monterey Bay and significantly inland.<br /> <br /> QUOTE: \"I am very old...my people were once around me like the sands of the shore...many...many. They have all passed away. They have died like the grass...they have gone to the mountains. I do not complain, the antelope falls with the arrow. I had a son. I loved him. When the palefaces came he went away. I do not know where he is. I am a Christian Indian, I am all that is left of my people. I am alone.\" --Pedro Alcantara, the last known Yelamu, born in 1780, from an interview recorded by Indian Agent Adam Johnston in 1850, the year California became a state.<br /> <br /> CHART DESCRIPTION: A two column chart. The first column lists individuals' Yelamu names and their dates of birth. The second column lists the individuals' corresponding Spanish name and the dates of their baptism.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Mission San Francisco baptism records reveal the names of some of the last Yelamu individuals from the village of Petlenuc. At baptism the individual was given a Spanish name.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: On the left side is a photograph of Ohlone children dancing in a circle wearing traditional regalia including grass skirts, animal pelts and feather headdresses. They're watched by a group of adults and children in modern dress. A man with a goatee wearing a dark shirt and jeans beats a white round drum with a mallet, and looks on as the children dance barefoot on the grass of Crissy Field, overlooking the water's of the bay.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Crissy Field tidal marsh opening, 1999.<br /> <br /> TEXT: \"We Are Still Here.\" The Yelamu population, around 200 at the time Spanish colonists arrived in the 1770s, was among the smallest of all Ohlone tribes. The disruptions wrought by European colonization decimated the Yelamu. Although we know of no Yelamu descendants living today, several Ohlone tribal groups and many individuals from the broader Ohlone population make up a vital contemporary native community. Ohlone people have played an active role in the Crissy Field restoration project.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: A photograph of several men sitting around a table in a dark room looking on as one man signs a piece of paper on the table.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Ohlone representatives signed an agreement with the National Park Service concerning the preservation and interpretation of Ohlone culture.<br /> <br /> TEXT: This exhibit was prepared in collaboration with the Ohlone community. \"Ohlone\" is a native term used by many tribes and individuals today. Some local tribes, individuals, anthropologists and linguists use the term \"Costanoan,\" which was originally applied to this cultural group by the Spanish.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Walk 180 feet west along the San Francisco Bay Trail. You'll arrive at a boardwalk bridge where there's a wayside along its northern side.</p>",

With a potential life span of 25-30 years, including 20 or more breeding years, and a clutch of three eggs every nesting season, suggest that each pair of western gulls could raise more than 60 chicks. However, just one or two chicks fledge from each clutch, and of the very few that survive to adulthood, most live no more than ten years. Through careful management, the island provides vital nesting habitat for colonies of gulls and other sea birds.  </p>",

Here at the ocean's edge, they found everything they needed: hillside springs gushing with fresh water; trees and brush for shelters; and easy access to the shore, where they fished and hunted for otters, sea lions, and sea birds. For leisure, they played stick games and told tribal stories. Spanish settlement of San Francisco, which began in 1776, ended the Yelamu's traditional life at Lands End.<br /> <br /> Beneath this text is a drawing of an Ohlone settlement. Two conical reed huts are connected by a reed awning, and Ohlone tribes people pursue activities like mending nets and transporting stores in baskets.The caption is, “Ohlone village scene.\"<br /> <br /> Beneath this drawing are several more images.<br /> <br /> At left is a closeup drawing of hands weaving a basket, captioned, “Basket weaving.\"<br /> <br /> At right is a photo of an arrowhead posed with rulers that indicate it is eight inches long and about two and a half inches wide at its base. The caption reads, “Chert point found at Lands End.\"<br /> <br /> Below are two more drawn images.<br /> <br /> One shows hands working on flint with the caption, “Knapping flint to make arrowhead.\"<br /> <br /> The other titled, \"Soaproot brush,\" shows a hand using a brush of this natural material. A caption below all the images reads, “These replica items, made by contemporary Ohlone, are among the everyday objects used by the Yelamu people.\"<br /> <br /> Several more Yelamu artifacts are in the glass case.<br /> <br /> Now for directions to the next stop, step to the left and find the other glass-topped display counter. Go around it on the left and walk to its end. Stop there to hear about a tall, vertical panel just ahead of you.</p>",

It is under the shade of Monterrey cypress.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: The wayside overlooks lower Fort Mason. It is composed of a large accessible parking lot, five landmark buildings labeled A through E, and three piers with large warehouse buildings. The three piers are: Pier 1, Pier 2 or the Herbst Pavilion, and Pier 3 or the Festival Pavilion. All of the buildings are cream colored with red roofs. Red staircases allow access the second and third stories of the pier buildings. Large, garage-like doors allow for ease of loading and assembly. In the distance, there is a view of Crissy Field, the Presidio, and the Golden Gate Bridge. There is a sign that says Fort Mason Center and points directly ahead, down a steep set of stairs that are to your right. The sign reads: Buildings A through E, Pavilions slash Piers 1 through 3, and Programs and Events. There is a trashcan and recycle bin a few feet to your left. The asphalt path continues on in this direction towards the Great Meadow. Behind you, there is a view of the Madonna Statue by Benny Bufano. \"Madonna\"<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF SCULPTURE: The sculpture is made from smooth granite. The figure is tall and straight, with no defined arms or legs. The face is not very detailed, but is characterized by large oval eyes, a thin nose with a sharp bridge and upturned lips forming a subtle smile. Her head is covered by a shape that may represent hair or a hood that comes down from the crown of the head to her shoulders, and melds into her back. At the base of the sculpture is a second figure made of mosaic tiles laid into the base of the Madonna. The mosaic figure is a child, much smaller than the Madonna, and only shown from the chest up. The child has dark brown hair that goes past the shoulders, and four eyes arranged in two vertical rows. The top half of the figure's face is divided by color in two quarter sections, colored purple and gold. Two hands, one darker than the other, rest on the child's shoulders. The child is wearing a white tunic with a blue broach.<br /> <br /> TEXT: A Stepping Off Point for a New Pacific Empire<br /> <br /> TEXT: United States interests expanded into the Pacific after annexing new territories in the Spanish American War of 1898. Fort Mason's mission shifted from defending against enemy ships to sending military ships overseas to new acquisitions like Hawaii, Guam and the Philippine Islands. By 1915, Fort Mason was the army's main depot for shipping troops and supplies to these new Pacific colonial possessions.<br /> <br /> In 1932, the military transport operation at lower Fort Mason and several other Bay Area ports was named San Francisco Port of Embarkation (S F P E). The S F P E grew from 830 personnel in 1939 to over 30,000 employees in 1945, when they shipped more than 23 million tons of cargo and 1.65 million soldiers. These transport operations played a crucial role in the Pacific Theater war effort.<br /> <br /> As a world power, what role should the U S play in global affairs?<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black-and-white photo of lower Fort Mason is to the right-hand side of the text. Dated 1930, it features large shipping vessels docked on either side of Fort Mason's piers. Dense and bustling, San Franciscan buildings extend over the ridgeline in the background.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The story of Fort Mason's port is the story of America's emergence as a world power. The piers and buildings of lower Fort Mason supported overseas operations in the Pacific from 1909 to 1962. The S F P E was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1972.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph of lower Fort Mason in 1920. The walkways are stacked with large shipping crates, and a ship is docked at the port.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph shows five soldiers walking up a ramp and into a small metal opening in a ship. They wear army helmets, and their backs are saddled with large sacks. The photograph is dated 1940.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A black and white photograph is of military personnel in 1943. Women stand in a line at Fort Mason's parade grounds and hold their arms up in salute to the American flag. Some men with instruments stand near them and face the flag.<br /> <br /> SIDEBAR: The Port Today.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE: A photo of a woman standing in lower fort Mason. She wears a microphone headset, a pink jacket, and large gold sunglasses. She is holding a pink sculpture in her left hand.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Today, lower Fort Mason has been converted into a nonprofit cultural center. A park partner of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Fort Mason Center for Arts and Culture houses dozens of art organizations and presents adventurous and engaging art exhibitions.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTON OF IMAGE: A photo of a woman dressed in white is below this text. She looks at a white wall, where sketches of purple fish are being projected. Portions of the sketches are projected onto her as well.<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Continue straight and slightly downhill on the asphalt path for 215 feet. The next wayside will be on your right-hand side.</p>",

It feeds the soul and provides a recreational playground for locals and globe travelers alike. But the very ocean we enjoy here threatens the existence of this beach and promenade. Earth's warming temperatures-mostly caused by human actions like burning fossil fuels-melt glaciers and make sea water expand. Rising seas will submerge our seaside retreat. Should we reduce carbon emissions or build levees?<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: The background image is a photograph of the San Francisco Bay Trail on a sunny day with many visitors walking east and west along the edge of Crissy Field and the bay. The southern tower of the Golden Gate Bridge is prominently featured in the background, with the cables and road span stretching to the north over the water. Further in the background are the hills of the Marin Headlands.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: Superimposed on this background photo is another photo of the Golden Gate Bridge, taken from the perspective of the waterfront near the entrance of Fort Point. In the photo, gray clouds loom and frothy waves crash onto the shore in front of a chain fence.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Storm waves already crash over the sea wall to the west. As sea waters rise, storm surge and swells get bigger.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #3: At the bottom center of the panel is another superimposed photo, showing a small bird, a snowy plover. It has a brown head and wings, and its breast, tail bottom and space just over its eye are white.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Snowy plover. The beach offers snowy plovers a life-saving food-and-rest stop.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF CHART: On the right side of the panel is a vertical chart that measures sea level. The chart shows an illustration of a pole, with different heights from 0 feet to 16 feet, marked and annotated.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Measure for Sea Level. This pole marks projected sea level and storm surge to show how rising waters affect your recreation and migrating birds. Projections are from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2013.<br /> <br /> 0 feet: Average high tide in 2009<br /> <br /> 3 feet: Projected high tide in 2100, elevation of plover resting area<br /> <br /> 4 feet: Current storm surge plus wave pile-up<br /> <br /> 7 feet: Projected high tide in 2100 plus storm surge, elevation of promenade<br /> <br /> 12 feet: Projected high tide in 2300<br /> <br /> 16 feet: Projected high tide in 2300, plus storm surge<br /> <br /> DIRECTIONS TO NEXT WAYSIDE: Walk west 350 feet and you'll arrive at the next wayside on the southern side of the trail.</p>",

He would tell you they are the worst men for fighting you ever saw. The New York boys run from us. We have come out ahead in every scrap so far, but when we first moved to the Presidio where we are now situated some of them made the remark they were going to throw us in the bay when they caught us out, but it is the other way now.<br /> <br /> This morning when I got up some one says catch that negro and about four hundred men started after a negro. He had hit one of our men with a pair of brass knuckles and run you might say for his life, for I tell you, the boys who chased him tried to kill him, some one struck him in the head with a rock while others trying to cut him with knives, but Major Cheatham came in time with the guards to keep off the crowd, but if he had been five minutes later the negro would have been cut all to pieces. It looks like this regiment has to have somebody to fight any way, but we still have some hope of going to Manila.</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The near-lynching of the African American by the Tennessee regiment warranted a full page spread in the San Francisco Call newspaper on August 16, 1898,<br /> <br /> <em>Soldiers of Tennessee Mob a Negro, Drunken Row Almost Results in a Murder</em><br /> <br /> The trouble began on Baker Street, between Filbert and Greenwich. The victim Dan Thomas reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I was on my way back from Dwyer's saloon, on the corner of Filbert and Baker streets, where I had been delivering some crabs, when two soldiers stopped me. One of them asked for a chew of tobacco and the other for a dime. I told them I had no tobacco and no dime, and then one of them hit me. I hit back and then I ran home as fast as I could, a lot of soldiers following me. I told my brother and mother they were after me to kill me, and then I climbed up into the garret. I heard them come into the house, and I stayed where I was until an officer told me it was safe to come down.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> Major Cheatham of the Tennessee Volunteers, who took a prominent part in the rescue, and who undoubtedly saved Thomas from death, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I was sitting in the mess tent this morning about 7:30 when I saw a number of men running down the road from our camp. I asked one of our men what the trouble was, and he said that one of our regiment had been killed by a negro and that the crowd was after him. I quickened my pace toward the entrance to the reservation, and just as I arrived I saw a large crowd running down the hill. I ran to the house where the men were gathered. I jumped the fence and entered the back door and ran up the stairs. There I found soldiers pulling a man through a hole in the ceiling. I drew a revolver and ordered the men to stop, saying that I would shoot, and they immediately obeyed me. I took the negro in charge, appointed guards over him, taking the very two men who were closest upon him for this purpose, and we brought him back to camp.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> General Miller's indignation at the barbarous treatment of the negro knew no bounds. The general said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The negro did not use brass knuckles on the soldier, but he did very good service with his fist-just about what the soldier deserved: and the whole company, or what amounted to a company in numbers of Tennesseans and Iowans who attacked him afterwards. I had him placed in the post guardhouse, and if any attempt had been made to take him back, as I hear was contemplated, the perpetrators would have met with a warm reception from the Washington guard. A soldier on duty can use his gun. I placed the negro this afternoon among his friends, and no one need know where that is.\"</p> </blockquote>",

Directly overlooking the wayside, the flat, scrubby grassland can be seen in the distance. Behind where you are standing are two benches, both facing the flat grassland. Turning to face the benches, the vast expanse of the rolling hillside can be seen in the distance. The hillside is mostly bare, filled with grasses and scattered with a few trees. Depending on the time of year, the land can be filled with brightly colored wildflowers. In the dry, winter season, the landscape is typically filled with the greens and browns of the grasses and evergreens.<br /> <br /> WAYSIDE LAYOUT: Rectangular wayside with three columns. The first column has text and 1 image. The second column has 2 images, oriented one above the other. The third column has 1 image with a quote below it<br />  </p> <h3>Column 1</h3> <p>TEXT: A Rollicking Past - Mori's Point Inn - In the late 1800's, Stefano Mori and his family arrived from Italy and farmed this land, grazing cattle and horses. They built a rambling 21-room farmhouse. This became Mori's Point Inn, a haven for travelers, bootleggers and diners. Mori's was an oasis on the long road between San Francisco and Half Moon Bay. During Prohibition in the 1920's, Stefano's son Jack turned the inn into a speakeasy, running Canadian whiskey from the smugglers' ships off the point. Federal agents arrested Jack Mori and confiscated thousands of cases of whiskey from his farm in 1923. Stefano's younger son, Ray, and his wife, Marie, rescued the roadhouse in 1932 and revived it as a restaurant, hotel and dancehall. It kept its' lively reputation until 1965, when Mori's Inn burned to the ground.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: Located at the bottom of the first column on the left side of the wayside. Black and white editorial style cartoon. The image is of Mori Point, a cliff overlooking down the beach and water below. There are 5 men on the left side, only their heads peeking over a cliff down to the beach. One of the men appears to be a police officer and another is holding a flashlight, aimed towards the beach. On the beach, there is a man on a small boat, unloading boxes. He is handing the box to a man on the shore, who is loading it into the back of a moving truck. A man in the truck is wearing a dark hat and dark glasses.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: \"People...can recall an auto engine with attached winch which was permanently stationed on the beach and used to tow a skiff back and forth between the beach and anchored rumrunners' boats.\" - Bill Drake, Editor, Pacifica Tribune.</p> <h3>Column 2</h3> <p>DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: Located at the top of the second column. Black and white, rectangular photograph of Mori's Point in. The building is two stories and shown from the end. The end of the building has a porch wrapping around the corner, ending about halfway down the length of the building. Parked in front of the building are two older model cars.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Mori's Point Inn, 1952.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #3: Located at the bottom of the second column. Black and white, rectangular photograph of Mori's Point Inn from the point, looking inland. The Inn sits atop a cliff on the right side of the image, overlooking the waves crashing below on the left. In the distance, there is a small pond with a river flowing from it, stretching down the image to where it meets the crashing waves at the beach. Trees can be seen scattered across the landscape in the background.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Mori's Point Inn, 1955. Looking eastward at Mori's Point Inn from the Point. A gap in the dunes permitted overflow from the Horse Stable pond to reach the ocean. Much of the beach has since eroded away.</p> <h3>Column 3</h3> <p>DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #4: Located in the third column, far right side of the wayside. Colored photograph, tall rectangular photograph of Mori Point as it looks today. The image is looking up the coast from Mori Point, in the foreground are bright yellow wildflowers in bloom surrounded by lush green grass. In the distance, the steep cliffs are overlooking the waves crashing below on the beach. The sky is mostly covered with gray clouds but the sunshine is beaming in from the right of the image, over the ocean.<br /> <br /> QUOTE: \"Before dinner we not only visited the garden where vegetables and herbs are raised for their use and chickens for the table, but we went for a hike over Mori's Point. We enjoyed the music of the dashing sea as it broke against the rocks where mussels are caught.\" - San Francisco News, 1937</p>",

Now, in addition to the soldiers stationed here to defend San Francisco Harbor and the west coast, the post took on responsibilities for staging the operations in the Philippines and elsewhere in the Pacific. In April 1900, Presidio post commander briefed his superiors on the Presidio's activities since the beginning of the war:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Presidio has become the most important post in the U.S. Army, forming a defense of the Golden Gate with fifty-two modern defense guns and mortars. The Presidio garrison amounts to upwards of 1,000 men. The post processes all the regulars and volunteers going to the Philippine Islands. It handles recruits, furloughed soldiers, and discharged men. All the sick returning from the Pacific pass through the reservation, and the remains of deceased soldiers are received here. In addition, animals destined for the far Pacific are handled at the post.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> With the increase in troops at the Presidio, overcrowding became a real problem, not only for the enlisted men, many of whom were camping in tents, but also for the officers. In 1901 the San Francisco Call had this account of activities at the Presidio:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Presidio presents an animated scene since the return of the volunteers commenced and the issuance of orders calling for the organization of new regiments. There are at present quartered on the military reservation more than 7000 men, exclusive of the 600 patients in the general hospital. Within the next few days 2300 men will leave for Manila, but their places will-be filled by the incoming recruits and returning regiments.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The same year, post commander Colonel Rawles reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A captain in Texas who has orders for the Philippines has asked for quarters for his family, but I answered no and suggested he apply to Benicia Barracks. Even the chaplain has complained that the post chapel is too crowded and has requested the construction of a larger chapel.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The arrival of newly assigned officers produced a kind of musical chairs at the post. In 1904 the San Francisco Call reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The arrival of Colonel Edward A. Godwin, Ninth Cavalry, has raised a great commotion at the Presidio. His rank entitles him to select any quarters except those of the commanding officer of the post. His eye lighted on the beautiful grounds and commodious home of Major Stephenson, so the major was politely requested to seek other quarters. As Major Stephenson has his two sisters visiting him and desires to entertain in their behalf, he will naturally choose the next best quarters in the line, which will oust a captain, and this will result in a grand change all down the line. Things will be merry in the moving line next week.\"</p> </blockquote>",

Bird life and enviable views of the city make the Agave Trail a great alternative or addition to the main tour. The trail is open when the birds are not nesting, typically from about mid October to mid January.</p> <h3>Naming Alcatraz</h3> <p>The origin of the name \"Alcatraz\" is debated, but is often attributed as a derivative of a name given by 18th century explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala, \"Alcatraces,\" meaning \"pelicans\" or \"seabird.\" The name is fitting, given the number of birds that call the island home. It's interesting to note that the original name the US Army gave to the island was \"the post on Alcatraces.\"</p> <h3>Bird friends</h3> <p>Alcatraz Island is a prime destination for seabirds including Brandt's cormorants and pigeon guillemots. The bluffs on the island provide habitat where these species can safely nest. These bird friends mostly feed in the open ocean and San Francisco Bay and have a taste for small fish.<br /> <br /> But the good life these birds enjoy could be in danger. Changes in ocean temperatures, and wind and upwelling patterns are affecting productivity and the distribution of the fish these birds eat. In some recent years, the distribution of anchovies, a favorite snack of cormorants, shifted south, leading to a near complete failure of cormorant nesting at Alcatraz and other nearby nesting areas. Continued climate change is likely to lead to further productivity and food chain disturbances for seabirds.</p>",

When it transferred from military control to the Bureau of Prisons, the cell bars were strengthened to better prevent escapes. The cells remained primitive and lacked privacy.<br /> <br /> African-American prisoners were segregated from the rest of the prison population due to the prevalence of racial prejudice and physical abuse among prisoners. D-Block housed the worst inmates in solitary confinement. In 1972, Alcatraz became part of the newly created Golden Gate National Recreation Area and was opened to the public in 1973.</p> <h3>The Hospital Wing</h3> <p>The hospital began operations when the cell house was completed in 1912 and continued to provide services after Alcatraz became a federal prison. Naturally, the hospital was used to provide medical care to inmates, prison personnel and civilians on the island. In all, the hospital was made up of the recovery wards, doctor's offices and a surgery facility. The hospital was also used to house the infamous Robert \"Birdman\" Stroud to isolate him from inciting and rousing the other inmates.</p>",

Group reservations for 15 or more can be made at 415-438-8361.</span></p> <h4>Military Period</h4> <p>For nearly 80 years, Alcatraz island was the site of the first US fortress and military prison on the West Coast. Beginning when the island was designated as a disciplinary barrack in 1868, most prisoners were US military personnel, but some notable exceptions included southern sympathizers during the Civil War, WWI conscientious objectors and Native Americans.</p> <h4>Bureau of Prisons</h4> <p>In the 1930s, the federal government developed a new type of prison for the nation's most incorrigible bad boys. The facilities at Alcatraz were modernized to become a maximum-security, minimum-privilege penitentiary specially designed for inmates that other prisons couldn't contain or control. During its 29 years of operation from 1934-1963, more than 1,500 convicts were incarcerated here.</p> <h4>We Hold the Rock</h4> <p>From November 1969 through June 1971, Alcatraz was taken over by Native American activists who called themselves Indians of All Tribes. The protest drew attention to the plight of native peoples across the US. Many lived in severe poverty on reservation land and faced serious discrimination from the greater US. The activists, many of whom were students who'd relocated to the Bay Area, selected Alcatraz for the occupation because it was surplus government land. It also had the distinct practical advantage of being difficult for federal authorities to access.<br /> <br /> The dramatic nature of the occupation was effective in capturing national attention, especially since it was an on-going action that dominated TV news for several months. The takeover resulted in a series of federal reforms with regard to the treatment of American Indians.<br /> <br /> According to the architects, the most significant impact of the occupation was to galvanize the reconnection of Native Americans to their cultural roots. The activists who first arrived on Alcatraz called for a pan-Native occupation, inviting any and all native people to join them on the island, which is exactly what happened. All the activists lived communally, some for the entirety of the occupation. In this way, a community formed that gave rise to personal bonds and cultural exploration that lasted long after the occupation was over.<br /> <br /> The success or failure of the occupation should not be judged by whether the demands of the occupiers were realized. The underlying goals of the American Indians on Alcatraz were to awaken the American public to the reality of the plight of the first Americans and to assert the need for American Indian self-determination. As a result of the occupation, the official government policy of termination of tribes was ended and a policy of American Indian self-determination became the official US government policy. Alcatraz may have been lost, but the occupation gave birth to a political movement which continues today.</p> <h4>From prison to tourist attraction</h4> <p>In 1972, Alcatraz was added to the newly created Golden Gate National Recreation Area and was opened to the public in 1973 as a historical landmark.</p>",

Many different seabird species, including Brandt’s and pelagic cormorants and <b>pigeon guillemots</b>, breed on Alcatraz Island.<br /> <br /> As the climate changes, California’s seabirds will be stressed by disturbances in their food supply. The timing and intensity of upwelling, which moves nutrients into shallow coastal waters, is changing as the ocean absorbs more heat from the atmosphere. The seabirds’ prey fish rely on upwelling and associated plankton blooms. Changes in the timing and intensity of these events can disrupt food availability during the birds’ critical breeding season and ultimately impact survival of their offspring.",

The Golden Gate National Recreation Area has taken these challenges head-on and developed several ways to improve efficiency and limit energy expenditure. Be it water usage, garbage management or carbon emissions from electricity production or transportation, we are addressing the problems.</p> <h3>Hybrid Ferries</h3> <p>The Alcatraz Cruises runs future-forward ferries powered by a combination of solar, wind and diesel power to get visitors to and from Alcatraz and Angel Island and back to San Francisco.</p> <h3>Waste Management</h3> <p>Garbage and sewage are shuttled back to the mainland to keep Alcatraz from getting too stimulating to the olfactories. The park, along with Alcatraz Cruises, is committed to keeping waste from Alcatraz out of landfills. After returning to the mainland, workers separate recyclable and compostable materials.</p> <h3>Alternative Power Source</h3> <p>Alcatraz has no electrical or water lines from the mainland. Drinking water and diesel fuel for electric generators must be ferried to the island. These inefficiencies raise the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions Alcatraz puts out, which is why the NPS has found some creative ways to reduce Alcatraz's carbon footprint.<br /> <br /> The buildings on Alcatraz are fitted with solar panels and a battery system that lowers its carbon dioxide emissions. In 2013, solar power reduced the island's fuel usage by an estimated 32,000 gallons and kept 325 Metric Tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere. Go planet!</p> <h3>The Ins and Outs of Solar Power</h3> <p>When it's sunny out, 959 solar panels on the cellhouse roof power the entire island. Any extra electrical juice that comes through charges a bank of batteries located in the old power house. The batteries store energy to boost the electrical system when the sun isn't enough. The power house is also equipped with diesel generators that can power the island if all the other juice runs low and then put any extra energy back into the battery bank.</p> <h3>Smart Water</h3> <p>Alcatraz needs water for drinking, irrigation and maintaining the island's sewage system. To cut down on bringing water to the island, the gardens are irrigated with captured rainwater, and the toilets are flushed with saltwater. Currently, desalinization and on-site sewage treatment are under study, and may further reduce the need to transport water and sewage.</p>",

That facility was used to house unruly soldiers and during the Civil War, Confederate spies. The guardhouse featured a sally port, an armored, controlled entryway to the fortress on Alcatraz beyond.</p> <h3>Hopi Prisoners</h3> <p>In 1894, 19 Hopi men were arrested by federal troops in Arizona as part of a US policy of using incarceration to intimidate Native Americans who resisted assimilation. The Hopi men were part of a group who refused to send their children to government boarding schools and other disputes with US authorities. They were taken from their homes and kept in the army prison on Alcatraz for a year before their release in September 1895.<br /> <br /> <br /> Besides being forcibly removed from their homes and families for the 'crime' of defending their culture, the Hopi prisoners lived in dangerous, unsanitary conditions on Alcatraz. During the day, they were made to cut large logs into smaller sections. Their hardship was downplayed by newspapers and their captors, who referred to their forced removal as \"rude.\" Two of the men's wives gave birth to children who died while the men were imprisoned.</p> <h3>Restoring the guardhouse and sally port</h3> <p>The National Park Service completed major repairs to the guardhouse, with special attention paid to improving the structure's ability to withstand earthquakes. The boathouse, added in the 1920s, was removed so that visitors could see and pass through the original sally port entrance constructed in 1857.<br /> <br /> Any construction projects on Alcatraz are complicated because supplies and water must be ferried to the island. The guardhouse repairs were especially challenging because the work had to be performed alongside the island's daily visitors, who traveled through the actual construction site. Delivery of the building materials was carefully coordinated around visitor arrival and departure times and the breeding seasons of the island's bird population.<br /> <br /> Certified hazardous material contractors removed the building's unsafe lead paint and repainted the building with environmentally friendly paint that would stand up to the harsh marine environment. The NPS rehabilitated special historic guardhouse features, including the defensive dry moat, the cannon port \"embrasure\" and the lower prison room.<br /> <br /> The 1920s boathouse addition was removed so that visitors could better understand and experience the guardhouse and sally port entranceway as it was originally constructed.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Baker Beach is accessible by two parking lots. The first is located along Gibson Road, the other, which has a view of the Golden Gate Bridge and is next to Battery Chamberlin, can be reached by turning right onto Battery Chamberlin Road at the intersection with Gibson Road.<br /><br />As you head towards the second parking lot at the end of Battery Chamberlin Road, the way is lined with picnic tables and barbecues along the road's right hand side. The barbecues and benches are set far back from the roadside under cover of cypress and pine trees in sandy soil. Each area has bins for trash and recycling.<br /><br />As you enter the parking lot at Battery Chamberlin, you'll see the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. The parking lot is large, with spaces along the entire perimeter, and a section in the middle for additional parking. The bathrooms, trash and recycling are on your right as you enter. A trash bin as well as the housing for a beach access wheelchair are both to the right of the entrance to Battery Chamberlin at the far end of the parking lot.<br /><br />Past the bathrooms on the right hand side of the parking lot, is another picnic area. Tables and trash bins are located along a loop in the dark sand amidst coastal scrub.<br /><br />The beach is a sandy shore a good ways lower down from the parking lot, with views of the Golden Gate Bridge, rocky cliffs and across the Golden Gate, the brown and green peaks of the Marin Headlands. The beach is accessible from both parking lots by a short series of sand-covered wood stairs.<br /><br />The entrance to Battery Chamberlin at the far end of the parking lot starts off sandy, but quickly turns to concrete. The entrance is surrounded by an eight foot tall chain link fence. The battery houses a 6-inch rifled gun mounted on the only still functional \"disappearing carriage.\" The rifle is housed inside a concrete wall, shielding the gun from view where it sits on top of a raised concrete platform five feet off the ground. A short concrete staircase along the inside edge of the wall provides access to the gun, which sits in the center of the circular platform. A second staircase gives access to the top of the wall, or parapet.<br /><br />The gun barrel is steel and painted a gun-metal gray. The barrel is a long, thin cylinder sitting on top of a circular mount with disappearing carriage that is painted olive drab. The carriage rotates and pivots the gun's position. A short ladder attached to the carriage gives access to the steering wheel controls used to aim the gun.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Battery Chamberlin is named in honor of Captain Lowell A. Chamberlin, First Artillery, who served with distinction in the Civil War and continued as an artillery officer until his death at the Presidio in 1889. This Endicott-era battery was completed and armed in 1904 with four six-inch guns mounted on disappearing carriages. The battery was built to protect underwater minefields laid outside the Golden Gate during the time of war. These guns had a range of nine miles and could fire at the rate of two rounds per minute.<br /> <br /> The original guns were dismounted in 1917 for use in World War I, but the battery was modified to receive two six-inch guns on simple barbette carriages in 1920. During World War II, the Sixth Coast Artillery (Harbor Defense) Regiment, Battery \"D,\" manned the two guns at Battery Chamberlin, which were placed under camouflage netting to hide them from potential air attack. In 1948, the Coast Artillery Corps was deactivated, the battery disarmed and the guns scrapped during \"Operation Blowtorch.\"<br /> <br /> In 1977, the National Park Service received the Six-Inch Rifle Gun Number Nine and disappearing carriage, listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places, from the Smithsonian Institution. The gun and carriage were installed at gun emplacement Number Four at Battery Chamberlin, and are the same type as initially used here before World War I. An underground cartridge room also is open for inspection and contains photos and small exhibits on the coastal defenses of San Francisco.<br /> <br /> Battery Chamberlin, part of the Presidio of San Francisco and a National Historic Landmark, is administered by the National Park Service's Golden Gate National Recreation Area. It is located at the north end of Baker Beach along the western shoreline facing San Francisco Bay in San Francisco. <br /> <br /> <em>Visit Battery Chamberlin's small, on-site museum, and take part in loading demonstrations between 11AM - 3PM on the first full weekend of the month.</em><br /> <br /> <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-80f82afa-7fff-e565-36be-ec9b53ac67f9\">Discover more history and culture by visiting the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/subjects/travelbayareawwii/index.htm\">World War II in San Francisco Bay Area travel itinerary. </a></b></p>",

There was Battery Davis, the southern 16-inch gun counterpart to Battery Townsley across the Golden Gate, not to mention 86 new-fangled temporary barracks and other buildings that by 1942, were deemed obsolete. At the close of the war, the batteries were also behind the times and the post was demolished except for a few straggler buildings.<br /> <br /> Battery Bruff was declared obsolete just six months after it came under the jurisdiction of the Coast Artillery Corps, making it the shortest-lived battery in all the San Francisco Bay defenses. Built to be a temporary structure, Battery Howe held out until 1945 outlasting many \"permanent\" mortar batteries.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Directly off of Conzelman Road, Battery Spencer is a hotspot destination for Bay Area tourists and locals alike. There's parking at the battery, but it's limited, so be prepared to park either further up Conzelman, or in the lot below on busy days. From the parking lot, you'll first encounter an open plaza area made of loose gravel where there are trash and recycling bins as well as a row of upside down U-shaped posts for locking bikes. <br /><br />Following the gravel trail past the plaza takes you past the first battery building on the right, which is now a restroom facility. A little ways past the bathrooms, the path forks in two directions. Going right will take you through the battery itself, a network of rooms bordering a large, open area in the center. Going left will take you on a slightly elevated path away from the batter, overlooking the famous view of the Golden Gate Bridge. From this exposed point, the winds coming off the bay are intense. <br /><br />The trail leads you out to the bluff edge, from where you can see the high-vaulted north tower up close, and the thick suspension cables swooping down from the bridge's highest point in a semi-circular arc down close to the cars and pedestrians crossing north and south below. Smaller support cables run in parallel, vertical columns in equidistant increments along the entire length of the bridge, connecting the suspension cables to the roadbed. The detail of the art-deco tower, with its four rectangular window-like cut outs and iconic color, international orange, a sort of earthy-red tone, can be admired with greater clarity from this vantage than anywhere in San Francisco. On clear days, you can see far into the city from Battery Spencer, as well as the shipping lanes in and out of the bay. <br /><br />From the bluff, you can access the battery by turning away from the water and going down one of several flights of stairs. You can walk around the battery's first level, mostly a large, open space, or climb up to the second level. The building is mostly army green, though the paint is worn and peeling in places.",

It's well worth it for the history lesson and views of Rodeo Beach and the Pacific Ocean.<br /> <br /> <br /> Battery Townsley is one of only two WWII era batteries in the San Francisco area that contained mammoth 16-inch guns. The other is located at Fort Funston, also in the park. Together these guns protected an area from Half Moon Bay to Point Reyes, effectively covering the entire sea approach to San Francisco.<br /> <br /> <br /> The army installed these big naval guns to match those on battleships sailing the Pacific in the late 1930s. In the year following Pearl Harbor, 150 men lived inside this cavernous fortress twenty-four seven. Today you can visit the exhibits inside during open hours. It's a steep climb up the road to Battery Townsley, but worth it for the history lesson and views of Rodeo Beach and the Pacific Ocean.</p> <h4>The Zenith of American Military Technology</h4> <p>This battery, named in honor of WWI Major General Clarence P. Townsley, represented the zenith of American military technology and became the prototype for subsequent coastal defense batteries. As early as 1915, the army considered mounting the 16-inch guns to protect San Francisco, and by 1928, the War Department made the decision to construct two batteries, one on each side of the Golden Gate straits. Battery Townsley at Fort Cronkhite in Marin was finished first, followed several months later by Battery Davis at Fort Funston.</p> <h4>16-inch Gun</h4> <p>16-inch guns were sixty-eight feet long and could fire a 2,000-pound projectile almost twenty-five miles. The gun tube posted here outside the battery was originally mounted in one of the forward gun turrets aboard the battleship USS Missouri and saw extensive action during World War II. It's identical to the two guns that were mounted here during World War II.</p> <h4>Obsolescence</h4> <p>The growing threat of long-range bombers and nuclear weapons made Battery Townsley obsolete at the end of World War II. Its long-range guns, designed to shoot at battleships far at sea, were useless against enemy aircraft. The big guns were scrapped in late 1948, and the battery converted to use as a warehouse, temporary barracks, and underground test facility. Sealed for many years, the National Park Service began restoration work in 2006. Work continues to this day, carried out by a group of dedicated Volunteers in Parks (VIPs).</p>",

Today, it's an ideal spot for a picnic with barbecues and picnic tables on-site, and great views of the San Francisco Bay and Golden Gate Bridge beneath the shade of tall, dark green Monterey cypresses. There is ample parking and a bathroom facility with recycling and trash bins adjacent to the parking area. <br /><br />The picnic area is a short walk across a road to Battery Wallace, a cement structure built into the landscape. A cement passageway cuts through a hillside covered in tree litter, with the words \"BATTERY WALLACE, 1942\" etched into the concrete overpass just as you proceed through the passageway under the hill. The passageway leads to a circular room with a cement floor and walls. There's no concrete at the very center of the room's floor. Instead, there's a circle of bare ground with patchy clumps of grass growing intermittently throughout. Instead of a wall along the far side of the room, there's a trapezoid-shaped opening that leads out to the hillside. On the opposite ridge, a two-level, rectangular structure is visible at about the same elevation as Battery Wallace. <br /><br />The picnic area is a short walk across a road to Battery Wallace, a cement structure built into the landscape.

    "bodyText": "<p>Compared to other batteries in the region, Battery Yates held relatively small, 3-inch diameter rapid fire rifles, used to protect the bay entrance. In the event of a foreign attack, its guns could fire up to 30 shots per minute at fast moving enemy torpedo boats. During World War II, the guns protected an anti-submarine net that spanned the entrance to the bay.</p> <h3>Lime Point</h3> <p>In the mid-1800s, the US Army wanted to build a fort to match Fort Point on the north end of the San Francisco Bay. This was to be at Lime Point, and it was to be built roughly where the north tower of the Golden Gate Bridge stands today. In order to build upon the rock outcropping that stood separate from Marin, the plans called for heavy blasting to level the surface of the rock. This proved too difficult and the plans were abandoned. The army decided to forgo their brick fort defense designs altogether, in favor of a more modern defense: a network of batteries.</p> <h3>The Great White Fleet</h3> <p>On May 6th, 1908, some 200,000 people came out to the hills of the Marin Headlands to watch as the Great White Fleet pulled into the San Francisco Bay. A showy display of military strength, the fleet was something akin to the Blue Angels of today. The US naval battle fleet stopped here on its circumnavigation of the globe on the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, to demonstrate American military might.</p> <h3>Mission Blue Butterflies</h3> <p>Mission blues are just little guys. Adults are about the size of a quarter, and larvae are so small that they're rarely seen. These little beauties look a little different depending on if they're guys or gals. Females have brown and some blue coloration on the upper side of their wings. Males are light blue. Both have dark edges around their wings. The underside of their wings are off-white with two rows of irregularly shaped black spots.<br /> <br /> Mission blues require a host plant and nectar in coastal grassland habitat to survive. The host plants utilized by the Mission blue are several varieties of lupine. Nectar plants include various composites that grow in association with the lupines.<br /> <br /> Their sensitivity to habitat and diet in addition to human impact on their environment has made mission blues endangered. Remaining populations are found in only a few locations around the San Francisco Bay Area, the Marin Headlands, Skyline Ridge in San Mateo County and San Bruno Mountain.</p> <h3>Ants and Butterflies: A Dynamic Duo</h3> <p>Mission blue larvae produce a sugary solution that's super-irresistible to native ant species. Because of their uncontrollable sweet tooth's, the ants voluntarily tend to the larvae in return for feeding off their sweetness. While in their care, the ants protect the larvae from predators.</p> <h3>Monarch Butterflies</h3> <p>Monarchs are famous nomads. Every fall, a new generation of travelers are born. Like one big, happy family, they migrate from areas as far north as the East Coast of Canada several million strong, all the way to central Mexico. It may take five or six generations for the butterflies to return all the way to their summer homes. They're the only butterflies that make such a massive journey, up to 3,000 miles.<br /> <br /> The monarchs that migrate here to overwinter in the mild Pacific Coast temperatures come from west of the Rocky Mountains and generally have a less arduous journey. They're extremely recognizable with their orange and black wing patterns and sometimes congregate in large groups, mainly on the branches of eucalyptus trees at Fort Baker and other spots along the California coast.</p>",

At the base of the sculpture is a second figure made of mosaic tiles laid into the base of the Madonna. The mosaic figure is a child, much smaller than the Madonna, and only shown from the chest up. The child has dark brown hair that goes past the shoulders, and four eyes arranged in two vertical rows. The top half of the figure's face is divided by color in two quarter sections, colored purple and gold. Two hands, one darker than the other, rest on the child's shoulders. The child is wearing a white tunic with a blue broach.<br />",

The Rodman cannons stationed here were San Francisco's last line of coastal defense against enemy ships entering the bay for over a century.</p> <h4>The Abolitionists of Black Point</h4> <p>In the absence of army authority, a rather interesting community of educated, well-to-do private citizens including the leader of the Bear Flag Revolt, John C. Fremont, moved into the private homes at Point San Jose. It wasn't their education or their wealth that made them interesting, but their forward thinking philosophy and activist roots: they were all abolitionists, dedicated to ending US slavery. For the next few years, the Black Point community became a center for political and social dialogue. With the outbreak of the Civil War, the army reclaimed the land and constructed a proper military fort here.</p> <h4>Dueling Ideologies</h4> <p>The community of Black Point staunchly supported California Senator and \"Free Soiler\" Democrat David Broderick for his progressive beliefs. The outspoken Broderick managed to get elected on his anti-slavery platform in a time when the issue was divisive, but it cost him a friendship with fellow politician and one-time Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court, David Terry.<br /> Not only did the friendship sour, but because Terry made some rather strong statements concerning Broderick's character and claimed that Broderick's election to the Senate contributed to Terry losing his own re-election campaign, things went from bad to worse to awful. Terry challenged Broderick to a duel at Lake Merced south of the city, and Broderick accepted.<br /> The two men chose pistols to settle their affair. Broderick's misfired into the ground before the official count was over, giving Terry the right at a free shot, which found its target in Broderick's lung. Two days later, Broderick succumbed to his wound at his friend Haskell's Black Point home, where he was heard to say he'd been killed for his support of freedom and accountable government.</p> <h4>A Spooky Discovery</h4> <p>Right around Halloween in 2010, archaeological monitoring near the hostel at Fort Mason led to an excavation and discovery of a pit filled with human bones. 1,400 human bones to be exact, enough for about 20 bodies, all stacked by type. Research is on-going, though a leading theory about the remains ties them to the Point San Jose hospital in the 1860s, where a Dr. Edwin Bentley is thought to have used the bones to teach medical students about causes of death.</p>",

Bolinas Ridge runs north-northwest to south-southeast with Olema Valley and Inverness Ridge to the west, and Lagunitas Valley and ridges and hills to the east. At the ridge crest is the Bolinas Ridge Trailhead, with a wide trail ascending to the south through grasslands. At the trailhead, the shoulder on the south side of the road widens from about 300 feet (90 meters), providing space for about 15 vehicles to park. About 500 feet (150 meters) to the west of the trailhead, the shoulder on the north side of the road widens from about 200 feet (60 meters), providing space for about 10 vehicles to park. A fence made of wooden and steel posts and barbed wire lines the road. At the entrance of the trail there is a wooden fence that forms a two-foot-wide, L-shaped chute. There is a brown sign with the National Park Service arrowhead logo, and icons that indicate the following: no camping, dogs allowed, no fires.",

Mori Point is one of the few places in the San Francisco area where limestone occurs in industrial quantities. Mori's limestone has always been of interest to people living in the area. Archaeological evidence shows the native Ohlone people quarried the white rock for construction, decoration and trade. Beginning in 1776, the Spanish used Indian labor to quarry Mori's limestone in building construction at the Presidio and Mission. Soldiers also used the lime in the pits to make whitewash for Presidio structures.<br /> <br /> After the US takeover, the quarries were mostly idle until reconstruction started after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. Later in the century, World War II needs created a need to reinvigorate quarry activity. By the 1980s, the quarries were shutting down for good, but local scientists became interested in how these isolated limestone blocks had formed.<br /> <br /> Careful study of the marine fossils in the rocks showed the limestone bodies had formed on the shallow tops of submarine volcanoes in the central Pacific. Between about 130 and 80 million years ago, these volcanoes took a ride towards North America on an ocean plate conveyor belt. When they arrived at the continent, the mountain peaks with their white limestone caps became lodged in the side of the continent rather than slipping under it like the rest of the ocean crust.</p>",

In 1907, as the prison population grew, the army renamed the island from Fort Alcatraz to U.S. Military Prison Alcatraz Island. Incarcerated soldiers were forced to tear down the Civil War brick buildings and cannon batteries and construct what you see here today, including this Powerhouse built in 1910 to power a new prison.<br /> <br /> In 1912, when that new 600-cell prison opened atop the island, it was the largest steel-reinforced concrete building in the world. Along with incarcerated soldiers, the new prison held First World War conscientious objectors like Philip Grosser, an anarchist who refused to work and was shackled in an unlit cell below the prison for weeks at a time.<br /> <br /> <em>How would you stand up for what you believe in? </em></p>",

In the early 1900s there were dozens of fresh graves in the sections to your right. The cemetery saw a huge increase of burials at this time; from 48 in 1898, to a peak of 855 in 1901.<br /> <br /> Soldier's bodies were first sent to the U.S. Army Morgue and Office of Identification in Manila. Remains were then shipped to San Francisco, some for further transport to their home communities, others for burial in the national cemetery. The Presidio's flag was lowered to half-staff on days when ships bearing bodies arrived in the harbor.<br /> <br /> The question of where to store the bodies before burial arose in 1899. The first recommendation was to use the dining rooms of the nearly empty the Model Camp. The post commander thought that a poor solution, especially if the press got wind of it. Instead, he designated storage in a large temporary recreation center that the YMCA had erected near the Lombard Gate.<br /> <br /> Volunteers training at the Presidio saw their fallen comrades return. One of the 51st Iowa Infantry regiment wrote this of a military funeral at the Presidio:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A funeral here is a most impressive ceremony. Led by a band playing low solemn music, pall-bearers and an army wagon with the corpse follow; then company officers and comrades of the dead, marching in slow cadence to the military burying ground, where a salute is fired by his mess mates. The band then plays \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" as soldiers stand at parade rest, and officers with hats removed and bowed heads.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> In the summer of 1900, the San Francisco Call reported on the crowding at the national cemetery:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The bodies of 110 men who died in Manila now remain unburied at the Presidio. Every day witnesses the burial of at least twenty, but they arrive almost as fast. Extension of the limits of the cemetery is now a necessity, and a force of men has been at work during the last few days removing the trees to utilize a portion of the national cemetery that is now covered with a growth of timber. To utterly destroy the growth, a charge of powder is placed under the roots and set off. It is expected that the acre of ground covered by the trees will be cleared within the next few weeks, and that the interrupted weekly funeral processions will be resumed. \"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> Several notable figures of the Spanish American and Philippine wars are buried at San Francisco National Cemetery. These include -- Major General William Shafter, commander of the Cuban Campaign during the Spanish American War -- Major General Frederick Funston, Medal of honor recipient and captor and Filipino nationalist leader Emilio Aguinaldo during the Philippine War, and Sgt. William Tompkins, of the African American 10th Cavalry, who received a Medal of honor for bravery and valor in the Spanish American War. These are but a few of the thousands of men buried here who risked and, for some, gave their lives for their country during the Philippine wars. A touch-screen kiosk outside the cemetery office provides grave location information and maps if you want to visit the graves of any of these notable figures.<br /> <br /> The Spanish American and Philippine wars not only altered the lives of the many soldiers that fought in them, but also had a lasting influence on the Presidio and San Francisco as a whole. It was during this period that the post transformed itself from a relatively sleepy duty station to one of the preeminent military installations on the west coast. It was also at this time that the Presidio became a significant part of the San Francisco community, leading up to its full involvement with the City after the 1906 earthquake.</p>",

Consider if you will, the following...<br /> <br /> For openers, coast redwoods (<em>Sequoia sempervirens</em>) can have a base width of 22 feet and grow to a height of 380 feet. They are the tallest living things on Earth! When they start out, they are just little guys. Redwood cones are less than an inch across, with seeds no bigger than a tomato's. Exactly why the redwoods grow so tall is a mystery. Theories continue to develop, but proof remains elusive.</p> <h3>I've Got All My Sisters with Me: Redwood Roots</h3> <p>Aside from logging, the most frequent cause of death for mature redwoods is windfall, because redwood roots only grow 10 to 13 feet below the ground. The roots spread outward 60 to 80 feet and interlace with those of their nearby tree friends. Individually, they are unable to support themselves, but together, they are strong enough to hold each other up.</p>",

Four segregated regiments were quickly created. These units, the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 24th and 25th Infantry, became known as the Buffalo Soldiers. The origin of the moniker is debated, but it likely came from the Cheyenne. Accounts contained in letters talk of the Cheyenne likening the hair of the black soldiers to buffalo fur. The comparison to the buffalo was intended as honorific by the Cheyenne and was received as such by the soldiers.<br /> <br /> After serving in Cuba, the Philippines and Hawaii during the Philippine American and Spanish American wars, the Buffalo Soldiers returned stateside and were garrisoned at the Presidio in San Francisco in 1903.</p> <h3>Colonel Charles Young</h3> <p>During their stay in California, Buffalo Soldiers patrolled Yosemite and Sequoia national parks in the Sierras during summer seasons. Their commanding officer, Colonel Charles Young, earned the distinction of being the first African American Park Superintendent as he led his troops to build roads and trails, and protect and manage the park. This is only one of his many accomplishments. His long and distinguished career as a commissioned officer in the United States Army made him a popular figure of his time and a role model for generations of new leaders.</p>",

It's likely that he raised private funds to construct the chapel through the support of the Presidio officers and the Episcopal Diocese.<br /> <br /> The chapel was open by the time the Confederacy surrendered on April 9, 1865. The death toll of the war was at least 558,000 lives. Five days later President Lincoln was assassinated. News of both these events reached the Presidio on Easter weekend, overwhelming the new chapel.</p>",

Tucked away in a cozy cove between Lands End and Baker Beach in the Sea Cliff neighborhood, you'll find a relaxing place to picnic, catch some rays, and play against the scenic backdrop of the Marin Headlands and Golden Gate Bridge.</p> <h3>Tips for a Day at China Beach</h3> <p>- No pet friends on China Beach, please. Same goes for glass containers and fires.<br /> - Because there are no lifeguards on duty here and surf conditions are unpredictable, swimming is not recommended.<br /> - Avoid the wind as you lounge by taking advantage of the small deck on top of the lifeguard equipment pick-up station.<br /> - In the area above the beach, you'll find grills and picnic tables. They're first come first served, so the early bird gets the worm out here.<br /> - Restrooms are open sunrise to sunset.<br /> <br /> During low tide, a walk from China Beach to Baker Beach will have you spying starfish, anemones and mussels hanging out on the rocky nooks and crannies of the cliffs. But, as with all beach locations within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, be careful in the surf and never turn your back on the ocean.<br /> <br />  </p> <h3>Chinese Immigration During the Gold Rush</h3> <p>Chinese immigrants came to California beginning in 1849, seeking fortunes in the Sierra Nevada gold mines. Despite the US' inclusive rhetoric, the public sentiment and laws were extremely hostile to non-whites. Because they were easily identifiable and willing to work for low wages, Chinese immigrants were more susceptible to discrimination and treated exceptionally poorly. Many returned from the mountains to the San Francisco Bay and established a fishing industry.<br /> <br /> The historical relationship between Chinese fishermen and China Beach is unclear. While we have no clear physical evidence of the beach being used as a campsite, anecdotal evidence points to a Chinese fishermen presence here. Foggy cove conditions aren't suitable for drying shrimp, but the beach may have served as an abalone harvesting site as well as a safe landing just beyond the Golden Gate.<br />  </p> <h3>A Mysterious Name</h3> <p>For a long time, locals have referred to this beach as \"China Beach\" or \"China Cove.\" While the origin of the name is unknown, there have been claims that it referenced Chinese immigrants who arrived in San Francisco during the Gold Rush. Chinese immigrant camps were common, but no evidence points to China Beach as a camp. It's possible the beach was used as a launch site for Chinese fishing vessels.<br /> 19th century politicians benefited from anti-Chinese platforms, including San Francisco Mayor James D. Phelan, for whom China Beach was named from 1933 to 1974. When China Beach came into the park's possession, the original name was restored to honor the popular history of this place.</p> <h3>Developing China Beach</h3> <p>For many years, China Beach was privately owned. In 1929, a local movement encouraged the city to purchase the land, but the plan was unsuccessful. By 1933, the city and state successfully reached a deal, and plans were made to develop China Beach into a public bath. This plan, however, ended in a development disaster, and remained stagnant for decades.<br /> <br /> Not until 1950 did the city start constructing a bath house. By this time the grand vision of the '30s was reduced to a more practical one. Five years later, the China Beach Bath House was finally opened to the public. In 1977, the city transferred the beach to the National Park Service.</p>",

Sutro included the miners in his plans for the tunnel and worked alongside them in dangerous conditions to see the work finished. Once operational, the tunnel drained two million gallons of water a year from the mines. The tunnel was a great success. Despite the decreasing value of the lode over the 1870s, Sutro was able to sell his tunnel for a great fortune, which later became a fortune for the people of San Francisco.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>In the 1930s, the Great Depression loomed over America. In 1933, recently elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt created several new agencies, including the most successful, the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC). Across the country, this program employed tens of thousands of unemployed and unskilled young men from various backgrounds, including: the Junior Enrollees, (young men ages 18 - 26), Reservation Native Americans, local men with forestry experience, and over 25,000 older war veterans. By 1942, over 2.5 million men had served in the CCC. They planted millions of trees, fought forest fires, constructed trails and campground facilities, among many other things. Much of the CCC's work can still be seen throughout the US National Park system, including at Muir Woods National Monument.</p> <h3>How the CCC Reshaped Muir Woods</h3> <p>Muir Woods was designated a national monument in 1908. The public's interest in nature, and the growing availability of private automobiles, increased visitation to Muir Woods National Monument and Mount Tamalpais State Park. San Franciscans came in droves to hike, picnic, and to ride the Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railway. The railway was aptly nicknamed the \"Crookedest Railroad in the World\" because of its 281 curves in 8 miles of track. The rapid increase in visitors required better facilities, and quickly.<br /> <br /> In 1933, over 200 CCC men arrived at Mount Tamalpais State Park to work on improvements in the state park, at Muir Woods, and on the land belonging to the estate of William Kent. Through 1937, the CCC worked on many types of projects, such as fire protection and flood control, trail improvements, bridges, comfort stations, picnic facilities, and improved administration buildings.</p> <h3>Armoring Redwood Creek</h3> <p>The largest project that the CCC undertook at Muir Woods was providing erosion control on Redwood Creek. Redwood Creek meanders through Muir Woods' majestic redwood forest for 1.4 miles (2.3 km) and is prone to flooding, which damages and erodes the surrounding trees and trails. After extensive damage in 1925, William Kent advocated for use of creek \"revetments\" to armor the banks and prevent future flood damage.<br /> <br /> Revetments are structures made of rocks, stones or concrete, called \"riprap,\" that are installed along the stream banks to control the flow of the water and reduce erosion. They were constructed in places susceptible to erosion during storms. More recently, we've learned that using riprap to turn a stream into a straight channel makes the water flow faster, which makes erosion worse at some places. Streams need space to move and change over time. Fish need bends, pools, rocky areas, tree roots, and logs where they can shelter and feed.<br /> <br /> When you visit Muir Woods today, you can still see some of the CCC's riprap along the banks of Redwood Creek. However, the park is removing some sections of riprap and letting the creek return to its natural flow at places where the local endangered population of Coho salmon need it most.</p>",

The rather obvious ploy backfired, and the Cliff House sank further into disfavor.<br /> <br /> That is, until 1881, when the property was bought by self-made millionaire, philanthropist and one-day Mayor of San Francisco, Adolph Sutro. He reimagined the Cliff House closer to its original vision of a family-oriented place for wholesome entertainment.<br /> <br /> Sutro was a man with a plan, seemingly in all endeavors. To help facilitate his business at the Cliff House, he bankrolled the construction of a railroad that would take people from San Francisco to Lands End, greatly increasing the number of people who could travel to the coast at a reasonable price. Everything was going smoothly until a fire burned the wood-frame Cliff House to the ground on Christmas Day, 1894.<br /> <br /> But Sutro was a lemons-to-lemonade kind of guy, and two years later, opened a new 8-story castle-inspired Cliff House, complete with art galleries, a gem exhibit, ballrooms, bars and restaurants. Tragically, in 1907, fire again destroyed the second Cliff House. By that year, Sutro had died. His daughter, Emma Sutro Merritt, devised plans to build a third, less grandiose Cliff House, made of fire-proof concrete and steel, which remains to this day.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Crissy Field is the place for you, your friends and anyone else who wants to enjoy a stunning walk or bike ride along a flat, hard-packed promenade with iconic views of the bay and Golden Gate Bridge.</p> <h3>On the Cutting Edge of Flight Technology</h3> <p>This enviable part of the city wasn't always so accessible. From 1921 to 1936, Crissy Field was the military's cutting-edge location for testing flight technology. During this time, the Air Service captured the nation's imagination with eye-grabbing headlines about flights at Crissy Field, including aerobatic stunts and air races. Most significant were a series of long-distance flights that contributed to the development of airline travel.</p> <h3>The Naming of Crissy Field</h3> <p>Presidio coast artilleryman Dana H. Crissy was ambitious. Being an artilleryman was interesting, but more interesting would be to get in on something new and innovative. Crissy changed the trajectory of his military career by joining the ranks of the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps, going on to become the Commander of the Mather Airfield in Sacramento. His position in Sacramento made him eligible to participate in a daring military test.<br /> <br /> On October 8th, 1919, 61 planes took flight from Roosevelt Field, Long Island heading west across the US while 15 planes, including one piloted by Crissy, flew east from a still unnamed airfield at the Presidio in San Francisco. These planes made up the Transcontinental Reliability and Endurance Test, the first US military attempt to fly across the North American continent. After three days and 24 hours in the cockpit, Captain Lowell H. Smith was the first to complete the trip, touching down on Roosevelt Field, New York.<br /> <br /> In the end, only nine planes made it all the way across. Nine pilots died, including Major Dana H. Crissy and his navigator, Sergeant 1st Class V. Thomas, who perished on their first day out trying to land their DH-4 airplane near Salt Lake City. Colonel Hap Arnold of the Presidio, a personal friend and brother in aviation to Major Crissy, requested the airfield at the Presidio, where Crissy took off on his last flight, be named in his honor.</p> <h3>First Flight to Hawaii - Almost</h3> <p>In 1925, after running six miles at full throttle across the bay, two P-N9 Navy seaplanes under the control of Commander John Rodgers took flight and headed west at a brisk 115 miles per hour. Their destination? Hawaii. But this was no pleasure flight making its way to a weekend of luaus. Rather, it was a major test of aviation.<br /> <br /> Coming on the heels of the around-the-world flight, which made use of short hops over the northern continents, the Navy was eager to show it was possible to fly planes over entire oceans at a single go.<br />  </p> <h3>Tragedy Averted</h3> <p>Despite meticulous planning, the expedition encountered adversity just five hours in, when one of the planes sprung an oil leak and was forced out of the air. Commander Rodgers' plane was flying fine, and so continued towards the south Pacific. Things continued uneventfully until 400 miles from their destination, the fuel reserves ran dangerously low, forcing Rodgers to veer off their charted path in search of a ship that could help them refuel. Unfortunately, no ship could be found.<br /> <br /> The airmen were forced down over the Pacific, in an area teeming with sharks. The low fuel took out both the engines and the radio. Stranded with little food, the men were left with few options. They managed to stay calm enough to remember their naval training and fashioned sails out of the canvas covering their plane's wings. Their ingenuity paid off. Against all odds, the men survived long enough to be rescued by a Navy submarine before sailing past Kauai, one week later than their intended arrival.</p> <h3>Crissy Field Today</h3> <p>Chrissy Field is a popular place to jog, walk, or ride bicycles. A pedestrian and bike trail stretches from Fort Point to the Maritime Museum, both Golden Gate NRA sites.</p>",

Yessir, Crissy Field has it all. Beaches, picnic spots, scenic overlooks and renowned conditions for windsurfing. Dog friends welcome!<br />  </p> <h3>From Seasonal Village to Pioneer Airfield</h3> <h4>The Ohlone: Coastal Native Peoples</h4> <p>The Ohlone people lived in and around the vicinity of Crissy Field by 740 AD. They and their predecessors lived in seasonal villages that could be moved to accommodate migratory hunting, fishing and foraging practices. Crissy Field was one such seasonal site. The Ohlone's way of life remained largely unchanged for 10,000 years, until the late 18th century and the arrival of European colonists.<br /> <br /> The Spanish arrived next, establishing a territorial presence alongside the Ohlone. They quickly adopted tactics to assimilate and systematically destroy the Ohlone culture and way of life. Yet the Ohlone continue to endure. The descendants of this pre-European society are still in the bay area, working to preserve and revitalize their culture. Revitalization happens in many ways, including language restoration, protection of ancestral sites and cultural revitalization through song, dance, storytelling and other traditional arts.<br />  </p> <h4>The Military at Crissy Field</h4> <p>This area was an anchorage for ships that supplied the Presidio soldiers during the Spanish, Mexican and US Army periods. After the US Army arrived, soldiers built stables, warehouses and refuse dumps in these damp lowlands. In the 1870s, the US Lifesaving Service (Coast Guard) Station opened at the west end of Crissy Field. The army always desired to fill the tidal sloughs to make the area more suitable for military activities.</p> <h4>Swamp to barracks via the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition</h4> <p>With a stroke of luck, the opportunity finally came with the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition, when the city filled the marsh for the army. During the Exposition, this area housed state and international pavilions at the east end. The west end had livestock show areas and an automobile racetrack. After the fair closed and World War I commenced, barracks for 6,000 soldiers training at the Presidio covered the Crissy Field area. After the war in 1919, construction of the airfield began where the old racetrack stood.</p> <h4>From Post to Park</h4> <p>In the World War II period, temporary barracks were again built along Crissy Field and stood here until the Army turned the Presidio over to the National Park Service in 1994. By that time, the area was showing signs of neglect and had an industrial feel. Restoration of the area began and continues today.</p> <h3>Restoration in the 21st Century</h3> <p>At the tail end of the 20th century, the focus on Crissy Field turned to restoration. A 1994 National Park Service management plan made a commitment to preserving the area as a place for relaxing, where visitors could experience solitude and enjoy a natural refuge in an urban setting, dedicated to the protection of cultural and natural resources. The first major initiative was the restoration of both the historic airfield and wetlands at Crissy Field. In consultation with the Ohlone, efforts to plant native vegetation have proven successful. The tidal marsh re-opened in 2000 and is now home to countless birds, jack smelt, bay shrimp and crabs.</p> <h3>Protecting Snowy Plovers</h3> <p>The snowy plover uses the beach at Crissy Field to rest and replenish its food reserves. This shorebird friend is a federally threatened species with only about 2,100 individuals left along the Pacific Coast from Washington to Baja. Their diminishing numbers are largely due to habitat loss.<br /> Plovers nest on nearby beaches and little things like walking dog friends near plover nests flushes protective parents out into the open, leaving eggs and chicks exposed to wind, sand, cold and predators. Leaving food scraps behind attracts opportunistic predators like gulls, coyotes, dogs, feral cats, skunks and raccoons, so please be mindful of your mess and pack out everything you bring.</p> <h3>Climate Change, Rising Seas</h3> <p>Burning fossil fuels like coal and gas releases carbon dioxide, which acts like a heat-trapping blanket around the planet, disrupting the climate. As glaciers melt and sea temperatures rise, so does sea level.<br /> <br /> Rising seas, coupled with bigger storms and waves, are causing more flooding and erosion of low lying areas like the one here, and could affect how sand is distributed along the beach. These trends may cause future visitors to have a very different beach experience here.<br /> <br /> A display at the bridge over Crissy Field marsh shows possible future sea levels, caused by global warming. The rate of sea level rise can be slowed by reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Crissy Field is a large green grass field, roughly half a mile long from the intersection of Old Mason St and Marine Drive to the western edge of Crissy Field marsh. If you include the area east of the marsh all the way to East Beach and the Crissy Field Center, Crissy Field is about one mile in length. <br /><br />Located on the edge of the San Francisco Bay, Crissy Field offers incredible views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Marin Headlands, whose dramatic, hilly terrain provides a stunning backdrop to the blue-green waters of the bay. The San Francisco Bay Trail runs along the northern waterfront side of Crissy Field, providing a flat, well-kept path wide enough for bikers and pedestrians. A network of dunes serves as a buffer between the field and the bay, running the length of the field from its western terminus at Torpedo Wharf all the way to East Beach.<br /><br />The field is bisected three times at roughly equidistant intervals by paths that take you from the San Francisco Bay Trail to Old Mason Street. In addition to these straight line paths across the field is one diagonal route, that cuts across the field starting at the north eastern corner of the field just west of the marsh, all the way to Old Mason Street at about the halfway mark of the field's length. Along the southern side of the field is an asphalt two-lane bike path with an extra lane for pedestrians that parallels Old Mason Street. Across Old Mason Street are many cream-colored buildings with red tile roofs, historic buildings of the Presidio, that today, house a variety of Presidio tenants and the Military Intelligence Service Learning Center. <br /><br />To the west of Crissy Field along the water you'll find Torpedo Wharf, an L-shaped fishing pier, and if you continue further west along Marine Drive you will eventually come to Fort Point, directly below the Golden Gate Bridge.<br /><br />To the east, you'll encounter Crissy Field marsh, a restored wetland that feeds into the bay. The wetland is roughly the shape of a rectangle, as it is bordered by the San Francisco Bay Trail to the north and Old Mason Street to the south. The water level rises and falls with the tide. <br /><br />Further east from the marsh is East Beach, a renowned location for kite surfing, but also a prime location for a regular beach holiday. East Beach has bathrooms, barbecues and food, at the Beach Hut Cafe, which is part of the Crissy Field Center. The Center is a low-impact green LEED certified green building that hosts educational environmental leadership programs for Bay Area youth.<br />",

The dunes surrounding the marsh are planted with coastal scrub plants that provide a beautiful carpet of flowers in the spring.<br /> <br /> <br /> Efforts to restore this tidal marsh, which feeds into the bay, have been long and arduous because of the environmental damage caused by the army. It was used as the army's dump site for years before it was filled for the 1915 International Exposition. Thanks to the countless hours and uncompromising efforts of the Golden Gate Parks Conservancy and the National Park Service, the natural beauty and diversity of life of this environment is being restored.</p> <h3>Unsustainable Practice</h3> <p>During the late 1800s when the US Army took over the Presidio, they considered the wetlands as an unhealthy nuisance and attempted to fill the marsh with refuse, wreaking havoc on the natural wetlands.<br /> <br /> <br /> In 1915, in preparation for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition (PPIE), the city filled in 630 acres of tidal marsh, stretching a full three miles from Fort Mason to Fort Point. Thirty-one nations and several US states built exhibits to dazzle the public, all connected by 47 miles of walkways. The PPIE demonstrated not only major technological achievement, but also that San Francisco had rebounded from the devastation of the 1906 earthquake and fire.</p> <h3>Bringing the marsh back to life</h3> <p>Since the tidal marsh re-opened in 2000, visitors have seen a resurgence of over 120 bird species in the area. Jack smelt, bay shrimp and Dungeness crab, popular food sources for our bird friends, are also rebounding. Today the marsh covers 20 acres, stretching over a mile along the Promenade.</p> <h3>Come fly the Pacific skies</h3> <p>During the re-creation of Crissy marsh, while the water was still unconnected to the bay, many shorebirds that hadn't been seen in the area for decades began stopping by at this location.<br /> <br /> <br /> Each year thousands of birds pass through the Presidio along the Pacific Flyway, the migratory bird equivalent of a cross-continent highway that goes all the way from South America to Canada. Birds use the marsh like a rest stop, to give their wings a break, grab a bite and let the kids go to the bathroom.</p> <h3>How does the marsh water look today?</h3> <p>Sometimes Crissy marsh is separated from the bay by the barrier beach for periods lasting several months because there isn't enough water in the wetlands to keep the channel open. Park scientists monitor the water quality in the marsh. When conditions are deemed too poor, a ditch is dug to reconnect the marsh to the bay.<br /> <br /> Today the marsh is alive and thriving. Enjoy the view, and see if you can spot some of these friendly guys!</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, a two-lane highway, descends from the wooded Bolinas Ridge to the west-southwest, crosses a bridge over Lagunitas Creek and bends to the east-southeast as it begins to follow the creek. The medium-sized Lagunitas Creek winds from the southeast to the northwest between the forested Bolinas Ridge to the west and mostly grass/pasture-covered unnamed ridge to the east. Just east of the bridge, Sir Francis Drake Boulevard intersects with Platform Bridge Road, which follows Lagunitas Creek downstream toward the northwest. There are houses, barns, and other structures of a small cattle ranch on the northeast corner of the intersection of these roads, and additional houses and structures to the north on the west side of the creek. An older, smaller, decommissioned single-lane bridge with arches runs parallel to the current bridge about 150 feet (45 meters) to the north of the modern bridge. The old route of Sir Francis Drake Highway ran across this older bridge and an approximately 600-foot-long (180-meter-long) section of the old roadway parallels the current highway to the west of the bridge before intersecting with the current road as it heads uphill. Parking is available along the southside of the old roadway and along the west side of Platform Bridge Road. Along the old roadway just west of the older bridge, the Cross Marin Trail heads south and east, passing under the modern bridge as it parallels the alder-lined Lagunitas Creek.",

Recognizing the geographic and economic importance of the San Francisco Bay and the need to transport gold cargo safely, the army identified locations that were well suited to national defense. In 1850, President Millard Fillmore established this land as a military reservation, designating it Point San Jose.</p>",

Much of their success was the result of a happy coincidence: the arrival of experienced Portuguese dairy farmers. Originally from the Azores, an archipelago of eight rural islands west of Iberian Portugal, these men emigrated to California aboard whaling ships.<br /> <br /> After a long time at sea, arriving in California and the allure of the Gold Rush prompted many Azoreans to \"jump ship\" in search of a better life. Those who didn't find their fortune in gold were able to use their native dairy experience to get jobs in Marin's newly established dairy ranches.<br /> <br /> Dairy farming was no joke. It took hard work from everyone who lived on the farms (women, men and children) to keep an operation running. Until electricity came in the 1930s, the cows were milked by hand twice a day, at 4 a.m. and 4 p.m. Depending on the number of cows, each milking time could take up to three hours. In between milking sessions, there was no shortage of chores, including sanitizing and preparing milk for transport, cleaning barns and equipment, mending fences, fieldwork, gardening, canning and tending livestock.</p>",

East Beach also offers a seasonal beach mat and two beach wheelchairs (available by reservation). Accessible parking and restrooms are available at either East Beach or West Bluff. You may access the Crissy Field Promenade from either location. The promenade is made up of a compacted decomposed granite. While walking along the promenade you will encounter a couple raised boardwalks which plank the beach and provide for viewing opportunities closer to the bay. You will also encounter pedestrian bridge near East Beach which spans the marsh inlet. The surface of this bridge is wood. There is a raised boardwalk that takes you into the marsh; entrance gates are provided near the East Beach picnic area and along Mason St. You may choose to walk back along the promenade or create a loop by walking along Mason St. The trail along Mason Street is paved asphalt. There are dedicated bicycle and pedestrian lanes. Completing this loop is approximately 2 miles. The loop described is part of the Bay Trail.<br /> <br /> <b>Crissy Field Promenade Trail Overview</b><br /> Distance: 2.3 mi (3.7 km)<br /> Elevation Gain: 10ft<br /> Time: 1 hour<br /> Trailhead: Crissy Field/East Beach<br /> Slope: Avg 0%, Max 1.4%<br /> Side Slope: Avg 1%, Max 2%<br /> Width: Avg 264\", Min 60\"<br /> Trail Surface: Compacted Natural Material, Boardwalk, Asphalt<br /> <br /> <b>Safety</b><br /> - Stay on the established trail.

    "bodyText": "<p>Located at the heart of the Tennessee Hollow Watershed, El Polí­n offers visitors a chance to connect with the Presidio's earliest history, experience some of the park's best birdwatching and enjoy the blooms and wildlife made possible by the year-round flow of the spring.</p> <h3>History of El Polí­n</h3> <p>Before European colonists arrived, the Yelamu Ohlone and their ancestors inhabited this space for thousands of years. When the Spanish arrived in 1776, El Polí­n Spring provided an essential water source for the Presidio. By 1812, Spanish colonial families were firmly established at El Polín, over twenty years before the town of Yerba Buena, later named San Francisco, was founded. According to legend, the waters of the spring increased fertility in women. The Miramontes family, who resided near the spring in the early 1800s, are often used to support this claim. They produced 20 children.<br /> <br /> After the US Army took over the Presidio in 1846, they changed the watershed by planting cypress and eucalyptus trees. They also redirected the flow of water by constructing dams, which were used as a water supply at the Main Post. The habitat for many of El Polin Springs' wildlife was forever altered.<br /> <br /> The watershed was home to tent encampments during the 1898 Spanish American War, and later served as temporary housing for San Franciscans left homeless by the 1906 earthquake. The area also saw several generations of more permanent housing. By the 1930s, several neighborhoods of brick houses had sprung up and in 1959 a new set of apartment buildings arrived when the Army expanded during the Cold War. As a result, only small pockets of riparian habitat remained.</p> <h3>Juana Briones</h3> <p>One enduring figure of the 1800s is Juana Briones, a woman of European, Native American and African descent, who grew up at El Polí­n. Briones was the descendant of members of both the Anza and Portolá expeditions from Mexico to Alta California. She made a name for herself as a healer, midwife and self-taught doctor, skills she is said to have learned from Native Americans. She was also a cunning businesswoman with a prominent business selling milk, produce and raising cattle.<br /> <br /> Briones was such a respected member of her community that she was able to keep her several Mexican ranchos, even after California's admission to the Union in 1850, and many Californiano families lost their land rights. Though there are no authenticated surviving photos, journals, or other primary documents from Juana herself, she is well remembered.</p> <h3>Restoration of the Southlands</h3> <p>For the past decade, revitalization has been underway within the Tennessee Hollow Watershed surrounding El Polí­n Spring. The watershed covers 270 acres in the eastern Presidio. It's made up of three streams that flow north through the valley before merging into one watercourse that flows into the San Francisco Bay. Creeks provide most of the freshwater for the restored Crissy Field marsh.<br /> <br /> <br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "A quarter mile loop trail tucked away in a quaint neighborhood of the Presidio provides access to El Polí­n Spring. A limited amount of parking is available at the trailhead in a cul-de-sac on MacArthur Avenue. Standing on the cement curb facing the trail to your south, there's a composting toilet a few feet to your right, past a row of four wooden benches. Trash and recycling bins are directly to the left of the trailhead, and a few feet further left, several bike racks. As you walk along the hard-packed trail, almost immediately you'll come across a wooden staircase on your right, the first of two in succession. The first flight of stairs is brief. The second set of stairs, separated from the first by a brief, flat path, is quite long and steep. Following the steep staircase will take you to the Ecology Trail and Inspiration Point Overlook. Walking up the short flight of stairs and turning left will take you to the Mountain Lake Trail. Simply continuing along the initial path will take you around El Polí­n Loop, where you'll encounter native plants and an archaeological site where a Spanish adobe structure once stood. The floorplan of the adobe structure has been recreated using modern adobe bricks that are a bright, powdery white, and are stacked one and a half feet high on three sides of a rectangular foundation, so the shape before you is like that of a block letter \"C\". The bricks are flat, wide and meticulously even. The spine of the \"C\", is about fifteen feet long. It's flanked by two incomplete sides, about half its length. The incomplete sides don't make it all the way to their corners, but descend in a manner similar to steps or the sides of a Mayan pyramid. In the middle of the \"C\" is a tile floor. The tiles are large squares, the same white color as the bricks. The tile floor, like the two foundation sides, is incomplete. A section at one corner is missing. Continuing along the loop you will come to an open section of the trail that forms a sort of circular space, with wooden benches along the perimeter. At the far side of the circular space are two options for proceeding, and completing, the loop. Both routes take you up the same slight slope around the middle section of the loop. Green, native riparian plants grow around the interior of the loop. If you take the right hand fork, the trail becomes a wooden boardwalk along the curve of the loop. El Polí­n Spring is to your right just before the boardwalk begins. The spring water trickles over two low brick dams and then flows under the trail to emerge on the left side in a small channel made of rounded river stones. Hummingbirds frequent the spring and the buzzing of their wings may be heard. Additional wooden benches can be found along the boardwalk, which is only about one quarter of the loop. A few feet from where the boardwalk ends, the trail is bisected by a thin gully. The gully is also made of small rounded stones, and runs down the slope through the middle of the trail to the center of the loop. A few feet after the gully is a connecting trail off to the right that leads to the Mountain Lake Trail, Julius Kahn Playground and the Bay Area Ridge Trail. Continuing along the loop, you'll find more wooden benches, and a small path to the left towards the interior of the loop. This path leads to a raised, circular stone structure that looks like a well built into the ground. Three stone gullies are visible from here, converging at the stone structure, where the spring and groundwater from the surrounding area is channeled and collected. The stone structure has semi-circular openings at its base that line up with the gullies and let water in from two upstream gullies and water flow out in the downstream channel. The soil in this area is damp, allowing several leafy, green plants to grow.",

This area, like much of Muir Woods, is home to many animal friends. Despite living in all areas of the woods, from the forest floor to high up in the canopy, most inhabitants are hard to spot, so keep your peepers peeled!</p> <h3>Looking High and Low</h3> <p>A lot of animals in Muir Woods are just little guys whom you might see along the ground or lower in the canopy. Some common woodland friends include banana slugs, Steller's jay, Echo blue butterflies, thrushes, rough-skinned newts, hummingbirds and the Sonoma chipmunk.<br /> <br /> <br /> But keep your eyes open for larger animal friends, too--Muir Woods is also home to black-tailed deer, bobcats, otters, skunks and raccoons.</p> <h3>Northern Spotted Owl at Muir Woods</h3> <p>Muir Woods lies within the southern portion of the northern spotted owl's range, a subspecies of the spotted owl. These owls reside in old-growth coniferous forests from Northern California to British Columbia and prey on small mammals. In Muir Woods, spotted owls primarily diet on dusky-footed woodrats, with other common prey such as brush rabbits, voles, pocket gophers and mice.<br /> <br /> They don't make their own nests, preferring instead to reside within tree cavities, including broken-topped trees and platforms. Because of their specific nesting preferences, the health of northern spotted owl populations is indicative of the health of old-growth forests, making them one of the most-studied owl species. They're classified as federally threatened, with the primary threat due to logging activity resulting in the fragmentation and elimination of their forest habitat. If you're visiting in the twilight hour, keep your ears open. You may hear the northern spotted owl's distinctive \"barking\" call.<br />  </p> <h3>Fish Friends</h3> <p>When you're going about your daily fish identifications, it's important to remember that a trout is a salmon, but a salmon does not always a trout make. Consider the coho and the steelhead, both are anadromous, meaning, they migrate to the ocean after birth in freshwater rivers and streams. Both fish friends are threatened by a number of human-induced environmental factors such as habitat degradation, water diversions and improper harvesting. In Muir Woods, we're doing our part to care for our fish friends by restoring native habitat up and down their spawning grounds, Redwood Creek.<br /> <br /> Remember, look but don't take! Fishing is not allowed!</p>",

This audio tour will reveal the many ways in which the soldiers and the citizens of San Francisco interacted, forever changing the face of the Presidio and the city.<br /> <br /> After Indian uprisings were no longer a threat in the mid-1890s, the Army began moving troops from frontier posts to bases better connected to transport routes. The rail lines and port of San Francisco made the Presidio a prime place to relocate troops, and by 1896 the monumental brick barracks along Montgomery Street emerged above the newly expanded Main Post parade ground. Foreshadowing the coming conflict in the Pacific, these impressive buildings would house a growing contingent of soldiers.</p>",

Today, these buildings are home to a number of park partners including Cavallo Point Lodge, the US Coast Guard and the Bay Area Discovery Museum. There's also a harbor, several historic gun emplacements and trails.<br /> <br /> A cell phone tour begins near the kiosk in front of the Bay Area Discovery Museum. The recorded audio provides additional information about the history and environment around Fort Baker. A map of the tour is available through park partners, Bay Area Discovery Museum, and Cavallo Point Lodge registration.</p> <h3>Fogless Wonder</h3> <p>Much of San Francisco and points north of the bay fall under the realm of the frequent visitor in gray, Karl the Fog. Karl is fond of the Golden Gate Bridge and the bay; large swaths of the city disappear within his dense shroud. Although a ridge to the west keeps him from Fort Baker, it makes the view from Fort Baker a bit eerie. He's a product of cold ocean water and warmer landward moving air coming together at the Golden Gate. When he shows up for several days on end, Karl can feel a lot like the house guest on your couch who has outstayed their welcome.</p> <h3>Bay Natives: The Coast Miwok</h3> <p>The Miwok and their ancestors made their home in areas north of the Golden Gate, primarily in Marin County and southern Sonoma County, for 10,000 years before any Europeans arrived. They were organized into small, politically independent societal groups that moved annually between temporary and permanent village sites determined by seasonal hunting, fishing and resource gathering. Because of their proximity to the Pacific Ocean, the Coast Miwok relied heavily on resources like kelp and shellfish for food.<br /> <br /> A few years after their arrival to the region, the Spanish began a cultural takeover of the indigenous peoples meant to destroy the native way of life. By 1810, a combination of indoctrination, enslavement and diseases brought by the Spanish led to decimation of the Miwok and their culture. Yet, despite this attempt of systematic destruction, the Miwok endured. Today, they live throughout the bay area and are committed to the preservation of their culture. Language revitalization, protecting ancestral sites, traditional plant use, storytelling, dance, song and basket weaving are all aspects of restoration efforts.</p> <h3>Mexican Era Rancho Sausalito</h3> <p>Although the Spanish colonized this region in 1776, the area remained largely uninhabited even after the Mexican War of Independence, which was fought from 1810 to 1821. Towards the mid-1800s, the grasslands here were gaining recognition as primo territory for cattle ranching. The ranch hands were known as <em>los vaqueros</em> and were some of America's first cowboys. In the late 1830s, William Richardson, a one time cabin boy who worked his way up to Port Captain, became the first settler to put down roots in the area north of the Golden Gate. Richardson married the Commandant of the Presidio's daughter and was awarded a land grant, giving him the rights to these lands. He established Rancho Sausalito, his cattle ranching operation. Later, this land would become Fort Baker.</p> <h3>Establishing Fort Baker</h3> <p>In the mid-1800s, the US Army set about modernizing the harbor defenses of San Francisco. The brick forts that had been the standard structures for the first half of the century were now vulnerable to rifled artillery attack. The army therefore developed a more modern system that relied on hidden batteries and \"disappearing\" guns. At first, the men who operated and maintained this new weaponry slept in tents, but cold fog and strong winds made more permanent housing a necessity, hence the construction of Fort Baker in 1901.</p> <h3>Fort Baker Defenses During WWII</h3> <p>As the country began to mobilize for war, the army created the Harbor Defenses of San Francisco, a system with operational command over many San Francisco army posts, including Fort Baker, Fort Barry and Fort Cronkhite. The Harbor Defenses of San Francisco was responsible for ensuring the safety of friendly shipping traffic and defending the coastline from enemy naval attack. The entrance to the bay was lined with underwater mines, which were armed by hand by soldiers here at Fort Baker. Past the mines, closer into land, was an antisubmarine net protected by the 3-inch rapid fire guns at Battery Yates.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Just north of the Golden Gate Bridge is Fort Baker. Facing north from the parking lot is the parade ground, a large, grassy field surrounded by old military barracks and buildings. To the right of the parking lot is a series of buildings with angled roofs similar in size and shape to a barn. These old army buildings now house the Bay Area Discovery Museum. To the left of the parking lot as you face the parade ground is the fishing pier, directly below the Golden Gate Bridge, and remains of Battery Yates. From the parking lot, if you go right around the parade ground, you'll come to Cavallo Point, a park partner resort housed in several of the former barracks. Fort Baker has a ring road running around the parade ground and is shaded by tall, dark green Monterey cypresses. WAYSIDE PANEL TITLE: Exploring Fort Baker- Graphic kiosk panel.

    "bodyText": "<p>Fort Funston is a great place to lay out and soak up some sun on a fog-free day. But no matter the weather, Fort Funston is a primo spot to chill with your dog friends on or off leash.</p> <h3>Trails at Fort Funston</h3> <p>While most of the trails at Fort Funston aren't too difficult, some can be a bit tricky. Some sections of trail require scrambling up and down sand dunes. The dunes here move frequently because of high winds, sometimes making trails difficult to find or follow, and the loose sand on the dunes slows mobility. One trail in particular, the Sand Ladder Trail, is very steep but brief. Dog friends are permitted off leash under voice control, except for the 12-acre closure in northwest Fort Funston. Hikers and horse friends share the Bay Area Ridge Trail.<br /> <br /> The sand dunes here at Fort Funston used to be characteristic of the entire San Francisco peninsula. Now, Fort Funston is one of only a few parts of the city where active sand dunes still exist.</p> <h3>Fearless Freddie Funston</h3> <p>General Frederick Funston, for whom Fort Funston is named, stood only 5' 5\", but what he lacked in height he made up for in moxie. He was a botanist for a time with the US Department of Agriculture, which took him on assignment to some pretty out there places, including the Dakota Badlands, Death Valley, Yosemite and Alaska. His appetite for world travel officially whetted, Funston did something rather bold, and volunteered with Cuban rebels in their war for independence from Spain, where he fought in 22 battles.<br /> <br /> Upon returning to the US, he was appointed colonel of the volunteer 20th Kansas Infantry Regiment. Funston and his men trained at the Presidio of San Francisco before deploying to the Philippines, where they saw serious combat in the Filipino Insurrection.<br /> <br /> Funston was an unabashed imperialist, so zealous in his remarks that President Theodore Roosevelt asked him to stop speaking publicly because he rubbed people the wrong way. Funston's exploits even drew attention from another famous American with ties to San Francisco, satirist Mark Twain, who condemned the general in his humorous essay, <em> A Defense of General Funston</em>.<br /> <br /> Divisive, but effective, Funston returned to the Presidio as a commander of the Department of California. As fate would have it, Funston was in control of the Presidio on April 18, 1906, the day of the San Francisco earthquake. In typical Funston fashion, he seized the reins of control, mobilizing troops, heading up relief efforts and even overseeing the dynamiting of buildings to create fire breaks. Some criticized him for overstepping his role, but Funston's quick decisions helped a city reeling amid disaster. In San Francisco, Funston was remembered as a hero. Tens of thousands came to pay their respects to his body on display at the rotunda at City Hall after he died. He was laid to rest in the San Francisco National Cemetery in the Presidio.</p> <h3>History of Fort Funston</h3> <p>In 1890s, the Army Corps of Engineers was hard at work updating coastal defenses around San Francisco Bay. Plans were drawn to build two mortar batteries between Laguna de la Merced and the Pacific Ocean. The plans were pretty basic, and in 1917, as the post added 150 acres to its grounds, troops assigned to Fort Funston were living in tents while they built their own wood frame barracks.<br /> <br /> The San Francisco Chronicle reporters describing the first flag raising ceremony over Fort Funston parade ground were none too impressed by what they saw, saying the battery resembled a rustic frontier outpost. Despite the fort's humble first appearance, it was a significant outpost, eventually equipped with 16-inch guns and later, during the Cold War, nuclear Nike missiles.</p> <h3>Nike Site</h3> <p>During the Cold War, Fort Funston housed SF-59, one of the Bay Area's twelve Nike missile defense sites. These missile sites were installed around the bay and other areas in the US to defend against potential Soviet airstrikes. Concerns regarding the missiles' ability to accurately identify multiple targets flying in formation along with their limited range, led the Army to arm them with nuclear payloads, which compensated for their design shortcomings. Of course, having nuclear warheads near a large urban center came with its own serious risks. Thankfully, an attack never came, and the missiles were never fired.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "From Skyline Boulevard and John Muir Drive<br /><br />If you are arriving by the 57 bus you must cross the four lane thoroughfare of Skyline Boulevard. There is a crosswalk on the north side of the intersection of Skyline Boulevard and John Muir Drive that spans Skyline Boulevard, a distance of about 110 feet. Once across, walk diagonally left another 65 feet to the paved road that leads up a slope to the top of Fort Funston. <br /><br />The road makes a U-shaped curve, taking you first south then north. It's about 500 feet from the start of the curve to where it bends north. It's here that there's a staircase going up the slope that serves as a shortcut to the Sunset and the Chip Trails, at the top of Fort Funston. The stairs are sandy, and continue for about 335 feet. It's an additional 45 feet straight from the stairs to the trail. Alternatively, you can skip the stairs and continue along the road which eventually links up with the trails, though it is an extra one third of a mile around if you take the road the whole way.<br /><br />If you take the stairs, once you get to the top, take either of the trails to the left. If you avoid the stairs and take the road the whole way, it will orient you south by the time you reach the top. Continuing in this direction, you will reach the trails. <br /><br />The Sunset Trail is further west than the Chip Trail, and takes you closer to the cliff's edge. The Chip Trail stays inland on a quarter mile path through the dunes, ending at the northwestern edge of the parking lot. From the stairs it's about one third of a mile along the Sunset Trail to reach the southern end of the parking lot where there are portable lavatories, waste receptacles and access to the hang gliding viewing area.<br /><br />For the first part of the Sunset Trail there's a grove of tall trees on your right. Once you're past the grove, the trail affords open views over the dunes of the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />At the southwestern end of the parking lot there are portable lavatories about 35 feet to your left as you come off the path. About 80 feet straight from the trail is a crosswalk in the parking lot. Once you reach the cross walk, turn right. In about 30 feet and you'll be on a boardwalk path. Facing west at the beginning of the boardwalk, a single picnic table is located about 45 feet to the left. About 18 feet to the right is a brown, metal trash bin. The boardwalk is about 200 feet long and ends in a wide, circular boardwalk landing overlooking the Pacific Ocean. This is the hang glider viewing platform. In its center is a concrete base end station that the landing is built around. The base end station is an asymmetrical shape made of smooth concrete. <br /><br />There are benches on the landing beginning about 17 feet to your right as you come off the boardwalk path. Facing west, a second boardwalk goes to the right where there are more benches. There is a waist high fence with a wooden railing along part of the coastal bluff edge. The fence doesn't follow the entire bluff edge as you walk right towards the benches. At the fence's edge is a tall pole with a bright orange windsock at its top. At the far right end of the landing next to all the benches is another base end station.<br />",

This 0.75 mile-long, flat, seaside trail is easy for all. The trail takes visitors past Battery Davis, offering picnic tables and benches along the way. After Battery Davis, the trail heads downhill towards the northern beach access trail. For a flat walk, with no inclines, Battery Davis is a good place to turn around.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunset Trail Overview</b><br /> Distance: 1.5 mi (2.8 km)<br /> Time: 1 hour<br /> Trailhead: Sunset Trail<br /> Slope: Avg 6%, Max 27%<br /> Side Slope: Avg 3%, Max 8%<br /> Width: Avg 87 in., Min 40 in.<br /> Trail Surface: Firm<br /> <br /> <b>Safety</b><br /> - Stay on the established trail. Keep an eye out for poison oak.<br /> - Observe warning signs and railings-these exist for your safety.<br /> - Dress in layers and be prepared for varying weather conditions. Sunny days along the coast can turn windy, foggy, and cold very fast.<br /> - Do not climb on the coastal bluffs or edges, the sand and rocks are loose and eroding and dangerous!<br /> - People have fallen from these cliffs -- and died!<br /> <br /> <b>Parking</b><br /> There is parking at Fort Funston, including ADA accessible parking.<br /> <br /> <b>Bathrooms</b><br /> Bathrooms are located near the parking area.<br /> <br /> <b>Dog and Trail Etiquette</b><br /> Dog walking is allowed in areas for on-leash or voice/sight control. Dogs are not allowed in the Habitat Protection Area, the marked Sensitive Habitat area and the area surrounding the Native Plant Nursery. Off-trail travel harms plants and causes erosion. Keep your food within arm's reach at all times and do not feed the wildlife. Carry out all trash and food waste (fruit peels, shells, etc.).<br />  </p>",

There are plenty of places to explore right here, including restaurants and shops at Fort Mason Center on the waterfront. If you have a whole day, Fort Mason is a great location to start a journey to the marina, East Beach and Crissy Field.</p> <h3>Trails at Fort Mason</h3> <p>The Great Meadow features a network of paved paths that lead through the meadow and down to Marina Boulevard. The San Francisco Bay Trail is part of these paths, hugging the coast, beginning at the Municipal Pier near the Maritime Museum and Fisherman's Wharf, and continuing to Crissy Field. The trail is on a gentle slope.</p> <h3>Park Headquarters and Visitor Information Center</h3> <p>Within a stone's throw of many of the park's sites, Fort Mason serves as the headquarters for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The Visitor Information Center in Building 201 provides maps, brochures, self-guided tours and park-wide information Monday through Friday, 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. Further information is available by calling 415 - 561 - 4700.</p> <h3>History: Location, Location, Location</h3> <p>Geography is the key to understanding Fort Mason. Its elevated position overlooking the bay made it a natural choice for a fortification for 200 years. The site served as a point of defense for the Spanish, Mexican, and US forces. As early as 1797, the Spanish built the first military fortification here, <em>Baterí­a de San Jose</em>, armed with five eight-pound cannons. After a successful revolution securing its sovereignty from Spain in 1822, Mexico continued to hold influence in the region until the 1840s. Like the Spanish, the wild frontier of northern California proved difficult for the Mexicans to maintain, and many fortifications fell into disrepair or were abandoned.<br /> <br /> After the <em>Bear Flag Revolt </em>in 1846, American forces secured the region that would later become San Francisco. Back then, San Francisco was a town of about 1,000, mostly fur trappers, whalers, fishermen and sailors. It wasn't until gold was discovered in the Sierra Nevadas in 1848 that San Francisco began to boom. Soon it became a launching pad for opportunists looking to make a buck in the tight housing market. Developers bought military land at Fort Mason (then Point San Jose) and constructed private lavish homes for themselves. The area was known as <em>Black Point</em>, home to a vibrant, civic-minded abolitionist community.<br /> <br /> The <em>Civil War</em> brought the return of the military to Black Point. It was renamed <em>Point San Jose</em>, and was laid out and constructed to function as a small, self-sufficient town. Point San Jose was different than other posts in that the army officers were stationed in the former Black Point civilian homes instead of living near the main parade ground. In 1882, the post was renamed Fort Mason to honor Colonel Richard Barnes Mason.<br /> <br /> <em>Fort Mason</em> continued to be important to local and US history. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, Fort Mason functioned as the city's temporary city hall and shelter to hundreds of homeless citizens.<br /> <br /> By 1915 and during WWI and WWII, Fort Mason served as the headquarters for the San Francisco <em>Port of Embarkation</em>, the nerve center of a vast network of shipping facilities that spread throughout the Bay Area.</p> <h3>Looking to Move?</h3> <p>Upper Fort Mason offers a unique opportunity to live in historic homes on national park grounds in an urban setting. Rent revenues to the park are used to further rehabilitate historic buildings and fund various improvement projects in the park.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Down the hill from the Great Meadow and across a public pay parking lot accessible from Marina Boulevard, is Fort Mason Center. Once the gateway to the Pacific for many soldiers from the late 19th century through WWII, in its modern incarnation, Fort Mason Center is home to many non-profit programs including museums, theater groups and centers for the arts and yummy food places. Housed within the Landmark Buildings, five rectangular cream colored brick and red Spanish tiled roofed edifices labeled A, B, C, D and E, the non-profits include the SF MOMA Artists Gallery, Children's Art Center, Magic Theatre and Blue Bear School of Music, all of which offer a variety of cultural programs in the form of theater performances, concerts and art exhibits.<br /><br />Building A is two stories tall, and the closest of the five to Marina Boulevard. It contains the Fort Mason Center Convention Center and Main Office. Buildings B, C, D and E are each three stories. All five buildings are accessible by stairs and ramps at the center of their longer, interior sides that parallel the parking lot between buildings C and D. The lobbies to each building contain elevators and a corner corridor stairwell with access to women's restrooms on the first floor, and male/female restrooms on the second. Buildings B and C are linked by a skyway on the second and third floors, as are buildings D and E. In addition to the non-profits, the Landmark Buildings house Reader's bookstore, Goody CafÃ© and Greens Restaurant.<br />The Herbst Pavilion is stands upon pier 2, between and beyond both the parking lot and buildings C and D. Facing the San Francisco Bay, pier 3 is to the right of pier 2, which holds the larger Festival Pavilion.<br /><br />On clear days, Fort Mason Center offers pristine views of the Golden Gate Bridge which spans the northern narrows of the Bay, leading into the high hills of the Marin Headlands. Also visible and closer in than the bridge is Alcatraz Island, with its blocky, sand-blonde facade, square windows and lighthouse rising in sharp relief against the Bay's blue-green waters. <br />",

Brigadier General Frederick Funston, acting commander of the U.S. Army Department of the Pacific, immediately established a command post in the Fort Mason Commanding Officer's residence (Quarters 1). Because much of the city's downtown was on fire, the city and the army designated the Commanding Officers' residence as San Francisco's temporary City Hall. From Fort Mason, the army managed an emergency command center, coordinated law efforts to maintain civilian peace and set up hundreds of essential earthquake relief camps.<br /> <br /> <b>The World's Fair</b><br /> In 1915, San Francisco hosted the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. This World's Fair celebrated the opening of the Panama Canal, which dramatically improved travel to and from the East Coast and worldwide. The city filled in over 600 acres of tidal marsh to create three miles of exhibition space for different nations and U.S. states. \"The Zone\", the fair's amusement and concession area, was constructed on Fort Mason and extended south out to Bay Street. Locally, San Francisco used the Exposition to prove to the world that the city had fully recovered from the devastating earthquake and was once-again open for business.</p>",

The fort is an iconic symbol of San Francisco's early US history.<br /> <br /> If you come for a visit, bring a jacket and something to keep your ears toasty! It gets mighty cold and windy this close to the water. If you get too cold (or even if you don't), you can always check out the 20 minute videos that run continuously in the theater to the right as you enter from the sally port, or the many shorter videos in the powder magazine you can choose for yourself.</p> <h3>Having Fun at the Fort</h3> <p>Having fun at Fort Point isn't hard to do. First of all, it's beautiful. Second of all, the fort sets a stage for stepping back in time. Walking through the windy corridors or looking out over the edge of the barbette tier at the wilds of Marin, one can't help but imagine the men who once lived here, and wonder what their lives were like. And if that were not enough, you can find all sorts of crazy photo angles of old bricks, rusty canons and the cool bridge above.</p> <h3>Historical Reenactors</h3> <p>If you're walking around inside Fort Point, don't be surprised if you see a Union soldier walking around, too, rifle slung over their shoulder. These soldiers are usually in good spirits, probably because they don't have to sleep in shifts in the same bed as several other recruits or endure the bitter winds of the fort every day without a break, like in the olden days.</p> <h3>Fort History</h3> <p>Prior to Fort Point, the Spanish built a fort of their own, <em>el Castillo de San Joaquí­n</em> , which sat on a clifftop very nearly on this spot. The US Army blew up the bluff edge and the Spanish fort so that the new fort's guns could fire at ships from water level. The US Army Engineers built the fort between 1853-1861, and was originally armed with cannons designed to repel naval attacks from foreign powers. The fort was rushed to completion with the onset of the Civil War, when it was fully manned and armed with over 100 cannons to counter any Confederate threat to San Francisco.<br /> <br /> In 1861, General Albert Sidney Johnston commanded the Department of California for the Union Army. The Confederates hoped they might be able to take hold of the region, and a secret plan was hatched to commandeer Fort Point for the Confederacy with the hopes that Johnston, a southerner by birth, would sympathize with the plot. The plan never came to fruition, though, and California remained a Union-controlled territory. Johnston, however, did in fact align with the Confederacy, but not until Fort Point was completed. After fulfilling his duties for the Union, Johnston gave up his post and became a Confederate general. In this capacity, he died at the battle of Shiloh in 1862.<br /> <br /> Long neglected by the military after it became obsolete during the Civil War, Fort Point was slated for demolition to make way for the Golden Gate Bridge in 1933. The fort was spared thanks to the efforts of the bridge's Chief Engineer, Joseph Strauss, who championed the fort's preservation because of its fine masonry and historical significance. In 1970, it was declared a national historical site.</p> <h3>Climate Change at Fort Point</h3> <p>This Civil War-era fort never faced enemy fire, but now it's under attack by rising seas and bigger storm waves. When we burn fossil fuels like coal and gas for energy, we add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This buildup acts like a blanket that traps heat around the world. Warmer temperatures expand ocean water and melt glaciers, causing sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service is serious about its responsibility to address problems facing our coastal parks and is taking practical steps to make progress before environmental problems get worse. How can we continue the army's legacy of defending our coasts in the face of sea level rise?</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The entrance to Fort Point is along the fort's south wall. As you approach the cement ramp that leads to the entryway, the size of the fort's brick wall becomes formidable, the closer you get the more it blocks out the sky. The entryway is denoted by a squared off pair of columns and an overhang set into the fort's facade. A cement keystone sits above the entrance, with an arc of bricks along both sides. Two large, studded wooden black doors open inwards into the sally port, a brief but wide hallway that leads into the central parade ground. The sally port is flanked by brick walls with small thin windows that acted as gun slits on either side. A second set of studded wooden doors with small openings for guns separates the sally port from the parade ground. <br /><br />The parade ground is a large open space at the center of the fort. It is surrounded on all sides by the three-levels of the wall, each with identical sets of domed arch ways, giving the place something of a beehive or honeycomb look. There is no roof on the fort, it's entirely exposed at the top. The lighthouse tower can be seen rising up from its perch on the barbette tier--the \"roof\" level of the fort. Above the lighthouse is the skeletal orange arch of the Golden Gate Bridge, which passes over the fort. <br /><br />A metal staircase is located at the corner to the right of the fort's entrance. A spiral granite staircase is in the corner of the fort to the left of the entrance. Each stairway has a map of things to see in the fort that are also in Braille. Stairs take you to each level of the fort, including the barbette tier, from where you have a unique view from beneath the Golden Gate Bridge and of the San Francisco Bay.",

Fort Scott offers amazing views situated near several trails and scenic overlooks. It's also the backdrop for popular volunteer stewardship activities at the Presidio Nursery and the surrounding area.<br /> <br /> Fort Scott is home to the Presidio Institute, which provides transformational experiences to inspire and empower leaders across an array of fields to make positive impacts in their communities.</p> <h3>Get Your Nature On: Trails and Vistas at the Fort</h3> <p>The best way to enjoy the outdoors at Fort Scott is to park in the lot at Langdon Court off of Lincoln Boulevard. Go south to walk the Batteries to Bluffs Trail (featuring an in-app tour) which takes you to Marshall's Beach and points south, including Baker Beach. North of the lot is the Golden Gate Overlook, old coastal batteries and the Golden Gate Bridge.</p> <h3>History of Fort Winfield Scott</h3> <p>Prior to 1912, Coast Artillery soldiers lived at the Montgomery Street Barracks at the Presidio's Main Post, a good thirty minute march from the coastal guns where they performed their duties. Fort Winfield Scott significantly shortened their morning commute.<br /> <br /> Between 1922 and 1946, the fort was designated headquarters of the Coast Defenses of San Francisco, commanding other coast artillery forts in the area, like Fort Barry and Fort Baker.<br /> <br /> After the Pearl Harbor attack, the fear of Japanese invasion prompted Army command to station soldiers at the batteries 24 hours a day. Fort Scott became a place where shift-weary soldiers could enjoy a little rest and relaxation.</p> <h3>Old Fuss and Feathers</h3> <p>\"Old Fuss and Feathers\" is high in the running for greatest nickname of all time. The honor belongs to US Army General Winfield Scott, who served more time as an active duty general than any other commander in US history. His career began in the War of 1812, though his rise to prominence came during the Mexican War. He led the assault on the fort of Chapultepec, resulting in a Mexican surrender in 1847. The US victory against Mexico led to the annexation of California.<br /> <br /> At the end of his illustrious career, his deeds earned him a second alias, \"The Great Old Man of the Army,\" which is epic, but lacks a certain ring you get with his original moniker. Scott's also remembered for devising a blockade to defeat the Confederacy, and for being an insufferable crank.</p> <h3>Prisoners of Conscience</h3> <p>During the Vietnam War, the Presidio was a functioning US Army post complete, with its own stockade, used to jail enlisted men who had committed violations against their terms of service. In the late 1960s, 127 men were held at the Presidio as military prisoners. The majority were serving time for AWOL offenses.<br /> <br /> 123 soldiers were kept in Building 1213, a facility fit to hold a maximum 88. The conditions of the stockade were deplorable. The men were subjected to extreme cruelty from the guards, who the soldiers described as antagonistic and racist. Overcrowding resulted in insufficient meal portions and two hour wait times to use bathrooms overflowing with human waste.<br /> <br /> While many prisoners suffered from mental stress and disorders, Private Richard \"Rusty\" Bunch, was particularly unstable. He was known to meditate in his cell, muttering that he'd been reincarnated and attempt to walk through walls. One day, Private Bunch asked a guard if he would shoot him if he ran, to which the guard replied he'd have to run to find out. Bunch did run, and the guard shot him in the back with a shotgun from ten feet away, killing him.</p> <h3>The Presidio Mutiny</h3> <p>The killing of Private Richard \"Rusty\" Bunch was the spark that led to the so-called Presidio mutiny. Upon hearing of Bunch's slaying, the prisoners were enraged, threatening violence against the guards. Ultimately, cooler heads prevailed. Instead of a violent outburst, 27 prisoners organized a peaceful non-cooperative demonstration where they sat in a field, sang protest songs and refused to move until meeting with Captain Robert Lamont, commander of the Presidio stockade.<br /> <br /> When Lamont arrived, the protesters read him their seven demands which sought to improve conditions at the stockade, ensure psychiatric evaluations of prisoners and guards, and allow prisoners a chance to talk to the media regarding Bunch's killing. Lamont cut the men off and accused them of mutiny before having them forcibly returned to their cells.<br /> <br /> The men were court-martialed, found guilty and handed sentences ranging from six months to 16 years. As often happens, justice arrived late. A year after the court-martial, the decision was reversed by judge Jacob Hagopian, who ruled that the men's actions did not meet the definition of mutiny, and the charges were dropped.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>This redwood grove includes some of the woods' biggest trees, including the Pinchot tree. The health of the towering redwoods depends on the complex soils of the forest floor, a product of fungal decay and recycling of low greenery, understory trees and the redwoods themselves.</p> <h3>A Life and Death Situation</h3> <p>The impressive size of coast redwoods may suggest dominance over other species in their habitat, but in fact it's just the opposite. Redwoods are only able to grow as a result of their unique biotic community. A healthy redwood forest usually includes massive Douglas firs, tanoaks, madrones and other trees. On the forest floor, among ferns and leafy redwood sorrel, mosses and mushrooms help to regenerate the soil. And of course, the redwoods themselves eventually fall to the forest floor where they decompose and return nutrients to the soil.<br /> <br /> Many different shrubs populate the understory of old-growth redwood forests, including numerous berry bushes. Some examples include: huckleberry, blackberry and thimbleberry, which act as seasonal food sources for raccoons and other forest inhabitants.<br /> <br /> When left to their own devices, redwood forests are natural recyclers. The 35 inch average yearly rainfall provides the soil with some nutrients, but trees must rely on each other, living and dead, to receive all they need to be healthy. To complete this process, redwoods must decay naturally along the forest floor. These decaying trees are what's known as \"nurse logs.\" When logging occurs and the trees are removed, this cycle is disrupted. Since trees have never been logged at Muir Woods, the natural ecological process continues as nature intended.</p>",

Additionally, the ocean waves and tides are hard to predict, and can be dangerous. Be vigilant when you or anyone you're with goes near the water.</p> <h3>Ice Ages Revealed</h3> <p>Fort Funston sits on a bluff made up of soft, sedimentary rocks that are part of the Merced Formation, a sedimentary deposit formed in a basin along the San Andreas fault during the Ice Ages of the last three million years. A walk along the beach will take you through a series of rocks that reflect 300 foot (100m) sea level rise and fall events due to glacial retreats and advances.<br /> <br /> The rocks tell the story of episodic changes from shallow offshore conditions that became sandy shorelines and beaches, wind-blown dunes and bays filled with clams, gravelly stream deposits and orange and green soil horizons developed during low sea level times.<br /> <br /> The cliffs here are truly an outdoor classroom for the geologically inclined. Near the storm water outfall pipe at the base of the bluff, there is even a distinctive white ash bed that came from a huge volcanic eruption near Mt. Lassen a half million years ago.</p> <h3>Coastal Bank Swallows</h3> <p>Coastal bank swallows are tiny but mighty migratory bird friends. Endangered due to habitat loss, today there are only two known coastal bank swallow colonies in California, one here at Fort Funston. Bank swallows make their homes by burrowing deep into cliffsides, digging tunnels about the width of a hot dog into a cliff face, and constructing nests deep inside at the tunnels' far end, hidden from view. They return to Fort Funston every year between March and April and stay until August, when they make their 5,000 mile journey to South America for the winter.</p> <h3>A Changing Climate</h3> <p>Like most coastal settings, Fort Funston is susceptible to sea level rise. The burning of fossil fuels like coal and gas releases carbon dioxide, which acts like a blanket around the planet, raising temperatures and disrupting the climate. As global air and ocean temperatures rise, so are ocean tides, encroaching on shorelines.<br /> <br /> The cliffs at Fort Funston are made of soft sandstone that's prone to erosion. We've already seen the destructive force of change over time, as some of the gun batteries have lost their toehold and are now on the beach!</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The plaza is the starting point for all your bridge-related adventures. From here, you can learn about the history of the bridge and its impact on the Bay Area with the help of interactive installations and models, including a cross-section of the bridge's main suspension cable. There is limited paid parking at the plaza, and we highly recommend that you take public transit.</p> <h3>Bridge Across the Bay</h3> <p>Crossing the bridge is a popular activity for tourists and locals alike. People from around the bay area flock every day to bike or walk across the span. Depending on weather, the walk across the bridge can afford stunning views of the city and the Marin Headlands, but don't be surprised if you get caught in the Fog Dome!<br /> <br /> The <strong>Golden Gate Bridge Welcome Center</strong> is your starting point for walking across the Golden Gate Bridge or planning an excursion in nearby parklands. You can ask a ranger about places to visit and pick up bridge-related souvenirs. Trails from the plaza go in several directions, even leading to Fort Point below. These trails have recently been improved for accessibility and the accommodation of cyclists.</p> <h3>Bridge Trivia</h3> <p>The following are some fun bridge facts you can use to impress friends at your next bridge-related get together...</p> <ul> <li>A bridge spanning the Golden Gate Strait was first proposed in 1872 by railroad tycoon Charles Crocker. At the time, many people thought a bridge across the strait couldn't be built. The idea wasn't brought up again until 1919, 47 years later, when the San Francisco Board of Supervisors instructed the city engineer to do a study to evaluate the feasibility of such an undertaking.</li> <li>The bridge took more than four years to build, from January 5th, 1933, until its official opening to vehicular traffic on May 28th, 1937.</li> <li>When it was first being built, the bridge had several enemies. Among them, the Southern Pacific Railroad, who had a controlling interest in the ferry that conveyed commuters from Marin County to the city. Legendary landscape photographer Ansel Adams, along with the Sierra Club, also opposed the bridge, fearing it would ruin the view.</li> <li>At its opening in 1937, the bridge weighed 894,500 tons. After modifications in 1986, the bridge slimmed down to a lean 887,000 tons. The towers are 746 feet tall, and each have about 600,000 rivets. End to end, including abutments, the bridge is 1.7 miles long. The span across the strait is 1.2 miles long.</li> <li>The main suspension cables, which run the length of the bridge passing over the tops of the towers, are made of galvanized carbon steel wire. Each cable is 36 3/8 inches in diameter and 7,650 feet long. The total length of galvanized steel wire used in both cables combined is 80,000 miles, for a combined weight of 24,500 tons.</li> <li>The bridge was built to move. At midspan, the bridge can lower as much as 10.8 feet, or rise as much as 5.8 feet. Side to side, the bridge can sway up to 27.7 feet.</li> <li>The bridge's unique color, \"International Orange,\" was carefully selected by consulting architect Irving Morrow, who picked it to complement the bridge's environs, highlight its immensity and make it more visible in fog.</li> <li>The Civil War-era Fort Point was slated for demolition in 1933 to make way for the bridge's construction, but Chief Engineer Joseph Strauss put a halt to the plan, citing the fort's fine masonry as well as its historical significance among the reasons it should remain. The bridge was redesigned with an arch at the south end to accommodate the fort.</li> <li>In 1967, San Francisco topless star Yvonne D'Angers, aka the Persian Lamb, protested threats of her own deportation by chaining herself to the bridge.</li> <li>In 2004, a young deer decided to join the commute, bounding across the bridge in a FasTrak lane before exiting on 19th Avenue and disappearing into the Presidio.</li> <li>In late August 2005, a 6-foot tall ostrich escaped from a cargo van just in time to jam the evening commute north and south across the bridge.</li> </ul> <h3>Parking is Limited</h3> <p>Paid parking is extremely limited at the plaza. It's highly recommended that you take public transit to the plaza. Options from San Francisco include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Downtown, at Main and Folsom or along Mission Street. (Routes 10, 70, and 101)</li> <li>Union Square, at 5th Street and Mission. (Routes 10, 70, and 101)</li> <li>Civic Center, at 7th Street and Market or McAllister and Polk Street. (Routes 10, 70, 92, 93, and 101)</li> <li>Along Fisherman's Wharf. (Routes 2, 4, 8, 18, 24, 27, 38, 44, 54, 56, 58, 72, 74, and 76)</li> <li>You can also take the <a href=\"https://presidio.gov/visit/getting-to-and-around-the-park/presidio-go-shuttle\">Presidio Go</a> shuttles from the Presidio.</li> </ul>",
    "audioDescription": "The Golden Gate Plaza is a series of buildings, trails and outdoor displays relating to the Golden Gate Bridge. Facing north from the parking lot, the plaza is in front of you separated by a two lane street. The bathrooms are to your left, on the same side of the street as the parking lot, and the bridge, the bathrooms are on your left. Once you go north and cross the street from the parking lot, you will be in an open plaza, with the orange Welcome Center Information & Store building on your right. Straight ahead is a bronze statue of a man with short, wavy hair wearing a suit. This is Joseph Strauss, the chief engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge. On your left opposite the Welcome Center souvenir store on the way to the Strauss statue, are two panels whose images change depending on how you face them. They feature photographs that show change over time during the construction process of the Golden Gate Bridge. Up above on a hillside straight behind the statue of Strauss is a circular building with glass walls, the Round House Cafe. It's accessible by a ramp that curves around the building's exterior. The different sections of the outdoor plaza area are accessible, and feature descriptive panels about regional history as well as tactile models of the bridge that demonstrate the physics behind its design in addition to 3D maps of area topography. <br /><br />Footpaths and bike trails take you from the plaza to the bridge deck and other areas within the Presidio.",

    "audioDescription": "Facing east from the beginning of the boardwalk at the southwestern side of the rectangular parking lot, there are portable lavatories about 125 feet to your left. To reach them first walk east, straight from the boardwalk, about 60 feet then turn left and walk through the parking lot about 70 feet and you'll arrive at the lavatory. <br /><br /><br />From the same starting point facing east from the beginning of the boardwalk, there is a picnic table 45 feet to your right. To your left there is a metal trash can about 18 feet away. <br /><br />Facing east from the boardwalk, the Sunset Trail begins about 90 to the left. Walk along the edge of the asphalt parking lot about 50 feet then turn slightly right and walk about 40 feet to the trailhead. You will pass a four-sided informational kiosk in the parking lot on your right before arriving at the start of the trail. <br /><br />If you take the boardwalk, it's about 200 feet long and ends in a wide, circular boardwalk landing overlooking the Pacific Ocean. This is the hang glider viewing platform. In its center is a concrete base end station that the landing is built around. The base end station is an asymmetrical shape made of smooth concrete. <br /><br />There are benches on the landing beginning about 17 feet to your right as you come off the boardwalk path. Facing west, a second boardwalk goes to the right where there are more benches. There is a waist high fence with a wooden railing along part of the coastal bluff edge. The fence doesn't follow the entire bluff edge as you walk right towards the benches. At the fence's edge is a tall pole with a bright orange windsock at its top. At the far right end of the landing next to all the benches is another base end station.<br />",

Reusing and rehabilitating historic buildings is in itself a sustainable practice, and the work was done so as to maintain the buildings' historic character inside and out. New lodging facilities were constructed with state-of-the-art solar panels integrated onto the roofs, and environmentally friendly glues, paints, carpets, and other green building materials such as denim insulation, bamboo and recycled woods were also used.

The List would inform the navigator of the unique signature of each light-seeing a light flashing one second off, three on would mean you were looking at the Point Bonita light.<br /> How reassuring it would be to see this array of lights flashing from a distance confirming the ship's bearing. (One second off, three on) By 1855, the navigator might have seen the Farallon Island light, and by 1898, the Light List would have noted a new lightship, the San Francisco, anchored 8Â½ miles out in the shipping lane.<br /> <br /> Now look back at the San Francisco Bay.<br /> <br /> By locking in a course from the lightship towards Alcatraz and staying safely off Fort Point on the starboard and Point Bonita on the port (and with a little bit of luck), the ship would soon be safely at anchor.<br /> <br /> CONCLUSION<br /> <br /> Now feel free to walk about the lighthouse grounds as we conclude our tour.<br /> <br /> There are many geographical areas that, by their unique nature, have had a profound effect on human history; one of these is the Golden Gate. At the outset, the ability to safely navigate, or even locate, the Golden Gate seemed nearly impossible. But ultimately a robust lighthouse navigational system changed all that and led to the growth of an internationally beloved city. San Francisco is home to an amazing diversity of people, many who arrived by sailing through the Golden Gate. Today, the ports of Oakland and San Francisco host many international visitors and conduct significant global maritime trade. All this would be impossible without the hardworking keepers and the lanterns, bells and horns (and cannons) of the Lighthouse Service. (music crescendo)<br /> Thank you for taking our cell phone tour of the Point Bonita Lighthouse. This cell phone tour was produced by the National Park Service and Antenna Theater.</p>",

It is an area where powerful environmental forces have profoundly affected human history. And some might say it all started with...GOLD!<br /> <br /> The Golden Gate, the Golden Gate Bridge, the gold rush and our golden state, California. The Golden Gate, the body of water that is laid out before you, was named golden before actual gold was discovered. It was named by explorer John C. Fremont in 1846 after the \"Golden Horn\" in Constantinople. Ah, the golden gate, a beautiful place to view the setting sun slipping into the Pacific as the rosy rays leave the straits glowing like gold at dusk. These sunsets must have been a delight to behold by the less than 1,000 residents living in San Francisco, then a quiet sleepy town in the early 1800s.<br /> <br /> Please start moving, through the metal gate and up the hill, staying on the asphalt path. Stop when you reach the top of the hill.<br /> <br /> On January 24, 1848: EUREKA! James Marshall discovers gold in the American River, northeast of San Francisco. Sam Brannan rides through the city waving a bottle of gold dust shouting \"Gold! Gold! Gold from the American River!\" The rush was on! News of Gold in California travels far and wide. (Wagon wheels and horses are heard as if you are joining the rush) Thousands upon thousands dropped what they were doing and headed for the gold fields of California.<br /> But how to quickly travel to the newly discovered fields of gold? Whether to strike out on a dangerous land passage with a wagon train across the inhospitable dry deserts and over snow-covered mountain passes, or book passage on a sailing ship, possibly a sleek clipper ship , to weather a stormy voyage around South America's Cape Horn or survive the typhoid ridden tropics?<br /> <br /> You should now be on the path at the top of the hill.<br /> <br /> THE SHIPWRECK GRAVEYARD<br /> <br /> There are rocks below and all along the coast. Those '49ers that chose to make the sea voyage sailed through this strait - the Golden Gate Strait - barely a mile wide and three miles long. The waters that are below you swallowed up many unlucky ships navigating this inlet just hours before they would have dropped anchor in San Francisco's safe harbor. During the Gold Rush, from 1849 to 1861, 24 shipwrecks are known to have happened around here. The journey leading to San Francisco and the California dream was a treacherous one. Clearly, ships needed help getting from the sea to San Francisco Bay. A system of navigation lights would be required up and down the west coast-with some of the most critical ones signaling the mouth of the Golden Gate, right before you.<br /> <br /> Now start moving down the path, towards the next sign, which is positioned on the right.</p>",

Ever since gold was discovered in 1848, it has been the army's highest priority to defend this strategic harbor. Although there are many ways to defend a harbor, the army built four generations of harbor defenses here. The first generation used brick forts with many cannons to level crossfire on enemy ships. Only two of the three planned forts, at Fort Point and Alcatraz Island, were constructed. The Lime Point installation, planned for Fort Baker, was never built. The next generation of harbor defenses, from the 1870s to the 1920s, consisted of large rifled guns dispersed along the bay entrance. This generation led to the construction of batteries at Fort Baker. The third generation, during World War Two, relied on huge 16-inch guns on the coastal bluffs, and underwater mines managed from Fort Baker. After the war, Nike missiles at Fort Cronkhite, to the west of Fort Baker, deterred attacks from Russian bombers into the 1970s.</p>",

Directly in front of you is a fence guarding a small pond. Immediately to the left of the wayside is a large, short boulder with a flat top. There are a bunch of scrubby bushes to the right and slightly behind and to the left of where you are standing, is a bench which is a quiet place to observe the wildlife of the pond. Turning to the right is a short, narrow dirt path that leads back to the main boardwalk.<br /> <br /> WAYSIDE LAYOUT: The wayside has 2 rows of content featuring images and text. The top row has the main body of text and 1 image. The second row is 2 images, text and a final image on the right.</p> <h3>ROW 1</h3> <p>TEXT: It's all Downhill: Stepping stone ponds for wildlife. Here at Mori point, park scientists and volunteers have used the natural flow of water on the landscape to create a connected network of pond habitats for the threatened California red-legged frog and the endangered San Francisco garter snake. Rainfall from the hillsides feeds the pond in front of you. When the pond is full, water flows under the boardwalk into the pond just to the right of you. This pond then overflows into the freshwater wetlands between here and Sharp Park.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION IMAGE #1: Located on the top right side. Colored, wide landscape photograph of the boardwalk and where you stand now, looking down the trail in the direction of the parking lot. On the left, the boardwalk can be seen with short trees and houses featured behind it. The right side of the photo shows the pond as described on this wayside with calm water surrounded by tall, green grasses along the edge of the pond.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Nature's Underfoot! This boardwalk serves as a dry path to take in the beauty of Mori Point while protecting the plants and animals living here. Snakes like to sun themselves on t roads and trails where they can easily be trampled. The raised boardwalk is difficult for snakes to reach, but a safe corridor below allows snakes and other animals to move between uplands and wetlands.</p> <h3>ROW 2</h3> <p>DESCRIPTION IMAGE #2: Located on the bottom left side. Colored rectangular photograph of a San Francisco Garter snake (<em>Thamnophis sirtalis tetraenia</em>). The snake is long and skinny, with red, white and black stripes running lengthwise along it's body. The snake appears to slither across brown, dusty looking ground. The snake is surrounded by rocks and dirt clumps. The snake's head is at the bottom right corner and its tail is stretching out of frame at the top left corner of the photograph.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION IMAGE #3: Located at the center towards the bottom. Colored, mostly square photograph of a California Red-Legged frog. This is a close-up photo of a frog from the side, as it faces to the right. The frog is dark green with black spots scattered across its body. It has small red patches on the sides of its main body. The frog is resting on green and brown grass or reeds that are partially submerged in water<br /> <br /> CAPTION: During wet months you may hear male frogs calling to attract mates and defend territories. The California red-legged frog and the Sierra treefrog lay egg clusters on vegetation near the water's surface. If you have binoculars, you just might see them.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Food for thought. These ponds provide frog breeding habitat, but the water sometimes dries up before tadpoles become adults. As the ponds recede, tadpoles are concentrated into a small area where they are easy prey for snakes.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION IMAGE #4: Located on the bottom right side. Colored, mostly square photograph of California red-legged frog eggs. The eggs are submerged in the pond and clustered around brown grass and reeds that are poking out from below the water.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: California red-legged frog egg masses are the size of a grapefruit, while Sierra treefrogs lay their eggs in clusters the size of ping-pong balls</p>",

In a landmark case, just one year after the reprehensible Supreme Court decision Plessy vs. Ferguson that upheld separate but equal segregation policy for public spaces, Mr. Harris brought his case before the San Francisco Superior Court under California's Dibble Civil Rights Act, which declared: all citizens \"of every color or race whatsoever\" shall \"be entitled to the full and equal\" facilities of \"all places of public accommodation or amount.\"<br /> <br /> The suit was successful, but personally for Mr. Harris, the victory was bittersweet, as the amount he won in damages was insufficient even to cover his legal expenses. The case, however, spurred a wave of suits across the state in the wake of Harris' eventual success.</p>",

Federal Marshals arrived on June 11, 1971 to remove the final fifteen occupiers.<br /> <br /> At that time, Richard Oakes stated, “Alcatraz is not an island. It is an idea.”  The NPS recognizes the significance of the Alcatraz Occupation in programming and exhibits. Education programs teach about the occupation while reflecting on society’s changing opinion of civil rights and freedom. The annual Indian of All Tribes Day, reunites former occupiers, their families, and their friends to gather and tell their stories.<br /> <br /> Twice a year, on Indigenous Peoples’ and Thanksgiving Day, the occupation is also acknowledged by sunrise ceremonies with prayers, dancing and drumming on the parade ground below.<br /> <br /> To learn more, visit the Red Power on Alcatraz online <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/goga/redpower50.htm\">exhibit </a>or visit the exhibit in the New Industries Building.",

There are exhibits of historic places and colorful stories from the area's past as well as displays of artifacts, landscapes and geology. A recorded audio tour describing the center's exhibits and the surrounding area is available from the center staff. The café is temporarily closed, but snacks, hot and cold beverages, and gelato bars are available. Peruse the souvenir shop and bookstore and take a part of this special place home with you.</p> <p>From the visitor center you can explore the Sutro Baths and the nearby Sutro Heights gardens. This is also the site of the Sutro Pleasure Grounds, a short-lived amusement park fashioned after Coney Island in New York City. In 1913, it morphed into Playland, a mainstay of San Franciscans seeking excitement until it closed in 1972. </p> <h3>Incredible View</h3> <p>The overlook at Lands End offers stunning views. Hillsides of cypress and wildflowers meet the craggy coastline. Additionally, the Coastal Trail and Point Lobos Trail take you to some of the most inspiring views in the city.</p> <h3>Coastal Native Peoples</h3> <p>For thousands of years, the Yelamu Ohlone tribe and their predecessors lived at Lands End in seasonal settlements. They lived off the land by making salt, gathering shellfish, hunting seabirds and marine mammals and using these resources in a sustainable way that worked for generations.<br /> <br /> When the Spanish settled in the area in 1776, they moved the Yelamu to the newly established Mission Dolores. This forced relocation had dramatic consequences for the native people, as they were forced to conform to the societal norms of colonial Spain. They were also exposed to new diseases such as measles and influenza, resulting in dramatic death tolls. The arrival of European colonists completely obliterated the Ohlone way of life, but they endured in spite of adversity. Today, the Ohlone community is actively revitalizing their culture.</p> <h3>19<sup>th </sup>Century Naturalists</h3> <p>In the mid 1800s, Lands End was a secluded, inaccessible area that meant a long journey for anyone who came out this way. After California was annexed by the US in 1846, some of the first visitors brave enough to venture here were scientists and naturalists interested in studying marine mammals and other natural wonders native to this unique environment.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Lands End Overlook is a visitor center along the south western corner of the parking lot off of Point Lobos Avenue. The building is made of gray concrete and glass. From the sidewalk in front of the visitor center facing south, the building has a rectangular, concrete wall part of which protrudes past the rest of the building, with a rectangular cut-out section that resembles a window. Embossed on the wall are large letters that read, \"Lands End Lookout.\" On the other side of this wall is a trash can, and further to the right, a small outdoor window concession for the former cafe. <br /><br />To reach the glass door entrance to the visitor center you must pass through a concrete passage with an engraving of the National Park Service arrowhead logo, with a mountain, tree and buffalo depicted within the arrowhead. The doorway is on the right. The bathrooms are located along the outside of the building past the glass door entrance. To reach them, walk along the outside of the building, the bathrooms are in a short outdoor corridor. The men's room is straight back, the women's room is on the left.<br /><br />Inside the visitor center there is a welcome desk to your left as you walk in. Behind the welcome desk are aisles of books, apparel and other souvenirs available for purchase. The back wall of the building is comprised of picture windows that look out over the Pacific Ocean. <br />",

Navigation off the coast was especially treacherous in the early 20th century. Three shipwrecks are visible from different points along Lands End. The <strong>Ohian</strong> (1937) stern and boilers can be seen at low tide by taking the stairs down from the Merrie Way parking lot. The <strong>Lyman Stewart</strong> (1922) and the <strong>Frank Buck</strong> (1937) remnants can be seen between the vista point and the Palace of the Legion of Honor along the Coastal Trail. Strangely, the <strong>Lyman Stewart</strong> and the <strong>Frank Buck</strong> began their days side by side in the same shipyard, and went down against the same rock at Lands End.</p>",

It's the most popular trail in the Lands End area with both locals and visitors from around the world. The entire trail is fairly non-strenuous, flat terrain with great views of the Golden Gate among cypresses and coastal scrub. The first part of the trail is wheelchair accessible all the way to the Mile Rock Overlook, and bike accessible until the Eagle's Point steps. A spur trail takes users to Mile Rock Point and Mile Rock Beach, which offer views of the Golden Gate.<br /> <br /> <br /> This revitalized trail features diverse, native plant habitat. Along with the requisite views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay, hikers and wildlife enthusiasts are in for a world class treat. Keep your eyes peeled for marine mammals and birds-cormorants and oystercatchers are staple species-as well as landscape features like the famous Cliff House, Sutro Bath ruins and the Palace of the Legion of Honor.<br /> <br /> <br /> Despite the relative ease of the trail, be careful! There are some rugged spots, especially near Eagle's Point where the rocky cliffs can be treacherous and windy.<br />  </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The building now known as Letterman General Hospital began providing healthcare in different capacities in 1898. In World War II it was one of the largest hospitals in the country, and continued to function as a hospital into the 1980s. Now, nonprofit organizations reside in what remains of the original hospital building. A 1960s addition to the hospital complex wasn't up to modern earthquake code, and so it was replaced by new buildings that are home to George Lucas' LucasArts and Industrial Light and Magic divisions of Lucasfilm.</p> <h3>Letterman Origins</h3> <p>In 1898, the Old Post Hospital was short one too many bedpans for all the sick men, soldiers and volunteers at their facility. A request for a new Army General Hospital at the Presidio was made. Established in 1899, this later became known as the Letterman Hospital. Most of its patients were sick soldiers who were going to or on their way back from the Philippines during the Spanish-American War.<br /> <br /> From its infancy, the hospital was home to state-of-the-art technology, including an intercom telephone system as well as primitive X-Ray equipment. Further progress came in 1901, when the facility became the first army general hospital to employ women of the newly created Army Nurse Corps. Soon Letterman Hospital became world-renowned for its research on tropical diseases and was instrumental in many crucial developments in orthopedics. Although it was chartered to serve the Army, the hospital opened its doors to civilian casualties after the 1906 earthquake and fire.</p> <h3>Letterman in WWII</h3> <p><br /> During World War II, Letterman's location made it the most important hospital for the treatment of sick and wounded soldiers from the Pacific Theater. The statistics are staggering-in 1945 alone, Letterman General Hospital received more than 73,000 patients. Letterman and Walter Reed Hospital were the Army's largest hospitals during this period.</p> <h3>Renovation and Innovation</h3> <p>By the Vietnam era, the Army renovated the aging structure into a new ten-story, 550-bed facility in 1969. The new Letterman Army Medical Center trained a quarter of the Army's medical specialists and served soldiers wounded in Vietnam throughout the 1970s. The facility was on the cutting edge of the development of artificial blood, laser physics, and the treatment of trauma. Following the transfer of the Presidio to the National Park Service, both the hospital and the research institute were deactivated in 1995.</p> <h3>George Lucas' Letterman Digital Arts Center</h3> <p>The hospital was deactivated in 1995 following the transfer of the Presidio to the National Park Service. As part of an ongoing effort to make the Presidio a financially self-sufficient National Park, Lucasfilm was selected to redevelop the site. The new Letterman Digital Arts Center is home to several Lucasfilm divisions, including Industrial Light & Magic and LucasArt. The beautiful campus is host to many inspirational sculptures.</p>",

When we arrived in California we were sent to Camp Merritt, near the coast and a very unsanitary place, heavy fog and the men began to develop chest colds and several died from pneumonia. I was sick, very sick, and went to the field hospital and all they did for me was to soak some cotton in alcohol, put it in a glass, set it afire, and cupped my chest which did nothing for me, but I visited the home of some people there and the lady of the house realized how sick I was and applied red flannel cloths to my chest with camphorated oil and I then got well fast.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As sick soldiers overwhelmed the 50-bed post hospital, an Army General Hospital was requested for the Presidio. Later known as Letterman Hospital, the general hospital was established in 1899 to receive sick troops en route to and from the Philippines and to care for patients transferred to the States from the Manila hospitals. The largest number of patients in one day was 1,040 on August 2, 1899.<br /> <br /> When Maj. Alfred Girard took command of the still incomplete general hospital in July 1899, he had mixed emotions about his new command, writing:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The location of the hospital has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are proximity to the city, to the post of the Presidio, and to the camps which were to shelter the troops assembling for duty in the Philippines and the volunteers returning therefrom. The disadvantages are exposure to the high winds and fogs, the low ground with swarms of mosquitoes and flies, and the proximity to the liquor shops adjoining the Presidio.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The role of the hospital grew and by 1905 it was also handling special cases from all over the United States - obscure tropical diseases; serious surgical cases; and eye, ear, nose, and throat cases throughout Western military installations. In 1904 Surgeon Maj. William Stephenson pleaded for a third doctor at the Presidio because it now had one of the largest military populations in the Army.<br /> <br /> In addition to the 1,600 men stationed here, hospital surgeons care for a large contingent of active and retired officers' and soldiers' families, servants, widows, and families of soldiers in the Philippines living near the reservation. Hospital doctors also sit on examining and courts martial boards, supervise the medical needs of troops en route to and from the Philippines (vaccinations, sick calls, etc.), and complete extensive administration work.<br /> <br /> The Army responded by assigning a third post surgeon to the Presidio at the end of 1904. Daily activities at the hospital are described in an August 1900 newspaper article:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It seemed like a special visiting day at the General Hospital, so great was the number that applied for passes. The fruit peddlers disposed of their stock long before the day was over, and every sick and convalescent soldier could be seen contentedly munching the grapes and pears given them by the kind-hearted crowd.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The General Hospital also dealt with a different kind of sickness from the war as reported on in this July 1900 news article.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Reports of hundreds of mentally diseased soldiers returning from the Philippines are exaggerated. The landing of eleven insane men from the transport Sheridan brings to sixty-four the number of insane patients returned from Manila. There are now close to sixty-five thousand men in the Philippines, and there are enough State volunteers returned to bring the total up to nearly one hundred-thousand, yet insanity patients have numbered less than one hundred. The causes of insanity are not numerous. They comprise heat, drink, hard campaigning, homesickness and loose ways of living. There is also a class of insanity patients who swell the number materially, but who have merely decided upon that method of escaping the service.\"</p> </blockquote>",
    "audioDescription": "The army attempted to improve conditions here as the volunteer soldiers returned home. In April 1901, the San Francisco Call paper reported: \"The volunteers in camp and regular troops at the Presidio were greatly pleased at the reopening of the Red Cross tent yesterday, and showed their appreciation by crowding the canvas structure. Magazines, newspapers and story books were eagerly grasped by the soldiers. Most of the men prefer a quiet spot and a periodical to read to spending their time roaming aimlessly about the camp. The intention is to secure a piano and a collection of all sorts of games to furnish amusement for the soldiers. Maps and atlases are greatly in demand and dictionaries are greatly needed. The tent will be lighted by electricity and be open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Chaplain Miller has secured it for one night a week and will endeavor to provide entertainment for the men. There are at present 9000 soldiers at the Presidio, and the reservation presents a lively aspect. Hundreds of visitors spend hours there daily, and the scene is not unlike the appearance of the reservation at the outbreak of the war. As the volunteer soldiers returned home, it became evident that the army would need to improve conditions here. The first indication that the camps needed something more than canvas tents came in May 1902 when Maj. Gen. Robert Hughes wrote to Washington saying: The Army has spent $60,000 on canvas at San Francisco since 1898 and something more permanent is required. I recommend construction of temporary barracks of rough lumber, double tier bunks, and small heating stoves for four battalions. To house and feed the returning soldiers, the Army constructed the wood-frame buildings across Lombard Street in 1903, incorporating them with the older wooden kitchens and mess halls surviving from the 1899 Model Camp. Even then, the conditions were considered substandard. The San Francisco Call reported in July of 1904: General Adna Chaffee, chief of staff United States Army, accompanied by General Charles Humphrey, made an inspection of the Presidio yesterday. There was no review, no salute, no inspection of the troops. Every department was inspected including the main barracks, cantonments, warehouses and both hospitals. General Chaffee now has a full understanding of the needs of the Presidio. On entering the post, General Chaffee was received in the little shack that serves as headquarters for the Infantry Cantonment. They could barely squeeze in there and Colonel Pitcher took advantage of the occasion to call attention to the needs of an administration building. As far as the cantonments are concerned, the head of the army made a special and complete investigation. Whether he recommends an appropriation for entirely new barracks or whether he will decide that the present quarters of the cantonment camps are sufficient remains to be seen.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The large, white boulder near the base of Bootlegger's Steps is local limestone. Mori Point is one of the few places in the San Francisco area where limestone occurs in industrial quantities. Mori's limestone interested the people that lived here through the centuries. Native Ohlone people quarried the rock for construction, decoration and trade.<br /> <br /> <br /> When the Spanish arrived in 1776, they used Mori's limestone for constructing buildings at the Presidio and Mission, as well as whitewash for Presidio structures. After a period of inactivity, the quarries became active again during rebuilding efforts after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and during World War II. By the 1980s, the quarries were shutting down for good.<br /> <br /> The limestone also interested local scientists, who wanted to know how these isolated limestone blocks formed. The marine fossils in the limestone bodies show that they formed on the shallow tops of submarine volcanoes in the central Pacific. Between 130 and 80 million years ago, these volcanoes took a ride towards North America on an ocean plate conveyor belt. When they arrived at the continent, the mountain peaks with their white limestone caps became lodged in the side of the continent rather than slipping under it like the rest of the ocean crust.</p>",

Many changes were happening here through this period. The San Francisco Call reported in the December of 1903:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The new gymnasium at the Presidio is nearing completion. It is a fine building and a most valuable adjunct to the fine quarters of the post. Also, in the gymnasium, there is to be a bowling alley, coffee and lunchroom, reading room and baths. The original Casual Camp No. 1 appears very different today from what it did during the Spanish American war. Then it was a rough hillside which sloped down into a steep ravine. Now all is being changed; a big gang of men, horses, plows and dump carts are leveling the place. When finished it will greatly add to that part of the post and make a magnificent site for a fine building. Down at the gun wharf a new torpedo station and torpedo cable station are being put in. On the beach two more storehouses are under construction. They will be 300 feet long by fifty feet wide. A new operation pavilion will soon be ready at the general hospital. During his trip to the East, Major Kendall will look into the purchasing of the newest and latest surgical appliances to be used in the new building. \"</p> </blockquote>",

    "audioDescription": "A sinuous two-lane paved highway runs northwest to southeast along the floor of a valley. The valley is bounded by a forested ridge to the west and a ridge to the east that is partially covered by trees and otherwise covered by chaparral. Along a tree-lined section of the highway, a section of the shoulder on its west side has been paved, large enough for three parked vehicles. A split-rail fence lines the paved parking area. A brown sign for the Olema Valley Trailhead stands adjacent to a gap in the fence that provides passage onto the trail that leads to the northwest. The Olema Valley Trailhead sign contains icons for no pets, no fires, but camping is allowed by permit only. On the east side of the highway are a number of short wooden posts and some moderate-sized boulders, along with a brown sign for the McCurdy Trailhead. The McCurdy Trailhead sign contains icons for no camping, no fires, but pets are allowed on leash. Further north on the west side of the highway is a large brown sign for Point Reyes National Seashore.",

    "bodyText": "<p>One of the most momentous events in Letterman Hospital's history occurred on May 24, 1901, when President McKinley visited and addressed veterans and patients from the Philippines at this very spot. The San Francisco Call newspaper gives this account of the President's visit.<br /> <br /> President McKinley's visit to the Presidio yesterday will live long in the memory of the gallant soldiers who were greeted by the commander in chief. Three-thousand strong, the recently returned volunteers from the Philippines listened to stirring words from the head of the nation, while the wan and wasted faces of the sick soldiers in the General Hospital brightened as the President passed through the wards and gave a kindly word to the men who lost their health in faraway jungles while fighting for the stars and stripes.<br /> <br /> Thousands of citizens flocked to the Presidio yesterday morning to witness the ceremonies. The big parade ground facing the General Hospital, was the spot where the volunteer soldiers gathered to listen to the words of the President.<br /> <br /> Suddenly the thunder of the guns told of the approach of the commander in chief and a tumult of applause greeted him as his carriage and escort swept past thousands of sightseers. The band struck up \"Hail to the Chief\" as the President's carriage drew up at the reviewing platform. As he walked along, the President glanced with pride at the 2000 stalwart men who stood rigidly at attention. The soldiers wore blue coats and trousers, brown leggings and brown slouch hats and carried no arms. As the President advanced to the front of the platform, the buglers sounded the salute and the cheers of the soldiers rent the air in mighty volume. The President raised his hand in salute, and when the cheering subsided addressed the men in terms of glowing praise.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I count myself very fortunate to have been in the city of San Francisco upon the arrival of your two regiments. I join with my fellow citizen of this city in giving you a welcome home, and at the same time express not only my own thanks as President of the United States but the gratitude of the American people for the splendid service you have rendered to your country in the past two years. Our hearts have been with you, our hopes have been with you; and we have realized in large measure peace as the result of the splendid work you performed in the Philippine Islands.\"</p> </blockquote>",

Like a lot of places in the region, this awesome area has been home to many cultural groups, beginning with the Ohlone who inhabited the area for thousands of years.<br /> <br /> Spanish colonial forces came on the scene in the 1700s, adding a new cultural layer to the landscape. After the Mexican Revolution in 1821, Mexican citizens began using the land for ranching. In 1846, the US went to war with Mexico, leading to the Bear Flag Revolt, an event that resulted in the declaration of an independent California Republic for a brief time before the territory was incorporated into the US.<br /> <br /> During World War II, the US Army built a gun battery at Milagra to protect the coast from enemy invasion. In 1953, a Nike missile launch site was installed during the Cold War. By 1987, Milagra Ridge had a chance to mellow out, and became part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area.<br />  </p>",

The cover story was that this place was an industrial laundry. Instead, this building was the training facility of the first MIS class, which had 30 graduates who had an accelerated six-month training after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The school was then moved to Fort Snelling in Minnesota, where over 6,000 men were trained over time.<br /> <br /> The graduates of the MIS became interpreters, interrogators, instructors, propaganda specialists and signal technicians whose work provided vital intelligence during the war. They saved countless Allied lives and hastened the end of the war. Collectively, the graduates of the MIS earned the Presidential Unit Citation.<br /> <br /> The army moved the school to Fort Snelling after its short time in the Presidio, when, in a dark historical twist, Japanese Americans living on the West Coast were placed in camps following President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066. This decision, a knee-jerk reaction to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, was implemented across the road from MIS in Building 35 at the Presidio Main Post.<br /> <br /> The center is now a <a href=\"https://njahs.org/640/\">museum </a> with exhibits and information about its historical use.</p> <h3>Japanese Internment</h3> <p>Soon after the Pearl Harbor attack, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. It granted the armed forces the authority to designate sections of the U.S. \"military areas,\" geographic zones where \"any and all persons may be excluded,\" if deemed potentially threatening or capable of carrying out acts of sabotage.<br /> <br /> Senior US Army official and Commander of the 4th Army and Western Defense Command at the Presidio in San Francisco, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt, designated the entire West Coast of the U.S a military area as per Order 9066. He then classified all persons of Japanese ancestry living on the West Coast potentially threatening, regardless of their citizenship. This decision led to a policy of internment, forcing Japanese men, women and children out of their homes to live in impoverished conditions in concentration camps.<br /> <br /> Even as families were living in camps, many had relatives fighting for the U.S. in the Pacific. Some were MIS graduates, highly trained linguists who provided invaluable service to US military efforts. These men fought bravely for a nation that assumed their families were capable of treason and stripped them of their rights, yet not a single internee was ever convicted of acting against the U.S. When the war ended, so did internment. But the effects of living in the camps continued and were passed down through the minds and bodies of former internees and their descendants.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>This area was originally the center of the Civil War-era army post; the western half of the post is gone, but the eastern side remains intact. Once the Civil War started, the army reclaimed Point San Jose. The post's prominent bluff, in tandem with the forts at Alcatraz and Fort Point, served as an ideal location to protect the city from Confederate attacks. The army evicted the civilian residents and tore down the Fremont's home to make way for new gun batteries.<br /> <br /> Like all Army posts that sprang up throughout the west, the military designed Point San Jose to function as a small, self-sufficient town. The post included a post headquarters, a hospital, barracks, and mess halls clustered around the main parade ground. The army usually constructed the more utilitarian and displeasing buildings, like the latrines and the stables, at the outskirts of the post. The fortunate Point San Jose officers enjoyed living in the elegant bay-front homes that the army had appropriated. In 1882, the army changed the post's name to Fort Mason to honor Colonel Richard Barnes Mason, the second military governor and commander of California (1847 to 1849).</p>",

Magazines, newspapers and story books were eagerly grasped by the soldiers. Most of the men prefer a quiet spot and a periodical to read to spending their time roaming aimlessly about the camp. The intention is to secure a piano and a collection of all sorts of games to furnish amusement for the soldiers. Maps and atlases are greatly in demand and dictionaries are greatly needed. The tent will be lighted by electricity and be open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Chaplain Miller has secured it for one night a week and will endeavor to provide entertainment for the men. There are at present 9000 soldiers at the Presidio, and the reservation presents a lively aspect. Hundreds of visitors spend hours there daily, and the scene is not unlike the appearance of the reservation at the outbreak of the war.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> As the volunteer soldiers returned home, it became evident that the army would need to improve conditions here. The first indication that the camps needed something more than canvas tents came in May 1902 when Maj. Gen. Robert Hughes wrote to Washington saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Army has spent $60,000 on canvas at San Francisco since 1898 and something more permanent is required. I recommend construction of temporary barracks of rough lumber, double tier bunks, and small heating stoves for four battalions.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> To house and feed the returning soldiers, the Army constructed the wood-frame buildings across Lombard Street in 1903, incorporating them with the older wooden kitchens and mess halls surviving from the 1899 Model Camp. Even then, the conditions were considered substandard. The San Francisco Call reported in July of 1904:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"General Adna Chaffee, chief of staff United States Army, accompanied by General Charles Humphrey, made an inspection of the Presidio yesterday. There was no review, no salute, no inspection of the troops. Every department was inspected including the main barracks, cantonments, warehouses and both hospitals. General Chaffee now has a full understanding of the needs of the Presidio. On entering the post, General Chaffee was received in the little shack that serves as headquarters for the Infantry Cantonment. They could barely squeeze in there and Colonel Pitcher took advantage of the occasion to call attention to the needs of an administration building. As far as the cantonments are concerned, the head of the army made a special and complete investigation. Whether he recommends an appropriation for entirely new barracks or whether he will decide that the present quarters of the cantonment camps are sufficient remains to be seen.\"</p> </blockquote>",

If you park outside of the parking lot, please be mindful of local street parking regulations.<br /> <br /> The view at the point is about 0.75 miles from the parking lot.</p> <h3>Speakeasies and Bootlegging</h3> <p>During Prohibition In the 1920s, Stefano Mori's son Jack was managing operations at the family inn and started serving alcohol at the roadhouse. Eventually, the Mori family bootlegging operation became so extensive it caught the attention of federal agents. The result was a finish worthy of a Hollywood film, when a shootout took place between \"Prohis\" and \"rumrunners.\" Jack Mori was arrested in 1923, and federal agents confiscated 24,000 cases of Canadian whiskey from the family farm.</p> <h3>Devil Music</h3> <p>Throughout the 1950s, future head of the Church of Satan Anton LaVey frequented the area, treating visitors to his talents on the organ at Mori Inn.</p> <h3>If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out!</h3> <p>The cult-classic 1971 film Harold and Maude filmed its final scene of a car careening off a cliffside on the bluff here at Mori Point.</p>",

In the 1700s, the Spanish mined nearby limestone to whitewash San Francisco's Presidio buildings. In the early 19th century Mori Point was part of the sprawling Rancho San Pedro, where both Spanish and Mexican interests used the land for cattle grazing, woodcutting and farming. When control of the region passed on to the US, the land grant was extended, and ranching activities increased.<br /> <br /> In 1888, Stefano Mori purchased 19 acres of farmland here. He and his family raised livestock and horses, and grew Brussels sprouts, cabbage and artichokes. The Mori family built a house on the northwestern corner of the point, with a kitchen to feed ranch hands, and rooms to house them. Years later, this building became Mori's Point Inn.</p> <h3>From Development to Restoration</h3> <p>For years, the landscape around Mori Point was marred by the limestone quarry operations, and later, off-road vehicle use. In the 1980s, developers proposed constructing a hotel and conference center, homes and a horse show arena on Mori Point. Thanks to the combined efforts of land agencies and community members, this development deal never went through.<br /> <br /> In 2000, with the help of the Pacifica Land Trust, the Coastal Conservancy and the community, Mori Point was purchased by the Trust for Public Land and later added to the Golden Gate National Parks. Restoration efforts have helped the area recover from invasive species introduced over centuries of human interference, and spurred the return of both native animals and plants.</p>",

The lake was partially filled when Highway 1 was built next to it in 1939. Since then, traffic pollution has led to an accumulation of heavy metals in the water, impacting our native animal friends. Further challenges came from residents releasing aquatic pets (including an alligator) that competed with native wildlife in the lake.<br /> <br /> With help from scientists, academic institutions and volunteers, Mountain Lake is rebounding. Thanks to an improvement in water quality, the Presidio Trust recently reintroduced the western pond turtle, pacific chorus frog and three-spined stickleback.<br /> <br /> Native submerged aquatic vegetation has also been successfully reintroduced to Mountain Lake, a sign that things are looking up for native species. More than 65 bird species visit the site, and the area has become a living classroom for students learning about ecology.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Facing south east from the parking lot, the bathrooms, recycling, trash and call box are all located on the left side of the lot, closest to the bridge that leads you over Big Lagoon to the beach. Outside the bathroom is a 4-sided kiosk. Approaching the kiosk will trigger audio description of its contents. <br /><br />Beyond the kiosk is a bench that offers a glimpse of the beach across a willow thicket. The beach is accessible by walking over the boardwalk bridge, which is just under one-fifth of a mile long, and leads you over the light, green willows that comprise Big Lagoon. The railings along the bridge are 4 feet high, made from wood and aluminum. Set into the left-hand wood railing about halfway across the boardwalk is a tactile wayside with four distinct panels. The first is of bird tracks walking across a sand dune. The second is of a western fence lizard perched on a rock. The last two are of native plants, the leafy, vine-like sand verdana, and the round-blossomed, thin-stalked rosilla.<br /><br />The boardwalk dead ends into a wall of blackberry and coastal scrub plants at the intersection of a dirt path. Go left for the Kaasi Coastal Fire Road, Green Gulch Trail and Dias Ridge Trail. These trails are all dirt, involve some stair climbing and steep inclines. Go right for beach access. An access mat leads you partially onto the sand. <br /><br />The beach is a wide and sandy. The shoreline is bookended by two rocky hillocks. Facing the water from the area of the beach where the trail leaves you, the hillock on the far end of the beach is tree-covered, and has several houses built upon it. The adjacent hillock is rocky, and undeveloped. A rutted staircase trail climbs its way over the rocks leading to a vista point that offers a more sweeping view of the Pacific. The water at Muir Beach may change color depending on weather and the time of year, but on sunny days, it's often a shade of aqua.",

Be wary, the poison oak is no joke out here.</p> <h3>Coastal Defense</h3> <p>One feature at the overlook that you can't miss is the base end \"fire control\" station. Unlike a gun battery, soldiers used massive spotting scopes to keep watch on the ocean horizon for enemy ships. Any sightings were reported back to a central communications and plotting center, then relayed to nearby gun batteries should artillery be needed.</p> <h3>Shake, Rattle and Roll</h3> <p>From the overlook, you'll see rocky coastline, bluffs, sandy beaches, mountain ridges, valleys and peninsulas reaching out into the Pacific. Each of these features are the result and a clue to tumultuous geologic events. The rocks that jut out from the water just beyond the bluffs are called sea stacks.<br /> <br /> Further inland, a careful eye will notice massive boulders dotting the hilly landscape. These boulders are part of a geologic phenomena known as mélange, a mish-mash of hard ancient sea floor deposits and lava mixed into soft mud deposits. The mélange was likely formed by giant earthquakes that tumbled rocks down into a deep sea subduction trench many tens of millions of years ago. During the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, this part of the just offshore San Andreas fault moved over 20 feet.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Muir Beach Overlook Road winds its way south west to the overlook parking lot. The parking lot is a semi-circular ring with a circumference of about 500 feet and three rows of parking. The row furthest to the south west is separated from the other two by a grassy median 110 ten feet long north to south and 17 feet wide east to west. Bathrooms are located along the north east edge of the parking lot. Trash and recycling cans are at the center of the bathroom building, against the outer wall. The south western perimeter of the parking lot is dotted with picnic tables. The Owl Trail begins at the north west corner of the parking lot and continues along the ridge of the cliff. To the south west, there are two short paths that lead from the parking lot to Muir Beach Overlook. The paths come together at a junction in front of a World War Two fire control station dugout. The dugout, or \"gopher hole\" is a partially submerged cement structure big enough for two men to stand. It resembles a pill, with a one-quarter section missing. Opposite the dugout to the south west are three interpretive wayside panels. The stair path continues to the south west, passing two more dugouts to the left on the way to Muir Beach Overlook. The corridor to the overlook is very windy. The path down to the overlook is a 500-foot series of stairs with a rail fence to either side. The path is wide enough for three people to walk abreast. On either side are clumps of thick coastal scrub and tall, green cypress trees with needle-covered branches. As you descend, the hillsides recede and the Pacific Ocean takes up more and more of the horizon. At the bottom of the stairs, the overlook itself, is a small, circular clearing with a railing around it. The view offers 180 degrees of the Pacific Ocean, and tall, rocky cliffs to the north and south along the coast.",

Tamalpais State Park. Weather and fire conditions can change suddenly, please check trail the <a href=\"http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page <strong>id=471\">Mt. Tamalpais</a> website for any closures of the connecting trails.<br /> <br /> NOTE: There is no cell service in Muir Woods. To use the app with partial functionality onsite, download the data to your phone ahead of time.<br /> <br /> Muir Woods offers an experience available in only a handful of places on Earth. The peaceful groves of old-growth coast redwoods found here are examples of the species <em>Sequoia sempervirens</em>, whose only habitat left on the entire planet is in pockets along the northern half of the California Pacific Coast.<br /> <br /> Muir Woods offers a space for quiet reflection in a filtered light forest environment. The immense height of the redwoods is sure to impress, but perhaps more amazing is the lifespan of these trees. The average age of the trees in Muir Woods is between 500-600 years, though some as old as 700-1,000 have been documented. In the right conditions, redwoods are capable of living up to 2,000 years. They're among the oldest living things on the planet, making Muir Woods a world-class destination that's not to be missed. Boasting accessible boardwalk trails and trailheads that lead through the forest to the coast, Muir Woods has adventures for all nature lovers, but dog friends must stay home.</p> <h3>Getting to Muir Woods</h3> <p>Muir Woods is a popular place in a hard to reach area. Planning ahead for how you'll get to and from the woods is essential. Reservations are required for all vehicles and shuttle riders. For parking and shuttle information and reservations go to <a href=\"https://gomuirwoods.com/\">GoMuirWoods.com</a> or call 1-800-410-2419.<br /> <br /> For a more peaceful experience, consider coming to the woods on a rainy day. Fewer people tend to venture to the woods when it's wet. The redwoods provide a fair amount of cover and can be quite beautiful in the rain. Another option is to come early or late in the day. From April to October, Muir Woods is open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Twilight visitors will find the trails quiet and uncongested. Mid-week is always less busy. For the more adventurous, you can plan a hike into the woods from one of the trailheads around Muir Woods.</p> <h3>Keeping California Wild: Establishing Muir Woods</h3> <p>Before the 1800s, California's northern coast was covered in approximately 2 million acres of redwood forests. Development and logging resulted in the loss of 97 % of these trees. The area along Redwood Creek, in what is now known as Muir Woods, may well have been logged too, had it not been so difficult to access. By the early 20th century, Redwood Creek contained one of the last uncut old-growth redwood stands in the Bay Area. Now, it's one of the only old-growth coast redwood forest left in the area, and one of the last on the entire planet.<br /> <br /> The preservation of Muir Woods is due to the efforts of Congressman and business mogul William Kent. Encouraged by his wife, environmentalist and women's rights activist Elizabeth Thacher Kent, the couple purchased 611 acres in the region in 1905. They promptly donated half the acreage to the Federal government to ensure its protection. Three years later, President Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt declared the site a National Monument, and suggested naming the woods after Kent. Kent declined the honor, giving instructions for the woods to be named after legendary environmentalist, philosopher and all around cool historical dude, John Muir. Muir was very grateful for the recognition saying, \"This is the best tree-lovers monument that could possibly be found in all the forests of the world.\"</p> <h3>Get Your Nature On: Trails in Muir Woods</h3> <p>Muir Woods has 6 miles of trails, including half hour, 1 hour and 1½ hour loops. There are additional trails that lead from Muir Woods into Mount Tamalpais State Park. Most of the trails in Muir Woods are asphalt or boardwalk, but some that lead far up the canyon are steep, rutted and often muddy.</p> <h3>Can't See the Forest for the Fog</h3> <p>Some know him as \"Karl,\" a thick gray fog who haunts the city and North Coast, especially during the summer. Karl is sometimes seen as a nuisance, but without him, we wouldn't have the redwoods. When inland temperatures are high, we get a visit from Karl, who comes in from over the ocean, providing a beneficial source of cooling moisture that collects in the forest greenery, and drips down to the forest floor. Karl plays a key role in supporting the forest. The moisture he brings during summer dry periods accounts for about 40 percent of the redwoods' moisture intake. Redwoods can move hundreds of gallons of water daily along their trunks from roots to crown. This water transpires through the trees' foliage, returning to the atmosphere.</p> <h3>ONE Tam at a Time</h3> <p><a href=\"http://www.onetam.org/\">ONE Tam</a> is a community-based initiative to ensure the preservation of Mount Tamalpais for the next century. ONE Tam raises awareness for the need to maintain the long-term health of the mountain, engage more volunteers in caring for its treasured resources and renew the spirit of philanthropy that was fundamental to keeping Mount Tam unspoiled over the last one hundred years. ONE Tam is a partnership between the following awesome organizations, dedicated to preserving wild areas in an increasingly digital age: California State Parks, Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, Marin County Parks, Marin Municipal Water District and the National Park Service.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Muir Woods National Monument<br />649 words.<br /><br />The entrance to Muir Woods National Monument is located along a sharp bend on Muir Woods Road. Limited accessible parking is available just to the east of the Visitor Center. Reservations are required. Please request an accessible parking space when you reserve.<br /><br />Facing west from the parking lot, the plaza is directly ahead of you. The plaza is an open space leading to the Visitor Center, ticket kiosk and entrance to the woods, all to the north. The Visitor Center is to the right of the ticket kiosk, and the entrance to the woods is a few feet further north behind both buildings. Bathrooms are located at the south west corner of the plaza, near the passenger drop off along Muir Woods Road.<br /><br />In the middle of the plaza is a bronze, three-dimensional tactile model of Muir Woods and the Redwood Creek Watershed. The plaza is lined with wooden benches around its perimeter. To the north, a large wooden sign marks the entrance to Muir Woods, and a lone redwood towers over the shorter canopy of Douglas firs that crowd out the sky. As you pass under the wooden sign the asphalt of the plaza becomes a boardwalk path.<br /><br />As you pass under the wooden entrance sign, you are immediately surrounded by a dense forest. The main section of Muir Woods is a 1.3 mile loop consisting of the Redwood Creek and Bohemian Grove Trails. The trails are a combination of wooden boardwalks and asphalt that circle around redwood groves and lead back to the Visitor Center and plaza. While you can take either trail to start, the loop is designed to begin with Redwood Creek Trail. From the entrance to the woods, Redwood Creek Trail is the path that forks slightly east, to the right.<br /><br />Along the Redwood Creek Trail, you will encounter the Muir Woods Cafe and gift shop, Redwood Creek, Founders Grove and Cathedral Grove. Four bridges cross over Redwood Creek from the Redwood Creek Trail. The first three link Redwood Creek Trail to Bohemian Grove Trail to the west. The fourth bridge leads up to the Hillside Trail. Take any of the first three bridges to the Bohemian Grove Trail in order to loop back to the Visitor Center and entrance.<br /><br />Beginning at the entrance sign to the woods, it is about a one tenth of a mile walk along Redwood Creek Trail to the Muir Woods Trading Company gift shop and cafe. A short series of stairs leads to the cafe and gift shop to the right of the trail. 75 feet further north, an accessible ramp to the right of the trail also provides access to the gift shop, cafe and bathrooms. The stairs and ramp lead to an outdoor patio. The cafe and gift shop are straight ahead, the bathrooms are to the left of the gift shop, which is left of the cafe. Left of the trail, directly opposite the junction that leads to the Muir Woods Trading Company is Bridge 1, which cuts west, or, to the left of Redwood Creek Trail.<br /><br />Continuing north about two tenths of a mile from the gift shop is Founders Grove, a wider section of the woods that features some of its largest redwoods. These coniferous giants have soft, pulpy bark with a reddish hue, which gives them their name. Park staff lead periodic talks on the history and ecology of Muir Woods in Founders Grove. <br /><br />Bridge 1 and Bridge 2 are two tenths of a mile apart. Bridge 2 and Bridge 3 are one tenth of a mile apart. Bridge 3 and Bridge 4 are half a mile apart. Bridge 3 is the final turnaround and connection between the Redwood Creek and Bohemian Grove Trails. Bridge 4 crosses over the creek and leads up to the Hillside Trail. A series of 21 wayside interpretive panels are arranged beginning in the plaza, along the loop trail, Cathedral Grove and the Bohemian Grove Trail.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The building behind the kiosk was the Presidio terminus of the trolley line from the downtown and the wharfs. With the increased in troop activity near the turn of the century came many changes at the Presidio. New orders restricting activities on the Presidio were issued in the spring of 1899:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"News reporters can no longer use a camera on the reservation. Women can neither enter a barracks nor sit on barracks porches or steps. Privates are not allowed to \"walk, stand, or lie\" on the boardwalk leading from officers' row to the trolley terminus. The civilian fruit stand at the terminus is to be closed and a post exchange opened at the site.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The new post exchange at this site supplied cigars and candy to soldiers and visitors, the profits of which contributed to the comfort and welfare of the command.<br /> <br /> In 1898 this was the edge of a large tent camp that spread over the area now covered by the Letterman Digital Arts Center. It was known as Camp Miller, and volunteer regiments like the First California volunteers camped here before going to fight the Spanish in the Philippines. This camp and others located up the hill across Lombard Street and over in Tennessee Hollow later became known as Camp Merriam, with its East and West Cantonments.<br /> <br /> While waiting to ship out, volunteers from around the country took part in the local sports scene. The entire 51st Iowa Infantry regiment took a train to Stanford University where its football team beat Stanford 6 to 0. Later the team tied the University of California 0-0.<br /> <br /> But by the end of October 1898 Camp Merriam lay almost deserted after most volunteers had sailed for the Philippine Islands. A year later these regiments began returning. The 51st Iowa's historian wrote of their return in 1899.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"General Shafter, himself, with cavalry and artillery, led our regiment on a parade from the pier up Market Street to Golden Gate Avenue, down Van Ness, then Lombard to the Presidio. Company M still had its two dogs, Bob and Dewey, who had gone overseas the year before. At the post, the brick barracks were familiar but nearby stood a new army general hospital. The hillsides were covered with round-topped tents pitched along well kept streets with adjacent wooden kitchens and other buildings.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The 1st Idaho Infantry left Manila on July 29. The ship was quarantined for two days at Yokohama, Japan, because of measles. Arriving in San Francisco Bay on August 29, the regiment marched to the Presidio, only quite a number were unable to stand the walk, and made the trip on the street cars. Pvt. James Camp wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"On the voyage home we had good food. We marched to Camp Presidio where we lived pretty good. The people from San Francisco brought us food to eat. The Sibley tents of the new Model Camp on the warm hillside had board floors and a small stove heated each.\"</p> </blockquote>",

    "audioDescription": "Located on the side of a hill off of Field Road, the Marin Headlands Nike missile site is a flat, paved area with only a few structures and several pieces of old army equipment left over from the days when the site was an active missile launch site. On approach to SF-88, the official name for the Nike site, you'll come to a ten foot tall chain link security fence with barb wire at the top. The fence goes all the way around the perimeter of the site, and the entrance from the road is a section that must be rolled aside to allow cars or persons inside. Just past the gate is a small, aqua colored booth with two mannequin soldiers inside. The booth has been preserved in a fashion that suggests current usage. The desk is covered in papers and old soda cans. At the desk is a typewriter, and along the shelves to the back, a walkie talkie and a radio. Phones are mounted to the wall between the window panes. A sign is posted that reads in all-capital block letters, \"SMOKING PERMITTED WITHIN THIS BUILDING.\" The mannequin army men are standing at attention in full uniform facing the entrance. A paved road takes you further into the site past the security booth to a more centralized parking area in front of a one-story rectangular building reminiscent of a duplex, with two sets of double doors set equidistantly from each other. There are several picnic tables out front between the parking lot and the building, as well as a trash and recycling bin up against the building's façade on the right. There are two large pieces of radar equipment behind the duplex-looking building. One is on a raised, 10-sided polygon platform. One is a large sphere, covered in an army green tarp, a missile guidance radar. The other is supported by a cylindrical column, and has a shape similar to a rectangular prism, a LOPAR acquisition radar. Opposite the radars are two white, metal rectangular trailers. The Nike site isn't immediately visible from other areas close by in the Headlands, but the site, you have panoramic views of the surrounding hills and lowlands.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Ocean Beach is a great hang. The sunniest months are September and October, but Ocean Beach always draws a crowd. San Francisco tends to be cool and gray, even at the beach. During the late spring and summer months the coast can get fogged in, but it's still beautiful. Just remember to bring a hoodie and you'll be a lot happier under the fog dome.<br /> <br /> Running the length of the Sunset and Richmond neighborhoods, there's plenty of space at Ocean Beach for the whole family.</p> <h3>Ocean Safety</h3> <p>It's never safe to swim at Ocean Beach and even wading is dangerous. Unpredictable tides and rip currents (strong, swift-moving channels of water) can pull swimmers offshore. If you're caught in a rip current, swim parallel to the beach until you're free of it, then swim toward shore with incoming waves. If you need assistance, wave your arms and yell for help.</p> <h3>Fires on Ocean Beach</h3> <p>You can have a fire on Ocean Beach if you follow these simple rules:</p> <ul> <li>Build a fire in 1 of the 16 provided fire rings. Fires are only permitted in the provided fire rings, which are first come, first served. They are available March through October only</li> <li>Extinguish fires by 9:30pm</li> <li>One adult (18+) must accompany every 10 minors</li> <li>No permit required except for groups larger than 25 people. Groups larger than 25 must obtain a <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/gogaspug\">Special Use Permit</a></li> <li>To see all the regulations regarding beach fires at Ocean Beach, visit <a href=\"http://go.nps.gov/beachfires\">http://go.nps.gov/beachfires</a> .</li> </ul> <h3>A Greener Beach</h3> <p>The low relief coastline at Ocean Beach is susceptible to sea level rise. Burning fossil fuels like coal and gas releases carbon dioxide, which acts like a blanket around the planet, disrupting the climate. As global temperatures rise, so will ocean tides, encroaching on shorelines like this one.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service is taking steps to curb the effects of climate change so that places like Ocean Beach don't disappear as a result of severe erosion. One action we are taking is to demonstrate sustainable practices like the wind turbine that produces power for the Cliff House, and the environmentally friendly Lands End Lookout.</p> <h3>Protected Plover Nesting Area</h3> <p>Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the western snowy plover, a threatened species that rests here in the winter. In California, there's been a significant decline in plover breeding locations due to human disturbance. In an attempt to protect the plovers, the National Park Service is carefully monitoring the species, and creating buffers between them and humans so they have a chance to bounce back. Let's remember that other bird and animal friends can use our help, too.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Ocean Beach is organized by a series of 28 numbered stairwells beginning with stairwell number 1 at the north end of the beach closest to Lands End and continuing south. The stairwells are breaks in the seawall which runs the length of Ocean Beach. Each stairwell is labeled with a square sign featuring a tactile number and braille representation of each stairwell's number on the inside right corner of each stairwell before you descend the steps to the sandy beach. Use the numbered stairwells as an orientation guide so you can walk freely along the beach as long as you'd like, and when you're ready to turn back, have an accurate understanding of how far you've ventured from your starting point. <br /><br />An accessible starting point to Ocean Beach is Judah and La Playa on the N Judah MUNI.",

    "bodyText": "<p>On November 4, 1769, a group of weary, half-starved hikers climbed what is now known as Sweeney Ridge and became the first Europeans to see San Francisco Bay. This group was led by Spanish explorer Captain Juan Portolá.<br /> <br /> Portolá, who's party of sixty men (with a caravan of 200 horses and mules for riding and the pack train), came from San Diego in search of Monterey Bay, but failed to recognize it from their overland approach.<br /> <br /> The expedition members were hungry, lost, and sick after a six months' journey. They were welcomed and assisted by the local Native people along the way. The local Ramaytush Ohlone Aramai tribe of modern-day Pacifica accompanied the explorers to the top of Sweeney Ridge, where they viewed the expanse of the bay.<br /> <br /> For millennia the Ohlone people had lived here and followed seasonal rounds of hunting, fishing, and managing the land for their needs. The Spanish \"discovery\" of San Francisco Bay would soon mean the loss of Ohlone lives, homelands and traditional ways when Spanish colonization started seven years later.<br /> <br /> Captain Gaspar de Portolá's first sighting of San Francisco Bay has long been memorialized in the Bay Area. In 1987, Sweeney Ridge became part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Today there are two permanent monuments at the \"discovery\" site -- the first was installed in 1975, and the second eight years later.</p> <h3>The Impact of Spanish Colonization</h3> <p>In 1769, about 2,000 Ramaytush Ohlone people inhabited the San Francisco Peninsula, living in a network of ten independent tribes. Villages varied in size from 50 to 500 people. Everyone contributed to their family's well-being, but individuals could become, among other things, accomplished hunters, fishermen, bow or spear crafters, singers, shamans, healers, or basket makers. Headmen advised food gathering or seasonal relocation, and had the authority to resolve inter-tribal and intra-tribal conflicts.<br /> <br /> This way of life was disrupted after Portoláv's \"discovery\" in 1769. Mission Dolores was founded 7 years later, and almost all of the people native to the San Francisco Peninsula had either joined the Mission or died by 1801. Conditions at the mission were poor, and life expectancy after baptism averaged four years. Despite generations of legalized servitude and tribal dismantling, Ohlone people continue to tell stories and preserve their cultural history here in the San Francisco Peninsula today.<br /> <br /> Information sourced from Linda Yamane and Jonathan Cordero.</p>",

Stop into the front office for maps and park info.<br /> <br /> In 1902, the army constructed this building as the post's army hospital, complete with a 12-bed ward. After four years the army brass was already considering it for major re-tooling since most wounded soldiers were being cared for at the new and larger Letterman Army Hospital in the Presidio. The army then used this building as a kind of a glorified closet for storage, temporary barracks and performing non-essential tasks. That all changed in 1912, when the army constructed a major depot on Fort Mason's shoreline, for the conveyance of cargo and troops. Suddenly, the building had purpose again: to serve as the headquarters for the new shipping center, that 20 years later, was renamed the San Francisco Port of Embarkation.</p>",

From the Franklin and Bay Street entrance, continue straight on Franklin Street, then turn left at the stop sign at MacArthur Avenue. Free visitor parking is available in front of the Whalen Building, which houses the Parks Conservancy offices in addition to the National Park Service's operations. The building is three stories, painted a cream color over brick facade with rows of rectangular windows. Facing the Whalen, there is a flagpole to its right, and palm trees to either side. There is a green grass lawn in front, with a walkway leading from the parking lot to the building's main entrance, at its center.<br />End",

Century-old stumps and steam powered sawmill remnants are still visible. Thankfully for nature lovers, so are the redwoods, which have grown back along the creeks and trails.</p> <h3>Trails at Phleger Estate</h3> <p>The trails at Phleger Estate combine for approximately 4.6 miles of moderately difficult out-and-back hiking under the cover of secondary growth redwoods. For access to the trails at Phleger, park in the lot near Huddart County Park, on the southern side of the estate. The trails here are well maintained and frequented by equestrian horse-friend types, but are also great for hikers. No dogs or bicycles are permitted at the Phleger Estate.</p> <h3>San Andreas Activity</h3> <p>The San Andreas fault line runs through Phleger Estate forming a rift valley of low-lying, marshy terrain along Union Creek. The area west of the fault is rising due to pressure built up along the fault, forming the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west. The mountains rose about three feet during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.</p> <h3>Gold-Digging</h3> <p>In 1848, when gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, people from all over the states and indeed, the world, went gold-crazy. San Francisco's population ballooned from a few hundred to more than 30,000. The need for homes, hotels, businesses and other buildings helped fuel a lucrative logging industry, including Phleger Estate, then known as Mountain Meadow.</p> <h3>Private Estate to National Park</h3> <p>Herman Phleger, a respected San Francisco lawyer and his wife Mary Elena Phleger, bought the large country house above west Union Creek in 1931. They were early supporters of the Save-the-Redwoods League, and in 1994, Mary Phleger sold the estate to the Peninsula Open Space Trust. The land was then turned over to the National Park Service.</p>",

These invasives have not co-evolved with local species that might control their abundance, so many of the locals can't compete with them.<br /> <br /> Here are a few native and non-native species you may see at Mori Point.</p>",

Tickets fo Sunset Tours can be obtained on recreation.gov</em></p> <h3>Prismatic Power</h3> <p>Back in the day, Point Bonita was powered by a Fresnel lens, a design that was first developed in 1822. The genius of the Fresnel lens is that it's able to focus a natural light source into a powerful beam. Without any kind of focus, an open flame loses nearly 97% of its light. Even with reflectors, a flame still loses 83% of its light, but a Fresnel is a horse of a different color. Fresnel lenses focus a flame so intensely that they only lose 17% of their light, which is why ships could see the light at Point Bonita up to 18 miles out to sea.</p> <h3>Tether Kids</h3> <p>The lightkeeper's quarters were located right next to the lighthouse. As the work was hard and the hours long and lonely, some of the lighthouse keepers of the late 19th and early 20th century brought their families to live with them. While living on this treacherous cliff, they would strap their children into harnesses attached to ropes tied around a post whenever they played outside so they wouldn't fall off the edge during a stiff wind or while chasing after a stray ball. One must wonder if this was done more for the amusement of the parents than anything else.</p> <h3>\"You Must Go Out...\"</h3> <p>In 1874, the government approved plans for lifesaving stations at the entrance of Golden Gate, but not until 1899 did construction on the Point Bonita US Life Saving Station begin. Plans called for a residence, cisterns, fire and storage sheds, a garage and sidewalks. Construction was to last 90 days, but rough swells and difficult terrain delayed the project's completion. Unsafe conditions due to inclement weather even led to an accident that resulted in the contractor's foot being crushed.<br /> <br /> Point Bonita Life Saving Station had two boats; a heavy lifeboat that was essential to navigating in the dangerous conditions of the rocky coast, and a surfboat, a lighter vessel that was launched directly through the surf. Typically, eight to ten men manned the lifesaving station, which was operated by the Coast Guard. Some say the brave men's motto was \"You must go out, but you don't have to return.\"</p> <h3>Hat Cliff</h3> <p>A perennial stiff breeze has led to a geologic anomaly here at Point Bonita. As you walk out of the tunnel look to your left and see the thickening strata of assorted caps that's formed along the cliffside. If you're wearing a hat, be careful not to fall victim to the wily wind!</p>",

Please stay established paths. There are uneven surfaces, loose rock formations, and steep drop offs in the surrounding areas.  Off-trail travel harms plants and causes erosion. </p> <h3>Perilous passage</h3> <p>Despite the lighthouse, navigation through the Golden Gate continued to be dangerous. Over 300 ships ran aground during the Gold Rush years. The worst disaster occurred in 1901, when the steamer ship <em>SS City of Rio de Janeiro</em> collided with Point Diablo, near Point Bonita. The bulkheads of the ship weren't water tight, and those below deck were left in darkness as the steamer filled with water. The ship backed off the rock where it ran aground and sank in ten minutes along with 128 passengers.</p> <h3>Point Bonita through the centuries</h3> <p>In 1874, the government approved plans for lifesaving stations at the entrance of Golden Gate. Twenty-five years later, in 1899, construction began on the <strong>Point Bonita US Life Saving Station</strong>. Plans called for a residence, cisterns, fire and storage sheds, a garage and sidewalks. Unsafe conditions due to inclement weather hindered construction.<br /> <br /> <br /> Point Bonita Life Saving Station had two boats; a heavy lifeboat that was essential to navigating in the dangerous conditions of the rocky coast, and a surfboat, a lighter boat launched directly through the surf. Typically eight to ten men manned the lifesaving station, which was operated by the Coast Guard. Some say the brave men's motto was \"You must go out, but you don't have to return.\"<br />  </p> <h3>From Cannons to Laser Foghorn</h3> <p>When Point Bonita is cloaked in fog, ships navigate by sound. Originally, a cannon gave the warnings, but this method was replaced first by a fog bell, and in 1874, a steam siren. Now, a laser beam is used to detect water and dirt particles on the light. When particles accumulate, an electric foghorn is triggered.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Beginning at the parking lot at Battery Mendell, is the half-mile trail to Point Bonita lighthouse. The trail starts as a paved walkway overlooking the bay with views of the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco. The trail descends as the terrain to either side of the guardrails becomes rocky and dips closer to the water. The path curves left around a pointed rock crag that juts 235 feet overhead. As you go left around the crag more of the shoreline comes into view, revealing a horseshoe-shaped cove with a long, downward-sloping rock cliff at its far end. The water is full of rocks and wooden pilings, the remains of an old pier. The shore is gray and rocky. Harbor seals use this cove to rest, you can see their whitish-gray bodies lying side-by-side on the rocks below. Continuing on, the trail narrows until only two can walk abreast between the metal guardrails as the trail leads you directly to the crag. In the side of the rock is a large metal door, the entryway into a narrow, damp hand-carved tunnel. The tunnel is 118 feet long with a ceiling that's six feet six inches tall. At the top entrance, the tunnel is four feet wide and six feet wide nearest the lighthouse. The walls and ceiling are rough, gnarled rock. The tread underfoot is smooth from wear. Immediately upon exiting the tunnel there's a thick row of poison oak on the left hand side of the trail that continues until you reach the first of two boardwalk bridges with white metal railings that form a path through the jagged rock cliffs. It's here you can see the first views of the lighthouse. Perched off to the right, beyond the second bridge, atop the narrowest, lowest portion of the cliff rocks. After crossing over the first bridge you'll come to an area to the left of the trail surrounded by a white picket fence. This area offers views of the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco, along with a bench to rest and take in the sights. To the right of the rest area is a white, wooden suspension bridge that leads straight to the lighthouse. The bridge is slightly arched, and leads you over a narrow, stretch of cliff. Don't be surprised when you feel the bridge sway as you walk across it. Once you're over the bridge you'll step onto a concrete walkway with a metal railing guiding you to the lighthouse just a few feet ahead. The lighthouse is only one story tall inside a brick building painted white with forest green doors and window shutters. The light is protected by a glass decahedron cover surrounding the lens inside. The top of the light enclosure is capped in bronze, with a decorative sphere and single spike projecting above its center.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The hand-carved tunnel that cuts a path through pillow basalt on the way to the lighthouse gets a check-plus for spooky atmosphere, but it must have been even scarier walking around the cliff before the tunnel was constructed.</p> <h3>Who Built the Tunnel?</h3> <p>The short answer is, we don't know. But why don't we know? Whoever made the tunnel had to carve a path straight through basalt rock big enough for people. No small task. For government agencies not to have kept records about such an endeavor is curious, since so much of what they did was carefully regimented and recorded. Was there a reason for an intentional forgetting of the facts? One theory is that the tunnel was completed by Chinese immigrants, conscripted to work in unsafe conditions for extremely low pay. We'll probably never know, but the theory itself has value. Regardless of whether it's true or not, it's a powerful reminder that most of history is invisible, yet produces tangible results.</p>",

As part of a military post, the small adobe building that would become the Officers' Club served military officers of three nations. Today it is a great space to enjoy an elegant meal or plan an event. It's also a great place to spend an afternoon taking in the historic and artistic exhibits on display.</p> <h3>Heritage Gallery</h3> <p><em>Open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. - 5 p.m.</em><br /> The Heritage Gallery showcases artifacts from the diverse cultures and overlapping historical narratives that describe the complex history of the Presidio in the context of California, the nation and its people. The gallery also features films, images, artifacts and multimedia exhibits.<br /> <br /> Been before? The gallery has short-term as well as permanent displays, so there's always something new to see.</p> <h3>Archaeology Lab</h3> <p><em>Open Wednesdays - Guided tours 1 p.m., open lab 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.</em><br /> Discovering the past is hard, ongoing work. Come take a look at what technicians from the <a href=\"http://www.presidio.gov/volunteer/Pages/archaeology.aspx\">Presidio Archaeology Lab</a> are doing to make sense of the clues left behind from the original Presidio colonial site.</p> <h3>Preserving the Heart of the Presidio</h3> <p>The adobe walls of this key building have stood for almost 250 years and have their own long history of renovation and restoration. Beginning in 1776, Spanish and Mexican forces occupied and then abandoned the post, allowing the adobe to fall into disrepair. In 1847, the US Army rebuilt the building when its soldiers started to occupy the Presidio. In the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) remodeled the Officers' Club to resemble the Mission Revival style.<br /> <br /> The 1970s saw the addition of the bell tower, and restoration in 2011-2016 sought to highlight historical preservation and integrate the Officers' Club into modern San Francisco while reinforcing the structure of the building. Visit the Mesa Room in the club to see the building's history peeled back.</p> <h3>History of a Happening Place</h3> <p>The history of the Officers' Club is the history of the Presidio. Over the years, the building that is now the Presidio Officers' Club has housed living quarters for Spanish and Mexican soldiers, barracks for the U.S. Army, a mess hall and kitchen, laundresses' quarters, post headquarters, an assembly hall, a ballroom, a restaurant and bar, and now a museum.</p> <p><strong>The Spanish Conquest</strong></p> <p>The year is 1776. In one week, some upstarts in Philadelphia will sign the Declaration of Independence. On the West Coast, an expedition of almost 200 mestizo soldiers and colonists, one priest and 1,000 head of cattle under the command of Juan Bautista de Anza arrive here after traveling from Nueva España (now Mexico). These colonists, under command of Lieutenant Jose Joaquin Moraga, established a tiny military garrison, <em> el Presidio de San Francisco</em>. It was the northernmost Spanish settlement in the New World.<br /> <br /> <br /> In the earliest days, Presidio soldiers concerned themselves with protecting the frontier and forcing the indigenous peoples into newly established Spanish-style communities. They built many of the simple buildings from the very available adobe clay, which unfortunately quickly deteriorated from the rain and harsh winds. This building served as the commander's residence and headquarters for the soldiers living here; much later it would become the Officers' Club.<br /> <br /> <br /> Thin soil and strong coastal winds made agriculture and cattle grazing difficult, but the colonists bent themselves to the task. The bay was the Spanish wild frontier and their efforts took a toll on the land, their bodies and their culture. The Presidio's residents were largely on their own.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Mexican Independence and the Presidio</strong><br /> Despite Spain's efforts to fortify the area, wild Alta California became a Mexican territory with the victory of the Mexican Revolution and subsequent independence from Spain in 1821. The modest adobe structure continued to be the commander's home and headquarters for the Presidio under Mexican rule. In 1834, the Presidio was temporarily abandoned when the soldiers moved north to Sonoma to defend that area from Russian and American encroachment. When the US military arrived in 1846, the commander's residence as well as many of the post's buildings were virtually in ruins, and the bay was essentially unprotected.</p> <h3>From US Military Post to National Park Service Park</h3> <p><strong>The US Army comes to the Presidio </strong><br /> The Mexican-American War exhausted Mexico's resources to hold its northern territories. As the Bear Flag Revolt of 1846 routed Mexican forces from the area, the abandoned Presidio was occupied by the US Army. With the flurry of the California Gold Rush in 1849, protection of the San Francisco Bay and its golden cargo became paramount. Fort Point was established, and the Presidio was once again a hub of activity and command. The remodeled building became a barracks, and by the 1880s, became a place for officers to rest and relax.<br /> <br /> <strong>The New Presidio Officers' Club</strong><br /> By the Spanish-American War of 1898, the adobe building built by mestizos and soldiers over 120 years earlier became the officers' club for the most important military port of the Pacific. For nearly 100 years, a constant stream of US troops came to and left from the Presidio, shuttled from the mainland to new US possessions in the Pacific. The Presidio Officers' Club served as an institution for rest, relaxation and entertainment for the leaders of our troops as they served our country.<br /> <br /> <strong>Post to Park, 1994</strong><br /> The Officers' Club, as a part of the Presidio, became a National Park Service site in 1994, officially ending almost 250 years of military service. At the time of its closure, the Presidio was the oldest continuously operating military base in the country and contained a National Historic Landmark District with hundreds of historically significant buildings. As part of the agreement that established Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1972, the Presidio was transferred to the park service when Congress decided to close the base as a part of a military base reduction program.<br /> <br /> <br /> Its history as a focal point for the main post continues today for the citizens of San Francisco. A museum and cultural center, gallery, shops, a restaurant, and private and public events fill a busy calendar. Free and open to all, the Presidio Officers' Club offers exhibits tracing the Presidio's past and present, free live music and talks, weekend crafts for kids, and school field trips.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Presidio Officers' Club is a large, sprawling building in the old Spanish mission style, complete with white stucco walls and a red tile roof. In front of the building, just off of the street, is a row of spiky cacti. As you face the Officers' Club from the parking lot directly in front of it, you'll see the entranceway with a pair of heavy brown doors in line with the crosswalk. Mounted on either side of the entrance is a bronze Spanish cannon, weathered to a blue-green patina. The entrance is part of a one-story section of the building that stretches off to the left, with an angled tile roof overhead, and wooden posts every few feet. The roof hangs down past the wall, creating a covered walkway below. To the right of the walkway and entrance the building becomes nearly two stories tall, with a broad, white faced facade facing the street. The facade has three rectangular windows, taller than they are wide, set equidistantly from each other along the first story. At the level of the second story, at the top-center portion of the facade, is a small circular window. <br /><br />The facade has squared off sides, and comes together at a point at the top. The red tile roof is angled like that of an A-frame house. The facade is but one side of the building which stretches further back, away from the street, connecting the front of the Officer's Club to the rest of the building in the rear. This section is even taller, reaching a full two stories, and is visible from the parking lot. On the second level is a veranda facing the parking lot. The top section is lined with windows and on the far left, a square tower with two rounded windows and a red tile roof rises above every other part of the building.",

The Public Health Service District is an increasingly popular entry point to trails in the Presidio's Southern Wilds. Parking is limited, so arrive early.</p> <h3>Southern Wilds Trails</h3> <p>You can access four in-and-out trails from here into the Southern Wilds area. Each trail is moderate to easy in its terrain, and offers incredible opportunities to explore the wild Presidio. Be warned! Parking at the trailheads is limited and tricky.</p> <ul> <li>Anza Trail 2.7 miles</li> <li>Mountain Lake Trail 2.6 miles</li> <li>Park Trail 1.7 miles</li> <li>Lobos Creek Valley 0.8 miles</li> </ul> <p>No dog friends allowed, please.</p> <h3>Changing facades: Public Health Service Hospital</h3> <p>Back in the 1800s, San Francisco was still a wild-eyed beast of a port town full of ship-bound fortune hunters. There wasn't a lot in the way of social services then, but one place you could go if you were a merchant seaman in need of aid was the US Marine Hospital, which provided free treatment to sailors of all nations.<br /> <br /> Built in 1875, the Marine Hospital operated until 1932, when it was replaced by the building that stands here now, the Public Health Service Hospital. Two wings were added to the front of the building in the 1950s. The work of caring for ailing sailors continued when the Public Health Service took over.<br /> <br /> <br /> Eventually, the hospital extended its programs to caring for members of the US Coast Guard and other governmental agencies, as well as Native Americans and Vietnamese refugees. The Public Health Service also conducted important research on plague and other communicable diseases.<br /> <br /> After the hospital's closure in 1981, the Military Language Institute used part of the facility from 1982 to 1988. In the early 2000s, the building became a major destination for graffiti artists. In 2009, the Presidio Trust demolished the wings that were added in the 1950s, and the following year the main building reopened as the Presidio Landmark apartments.<br /> <br /> Located in the heart of the Presidio, the historic apartments offer amenities equal to modern apartment complexes throughout the city, with similar rents.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h4>What is Quartermaster Reach?</h4> <p>Quartermaster Reach is a restored seven-acre tidal marsh along the Presidio’s northern shoreline near Crissy Field. It is here that the freshwater stream from the Presidio’s largest watershed (known as <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/places/tennessee-hollow-watershed\">Tennessee Hollow</a>) flows into the saltwater <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/places/crissy-marsh\">Crissy Marsh</a> and ultimately to San Francisco Bay, creating valuable brackish habitat where plants and animals thrive.</p> <p>The site is named for the U.S. Army’s Quartermaster Corps, which operated in the area when the Presidio was a military post. Quartermaster Reach Marsh is located just east of the <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/tunnel-tops\">Presidio Tunnel Tops</a>, which open to the public in fall 2021. Together, the sites will create a wonderful new experience of the waterfront.</p> <h4>Connect with Nature</h4> <p>Visitors can enjoy an up-close experience of nature along an elevated pedestrian bridge and trail that winds through the marsh. Native salt marsh and riparian plants grown at Presidio Nursery create an extraordinary habitat for fish, crabs, and oysters. Bring your binoculars – Quartermaster Reach is a great place for birding.</p> <p>For the first time, visitors can use this new section of the <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/trails/tennessee-hollow-trail\">Tennessee Hollow Trail</a> to walk from Crissy Field’s East Beach, through Quartermaster Reach, under the Presidio Parkway, and along the 1.2 route tracing the watershed’s springs to their origin near Inspiration Point.</p> <h4>Access + Amenities</h4> <p>Quartermaster Reach is located south of Mason Street at Crissy Field, not far from <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/places/east-beach\">East Beach</a>. The MUNI 30 bus stops nearby at the intersection of Mason Street and Halleck Street. The site is also just a five minute walk from the <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/places/presidio-transit-center\">Presidio Transit Center</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/places/presidio-visitor-center\">Presidio Visitor Center</a>. Parking is available at a lot to the west on Mason Street and at East Beach. The nearest restrooms are at East Beach.</p> <h4>About the Marsh Restoration</h4> <p>Quartermaster Reach Marsh restoration is the latest milestone in the 20-year revitalization of the Tennessee Hollow Watershed.</p> <p>An Army-era landfill placed over the former saltmarsh was recently removed at Quartermaster Reach, enabling us to bring an 850-foot length of stream once contained in a pipe back to the surface. Box culverts were then installed beneath Mason Street at Crissy Marsh to allow the fresh water of the stream to flow into the saltwater marsh and San Francisco Bay.</p> <p>Specially fabricated fiberglass panels installed within the culverts, and concrete and shell “reef balls” placed in the marsh channels, promote the resurgence of the native Olympic oyster. The Presidio is planting 23,000 plants - including more than 40 different species of saltmarsh and dune plants grown in the Presidio Nursery - to create habitat for migratory shorebirds and water animals like fish and crabs.</p> <p>Restoration was sponsored by the Presidio Trust, the National Park Service, and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy.</p> <p> </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Rancho, or Rancho Corral de Tierra, if you're not into brevity, is the latest addition to Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The Spanish viewed the ridge and coastline that spans around present Half Moon Bay as having a similar shape to a large, natural corral, which led to the name Rancho Corral de Tierra, meaning \"corral of the earth.\"<br /> <br /> Rancho is nearly 4,000 acres of protected agricultural, equestrian-use and undeveloped land. An ongoing project, Rancho is a beautiful work in progress. Plans are underway for new and improved trails that'll open over time.</p> <h3>Trails at Rancho Corral de Tierra</h3> <p>Currently, there is no public parking at Rancho, but we're working on it! For now, you can access the trails by parking at either the Montara State Beach or in the neighborhoods at Montara. You also can hike in from McNee Ranch State Park or Gray Whale Cove State Beach to the north.<br /> <br /> Hiking at Rancho can be strenuous. Going through McNee State Park, you can hike up the 8-mile partial loop to Montara Mountain, gaining 2,000 feet in just over a mile. Gray Whale Cove Trail is a less lengthy, less strenuous scenic alternative. Trails at Rancho are currently being repaired. For now, the trails are very steep and sometimes eroded, making hiking conditions difficult.</p> <h3>Lichen at Rancho Corral de Tierra</h3> <p>Unique mutualism between algae and fungus (or algae and cyanobacteria) is seen everywhere in the abundant lichen found on trees, rocks and logs at Rancho. A recent survey found 96 different lichen species in the area, including a few rare and never-before-seen species in this part of California. What's more, lichen have a likin' for areas with excellent air quality, another great reason to explore this remote part of the GGNRA.</p> <h3>Walkin' Wildlife</h3> <p>Rancho is comprised of 4,262 acres of wildlands that countless critters call home. To help keep our animal friends safe from human impacts like freeways and roads, the GGNRA is helping to construct wildlife corridors, safe passages from habitat to habitat that avoid roadways. Cameras reveal that grey foxes, bobcats, coyotes and mountain lions are some of the animal friends making use of the existing walkway.</p> <h3>Grassland Restoration at Rancho</h3> <p>Less than one percent of California's native grasslands remain. Their loss is largely due to development, invasive plants, and changes in fire and grazing patterns that have allowed larger woody plants to take over, and have pushed out many grassland-dependent mammals and nesting birds.<br /> <br /> Rancho Corral de Tierra's precious remaining native grasslands are one of the things that make this place so special; however, some of these patches are in imminent danger of being lost to invasive weeds.<br /> <br /> NPS recently launched a three-year project that aims to restore some of Rancho's hardest hit grassland areas. The hillsides in Montara will undergo a dramatic transformation as invasive grasses and trees are removed.<br /> <br /> The bare ground will be treated with rice straw to prevent erosion and keep weeds from resprouting. Once the weeds are under control, native grassland, wildflower, and wetland species will be replanted to recreate a more natural, beautiful, and diverse landscape.</p> <h3>Rancho - A History of Many People</h3> <p>A crescent-shaped stone tool found just west of Rancho Corral de Tierra was carbon dated between 5,500 and 8,000 years old, making the tool one of the oldest indicators of human presence in the area. The tool places people in the area 500 to 2,500 years before the Ohlone are thought to have arrived.<br /> <br /> At the time the Spanish arrived in 1769, the Chiguan Ohlone occupied the territory from Montara Mountain down to Half Moon Bay. The area was sparsely populated; probably no more than 50 people lived in the area.<br /> <br /> When Mexico gained prominence in the area, they turned Rancho into two land grants. The holdings were all the way to the ocean to the west and as far inland as the coastal mountains. Later, during the Gold Rush, Rancho served as a home to many immigrant groups including the Irish, Italian, Chinese and Portuguese, as well as the original Mexican \"Californio\" people, all of whom came to cultivate the land.<br />  </p> <h3>Gangsters and Brussel Sprouts</h3> <p>The coastal areas of Rancho Corral are historically famous for growing artichokes, and for bootlegging during Prohibition. Back in the day this awesome place had close connections to organized crime, including an outfit run by Al Capone's brother-in-law, who had a notorious roadhouse nearby, where gangsters left the remains of person killed in a \"hit.\"<br /> <br /> By 1940, San Mateo County farmers supplied artichokes, Brussel sprouts and cabbage to California markets. Rancho continued to be cultivated up until the environmental movement of the mid 1970s, when San Mateo County began surveying and studying the land's significance. In 2005, Congress approved the expansion of the GGNRA to include Rancho Corral de Tierra.</p>",

The valley is bounded by a forested ridge to the west and a ridge to the east that is partially covered by trees and otherwise covered by cattle-grazed pasture lands. A barbed-wire fence line runs along the east side of the highway. An old dirt and gravel ranch road branches off of the highway and passes through a 10-foot-wide metal gate mounted between two large cylindrical posts whose tops have been cut diagonally. Beyond the gate is a brown sign for the “Randall Trailhead” with icons indicating pets are permitted on leash, no camping, and no fires. Trash and recycling receptacles are located close to the sign. The shoulders along this stretch of the highway are used for parking by hikers and are barren of vegetation. From the west side of the highway, a trail next to a sign for \"Olema Valley Trailhead\" leads through a dense thicket of willows.",

Some redwoods live more than 2,000 years.</p> <h3>The Old Ones</h3> <p>Fossil records indicate that relatives of today's coast redwoods were living large during the Jurassic Period 160 million years ago. The dinosaurs may have bit the dust, but the redwoods continue to thrive in this location, one they have inhabited for some 20 million years thanks to environmental conditions that remain largely unchanged.<br /> <br /> A combination of latitude, elevation and microclimates in the California Coast Ranges makes it possible for redwoods to grow.<br /> <br /> These factors are also what limits the redwoods' range to a few hundred coastal miles. The cool, moist air created by the Pacific Ocean keeps the trees continually damp, even during summer droughts. California's North Coast provides the only such environment in the world. The trees can live to be 2,000 years old, and regularly reach 600 years.<br /> <br /> Redwoods are tough customers. They possess built-in resistance to insects and fire. Diseases are virtually unknown. Their unusual ability to regenerate also aids in their survival as a species. Sprouts may come directly from a snag or downed tree's root system. Basal burls, which are hard, knotty growths that form from dormant seedlings on a living tree, can sprout a new tree when the main trunk is damaged by fire, cutting or toppling.</p> <h3>Hotter Planet, Bigger Trees?</h3> <p>Since the 1970s, researchers have noted some coast redwood and giant sequoia trunks are growing at a rate faster than others previously documented. Could this be the result of climate change? Experts aren't sure, but think it's possible. One theory suggests that increased sunlight due to less summer fog, but a still-adequate amount of winter precipitation, is spurring the growth. Another theory is that wildfire suppression reduces the amount of fire stress, allowing redwoods to expend more energy on trunk growth. Whatever the reason, the available evidence suggests that, at least for now, redwoods are growing faster in the changing environment.</p>",

The now managed grassland was once severely rutted from unregulated off-road vehicle use, paving the way for the introduction of disturbance-loving invasive species.<br /> <br /> The local community's stalwart resistance to the development proposals over two decades led to Mori Point's permanent protection. When the land was transferred to the National Park Service in 2002, major efforts to restore the land to a healthy open space began. In collaboration with the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, hundreds of community volunteers turned the vision into a reality. Mori now has improved trails, interpretive signage, a restored wetland and breeding ponds for the California red-legged frog.<br /> <br /> <b>Frog ponds: Creating habitat for frogs & snakes</b><br /> Mori's freshwater frog ponds are home to our threatened amphibious friends, the California red-legged frog. The ponds are ideal habitat for these cute lil' leapers, and a scenic location for humans to enjoy as well. The ponds are the result of extensive habitat restoration in the 32-acre wetlands.<br /> <br /> The red-legged frog is threatened by habitat loss and predation from invasive species such as bullfrogs. Habitat like these ponds gives their numbers a chance to recover. Funnily enough, the San Francisco garter snake, which is critically endangered, finds red-legged frogs delicious and in fact prefers them over just about everything else. Which means, the colorful snakes hang out near the ponds, too. Keep your eyes peeled!</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Rodeo Beach is a beautiful pebbly beach popular with surfers. Down the hill from Battery Townsley and nestled between Fort Cronkhite, and the Lagoon, <strong>Rodeo Beach</strong> is a great place to start a day's visit in the Headlands. On-site barbecues and picnic tables make it possible to grill out with a group.</p> <h3>Trails at Rodeo Beach</h3> <p>For access to trails, park along Bunker Road near the Marine Mammal Center. Take Old Bunker to the Coastal Trail and Battery Townsley. The trail continues both further inland as well as down to the coast where it meets the Tennessee Point Trail, which features beautiful bluffs. You can tailor your hike to your interests and time, but a full circuit of the Coastal, Wolf Ridge and Miwok Trails will take you a good half day to complete.</p> <h3>Where'd the Beach Go?</h3> <p>Big changes could be ahead for Rodeo Beach and the lagoon. When we burn fossil fuels for energy, we add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This buildup acts like a blanket that traps heat, warming and expanding ocean waters, and melting glaciers. As a result, sea level is rising and storms are becoming more powerful.<br /> <br /> <br /> Barrier beaches like this become submerged during rapid sea level rise. Winter storm waves already wash across the barrier. Without its protective beach, Rodeo Lagoon would become much saltier and pose environmental challenges to rare species who make their home here, such as the tidewater goby and California red-legged frog.</p> <h3>Rodeo Beach Geology</h3> <p>Rodeo Beach formed about 5,000 years ago when sea level rise slowed after melting of the last glacial period. At that time, this sandy barrier beach dammed an ancient stream valley to form Rodeo Lagoon. Strong waves and currents produce the unusually coarse pebbly beach sand here today.<br /> <br /> Watchful beachcombers can find a rainbow of pebbles dotting the shore. The vibrant colors are the result of the most common rock found in the Marin Headlands: radiolarian chert. Trace amounts of iron in the chert pebbles are oxidized in different amounts to produce a wide spectrum of colors, including green, yellow, red and black. Admire these natural beauties all you like, but please don't take them from the beach.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Facing south from the kiosk on the western edge of the parking lot at Fort Cronkhite, Rodeo Beach is about 120 feet due south. <br /><br />A bathroom structure is 25 feet northwest of the kiosk. Facing west at the kiosk, walk diagonally right and you'll arrive at the bathroom which has two facilities with entrances on the north and south facing sides. <br /><br />Follow the sidewalk north from the bathrooms or kiosk as it curves slightly west, leading to an area about 120 feet away with five picnic tables and waste bins accessible by a cement walkway. <br /><br />To get to Rodeo Beach, walk 76 feet from the kiosk along the sidewalk until you come to Mitchell Road. The road is about 46 feet across, on the other side you'll come to a staircase about 16 feet down to the beach.<br /><br />Rodeo Beach is a popular destination for surfers, who can often be seen in floating on their boards amongst the breakers in the northern end of the cove. They're not the only ones who flock to these waters, though. It's a hotspot for families and people who just want to relax in the sun. Rodeo Beach has a wide, sandy shore that stretches for half a mile from end to end. From the northern end of the beach, large rock outcroppings can be seen in the water to the south. Their edges smoothed and rounded by years of wear. The inland terrain around the beach is hilly, and sparsely developed. Both ends of the beach are marked by rocky cliffs that gain elevation as they jut out over the water.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Fort Point was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers between 1853 and 1861 to prevent entrance of a hostile fleet in the San Francisco Bay. In 1794 the Spanish Government built a small fort called \"Castillo de San Joaquin\" on a high bluff where Fort Point is now located. The Castillo was torn down in the early 1850's to make way for the construction of Fort Point.<br /> <br /> The fort was designed to mount 126 massive cannons. Rushed to completion at the beginning of the Civil War, Fort Point was first garrisoned in February of 1861 by Company I, 3rd U.S. Artillery Regiment. The fort was occupied throughout the Civil War, but the advent of faster, more powerful rifled cannons made brick forts such as Fort Point obsolete.<br /> <br /> The fort was then used for storage and training purposes for many years. Between 1933 and 1937 the fort was used as a base of operations for the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. During World War II, Fort Point was occupied by about 100 soldiers who manned searchlights and rapid-fire cannon mounted atop the fort as part of the protection of a submarine net strung across the entrance to the Bay.<br /> <br /> You're currently standing in the only entrance to Fort Point, the sally port. Notice the heavy studded double doors and the rifle slits in both walls. An attacker breaking through these walls would be caught in a devastating crossfire in this passage. Additionally, notice the opening to the cistern beneath the floor. It is one of five identical cisterns that held up to 200,000 gallons of fresh water for the use of soldiers stationed at the fort.</p>",

Directly in front of you is a fence guarding a small pond. Immediately to the left of the wayside is a large, short boulder with a flat top. There are a bunch of scrubby bushes to the right and slightly behind and to the left of where you are standing, is a bench which is a quiet place to observe the wildlife of the pond. Turning to the right is a short, narrow dirt path that leads back to the main boardwalk.<br /> <br /> WAYSIDE LAYOUT: This wayside has 2 columns. The first column has the main text and 1 image. The second column has 2 images and a quote.</p> <h3>Column 1</h3> <p>TEXT: Saving Mori Point - Stewards of the Land. For 20 years, Pacificans and residents from neighboring towns fought to protect Mori Point. This community wrote letters, debated and banded together. They became Friends of Mori Point, Friends of Pacifica, and the Pacifica Land Trust. They worked with the Trust for Public Land and, with funding assistance from the Coastal Conservancy, were able to outbid developers for the property at a sealed auction in September 2000. President Bill Clinton signed legislation by Congressman Tom Lantos later that year to transfer Mori Point to the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: Located on the bottom left of the wayside. Vintage looking black and white image of billboard. The billboard is advertising lots for sale in Salada Beach. The billboard says Salada Beach in large, dark letters. On the left side is an illustration of a woman walking to the right. The center of the billboard says \"Lots - Agents Higgens & Sons 321 Kearny St. S.F.\" To the right of that text is a big $275.00 and beneath it in smaller letters are the words \"A Lifetime Outing\". In front of the billboard on a dark colored blanket, sits two babies with dark bushy hair.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: \"A Lifetime Outing\" was the slogan for this Salada Beach billboard that was graced by twin tots to add appeal to the bargain price of only $275 per lot in 1924. Today's Salada Beach is now part of Sharp Park in Pacifica.</p> <h3>Column 2</h3> <p>DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: Located at the top of column. Colored rectangular photo looking up the coast from Mori Point. In the distance, there are high, steep cliffs are on the left. The ocean is crashing on the beach below from the right. In the foreground, two people are sitting, crossed legged on the ground, looking towards the cliffs and ocean below. The sky is cloudless and the sun is shining.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #3: Located at the bottom of column. Colored, rectangular close up photograph of two young boys working with plants. They are surrounded by green grass and appear to be focusing on the plants, working or digging with their hands. The boy on the left is wearing a dark long sleeve Park volunteer jacket with a matching hat.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: MANY HANDS PROTECTING THE LAND Community participation is key to keeping Mori Point vibrant. You can make a difference by joining the parks' volunteer stewardship team. You can improve a trail, protect an endangered species, or welcome a new visitor. For more information about volunteering, visit the Golden Gate National Parks' Conservancy website at: volunteer@parksconservancy.org or call (415) 561 - 3077.<br /> <br /> QUOTE: \"...the children of future generations will be able to commune with nature because the force to protect nature is an irresistible force\" - U.S. Representative Tom Lantos comments at the Mori Point dedication, 2002.</p>",

Geologists have found the sandstone in the vicinity of Sutro Baths and the Cliff House to be 80 million years old. Radiometric dating of zircon crystals, a kind of mineral found in the sand, indicates that the grains came from an eroded ancient mountain range in Idaho. The zircon crystals from that range formed between 1 and 2 billion years ago were uplifted and eroded, then carried by a river from Idaho to Northern California around 80 million years ago. That river formed a large delta in the present Sacramento Valley and dumped sediment into a deep sea subduction trench in the San Francisco area.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>In May of 1904, Colonel Nobel wrote a letter in explaining why the East Cantonment had such a high desertion rate.<br /> <br /> The present recruits are of very low quality. Recruiting officers concern themselves more with quantity than quality. The result is a class of men who are of inferior character, many being mere nomads. Also contributing to the desertions are the poor accommodations and deplorable surroundings. The men can see the Artillery and the 9th Cavalry troops over at the Presidio's main post with their good barracks, reading room, gymnasium, and so forth. The contrast with the cantonment's humble barracks causes discontent. Also, the numerous dives and saloons just outside the cantonment provide a source of evil. The veterans of foreign service expect better when they came home, but when they first see the post they are heartsick. While much has been done to improve matters much remains to be done.<br /> <br /> As Colonel Noble noted, the poor quality of the recruits led to less than savory interactions between the soldiers and citizens and proprietors of San Francisco. Papers reported on both the trouble caused by drunk soldiers, and the gouging of soldiers by local grafters. In August 1900 the San Francisco Call reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>Last night additional police officers were detailed to the Barbary Coast to prevent the soldiers from repeating Monday night's outrages. The danger to citizens through soldiers being allowed to carry their revolvers while away from camp has been exemplified on more than one occasion, notably the murder in the Spreckles Market by Private Rosser of the Tennessee Regiment. Another case, which fortunately did not have a tragic ending, occurred early yesterday morning. Several colored soldiers were drinking in the saloon at Pacific Street when a row started and one of the soldiers pulled a revolver out of his pocket and fired a shot at a white man. The bullet fortunately missed its mark. The soldiers fled from the saloon and Sergeant Christiansen was unable to get any clue to the identity of the would-be murderer.</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The most notorious of the bar brawls and riots by Presidio soldiers occurred on Christmas night 1901. The San Francisco Call reported on December 26, 1901:</p> <blockquote> <p>Not much of peace on earth, nor good will toward men, was displayed yesterday afternoon by more than 1000 howling soldiers in front of Dave Tarpey's saloon, on Baker Street, near Greenwich, just outside the Presidio grounds. They were men from several regiments, cursing, yelling, demanding blood and mixing in a general free-for-all. The riot was finally quelled by the police and several detachments of troops from the Presidio. Revolvers, clubs, stones and mud were brought into play during the riot, and for their participation fifty-nine of Uncle Sam's warriors are under arrest in the reservation and fifteen of them are lodged in the North End police station. The wonder of the riot is that no one was seriously injured. Dave Tarpey's saloon received a shake-up that brought back recollections of the old Tennessee days.</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> Soldiers being discharged from the army often encountered men scheming to fleece them of their money near the Presidio Gates. In April 1901, the San Francisco Call reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>Twenty-seventh Infantry soldiers mustering out at the Presidio yesterday had an opportunity to \"get even\" with certain neighborhood storekeepers and others of the human vampire species. Early in the morning the grafters began to gather around the entrance to the Presidio. Their number kept increasing until, at 12 o'clock, there were so many of those bipeds who make an easy living off the unsophisticated soldiers, that it became necessary to adopt drastic measures to protect the soldiers. Colonel Cummins had the camp surrounded by a mounted guard with orders to keep all persons out who could give no valid reason for their presence. The result being that all the men who had been hanging around the camps were driven from the reservation. At the entrance to the Presidio, the numerous individuals who were under the impression that a soldier is easy game fell into the hands of police officers, who kept them on the move, resulting in a freedom from the wily schemers not having been enjoyed for some time.</p> </blockquote>",

Needless to say, the beach is beautiful. Two beach wheelchairs are available at the lifeguard office upon request. Sorry, but no dog friends are allowed on the beach.</p> <h3>School's Out for Summer!</h3> <p>What'd you do on your senior ditch day? For local high schoolers, it's a longstanding tradition to forego that last Calculus class in favor of some fun in the sun at Stinson.</p> <h3>Beach Safety</h3> <p>Stinson is the only beach good for swimming in the park. Swimming is only recommended from late May to mid-September when lifeguards are on duty. Keep children within reach at all times. Never turn your back on the ocean, as large waves can wash farther up shore than expected. Rip currents (strong, swift-moving channels of water) can pull swimmers into deeper water. If you're caught in a rip current, swim parallel to the beach until you're free of it, then swim toward shore with incoming waves. If you need assistance, wave your arms and yell for help.</p> <h3>Sharks at the Beach</h3> <p>Ocean mammals like harbor seals are favorite prey for great white sharks, which are sometimes sighted in the area. Attacks on humans remain extremely rare, but visitors should be aware of the potential for sharks close to shore in shallow water.<br /> <br /> Shark sightings can lead to beach closures.</p> <h3>Warmer Planet, Rising Tides</h3> <p>Climate change is serious business, especially when it threatens a beloved place like Stinson Beach. Burning fossil fuels like coal and gas releases carbon dioxide, which acts like a blanket around the planet, disrupting the climate. As global temperatures rise so will ocean tides, encroaching on shorelines like this one.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service is taking action to curb the effects of climate change on a large scale by reducing carbon emissions in all park lands. Locally, NPS is taking steps to move underground electrical lines and restroom leach fields further inland here at Stinson in preparation of a changing landscape.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The red brick building to your right was the Main Post guardhouse and stockade. During the Philippine war years the stockade, or jail, was kept busy detaining soldiers caught taking absents without leave, participating in barroom brawls, or any number of other offenses.<br /> <br /> The March 1900 San Francisco Call reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The number of military convicts who have evaded the vigilance of their guards and taken French leave within the past few weeks has been unusually large. The climax was reached when a prisoner, who was working in the quarry at the mortar battery about two miles beyond the Presidio, disappeared Friday accompanied by the sentinel detailed to guard him. Colonel Eskridge yesterday ordered that all guards hereafter be armed with repeating shotguns loaded with buckshot. The ordnance department at once issued twenty of these weapons. Hereafter, if a prisoner attempts to escape he will take big chances, as buckshot is much more effective in bringing down a runaway than a rifle bullet.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> In October 1902, the 3rd Squadron of the famed 9th Cavalry \"Buffalo Soldiers\" arrived for duty at the Presidio; the first time an African American unit was assigned here. On arrival, the soldiers were dismayed to find that their horses were placed in the new flimsy shed stables located in the damp marshy flats below the bluff in front of you. They immediately applied for stables located on top of the bluff, in the area in front of you, only to be refused. This refusal was probably due to the better stables already being assigned to another cavalry unit rather than discrimination against the black troopers.<br /> <br /> Four troops of the 9th Cavalry served at the Presidio for the next two years. During the summer of 1903, they patrolled Yosemite and Sequoia national parks. They also performed numerous drills and exercises that entertained the citizens of San Francisco.<br /> <br /> The San Francisco Call published this account in the spring of 1904:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The 9th cavalry troops have been in the field every day, except Saturdays and Sundays, for several hours, and the result is shown by the fine display the squadron made yesterday. They were put through a pretty stiff drill, and when they dashed across the big field under full gallop with the bright guidons waving in the morning breeze, they presented a stunning appearance. Following the main drill came the pitching of the Sibley tents. In less than five minutes every tent was up. What had been a plain, smooth, clear field could now house a small army of men. At the conclusion the bugles sounded recall and the troopers galloped off the field to the stables. The day was absolutely perfect\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> In May of 1903, two of the 9th Cavalry troops had the special honor of serving as Theodore Roosevelt's presidential escort during his two-day visit to San Francisco, the first time black troops had been asked to do so.<br /> <br /> The San Francisco Call reported:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"As President Roosevelt emerged from the train depot he was greeted by hearty cheering from citizens who pressed against the wire cable on each side of the thoroughfare. The soldiers of the Ninth Cavalry presented sabers and the band stationed at the corner played enlivening music.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> In the afternoon, five thousand people gathered at the Baker Street entrance of Golden Gate Park to see President Roosevelt break ground for a monument to the late President McKinley. They waited patiently for the President to arrive and when he put in an appearance, escorted by the Ninth Cavalry, he was greeted enthusiastically.</p>",

Right on the beach, the ruins are an interesting place to wander about as the tide rolls in and out.</p> <h3>History of the Baths</h3> <p>Adolph Sutro, self-made millionaire, San Francisco mayor and all around entrepreneur, developed the lavish Sutro Baths in 1894. With his special interest in natural history and marine studies, he constructed an ocean pool aquarium among the rocks north of the Cliff House. Sutro then expanded his ocean front complex by constructing a massive public bathhouse that covered three acres and boasted impressive engineering and artistic details. Sutro's dream was to provide a healthy, recreational and inexpensive swimming facility for thousands of San Franciscans.<br /> <br /> The baths weren't just any swimming hole. Inside a massive glass enclosure were seven swimming pools kept at various temperatures, not to mention slides, trapezes, springboards and a high dive. During high tide, the Pacific Ocean could fill the 1.7 million gallons of water required for all the pools in one hour. The baths were capable of accommodating 10,000 people at once, offered 20,000 bathing suits and 40,000 towels for rent. But no flip flops.<br /> <br /> Also included at the baths was a cultural educational component that focused on natural history exhibits, sculptures, paintings, tapestries and artifacts from Mexico, China, Asia, and the Middle East, including Egyptian mummies. Sutro Baths was a venue for concerts, talent shows and restaurants. A railroad provided transportation to Lands End by the late 1890s, so a visit to Sutro Baths became a feasible family day trip.<br /> <br /> For all their glamour and excitement, the baths were not commercially successful over the long-term. They became less popular largely due to the Great Depression, the reduction in available public transportation and new public health codes. In attempts to make the facility profitable, the Baths were converted into an ice-skating rink, but it was not enough to maintain the enormous building. In 1964, a high-rise apartment development was proposed. Unfortunately, a fire destroyed the Baths in 1966, extinguishing an era of guild and glamour. The concrete ruins just north of the Cliff House are the remains of the grand Sutro Baths.</p> <h3>John Harris and the Dibble Civil Rights Act</h3> <p>4th of July, 1897. It's a scorcher in old San Fran. A group of friends decides to cool off by taking a trip out to Sutro Baths. After paying the entrance fee, San Francisco native John Harris is denied entry to the pools because he's black.<br /> <br /> Mr. Harris decided to sue Adolph Sutro. Mr. Harris brought his landmark case before the San Francisco Superior Court under California's Dibble Civil Rights Act of 1896, which declared: all citizens \"of every color or race whatsoever\" shall \"be entitled to the full and equal\" facilities of \"all places of public accommodation or amount.\" As usual, California was ahead of its time, seeing as how the Supreme Court made the reprehensible decision to uphold separate but equal segregation policy for public spaces in Plessy vs. Ferguson the year prior.<br /> <br /> The suit was successful, but personally for Mr. Harris, the victory was bittersweet. The amount he won in damages was insufficient even to cover his legal expenses. Furthermore, due to his vast wealth and the small amount of the fine, Mr. Sutro was able to continue his exclusionary practices at the baths. The case, however, did have an impact on the state at large, contributing to a wave of suits in the wake of Harris' success.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Sutro Heights, a sprawling garden on a hilltop overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Cliff House, features views of Ocean Beach and the Sunset District. Here you'll find the remains of Adolph Sutro's former mansion residence. Sutro Heights in its modern form may not sport the grandiosity of the original garden, but the natural beauty and secluded locale are worth a visit.</p> <h3>Citizen Sutro</h3> <p>Born in Germany on April 29th, 1820, Adolph Heinrich Joseph Sutro grew up to embody the American immigrant dream. He arrived in California during the Gold Rush in 1850. He was well educated in the field of mining engineering and business, which proved to be far more profitable than panning for gold. Sutro made his fortune by devising and implementing a ventilation system that rid the silver-rich Comstock Lode mineshafts of water and gas by driving a tunnel through Mount Davidson.</p> <h3>Sutro in San Francisco</h3> <p>After his work in the silver mines, Sutro moved back to San Francisco where he invested heavily in coastal real estate. In 1881, he purchased 22 acres of undeveloped land, including a high vista overlooking the Cliff House and Seal Rocks. Sutro's land boasted some of the best views of the Pacific Ocean, Mount Tamalpais, and the Golden Gate. He built a mansion home on the grounds, and named the property Sutro Heights, a luxurious public garden that was open to all citizens. Although not it its full splendor, part of the mansion's foundation and the gardens remain.</p> <h3>Sutro Heights Back in the Day</h3> <p>San Fran Big-Timer Adolph Sutro was committed to sharing the wealth-specifically his wealth-with the citizens of San Francisco. In 1885, he commissioned 20 acres of hilltop land for a lavish garden, Sutro Heights Park, designed to showcase views of the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate strait. Sutro spared no expense. The garden included observation decks, flower beds, forests, walkways, hedge mazes and parterres-a trendy European tradition of shaping bushes into figures-and 200 imported replicas of Greek and Roman statues.<br /> <br /> Sutro was a dreamer, and he always dreamed big. Sutro Heights was his imagined vision of European style superimposed onto an American landscape, a balance of refinement and natural ruggedness.</p>",

The sandy coastline and adjacent wind-protected valley of Thornton State Beach are good venues for picnicking, beach walking, surf fishing, and flying remote-control gliders. Take in views from this site include the Farallon Islands, Mount Tamalpais, Point Reyes, Mount Diablo, the Montara Mountains, and San Pedro Point.</p> <h3>Trails at Sweeney Ridge</h3> <p>There are several ways to access the 5.7 combined miles of trails at Sweeney Ridge. Most of the trails are totally exposed, so bring sunscreen! If it's cold and cloudy, bring an extra layer of clothing and expect windy conditions.<br /> <br /> <em>Note:</em> It is common for weather to change over the course of an afternoon.<br /> <br /> Take the Notch Trail from Skyline College and hike south to the ridge where you can take the Sweeney Ridge Trail further south or head west along Mori Ridge Trail.<br /> <br /> You can also begin at the trailhead adjacent to the Shelldance Orchid Gardens near CA-1 and hike up to the ridge using the Mori Ridge Trail. From San Bruno, take Sneath Lane to the Sneath Trail.</p> <h3>Portolá Discovery Site</h3> <p>The San Francisco Bay Portolá Discovery Site monument marks the place where Captain Juan Gaspar de Portolá and 60 Spanish soldiers of the Portolá Expedition became the first Europeans to see San Francisco Bay. The expedition members were hungry, lost, and sick after a six months' journey. They were assisted by the local Ramaytush Ohlone people along the way, and the Aramai tribe of modern-day Pacifica accompanied the explorers to the top of Sweeney Ridge.</p> <h3>Nike Missile Site SF-51</h3> <p>During the tense years of the Cold War, from 1953 to 1979, the United States Army built and operated close to 300 Nike missile sites in the United States. Nike Site SF-51 at Sweeney Ridge housed the radar targeting station for one of these anti-aircraft defense sites, while the launch area was located at nearby Milagra Ridge. By the 1960s, soldiers were ready in a minutes' notice to launch nuclear capable Nike Hercules missiles from these ridgetops. Obsolete by 1974, SF-51 was abandoned.</p>",

On her first Pacific voyage in 1849, she carried only 15 passengers because of rough storms, but in March of 1850, she arrived in Panama after 57 days at sea to a waiting throng of 3,000 seeking passage to San Francisco.<br /> <br /> <br /> The <strong>Tennessee</strong> brought thousands of gold-seeking fortune hunters to the city for three more years until a fateful, foggy day in March, when she ran aground in the Headlands. All souls were lost and the site of the wreck was renamed Tennessee Cove to honor those lost.</p> <h3>Geology of Tennessee Cove</h3> <p>Tennessee Cove is made up of the sedimentary rock, chert. The rocks here at the cove are chock full of radiolaria fossils. 'Radiolaria' is a big word for ocean faring single-celled organisms. These little guys are smaller than a grain of sand and come in a variety of symmetrical shapes. For hundreds of millions of years, they have been embedded in the rocks as fossilized mineral skeletons. You can see them with a standard magnifier.</p>",

These sons and daughters of San Francisco slept in tents until better accommodations could be found.<br /> <br /> The hollow is in the middle of a little sprucing up, thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.presidio.gov/presidio-trust/planning/tennessee-hollow-watershed-restoration\">Presidio Trust's Tennessee Hollow Restoration Project</a> .

Keep an eye out for poison oak.</li> <li>Dress in layers and be prepared for varying weather conditions. Sunny days along the coast can turn windy, foggy, and cold very fast.</li> </ul> <p><br /> <b>Parking</b><br /> There is trailhead parking at the Tennessee Valley Trailhead, including several accessible parking spots.<br /> <br /> <b>Bathrooms</b><br /> Accessible restrooms can be found adjacent to parking area.<br /> <br /> <b>Water</b><br /> There is no potable water available in Tennessee Valley. Plan ahead and pack water. Avoid becoming dehydrated or experiencing heat exhaustion. Drink plenty of water and drink often, pace yourself, rest in the shade, and eat salty snacks.<br /> <br /> <b>Trail Etiquette</b><br /> The Tennessee Valley Trail is closed to dogs. Please remain on the established trails. Off-trail travel harms plants and causes erosion.<br /> <br /> <b>Camping in the Valley</b><br /> The <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/10067346?q=Haypress Campground\">Haypress </a> (0.75 miles) and <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/258815?q=Hawk Campground\">Hawk </a> Campgrounds (2.5 miles) are accessible from this trailhead. For information about camping contact the Marin Headlands Visitor Center at (415) 332-1540. Don't expect to be able to book a site the day of your visit.</p> <h3>Animal Friends</h3> <p>Tennessee Valley is home to many animal friends. If you're a bird-lover, bring your 'binos (binoculars). Birds of a feather from predatory raptors to common swallows abound in the valley. On the ground, deer and coyotes stalk the land. Keep your eyes peeled and you may even see a bobcat.</p> <h3>Plant Friends</h3> <p>In the spring, Tennessee Valley is positively bursting with blossoms. You'll spot checker-bloom, blue-eyed grass, California buttercup and California poppy. In summer, the grasses turn golden, and by late summer you can find fennel, lizard tail, sagebrush, sticky monkey flower and blackberry bushes. In winter and early spring, rains turn the golden hills green again.</p> <h3>Marincello: The City That Wasn't</h3> <p>Marin County is famously committed to keeping its land open and undeveloped, but in the 1960s, there were plans to the contrary. When Pittsburgh land developer Thomas Frouge came out west, he saw something in the Headlands: a city for 30,000 Californians waiting to be built. Fifty apartment towers. Hundreds of homes. A shopping mall. And the cherry on top: a luxury hotel at the highest point in the Headlands.<br /> <br /> These were the plans for Marincello, the city that wasn't. The story goes that the plans, which the county approved, were fought tooth and nail by a small cadre of Marin's citizens. After bulldozing part of the landscape and building garish gates announcing the entrance to the community, development was halted due to a legal injunction. One thing led to another and the legal troubles against Marincello multiplied. In 1972, the land was sold to the Nature Conservancy and handed over to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Locals often liken the story of Marincello to a David and Goliath tale; an example of the underdog coming out on top. Today, the site where the main boulevard to Marincello was supposed to be is nothing more than a footpath, aptly named \"Marincello Trail.\"</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>This valley, known as Tennessee Hollow, held tent camps for volunteer regiments throughout the Spanish American and Philippine wars.<br /> <br /> This area is known as Tennessee Hollow because it was the camp site of the notoriously rowdy 1st Tennessee Volunteer Infantrymen, who trained at the Presidio from mid-June 1898 until they left for Manila on November 1. These men made a big impression on both the citizens of San Francisco and the local military establishment and the name has persisted through the years.<br /> <br /> Oral Histories and letters from this regiment portray what it was like for the many young men from across America, who had volunteered to fight in a land far from anything they know. From oral histories we hear - about the trip to San Francisco:</p> <blockquote> <p>No member of the regiment will ever forget the exciting moment when the news that we were to go to the Philippines spread through the camp. We did not know just where these islands were, but we wanted to go bad and find out their location.</p> <p><br /> Then came the preparations for the long trip to San Francisco, which we started on June 10, 1898. The trip to Frisco brings to us all the most pleasant memories-the open hospitality of the various cities and towns through which we passed, the cordial greetings and many kindnesses shown us, the good meals and hearty God-speeds--all will never be forgotten.<br /> <br /> Then came the Grand Canyon, beautiful Salt Lake City, the snowy mountains, and finally San Francisco. We cannot congratulate ourselves on the soldierly appearance of the boys as we marched through the City to the sand dunes of Camp Merritt, near Golden Gate Park; but under the parti-colored coats beat manly hearts filled with patriotism and only awaiting opportunity to prove same.<br /> <br /> To say we were given the glad hand by the people of San Francisco poorly expresses our reception by them. Never before was there seen such free-handed hospitality and welcome given to so ragged a lot of soldiers, or will we admit that there was ever a more appreciative lot of hungry boys with excellent digestions. We say hungry, but this condition did not last long, and though the strain on our digestions was great, we are proud to say that no man broke the first and most important rule of soldier life--eat whenever you get the chance.</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> A series of letters written by Richard Steele of the 1st Tennessee Infantry to his Aunt and Uncle reflect his impressions of his stay in San Francisco. Several letters report on the regiments activities and entertainment in the city.</p> <blockquote> <p>June 20, 1898<br /> <br /> Dear Auntie,<br /> Friday evening after we settled, we all went to the Sutro bath house out on the coast about three miles and went in, which made us all feel like new boys. We all put on bathing suits and some of the boys went in 9 foot water, some in 6 and some in four, but I couldn't hardly swim in four foot, so I just contented myself by something good.<br /> <br /> Yesterday we were allowed to go to town and stay two hours at a time, so I went to town twice and we got pretty view of the town, but the most important place was China town, it contains about four blocks and there the Chinese are all together and trade with each other.<br /> <br /> Auntie tell all my friends to write to me even the little girls I used to know, for it would make me feel right happy to hear from a nice pretty little girl from Nashville, but Nashville can't beat Frisco on pretty girls because they are all pretty and are as sweet as these plums that grow out here. I don't see how I will ever be able to come to Nashville again after mixing with the western people.<br /> <br /> July 4, 1898<br /> We left camp this morning about 7:30 to enter the parade and suppose we marched about ten miles, but the time past away fast, for every step we marched we were cheered by the California people and some of them say we drilled better than any regiment out of fifteen or twenty although we were not equipped, the people would say they are ragged but they can drill.</p> </blockquote>",

The Leonard Haskell residence was the place of U.S. Senator Broderick's untimely death.<br /> <br /> The Gold Rush attracted Southerners who supported slavery, Northerners who were against slavery, free African-American settlers, seeking their fortunes, as well as enslaved African-Americans, who were forced to dig for their owners' benefit. As new states were added to the union, Congress tried to achieve a balance by carefully admitting an equal number of slave states and free states.<br /> <br /> After much bitter national debate, California entered as a free-state, part of the so-called Compromise of 1850. However, its vague antislavery constitution was open for extensive interpretation. The Broderick-Terry Duel, an important chapter of the antislavery movement, is associated with the Black Point community. During the 1850s, the people living here were openly hostile to secession and slavery. They politically supported David Broderick, a self-made man opposed to slavery, in his effort to become California's U.S. Senator. In 1859, after Broderick responded to verbal abuse from his political opponent, California State Supreme Court Justice David S. Terry, Terry challenged him to a duel.<br /> <br /> On September 13, 1859, the Broderick - Terry duel commenced at Lake Merced, south of the city. After Broderick's gun misfired, Terry shot Broderick and wounded him severely. After his friends rushed him to Haskell's Black Point home, Broderick died three days later, after reportedly saying \"They killed me because I am opposed to the extension of slavery and a corrupt administration.\"</p>",

Depending on the time of year, the grassland can be covered in brightly colored wildflowers. In the dryer, winter season, the landscape is more browns and greens. On the boardwalk slightly behind you and to the left, are two benches that face the hillside, offering opportunities for reflection or watching the wildlife.<br /> <br /> WAYSIDE LAYOUT: The wayside has 2 columns and a sidebar with additional text and one image. The first column has the main text and 1 image and the second column has 2 images.</p> <h3>Column 1</h3> <p>TEXT: The Enduring Aramai Who were the first people of these lands? The Aramai settled at Calera Creek and used lands at Mori Point for over 3,000 years. Their villages, Timigtac and Pruristac, totaling 50 people, made up a distinct tribe among dozens of independent Ohlone tribes that lived from the Carquinez Strat south to Monterey Bay.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #1: Located on the left side, center of wayside. Colored illustration depicting a large group of Native Americans. In the background is a large, two story, Spanish style mission building. In the center of the image is a large cross, towering above the group of people. The mountains can be seen in the far distance. Featured in the foreground are 5 Native Americans appearing to be performing or speaking to a group of seated individuals.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The Aramai were among the first native people brought to the Spanish colonial Mission Dolores where they were joined by a diverse tribal people from the Bay region. Mission Dolores natives became the DoloreÃ±os, one of several new world communities of diverse native people that formed at the California missions.</p> <h3>Column 2</h3> <p>DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #2: Located top center of column. This is a scientific illustration of Arroyo Willow, <em>Salix Iasiolepis</em> . The illustration features long, thin green leaves that spread out along thin multiple branches.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Willows, which currently grow in abundance at Mori Point, have served Ohlone people for countless generations, providing the framework for thatched houses, a pain reliever found in the bark, and material for weaving the various baskets so important in everyday life.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #3: Located in the center at the bottom. Small, rectangular colored photo of a garter snake. The snake is slightly coiled into itself, as if to strike. The snake has red, white and black stripes running down the length of its body. It is resting on brown, dried grass.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Two Native Words and a Vow of Protection: The park honors the heritage of the Aramai by naming two of its trails in the San Francisco Bay Ohlone language - Timigtac after their village at Calera Creek, and Lishumsha for the resident garter snake. As we restore the habitat of the San Francisco garter snake and other wildlife, let us remember the first people who lived here and their descendents.</p> <h3>Sidebar</h3> <p>TEXT: One Remarkable Family: Utchus and MuchiÃ¡te are the Timigtac couple whose descendants make up the only known surviving lineage from the original 1400 native people of the San Francisco Peninsula. The story of their family embodies native survival at the heart of this tragic chapter in California history. Their daughter, Xilaite, was born a year before the Spanish Portola expedition reached San Francisco in 1769. She married Jose Ramos, the mission blacksmith from New Spain, in a rare pairing of native and colonial individuals. One of the very few to survive the harmful effects of mission life, Xilaite lived long enough to see the birth of her granddaughter in 1811. By that time nearly 95% of the Aramai had died, but Xilaite's descendants endured. They intermarried with other tribes, with others of Mexican heritage, and with European Americans, and they continue to flourish today. One of those descendants is Dr. Jonathan Cordero, Professor of Sociology at California Lutheran University. He is Xialaite's 9th generation grandson, and, like other Bay Area Ohlone's, he continues to honor his ancestors by writing about their past with the hope of inspiring interest in their future.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF IMAGE #5: Located at the bottom of the sidebar. Colored portrait photograph of a middle-aged looking man with tanned skin and dark hair. He is shown from the chest up, wearing a white button-up shirt and a light brown, multi-colored tie.</p>",

    "bodyText": "In February of 1857, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/james-douglas-statue.htm\">James Douglas</a>, the head of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson’s Bay Company </a>in British Columbia and Royal Governor of Vancouver Island shipped a modest amount of gold that had recently been discovered in the Fraser River Valley to the San Francisco Mint for processing. Word of Douglas’s shipment rapidly spread in the San Francisco area. By April, hundreds of Californians “suffering” from “gold fever” had arrived in Victoria. These men were the advance guard of an estimated 25,000-40,000 Californians who rapidly uprooted their lives and traveled vast distances into uncharted territory to extract riches from the challenging environment of Canada’s Fraser River Valley. Fort Yale, a Hudson's Bay Company outpost in the Fraser River Valley was a gateway for these fortuneseekers. Their actions would change the lives of First Nations people, alter the policies of imperial governments, devastate local ecosystems, and eventually lead to the Pig War. <br /> <br /> On April 4, 1858 a headline in a San Francisco newspaper read, “People Abandoning Everything for the Mines!” This was not exactly true; even as thousands of San Franciscans left their homes for Canada, they had to purchase many new things, including clothes, tools, food, horses, and transportation to get to the mines. The isolated communities in the Fraser River Valley consisted of Native American villages and Hudson’s Bay Company fur trading forts which lacked the agricultural base and stockpile of goods that could supply thousands of men who traveled there to engage in arduous and single-minded work, extracting wealth from the ground.<br /> <br /> This issue was exacerbated by a lack of environmental knowledge. The gold miners attempted to mine in Canada the same way they had in California, which in the early stages meant looking for bars of land normally submerged by the river and sifting their stones and sand for gold when high waters receded. Unfortunately for the miners, who largely arrived in Canada in May, June, and July, the Fraser River remained too high to find significant gold until late September. That meant that almost all of the prospective miners were forced to remain idle, using their dwindling supplies or paying exorbitant prices for scarce food and material at the isolated area where gold was discovered. This led some miners to head home early and empty handed, caused others to prospect further inland where they attacked First Nations people whose homes they had invaded in search of gold, and lead other miners to turn to gambling, drinking, and prostitution to pass their idle time.<br /> <br /> In late September, the water dropped low enough for mining activities to begin in earnest, but the gold that was found did not live up to miners’ outsized expectations. In the next few years, additional explorations would reveal that rich lodes of gold existed upstream and on tributaries, but it was clear that easy pickings were not available in the first places gold was found. If they would have waited until winter and had the endurance to work outside in the freezing cold and adaptability to move on in search of gold, many Californians would have found what they came for in Canada. Instead, they went home emptyhanded. Many also left bearing a resentment towards the British Empire and Governor James Douglas specifically; despite Douglas’s herculean efforts to deal with the rapid growth of his province with absolutely no funding from the British government (Vancouver was supposed to be self-supporting), and maintain British sovereignty in a community where American citizens suddenly vastly outnumbered British citizens, Douglas was reviled for the $5 license fee his government charged miners and regarded as a profiteer.<br /> <br /> Just as rapidly as they had come to Canada, miners began to leave Canada. Amongst those miners was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lyman-cutlar-homestead.htm\">Lyman Cutlar</a>, a 27 year-old man from Kentucky, who left Canada in the spring of 1859 with a Native American woman who he met and married during the Gold Rush. Cutlar and his new bride settled on San Juan Island, where they built a small cabin and planted crops in an area used by the British Hudson’s Bay Company as a major sheep farm. When one of the British pigs rooted up Cutlar’s potato patch on June 15, 1859, he killed it in anger. Cutlar’s actions would soon lead to a confrontation between the British and American empires, but many of the men involved in that conflict had participated in the Fraser River Gold Rush, which had shaped their understanding of US/British relations on the Northwestern frontier. ",

Work duties matched the crime. Some learned vocational skills and while others broke rocks wearing ball and chain.

The federal government initially barricaded the island and insisted the Indian people leave.

Although these articles were often based on accounts of doubtful accuracy, they convinced many that a war with Spain was the right thing to do.<br /> <br /> After the battleship Maine mysteriously blew up in Havana Harbor on February 15, 1898, and a naval court of inquiry and newspapers proclaimed it the result of a bomb, it did not take much convincing for Congress to declare war on Spain on April 19. By May, troops began pouring into the Presidio, preparing to fight the Spanish in the Philippines. Over the next two years, the Presidio was bustling with activity as over 80,000 men and their gear passed through the post during the seven-month Spanish War and the following three year Philippine War. Afterwards, troops continued to circulate through the Presidio on their way to and from the Philippine Islands for more than a decade.<br /> <br /> Many of the soldiers were volunteers who joined the army in their home states - like Utah, Iowa, Tennessee, New York, Kansas, and Nebraska. They came to the Presidio by train, stopping here for several weeks or months before shipping out to the Philippines. On returning from war, many of these same volunteers made their last stop here before leaving the army and returning home.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "A small, 15-vehicle gravel parking lot is located just west of Highway 1. A barbed wire and wooden split-rail fence surrounds the parking lot. On the northern end of the parking lot is a metal gate with a lever at the top to access the trail. Adjacent to the gate is a wayside exhibit with information about the Giacomini Wetlands. To the east, across the two-lane highway, grassy pasturelands rise to a low ridge crest. To the west, pasturelands descend to a narrow bay less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away. The one-mile-wide (1.6-kilometer-wide) bay stretches to the northwest for approximately 10 miles (16 kilometers). Across the bay is a forested ridge.",

    "bodyText": "<p>So, how did San Francisco Bay's dramatic landscape come to be? How and when did the bay and hills around you form? Geologically speaking, they are new features; the result of great tectonic plates colliding and grinding past one another, of sea level rising and falling as ice ages come and go, and of a rushing glacial-fed river cutting a new course to the ocean.<br /> <br /> San Francisco Bay first filled only 650 thousand years ago, at a time when glaciers in the Sierra Mountains and the continent's interior melted and sea level rose. About that same time, a glacier-fed lake in central California, nearly the size of Lake Michigan overtopped a ridge and catastrophically flooded down to the bay and ocean, cutting the modern Sacramento River valley on its way. Since then, the bay has drained and filled six times, as glaciers have built up and retreated. Scientists predict the bay will rise between three and five feet in the next century due to global warming.<br /> <br /> The rocks under your feet and other hills around the bay mostly formed on the sea floor over 100 million years ago, as the tectonic plate under the Pacific slid beneath North America-- a process called subduction. Then, about 12 million years ago, the San Andrea fault formed in this area. Now the Pacific Plate was sliding past the North American Plate instead of under it and the California coast of today started to emerge from the sea. But it wasn't until about 4 million years ago that today's coastal hills and mountains started to form when a shift in plate motion caused crumpling and folding along the San Andreas.</p>",

No enemy alien will be permitted to live in the forbidden zone, to work there or even visit there. The government will route approximately 1400 Italians from the 2000 man San Francisco fishing industry.<br /> <br /> Fearing a Japanese attack on the mainland, the Army activated underwater minefields outside the Golden Gate. Ships tending those mines used the harbor here. As more boats were needed to tend the mines, the army appropriated some of San Francisco's Italian fishing fleet idled by the evacuation order.<br /> <br /> To maintain these newly conscripted boats, the Army established a marine repair shop in the building you are standing next to. Repairs included redesigning boats, reconditioning engines, painting, scraping barnacles, and straightening propeller shafts. The metal marine railway you see coming out of the building and running down to the water was used to haul the boats out for repair.<br /> <br /> Shop foreman Harry Plummer said of the repair shop activities...<br /> <br /> Instead of waiting three weeks for a boat to return from a shipyard for a simple cleaning and painting job, the Baker gang can complete the task in two or three days. Heck, we will save the government more than fifty thousand dollars this year.<br /> <br /> That would equal more than 650 thousand of today's dollars.</p>",

Even today, salmon swimming up the Sacramento River drainage follow the old river channel at the base of this bluff rather than venturing into more southern parts of the bay. Salmon aren't the only tasty migrants here. Dungeness crabs migrate from the ocean to the bay to lay their eggs. The young crabs settle and feed in Horseshoe Bay.<br /> <br /> The volume of the immense San Francisco Bay estuary is so great that the tidal flow going in and out of the Golden Gate is twice the flow of the Mississippi River. Under the Golden Gate Bridge, strong tidal currents scour a 375-foot-deep channel all the way down to bedrock.<br /> <br /> The climate also is affected by this land-sea interface. Cold ocean air and warmer landward air meet at the Golden Gate to create the fog that frequently shrouds the bay. Microclimates are typical of these coastal areas, and Fort Baker is lucky to be in a fog shadow formed by the high ridge to the west.</p>",

Imagine a time with no Golden Gate Bridge. A time when the Coast Miwok Indian population here, could only visit the Ohlone villages on the other side of the bay, by paddling small reed canoes across the strong currents of the Golden Gate Strait. Descendants of these Coast Miwok still tell us of their past.<br /> <br /> Hello, 'oppun towis, I am Angela Hardin and I am Coast Miwok. These are the lands of my ancestors - the Coast Miwok. Today one can hear languages and meet people from around the world-Europe, Africa, and Asia. But for thousands of years before Europeans arrived, the languages here were those of my people, the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo.<br /> <br /> This place is still rich and lush, but once elk, tanta, and deer, choyyekke, grazed in the valleys while the mountain lions, upuksu, and bear, kule, roamed the hills. Oak trees grew scattered across the grassy hills, and the air was filled with birds.<br /> <br /> For countless generations, we raised our families in villages dotted across the area. A Miwok group known as the Huimen people lived in Liuaneglua, the largest nearby village, located in what is now called Sausalito. Villages were built near marshes and streams. The land and the sea gave us all the other materials we needed - wood for tools and fire, plants for food and medicine, and the animals for food, tools, and clothing.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Look up at the grassy hills around Fort Baker... These emerald winter, turned vibrant golden, late summer grasslands are a signature feature of California... Sadly, only one percent of the state's native grasslands are intact, due to overgrazing and introduced European grasses. Yet, the remaining grasslands harbor the majority of the state's rare and endangered species.<br /> Fort Baker contains remnants of the most species-rich grassland community in North America, the California coastal prairie. Coastal prairie is dominated by perennial bunchgrasses that can live for over 100 years. And these grasses shelter an abundance of wildflowers and bulbs. These grasslands also provide habitat for rodents such as mice, gophers, and voles, which are in turn hunted by hawks and other birds of prey. Some ground nesting birds also make their home here. But insects truly own this place, and among them are many species of butterflies, including the endangered Mission Blue.</p>",

It is re-enforced here and there with retaining walls to combat erosion and interspersed with bridges over precipices dropping to the sea. (Sound of rockslides) And all this needed to be in place before construction could begin on the new lighthouse.<br /> <br /> Please walk carefully across the cement bridge. Look up and locate the radar tower. Please stop when you are standing below the radar tower.<br /> <br /> There is a vertical swath of dirt running down from the top of the radar tower. The Point Bonita Lighthouse trail is built on two very different kinds of rock, both well represented here. On the left side of this small thrust fault line, there is a wall of diabase, an intrusive igneous rock that forms beneath basaltic volcanoes. This thrust of greenish rock braces Point Bonita against the pounding storms and crashing sea.<br /> <br /> On the right side is weathered graywacke sandstone, the crumbly light-colored sedimentary rock. It has begun to break down, and will eventually become sand and soil. Here, the graywacke is unstable-prone to erosion by the powerful forces of wind and sea. And there are many small pieces, which have broken off and fallen to the ground in front of this rock outcrop. Although the diabase at this location appears much more durable than the graywacke, along the path there are many places where the iron-rich diabase and pillow basalt have weathered, contributing to Point Bonita's landslide history.<br /> <br /> This fault line extends to the cove below, near the old lifesaving station. The engineers building the lighthouse at the time could never have foreseen the extent of the geologic calamity, which was to occur just three decades later.<br /> <br /> Now continue down the trail.<br /> <br /> 1906 EARTHQUAKE<br /> <br /> Official Point Bonita Log Entry: April 18th, 1906<br /> Terrible earthquake occurred at 5:12 a.m., doing considerable damage to the assistant's quarters. Shaking the gables' ends out, and cracking it so badly, that it was with difficulty that the families were taken out without injury... the doors were all jammed, so the keeper had to take his family out the kitchen window. (Sound of crashing, glass breaking, screaming, etc.)<br /> <br /> This destruction overwhelmed the keeper's house, a half-century old structure with unreinforced walls, at the top of the hill.<br /> <br /> Now stop and face San Francisco across the strait.<br /> <br /> The '06 earthquake shook the city to the core. The devastating quake ignited an even more devastating fire.

    "audioDescription": "The relative ease of building the first lighthouse on the lightly slopped hill, made way for what was to become an engineer's nightmare. To reach the new location, at the end of this spit, much preparation was required. Notice how the path winds its way among jagged rock. It is re-enforced here and there with retaining walls to combat erosion and interspersed with bridges over precipices dropping to the sea. (Sound of rockslides) And all this needed to be in place before construction could begin on the new lighthouse. Please walk carefully across the cement bridge. Look up and locate the radar tower. Please stop when you are standing below the radar tower. There is a vertical swath of dirt running down from the top of the radar tower. The Point Bonita Lighthouse trail is built on two very different kinds of rock, both well represented here. On the left side of this small thrust fault line, there is a wall of diabase, an intrusive igneous rock that forms beneath basaltic volcanoes. This thrust of greenish rock braces Point Bonita against the pounding storms and crashing sea. On the right side is weathered graywacke sandstone, the crumbly light-colored sedimentary rock. It has begun to break down, and will eventually become sand and soil. Here, the graywacke is unstable-prone to erosion by the powerful forces of wind and sea. And there are many small pieces, which have broken off and fallen to the ground in front of this rock outcrop. Although the diabase at this location appears much more durable than the graywacke, along the path there are many places where the iron-rich diabase and pillow basalt have weathered, contributing to Point Bonita's landslide history. This fault line extends to the cove below, near the old lifesaving station. The engineers building the lighthouse at the time could never have foreseen the extent of the geologic calamity, which was to occur just three decades later. Now continue down the trail. 1906 EARTHQUAKE Official Point Bonita Log Entry: April 18th, 1906 Terrible earthquake occurred at 5:12 a.m., doing considerable damage to the assistant's quarters. Shaking the gables' ends out, and cracking it so badly, that it was with difficulty that the families were taken out without injury... the doors were all jammed, so the keeper had to take his family out the kitchen window. (Sound of crashing, glass breaking, screaming, etc.) This destruction overwhelmed the keeper's house, a half-century old structure with unreinforced walls, at the top of the hill. Now stop and face San Francisco across the strait. The '06 earthquake shook the city to the core. The devastating quake ignited an even more devastating fire. (Fire and fire engine bells clanging in the distance) Half the city was in flames, and the residents of Point Bonita could only watch helplessly. (Sound of flames crescendo) Please walk down the trail to the white bench that faces the Golden Gate Bridge. You can sit on the bench when you reach it.",

And even better, they had electricity, hot and cold running water, and indoor toilet and shower facilities; all state of the art for that time.

Several years later, the structure stood nearly complete, but no guns were placed here until the Spanish American War of 1898, when three already obsolete 8-inch rifled Rodman guns were installed.<br /> <br /> Today, this enclosure not only preserves this unique example of 1870s military architecture, but also protects critical grassland habitat for the endangered Mission blue butterfly.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Before you is one of the most notable places in the world where art and engineering meet -- the majestic span of the Golden Gate Bridge. But in 1916, when San Francisco officials started considering a bridge across the bay, many thought a bridge at this location would be impossible. It was too wide for a beam bridge, too deep for a cantilever or truss bridge, and the strong winds might destroy a suspension bridge. But when bridge engineer Joseph Strauss was asked if he could build it, his answer was an emphatic, yes!<br /> <br /> Work started with Strauss' design team, who created the beautiful art deco bridge that complements the dramatic setting.<br /> <br /> The International Orange paint color was even developed to fit the location. Over four years, hundreds of construction workers built the bridge, completing it in 1937. The daunting project included setting underwater footings in 100 feet of water, constructing the 746-foot high towers, spinning 80,000 miles of wire to create the suspension cables, and building the road deck 220 feet above the water.<br /> <br /> Today this 4200-foot long international icon is being retrofitted to withstand a magnitude 8 plus earthquake, preserving it for future generations.</p>",

So, I became a Mexican citizen, married my love and built a home made of redwood, near the Yerba Buena cove. Our house was the first home in what is now San Francisco.<br /> <br /> After a number of years, I obtained land in the southern Marin headlands, The Rancho was officially granted to me from Governor Alvarado. The land was rich and untouched, 20,000 acres of what is known now as Rancho Sausalito. And in 1844 I was awarded a second tract of fertile land along the Mendocino coast.<br /> <br /> I had a made a series of poor investments and at the end of my life, I had lost almost everything. In a last attempt to salvage what we had, 640 acres were deeded over to my wife and the rest of the rancho was left in the hands of my administrator, Samuel Throckmorton.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>One aspect of serpentinite rocks is an abundance of seeps and springs formed where groundwater moves along fracture surfaces and escapes to the surface. This groundwater is often very alkaline and can be home to plant species specifically adapted to those conditions, like Franciscan thistle. The willows seen here grow naturally in wet areas and are indicative of water near the ground surface, in this case coming from serpentine seeps.<br /> <br /> This willow grove provides exceptional habitat for songbirds. Keep your eyes peeled for warblers and sparrows. You may also hear the chittering and whistling dive-bombing of an Anna's hummingbird. Hawks and ravens are common sights overhead taking advantage of the updrafts over the bluffs, and looking out to sea you may spot cormorants, brown pelicans and surf scoters.</p>",

Notice the sound of the Eucalyptus branches creaking and the fragrance of the leaves. Are there animals sharing the space? Are other people engaging with the sculpture in the same fashion? Considering the sculpture as a layer on the landscape that is not permanent, what does it add to the space, physically and metaphorically to you? <br /> <br /> - Created over two summers in 2010 and 2011<br /> - Extends 1,200 feet, roughly the length of four football fields<br /> - Always open<br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://www.presidio.gov/places/Pages/andy-goldsworthys-wood-line.aspx\">Andy Goldsworthy's <strong>Wood Line</strong> </a></p>",

    "audioDescription": "The massive three story limestone barn measures 60 feet by 110 feet per floor. It is built into the hillside to aid with insulation. The lowest level housed horses, milk cows, and baby calves when needed. The middle floor stored loose hay, held the original grain bin, and allowed for some equipment storage. The top floor stored loose hay and later four large grain bins were constructed in the center. Large metal support beams were added throughout when this addition occurred. They were needed to support the added weight of the grain. Trap doors on the middle and top floors allowed for easier handling of loose hay to the animals below. Two very sturdy ramps made of metal railroad tracks and wood plank flooring are on the north side of the building. These ramps went to the top floor, allowing for a team of horses and wagon to cart up the loaded hay for storage. Original construction allowed for the wagon to enter one side, travel through the barn, and then exit using the other ramp. There was originally a large windmill on the barn, used to grind grain and chop hay. The roof was originally covered with tin (7,000 pounds), but has been replaced with asphalt shingles. Two large wooden structures called cupolas are atop the building and were added with the installation of the large grain bins. Their function is to allow for grain dust to escape when the grain was being placed into the grain bins upstairs. Without these structures, grain dust is highly explosive. The slightest spark can cause an explosion.",

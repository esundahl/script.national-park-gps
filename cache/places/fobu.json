Yellow areas of the lake, labeled remaining sediments of Fossil Lake, make up less than a sixth of the whole lake. The outline of Fossil Butte National Monument is located in the northeast section of the lake. Caption: copyright 2016 Colorado Plateau Geosystems Inc. Text: Erosion: Look south across the valley for the tan layers on the ridgetops. These layers were deposited by Fossil Lake and were continuous with the ones on top of Fossil Butte in front of you. After Fossil Lake, the stream-deposited Wasatch Formation, the red rock, continued to accumulate. Deposition ended about 45 million-years-ago. Since then, erosion has cut down through the rock layers, mostly in the form of creeks and streams. This erosion created the valleys with limestones capping the ridges which provides access to quarry fossils. Five rock layers are commercially quarried; of those, the monument has completed research on one layer: the Gastropod Beds. Nearly 70% of the 47-inch-thick Gastropod Beds have been destroyed by erosion, causing an estimated loss of 51,437,532,000 fossil fishes.",

Drawings show a slump, with the land moving down a hill like stairs, and a debris flow, with the land moving in a continuous slide. Text: Slump or Debris Flow: Is the disturbed land in front of you a slump or debris flow? A debris flow (frequently called a landslide in the news) can exceed 50 miles an hour. The earth churns and mixes. At the bottom it may break like a wave and surge up the other side of the valley. Slumps are different. The soil moves slowly as a block, often coming to rest with trees and other plants still growing undisturbed. The movement may be undetectable, even to an observer standing on the block. Slumps and debris flows occur on slopes after water lubricates the contact between particles or the soil and underlying rock. Sometimes, when conditions are right, the slightest vibrations will trigger a journey downhill. Answer: It is a slump",

Caption: copyright 2016 Colorado Plateau Geosystems Inc Text: The Easter Edge of Fossil Lake The eastern edge of Fossil Lake was deeper nearshore due to the asymmetric shape of the basin. The visible quarry and one other produce more specimens of stingrays and Hiodon falcatus since they are closer to shore than other quarries. The area between Fossil Lake and Lake Gosiute to the east was a forested ridge on which a variety of birds and mammals lived. This ridge has been eroding since the time of Fossil Lake so it is unknown how tall it once was.",

After the lake dried up, streams cut channels eroding away the sediments. As erosion continues, the lake sediments on the top of the ridges will eventually erode completely away. The Wasatch Formation: The rocks of the Wasatch Formation are composed of silts, clays, and patches of gravel. These sediments were deposited by streams flowing through the forest. When the streams flooded, silts and clays were carried across the forest floor. As the composition of the stream waters changed, the colors seen in the hillsides changed. Gravels need to have high-energy water to move, so they are only found in stream channels.",

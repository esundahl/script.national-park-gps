It faces away from the path, so that when you stand looking at it, you see the path beyond and the wide grassy field in the middle of the settlement. From there, to your right, back towards the barn, is a tall, dry stone wall.<br /><br />The panel has two old photographs down the right side. The one on top shows a man wearing jeans, a long-sleeved shirt, and a wide hat. He faces us, leaning his left hand on a plow which has four horses hitched to it. The caption reads, \"Roy Stubbs at his plow in the 1920s.\"<br /><br />The bottom photo shows the Bruckners sitting for a family portrait in the 1900s. They form two lines in front of a cabin. Three women and a grey-haired man sit in front with a young boy standing in the middle. Standing in back are three young men, a young woman and two younger girls.<br /><br />On the left side of the panel is a map showing the buildings here in the settlement, which form a rough circle. At the top is The Johnson Cabin and text that reads, \"The landscape around you reflects more than 100 years of agricultural use.\"<br /><br />Moving clockwise, next is the Bruckner Barn. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"The stone barn to your right was built in 1884 by John Bruckner, patriarch of the family that lived on this site for more than 80 years. In 1972, the National Park Service acquired the Bruckner property with the help of funds donated by Lyndon B. Johnson.\"<br /><br />Near the bottom is another barn structure. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"To your left is the James Polk Johnson barn. J.P. Johnson, President Johnson's second cousin, owned this farm from 1872-1882, during the waning days of the open-range cattle industry. He later founded the town of Johnson City on land that had once been his ranch.\"<br /><br />Finally, at lower left is a small building, water tank and windmill. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"Stubbs Cooler House. Used to store vegetables and other perishables, this building was built by yet another Johnson relative, N.T. Stubbs. The adjacent windmill and water tank were common to every hill country farm. In the days before electricity, wind power pumped water from wells.\"<br /><br />End of description.",

Off the left, set back from the road, is a small barn.<br /><br />Text across the top of the panel reads, <br /><br />\"To a Texas rancher like Lyndon Johnson, conservation meant getting the most from the soil, water, and grass. The landscape before you reflects some of President Johnson's conservation efforts. These upper fields are terraced to control erosion and contoured to channel water into tanks (ponds). The grasses used here were, and are, genetically improved—tailored especially to this climate to provide maximum nutrition. With diligent watering, fertilizing, and cattle rotation, these fields yielded three cuttings of grass each year. Of LBJ's nine ranches (most of them larger than the LBJ Ranch), only on this one did he practice intensive conservation. The other ranches were â€˜unimproved' and yielded only one crop of grass each year. Their appearance bore little resemblance to the neat landscape you see here.\"<br /><br />Along the bottom of the panel is a photograph of a flat-bed truck in the middle of a field, hay bales scattered about.

Another man stands at the bottom of the conveyer belt. The caption reads,<br /><br />\"Of the three crops of grass, ranch hands usually cut one for hay. When the other crops were ready, the hands would rotate cattle through the fields to graze the fields down—a process that usually took 150 head of cattle about a week.\"<br /><br />Across the middle of the panel are five smaller photographs under the title of \"Annual Cycle.\" From left to right, the first shows a man kneeling in a plowed field, writing in a notebook balanced on his knee. In front of him is a shovel, bucket and other digging tools. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"February-March: Soil samples taken to determine mineral deficiencies.\"<br /><br />The next photograph shows a man on a tractor riding across a field, pulling behind a mechanism with two, cylindrical tanks. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"April-May: First application of fertilizer, based on soil analysis.\"<br /><br />The middle picture shows a view across a grass-covered field to a distant truck, its flat-bed piled high with hay bales, men standing on top. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"About June 1: Hay is cut for the first time. The grass is fertilized again and irrigated if necessary with water drawn from the Pedernales River. About July1: Hay is cut for the second time. Grass is again fertilized and irrigated as needed.\"<br /><br />The next picture shows a small herd of cattle grazing in a green field. The cattle are brown with white faces. Trees are scattered in the background. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"August - November: Cattle rotate into the field to graze down grasses before the first freeze.\"<br /><br />The last photograph shows a large field with a small pond in the middle. The grass covering it is very short, with bare dirt showing through in the foreground. A few head of cattle stand or lie in the field. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"December - January: Fields are dormant.\"<br /><br /><br />End of description.<br /><br /><br />",

A ramp leads up to the breezeway porch, and there's a modern bench on either side of the ramp. There is a drop off the porch on the back side through the breezeway. Posts support the eaves of the roof and stone chimneys stand on both ends of the structure. There are closed, wooden doors on both the inside left and right in the breezeway, one to each room.

The first burial, in 1905, is marked by a white marble gravestone with a lamb on top and belongs to the president's great-grandmother, Priscilla McIntosh Bunton. Due to a violent spring storm and river flooding, she was unable to be buried beside her husband at the Stonewall Community Cemetery. A spot within a grove of live oak trees was chosen for her final resting place on her son-in-law's (Sam Ealy Johnson Sr., the president's grandfather) property.<br /> <br /> President and Mrs. Johnson's gravestones are the tallest red granite markers in the main row. While looking at the headstones from the main cemetery gate, the headstones to the right of the first lady and president mark the final resting places of the president's parents and grandparents. Rebekah Johnson, the president's mother, died in 1958 while her son was majority leader of the US Senate. Next is the burial site for Sam E. Johnson Jr., the president's father. Sam died in 1937, a few months after Lyndon Johnson was elected to the US House of Representatives. The president's grandparents, Sam Ealy Johnson Sr. and his wife Eliza (Bunton) Johnson, share a headstone.<br /> <br /> To the left of President and Mrs Johnson are the president's brother, Sam, and his three sisters, Rebekah, Josefa, and Lucia. Rebekah's husband, Oscar Bobbitt, is also buried in the main row as is Lucia's husband, Birge Alexander.<br /> <br /> The prominent gray gravestone in front marks the burial site of the president's Aunt Frank and Uncle Clarence Martin. It was the Martins' house and property that Senator Johnson acquired in 1951.<br /> <br /> After lying in state at the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C. and at his library in Austin, Texas, President Johnson's funeral was held at his ranch on a cold and rainy day, January 25, 1973. Hundreds of people attended the funeral, which was conducted by Reverend Billy Graham.</p>",

A concrete sidewalk extends across the front of the cemetery wall and partway down the left side. At the far left corner stand three graphic panels. A low, black, iron garden fence separates the sidewalk from the cemetery stone wall. A black, metal gate forms the cemetery entrance where a small sign reads, <br /><br />\"Private. Please do not enter.\"<br /><br />Beyond the gate mowed grass covers the cemetery with a number of red granite grave markers and a few gray stone markers. Spreading trees shade most of the cemetery.<br /><br />A line of the red granite markers faces us about a third of the way into the cemetery. The two markers just right of center are taller. The one on the right is President Johnson's marker and the one on the left belongs to Lady Bird Johnson. His marker has the presidential seal on it, while hers has a flower blossom, a bluebell. <br /><br />A metal plaque just to the right of the gate has raised letters which read, \"Elegy written in a country churchyard. The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, the lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea, the plowman homeward plods his weary way and leaves the world to darkness and to me.\"<br /><br />Just to the left of the gate is a 3 foot by 2 foot graphic panel standing on two metal posts. The panel background is the front row of the cemetery with a close up inset of the president's and first lady's tombstones. At the bottom right there is a quote from Reverend Billy Graham's eulogy on January 25, 1973 which reads,<br /><br />\"Here amidst these familiar hills and under these expansive skies and under these oak trees that he loved so much, his earthly life has come full circle... his roots were deep, right here on this spot in the hills country.\" <br /><br />End of description.",

Students walked to school to learn the “3Rs”—<strong>r</strong>eading, w<strong>r</strong>iting, and a<strong>r</strong>ithmetic—in a sparsely decorated room heated by a wood stove and illuminated by kerosene lamps. A water bucket and dipper provided drinking water. Children brought their lunches from home in tin pails.<br /> <br /> In 1912, four-year-old Lyndon Johnson began his education in this building. Kate Deadrich taught 30 students ranging from preschool to eighth grade. Boys sat on one side of the room, girls on the other. The future president, youngest student in the school, often sat on Miss Kate’s lap for reading lessons.<br /> <br /> Inspired by his brief time in this simple schoolhouse, Lyndon Johnson would champion the cause of public education throughout his life. <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lyjo/learn/photosmultimedia/junction-school-virtual-tour.htm\">Go To Virtual Tour</a></h3>",

Just to the left of the panel a flagstone sidewalk leads through a gate in the fence and around the right side of the house.<br /><br />The background of the panel is filled with a black and white photograph of two men with short, dark hair, dressed in business suits. The man in the foreground is speaking into a handheld microphone attached to a coiled wire stretching down out of sight. Behind him, the other man is replacing a telephone handset on a rectangular box with a small antenna. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"Secret Service agents in action, May 1966.\"<br /><br />Text at the top of the panel reads, <br /><br />\"The US Secret Service maintained a presence with the Johnson family for 46 years beginning in 1961 when Lyndon Johnson was inaugurated as vice president. Over that lifetime of service, agents witnessed many events, both in Washington and Texas. One tragic event, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, launched Lyndon Johnson's presidency. During the next five years the Secret Service protected President Johnson round-the-clock from protesters, riots, fires and assassination. This protection continued after President Johnson left the White House in 1969 and returned to Texas. The small home in front of you served as the Secret Service's command post on the LBJ Ranch.<br /><br />\"Following the former president's death in 1973, agents continued to protect Lady Bird Johnson. A security detail remained with Mrs. Johnson until her death on July 11, 2007 - making her the longest protected first lady of the twentieth century.\"<br /><br />End of description.",

Over thirty years later, President Johnson wanted to tear down the structure. However, the family's architect, Roy White, felt that the barn complemented the landscape as well as the house, and family friends also pleaded for its preservation. In the end, the barn was saved and rehabilitated.<br /> <br /> Before construction of the Klein Shop in 1967 and before ranching operations were moved northwest of the airstrip, the barn had adjacent corrals. Four pens, a chute alley and a grass patch could work up to 60 cattle at a time. By the mid-1960s, the cattle operation had grown as had the function of the Texas White House. Increased activity of White House Communications and the US Secret Service-as well as Mrs. Johnson's displeasure with the livestock smell and noise—prompted the move to the current Show Barn.<br /> <br /> Today, the historic Martin Barn contains exhibits on the famous LBJ Ranch barbecues held down in the live oak grove along the river.</p>",

The process was difficult, and there were significant challenges such as minimum population density requirements that needed to be overcome.<br /> <br /> Newly elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937, Lyndon Johnson immediately began lobbying the Roosevelt administration to waive the population density requirement. Meanwhile, local representatives across five Texas counties, sought support from area ranchers and residents, and in May 1938, the Pedernales Electric Cooperative was established.

Johnson. The panel text reads: \"In the 1930s, investor-owned utilities didn't consider it profitable to extend miles of electric line to sparsely populated regions. As a result, rural residents lived an old-fashioned, labor-intensive lifestyle. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Rural Electrification Administration (R.E.A.) to encourage the formation of the rural electric cooperatives.<br /><br />\"After his election to U.S. Congress in 1937, Lyndon B. Johnson worked with representatives from Blanco, Burnet, Gillespie, hays and Llano counties to incorporate \"Pedernales Electric Cooperative\" on May 19, 1938. Despite organizational efforts, PEC could not meet the population density required for an REA loan.<br /><br />\"Johnson was determined to honor a campaign promise to â€˜bring the lights' to his beloved Hill Country. He obtained a private audience with President Roosevelt and successfully lobbied for a waiver. On September 27, 1938, PEC was granted a loan of about $1.3 million to extend one thousand eight-hundred miles of line to nearly three thousand families.<br /><br />\"The electrification of the Hill Country provided a backbone for opportunity in Central Texas, supporting the development of industries in what has become one of the fastest growing regions in America. Today, Pedernales Electric Cooperative is the largest distribution electric cooperative in the United States.\"<br /><br />End of Description.<br />",

Close to the sign is the back of an outhouse made of weathered, grey boards. The Boyhood Home is to the far left.<br /><br />The right side of the panel is filled with a black and white photograph of a young woman standing in a dirt yard, her arms around the neck of a young horse. A small barn sits in the background past barbed wire fencing. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"The Johnson yard looked more like a barnyard than a backyard, as the background of this photo of LBJ's cousin Ava Johnson Cox shows. Young Lyndon once broke his leg when he fell from the barn visible behind Ava.\"<br /><br />Down the left side are two smaller photographs. The top one shows a young boy wearing a large hat, the bib of his overalls just visible. The caption reads, \"Lyndon Baines Johnson, age 7.\"<br /><br />The bottom photograph shows a dark-haired man standing in front of a microphone on the wide porch of a white house. The yard in front of him is filled with people sitting in chairs. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"Lyndon Johnson making a speech from the front porch of his boyhood home during his 1941 Senate campaign.\"<br /><br />Text along the bottom of the panel reads, <br /><br />\"Lyndon Johnson spent most of ten years living in this home - a decade that profoundly affected the future president's view of the world. A neat landscape in front of you bears little resemblance to the backyard Lyndon Johnson knew. In Johnson's youth, this yard included almost everything needed to sustain a family: an orchard, vegetable garden, woodpile, windmill, barn, smokehouse. Hog wire fences kept in chickens and livestock. Laundry - scrubbed by hand - swayed under the intense hill country sun. Though Lyndon Johnson always thought fondly of Johnson City, he spent much of his political career trying to lessen for all Americans the hard realities he knew as a youth: no electricity, poor medical care, inadequate education, prejudice.\"<br /><br />End of description.",

The small, red house behind its white picket fence is slightly to the right, grassy fields and outbuildings at either side.<br /><br />The right side of the panel is filled with an old, black and white photograph of a large family, posing on and around an old automobile. At the right side is a gray-haired woman, sitting in a wheelchair. A dark-haired man stands behind her, using a hat to shade the woman's head. A gray-haired man with beard and mustache sits in the driver's seat. Other men and women sit and stand on either side and behind him. A number of children cluster around, sitting on the fenders and standing on the running boards. One boy leans against the front of the car, squinting in the bright sun. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"Sam Ealy Johnson Sr. with his wife Eliza and family members gather around a Model T Ford parked in the driveway of this home. Lyndon Johnson may be the boy standing in front of the car.\"<br /><br />Text down the left side of the panel reads, <br /><br />\"The scene was a common one: young Lyndon Johnson, only a few years old, toddling down the road to visit his grandparents in this house. Here he found a ready supply of apples, candy, and affection. The future president felt a powerful attraction to his paternal grandparents, Sam Johnson Sr. and Eliza Bunton Johnson; he would always identify himself with the frontier struggles they had endured. Sam and Eliza Johnson were among the first and most successful Hill Country cattle drovers, settling near what is now Johnson City in the late 1860s. After amassing a fortune, they lost it, and eventually resettled here along the Pedernales, where, Eliza Johnson remembered, â€˜the tempo of life was slower.' Sam lived here until his death in 1915. Eliza lived here until 1917. Both are buried in the Johnson family cemetery.\"<br /><br />Below the text are early portraits of Sam and Eliza Johnson. The one on the left shows a dark-haired man with goatee and mustache, wearing a jacket with a wide lapel. The one on the right shows a woman with dark hair pulled back with a hat on top, long ribbons hanging down in back. Her dress is tightly gathered at the waist with a wide belt.<br /><br /><br />End of description.",

Some of the natural and historic features could be hazardous to you. Please watch your step. Observe farm animals from a distance. Supervise your children closely.\"<br /><br />Also behind the center is a metal sign which reads, <br /><br />\"After the Civil War, Lyndon B. Johnson's grandfather, Sam Ealy Johnson, Sr., brought his bride Eliza to this place to live in a â€˜dog-trot' cabin. Sam and his brother, Tom, bought cattle on speculation to drive in great herds over the Chisholm Trail to the railhead in Kansas.<br /><br />The legendary cattle drives were long and hard and sometimes deadly; Tom drowned at a river-crossing in 1877. But equally long and hard were the days for families left behind on this isolated frontier. With the men gone on the long drive, Eliza faced constant difficulties and dangers, including Indians who still resisted the white man's invasion. On top of the occasional danger, however, was the plain backbreaking work of it all; to thrive on this frontier demanded seemingly endless daily toil and sacrifice.<br /><br />In 1871 the cattle market collapsed - too many cattle - and Sam and Eliza Johnson moved to Hays County, near Austin. Later they returned to this area to settle near Stonewall on land that would one day become part of the LBJ Ranch. There they lived to see the birth of their grandson, a future president of the United States.\"<br /><br />End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>In July 1955, Senator Johnson suffered a severe heart attack at a friend's estate in Virginia. After nearly a month at Bethesda Naval Hospital and a second month at home in Washington, DC, he was permitted by doctors to return to his Texas ranch for further recovery. Even before the heart attack, the Johnsons were planning to build a swimming pool southeast of their home.<br /> <br /> During his convalescence, the pool, a cabana, and area landscaping were planned and constructed under his watchful eye. For a multi-tasking man with an incredibly active mind, taking on this project was an effective way to pass the time while regaining his health. The senator would set up a yard chair outside to observe the excavation of the gaping hole and the pouring of concrete.<br /> <br /> In the end, the Johnsons had a kidney-shaped pool, long enough for laps and deep enough for diving. Like the ranch and like their home, it was a place for family time and for the business of politics.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Swimming Pool, 123 words.<br /><br />From the front stone wall, situated in between the Texas White House and the pool house, there is a large, kidney-shaped pool. The wider section on the left is shallow compared to the right side which is narrow and deep. A long diving board is at the far right end of the pool, hanging over the deep side. Closest to the front stone wall is the shallowest section with only one step in the water. Across the shallow end, a steel, curved handrail leads to three steps in the water. On the right, two curved, metal handrails lead to four ladders steps in the deep end. The whole pool has a trim of red bricks and a paved sidewalk following its entire circumference.<br /><br />End of Description",

The park protects the birthplace, home, ranch, and final resting place of Lyndon B. Johnson, 36th President of the United States.<br /> <br /> In November 1963 President Kennedy was assasinated in Dallas, Texas. This occurred as civil rights legislation began to take shape in Congress. President Lyndon Johnson addressed Congress five days after Kennedy's assassination, urging them to pass the bill. Johnson was famous for his tactics in getting legislation passed even as a member of Congress himself (he served in both the House and the Senate), before serving in the White House, and he used these skills to pressure Congress into passing what would eventualy become the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<br /> <br /> The Voting Rights Acts was a result of two things: 1. The elimination of the voting rights provision in the original Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 2. The Selma to Montgomery March in March 1965, which was a peaceful 54-mile march in an effort to register black voters in the South. The marchers were met with extreme violencefrom local authorites and white terrorists groups. Six days after the march, LBJ pledged his support for a Voting Rights Act.<br /> <br /> Following Dr. King's assassination in Memphis, Tennessee on April 4, 1968, President Johnson used the political climate at the time to push for more civil rights legislation. In a ltter to Congree, Johnson invoked Dr. King's assassination, imploring Congress to act in the name of a man \"who devoted his life to nonviolent achievement of rights that most Americans take for granted...\" On APril 10, 1968, the day after Dr. King's funeral, the House voted to pass the Civil RIghts Act of 1968 (commonly referred to as the Fair Housing Act of 1968).<br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Arial\",sans-serif\"><span style=\"background:white\">The Lyndon B.

The back of the building faces the small parking area. A low wooden porch at back may be reached by three steps in the rear or a short ramp to the left of the steps. From the porch a door leads into a small exhibit area where the interior has been furnished to show how it might have looked around 1912. A push button mounted to the exhibit wall may be pressed for an audio recording about the school and its connection to Lyndon Johnson. The front of the building has a double door made of wood and a flag pole to the left. A long set of concrete steps leads down to the road, where a large, brown park service sign reads, \"Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park. LBJ Ranch.\" There are four, double-hung windows on each side of the building and the peaked roof is covered with wood shingles. A single metal stove pipe sits on the ridgeline. When standing at the rear, facing the building, a round, covered well sits to the right. To the left, along the side of the building is a wooden table, which has a graphic panel on its top. Another sign is located at the side of the road in front of the building. End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The home of Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson at the LBJ Ranch was a place of family and of politics...as well as a place for rejuvenation. During his five-year administration, President Johnson spent a quarter of his time here—74 visits totaling 490 days. To the world, it became known as \"The Texas White,\" but for the Johnson family, it was simply known as \"Our Heart's Home.\"<br /> <br /> While Lyndon Johnson was growing up, it was the home of his Uncle Clarence and Aunt Frank Martin. Some of his earliest memories as a young boy were of the \"big house on the river.\" The house he loved for decades became his in 1951 after he purchased it and approximately 240 acres from his widowed aunt.<br /> <br /> As his career grew, so did the house and its functions. The Johnsons added an office in 1958 when he was senate majority leader. In 1962, the dining room and kitchen were both extended to create additional space for entertaining when he was vice president. Additional bedrooms and bathrooms were created and remodeled to house invited guests including world leaders such as the President of Mexico, West German Chancellor, and Israeli Prime Minister. In 1967, late in his presidency, the couple added two master suites for the comfort of their upcoming retirement.<br /> <br /> In the end, the Texas White House expanded to include 28 rooms (8 bedrooms, 9 bathrooms) spanning over 8,400 square feet.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Texas White House. 492 words<br /><br />This 3-and-a-half-foot by 2-foot graphic panel sits at side of the house, near the white fence that encloses the front yard. The yard with its shady trees lies beyond the sign with the house itself slightly to the left. Around the fence corner to the right is the front fence overlooking the whole Texas White House. The structure description follows the panel description.<br /><br />The panel is filled with a black and white photograph of a group of men around a table on a lawn, stone wall visible in the back ground. The men sit in lawn chairs, some with notepads in their laps, other leaning on the paper-strewn table. Most wear dark suits or military uniforms. President Johnson sits at left, in shirtsleeves, as he looks on papers on the table. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"President Johnson meets with his military advisors and Joint Chiefs of Staff in the front yard of the Texas White House, December 22, 1964.\"<br /><br />Text at the bottom of the panel reads, <br /><br />\"Although he lived in Washington for much of his adult life, President Johnson always considered this house his home. During the White House years it served as a busy office, a working ranch, and a quiet refuge from the pressures of being president in tumultuous times. The shade of the big live oak in front of you often served as a makeshift meeting room for the Johnson cabinet.<br /><br />\"President Johnson's capacity to influence or control events did not diminish during his stays at the Texas White House. Outbuildings held sophisticated electronics. Airplanes and helicopters buzzed along the ranch's runway. Inside the house, Johnson met with staff, read papers, watched television, and worked the phones constantly. He also hosted a steady procession of cabinet officers, legislators, celebrities, and heads of state.\"<br /><br />Description Continues...<br /><br />Moving to the right around the fence corner is a full view of the house. From here, the largest live oak tree is set on the left side of the yard. Beyond the tree, there is a one story room with a field stone wall and chimney on its far left and a long porch at its front. Connected to the right of this porch begins a two-story structure made of large blocks of limestone. Its small porch has four white columns and an entry door and window. The second story roof is gabled. <br /><br />To its right is an identical gabled roof above first floor bay windows on a wooden structure. The two gabled roofs are connected by a first floor porch and second floor porch balcony with cross railing. There are green hedges in front of the porches. Attached to the bay windowed room is a single-story addition with a window and roof skylight and three larger windows to the right. At the far right of the building is a short, side porch with stone steps. The swimming pool is on the far right side of the yard beyond another live oak tree. <br /><br />End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The congregation of Trinity Lutheran Church traces its history to 1902, when it was first organized in the nearby Albert, Texas schoolhouse. The members donated funds to purchase three acres of land overlooking the Pedernales River, and a small sanctuary was built here in 1904, just across from where Lyndon Johnson would be born in 1908. The elegant structure you see today was constructed in 1928. A fine example of the Gothic Revival style of architecture, the church features lovely arched window and door openings, a Gothic steeple, and its original pressed-metal siding. Worship services were conducted in the German language until 1950.<br /> <br /> Although President Johnson was a member of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and Lady Bird Johnson was Episcopalian, they would frequently attend services at Trinity Lutheran while at home on the LBJ Ranch.<br /> <br /> The church grounds also became the site for one of the first Head Start Schools in the nation. Operation Head Start was a strategic program in President Johnson's Great Society educational program. Launched in the summer of 1965, Head Start provides pre-school children with health, nutrition, education, and other social services. Since its founding, more than 36 million children have participated in Head Start programs, preparing them for the classroom at schools around the country. After his retirement, Lyndon Johnson would visit the Stonewall Head Start, arriving with candy for the children who knew him, not as \"Mr. President,\" but as \"Mr. Jelly Bean.\"</p>",

Early on, the hangar was used for hay storage at one point, but during Johnson's presidency, it was a gathering place for community and political events as well as for official press conferences. The hangar was even used as a movie theater for the Johnson family and their friends. Today, it has been repurposed as the LBJ Ranch District visitor center, complete with exhibits, park film, and bookstore.</p> <h4>The Many Functions of the Hangar</h4> <p>Hay was not the only thing that has been stored in the hangar. Zoom into this December 29, 1963 photo. Underneath the wings of the aircraft is a stack of lumber. In this photo, President Johnson takes Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ( <strong>front passenger seat</strong> ) and others for a spin in the golf cart. Jack Valenti ( <strong>pictured in the dark jacket directly behind Johnson</strong> ) follows on foot.<br /> <br /> Protecting aircraft from the elements was the primary purpose for the hangar. In this 1965 photo, President Johnson has a conversation underneath the open hangar door. Today the hangar door has been opened permanently to allow a wall of glass windows to be added, thus giving visitors a panoramic view of the ranch from inside. Step inside the hangar and underneath the open door; look up and through a glass ceiling to see the hangar door.<br /> <br /> The hangar, with it's size and open space, made an ideal location for press conferences during President Johnson's time in office. Joining the president for this September 1967 press conference are Lynda Bird Johnson and her fiancé Captain Charles Robb ( <strong>far right</strong> ).<br /> <br /> Parties and dinners were often held in the hangar as well. On November 6, 1968, a dinner for military support personnel and their families was held. President Johnson spoke to the approximately 300 in attendance with his grandson, Patrick Lyndon Nugent, by his side. Notice the wall paneling, ceiling tiles, and lights which can still be seen in the hangar today.</p>",

Its many blades allowed for the windmill to hold up to the pressure of strong winds and still generate enough torque to pump water from the well during periods of low winds. The well water then flowed by gravity through a pipe to the wooden water trough inside the cooler house. Wind was an important resource that the settlers harnessed. Cooperation with nature was an integral part of life. <h4>Water Tank</h4> <br /> The water tank is an essential part of the pumping process. It stores water above the height of where it will be used, and then is gravity-fed into water troughs and buildings. No electric or mechanical energy source is required for this part of the process. <h4>Cooler House</h4> <br /> The original cooler house was built in the 1880s by N.T. Stubbs, a cousin by marriage to President Lyndon B. Johnson. The cooler house provided cold storage for perishable food and dairy products. It was constructed out of native limestone with walls 18 inches thick. Inside, shelves were built along the thick stone walls for storage of crocks filled with wild dewberries, hog plums, and garden vegetables such as onions, peas, beans, and tomatoes. Cans of milk and churns filled with cream for making butter were kept cool in the wooden water trough. Eggs, preserved in salt, and cabbage, stored in barrels for making sauerkraut, were kept on the cool, moist sand floor, while potatoes and other root vegetables were stored in a large box, layered with sand to keep them dry. <p> </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>In the early 20th century, general stores were an important fixture in small, rural towns such as Johnson City. Not only did they provide \"store-bought goods,\" but they served as social centers and community message centers. Shoppers who entered would be met by long counters, rounded glass showcases, and side walls lined with shelves, drawers, and bins holding all manner of items for sale. Imagine the Johnsons and their neighbors coming to the store to purchase such necessities as flour, tools, lanterns, fabric, or shoes. Lucky children with a little spending money could select penny candies from glass jars. The shop keeper would cut, grind, or weigh merchandise that required it, wrap the purchases with brown paper and string from a roll at the end of the counter, and ring the total up on the cash register. The waiting customers could catch up on the latest local news or peruse the notices posted on the store wall.<br /> <br /> W.E. \"Bud\" Withers and Warren and E.D. Spauldings operated the general store in Johnson City as a partnership from April 1909 until December 1915 when Withers bought out the Spauldings. He continued to run the business as <strong>W.E. Withers</strong> until 1925, first in the original frame building and then in the stone building which currently houses the Johnson City Bank.<br /> <br /> The historic Withers & Spauldings General Store now serves as an exhibit area and information center for Johnson City. Visitors can learn about Johnson City shopping and dining options as well as additional attractions in the surrounding Hill Country community.<br /> <br /> Staffed by Johnson City Chamber of Commerce members, the property is part of Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park and is managed by the National Park Service.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Withers and Spauldings General Store. 509 words<br /><br />This historic building is located on the southeast corner of Main Street and Lady Bird Lane. The vertical siding is painted a dark red. The shutters and doors are painted white. Along the front a vertical extension has white lettering that reads, \"Withers and Spauldings General Merchants.\" A sign in front reads, <br /><br />\"Welcome Center. Chamber of Commerce, Exhibits and information.\"<br /><br />From the Lady Bird Lane side, a set of five steps leads up to the board sidewalk which is covered by a roof on both sides of the building. Just to the right of the steps a ramp provides wheelchair access.<br /><br />The entrance to the building is a pair of double doors on the corner. A bench sits along each wall on either side of the doors.<br /><br />Near the steps on Lady Bird Lane is a tall vertical sign behind a glass front. Down the right side of the sign is an old photograph of a teenage boy dressed in a light-colored suit and a straw hat. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"Lyndon Baines Johnson, (nicknamed â€˜LBJ') at age 15, the year he graduated from high school. His family moved to Johnson City from the country west of here in 1913, when he was five years old.\"<br /><br />At bottom right is a smaller photograph of the general store with the dirt street in front full of turkeys. Several people stand on the store porch and along the street behind the turkeys. One man at right is outlined in red. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"Johnson City was once a gathering point for turkeys raised by local farmers. In this 1913 photograph of Withers and Spauldings, the president's father is outlined in red.\"<br /><br />Down the left side of the panel are two other photographs. One shows an old limestone building. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"The Johnson City Bank was formerly Withers Opera House, where plays - some written by Rebekah Baines Johnson, the president's mother - were performed.\"<br /><br />The other photograph shows a small white house. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"The LBJ Boyhood Home is located on Elm Street, a short walk from Withers and Spauldings and just one block from the park visitor center.\"<br /><br />At the bottom of the left side is a map showing the visitor center two blocks south of your current location with the Johnson Settlement area to the west and the Boyhood Home nearby.<br /><br />Text at the top of the panel reads, <br /><br />\"Johnson City, A Presidential Home Town. Several buildings in town were built and owned by Lyndon Johnson's ancestor James Polk Johnson or owned by his father Sam E. Johnson, Jr, including the old grist mill building next o Withers and Spauldings. Lyndon Johnson also had a hand in getting a hospital, new post office and a subsidized housing development for his home town.<br /><br />\"Withers and Spaulings. This building served as a dry goods store; general merchandise emporium; cotton, wool and mohair warehouse; and a youth recreation center. It has been restored to its appearance about 1915-1920. President Johnson gave it to the American people in December 1972.\"<br /><br />End of description.",

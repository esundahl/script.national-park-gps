    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Who Was Maggie Lena Walker?</strong></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>In spite of humble beginnings in post-Civil War Richmond, Virginia, Maggie Lena Walker achieved national prominence as a businesswoman and community leader. Her business acumen, personality, and lifelong commitment to a beneficial burial society fueled her climb to success. She was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mawa/learn/historyculture/female-bank-presidents.htm\">the first African American woman in the United States to found a bank</a>. As a leader her successes and vision offered tangible improvements in the way of life for African Americans and women.</p> <p><strong>Achievements</strong></p> <p>When she was a teenager, Maggie Mitchell joined the local council of the Independent Order of St. Luke. This fraternal burial society, established in 1867 in Baltimore, administered to the sick and aged, promoted humanitarian causes and encouraged individual self-help and integrity.</p> <p>She served in numerous capacities of increasing responsibility for the Order, from that of a delegate to the biannual convention to the top leadership position of Right Worthy Grand Secretary in 1899, a position she held until her death. Under her leadership the Order's membership and numbers of councils were significantly increased throughout the country and its finances achieved solvency. Through sound fiscal policies, a genius for public relations and enormous energy, she took a dying organization, gave it life and helped it thrive.</p> <p>In 1902 Mrs. Walker established a newspaper, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mawa/learn/historyculture/st-luke-herald.htm\">The St. Luke Herald</a>, to promote closer communication between the Order and the public. In speeches Mrs. Walker had reasoned, \"Let us put our money together; let us use our money; Let us put our money out at usury among ourselves, and reap the benefit ourselves.\" In 1903 she founded the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mawa/the-st-luke-penny-savings-bank.htm\">St. Luke Penny Savings Bank</a>. Mrs. Walker served as the bank's first president, which earned her the recognition of being the first African American woman to charter a bank in the United States. Later she agreed to serve as chairman of the board of directors when the bank merged with two other Richmond banks to become The Consolidated Bank and Trust Company. Until 2009, the bank thrived as the oldest continually African American-operated bank in the United States.</p> <p>In addition to her work for the Independent Order of St. Luke, Maggie Walker was active in civic groups. As an advocate of African American women's rights, she served on the board of trustees for several women's groups. Among them were the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) and the Virginia Industrial School for Girls. To assist race relations she helped to organize and served locally as vice president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and was a member of the national NAACP board. She also served as a member of the Virginia Interracial Commission.</p> <p><strong>Family Life</strong></p> <p>Maggie Lena Mitchell was born in Richmond, Virginia July 15, 1864. Her mother, Elizabeth Draper, was a former slave and assistant cook in the Church Hill mansion of Elizabeth Van Lew, a Civil War spy. Later, Elizabeth and her husband William Mitchell moved the family to their own home in an alley between Broad and Marshall streets where Maggie and her brother Johnnie were raised. After the untimely death of William Mitchell in 1876, Maggie's mother supported the family by working as a laundress and young Maggie helped by delivering the clean clothes.</p> <p>Maggie Mitchell was educated in Richmond's public schools. After graduation she taught grade school for three years. Her teaching career ended in 1886 when she married Armstead Walker, Jr. She then directed her energies toward caring for her family and strengthening the Independent Order of St. Luke. Life was full and prosperous for the Walkers and their sons, Russell and Melvin.</p> <p>Tragedy struck in 1915 when her husband was accidentally killed, leaving Mrs. Walker to manage a large household. Her work and investments kept the family comfortably situated. When her sons married they brought their wives to 110 1/2 East Leigh Street. A major addition to the house in 1922 enabled Mrs. Walker to provide a home for her sons and their families, her mother, and the household staff.</p> <p>Mrs. Walker's health gradually declined, and by 1928 she was using a wheelchair. Despite her physical limitations she remained actively committed to her life's work including chairman of the bank and leader of the Independent Order of St. Luke until her death on December 15,1934.</p> <p><strong>The House</strong></p> <p>The residence at 110 1/2 East Leigh Street was built in 1883. The address became a prime location in the heart of Jackson Ward, the center of Richmond's African American business and social life at the turn of the century. The Walkers purchased the house in 1904 and soon began making changes. Central heating and electricity were added, and with the addition of several bedrooms and enclosed porches, the home increased from 9 to 28 rooms. In 1928 an elevator was added in the rear of the house to provide Mrs. Walker access to the second floor.</p> <p>The Walker family owned the home until 1979, when it was purchased by the National Park Service.</p> <p>Most of the furnishings throughout the home are original family pieces. They are valuable in understanding the 1904–1934 period of her occupancy. Together the house and the furnishings help us to learn more about Maggie Walker and the world in which she lived. Her community of Jackson Ward, a National Historic Landmark District, continues to exemplify the success of African American entrepreneurship.</p>",

He was born in 1863 at Laburnum in neighboring Henrico County and he attended the public schools of Richmond, graduating from Richmond Colored Normal in 1881.<br /> <br /> After a short stint in teaching, Mitchell would embark upon a career in journalism that would span nearly fifty years. He is perhaps best remembered for being the fiery, fearless editor and publisher of the Richmond Planet newspaper from 1884 until 1929. Mitchell used his pen as a sword to fight injustices locally and statewide. He also tirelessly fought for a federal anti-lynching bill. Mitchell served for a time as president of the Afro-American Press Association. As the founder and president of the Mechanics Savings Bank, he was for a number of years the lone African American member of the American Bankers Association.<br /> <br /> Mitchell was also very active in politics. He served on Richmond’s City Council from 1888 until 1896 and he even ran for governor in 1921 on the Lily Black ticket which included pioneering banker, Mrs. Maggie L.

    "bodyText": "<p>Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site in Richmond, Virginia, commemorates the life of Maggie L. Walker, a progressive and talented African American woman. Maggie Lena Walker was born in Richmond on July 15, 1864, during the final year of the American Civil War and became a strong leader in her community. Despite facing many adversities in post-Civil War Richmond, Walker achieved national acclaim as the leader of a fraternal organization and a member of countless national organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She became a national activist for economic independence, educational opportunities, and civil rights, particularly on behalf of women and children in the African American community.<br /> <br /> Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site encompasses Walker’s home at 110½ East Leigh Street within Richmond’s Jackson Ward National Historic Landmark District, once one of the most prosperous African American communities in the United States. The historic Jackson Ward is known as the birthplace of African-American entrepreneurship (“The Cradle of Black Capitalism”) and is one of the largest (42 city blocks) national historic landmark districts associated with African American history and culture in the United States. The park manages and administers six structures along roughly one-quarter of a city block at Second and East Leigh Streets in Richmond. The Italianate-style Maggie L. Walker House, Walker’s home of 30 years, has been restored to its 1930s appearance on the exterior and interior and is fully furnished with Walker’s original pieces. The other five structures within the park have been rehabilitated and adaptively reused for various purposes, including the park’s visitor center, museum exhibits and gallery, curatorial storage, and administrative offices.</p>",

    "bodyText": "The three-story building directly in front of us to the left formerly housed the Richmond Beneficial Insurance Company. Richmond Beneficial was organized in 1894 by a founding president, Reverend Wesley F. Graham and others. Graham, who was 5 pastor of the Fifth Street Baptist Church, would also found the American Beneficial Insurance Company in 1902. This building [which] would serve as headquarters for Richmond Beneficial opened to the public in June of 1912.<br /> <br /> As was customary for the time, this was a multi-purpose building. At the time of its opening it housed, in addition to the insurance company, the Capital Shoe Company and meeting rooms for rental to fraternal and social organizations. The Richmond Beneficial building had the distinction of being designed and constructed by African Americans. It was designed by professor Charles T. Russell, a native of Jackson Ward and one of the earliest licensed African American architects in Virginia. Russell received his training in the building arts at Hampton Institute and received further training at Tuskegee. He will design and oversee the major renovations of several notable African American businesses, residences, and churches. Professor Russell was also the founding president of the National Builders Association. The construction of this building was done by the African American firm of Moore and Archer. Henry J. Moore, of the firm, apprenticed under Joseph Farrar, the father of contractor Daniel J. Farrar. Moore also served on City Council during the 1890s. This insurance company no longer exists.<br /> <br /> The small building next to the Richmond Beneficial building formerly housed the Second Street Savings Bank. The Second Street Savings Bank was chartered in 1920 making it the sixth bank to be chartered by African Americans in Richmond. Its founding president was John T. Taylor and the bank was closely aligned with the Richmond Beneficial Insurance Company next door. The Second Street Savings Bank was also designed by noted African American architect, professor Charles T. Russell and it was constructed by African American contractor Daniel J. Farrar.<br /> <br /> Due to a dwindling pool of depositors and an economic downturn, the shareholders of the Second Street Savings Bank and Maggie Walker’s St. Luke Bank and Trust met in December of 1929 and voted to merge the two banks. The new bank opened for business in January of 1930 as the Consolidated Bank and Trust. The Commercial Bank and Trust would merge with Consolidated Bank and Trust approximately one year later to complete the merger of the three African American banks. For decades, Consolidated Bank and Trust was the oldest, continuously run African American-owned bank in America.",

    "bodyText": "<h4>Beginnings</h4> <br /> St. Luke Hall served as the primary headquarters for the Independent Order of St. Luke, a fraternal society operating as a mutual aid and insurance organization in Richmond, Virginia. The building was first built in 1903 next to the then-headquarters for the Independent Order of St. Luke on the corner of St. James and Baker streets in the Jackson Ward neighborhood. Initially St. Luke Hall was a three-story Edwardian style building designed by John H. White and the old headquarters building was demolished by make room for future additions. <br /> <br /> Throughout its history, the St. Luke building grew as the Independent Order of St. Luke expands its operations throughout the early 1900's. In the late 1910's, Charles T. Russell, a Tuskegee educated architect and the first licensed black architect in Richmond designed two of the main changes to St. Luke Hall. On the southern side of the building he added another bay to provide more space and a new main entrance to the building. He would also design a new fourth floor with an elevator to provide enhanced access to all the floors of the building.  <h4>Uses of the St. Luke Hall</h4> The main use for St. Luke Hall was as the main headquarters for the Independent Order of St. Luke. Most of the organizations workers, such as stenographers and bookkeepers, worked in St. Luke Hall helping to grow the organization. Many of the leadership of the Independent Order, such as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/maggie-l-walker.htm?utm_source=person&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=experience_more\">Maggie L. Walker</a>, the leader of the organization, worked out of St. Luke Hall. Many of the councils of the Independent Order of St. Luke, as well as other organizations, such as the Richmond Urban League, used the meeting spaces in the St. Luke Hall.<br /> <br /> St. Luke Hall also housed many of the other activities and business operations for the organization as well. One of the most notable but shortest business operations inside St. Luke Hall occurred in November 1903 when Maggie L. Walker and the Independent Order of St. Luke opened the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/st-luke-penny-savings-bank.htm\">St. Luke Penny Savings Bank</a>. On the banks first day of operation, 280 different people and organizations deposited over $8,000. The bank operated in St. Luke Hall gaining more deposits, achieving enough success that the bank moved out of the building beginning in 1905.  <br /> <br /> Another of the major business operation in St. Luke Hall was the publishing of the organization's newspaper, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/st-luke-herald.htm\">the St. Luke Herald</a>. In a 1901 speech, Maggie L. Walker called for the creation of a newspaper for the Independent Order of St. Luke, to be used to spread the St. Luke mission across the country. The first issue of the weekly St. Luke Herald was distributed on March 29, 1902 and continued out of the basement of St. Luke Hall for several decades, at one point being the most widely circulated black newspaper in Richmond. The printing presses in St. Luke Hall were used by various organizations and businesses in Richmond raising revenue for the Independent Order of St. Luke and making St. Luke Hall more of a business center for the residents of Jackson Ward. <h4>Today</h4> While the Independent Order of St. Luke closed out its operations in the 1980's, St. Luke Hall still stands in the same location where Maggie L. Walker worked to spread the influence of the organization. Today, St. Luke Hall is a privately-owned building that features both residential and commercial space.  <br />   <h4> </h4> <h4> </h4>",

    "bodyText": "<p>This Italianate style home on Leigh Street in the historic Jackson Ward community became well known as the longest and last home of the pioneering bank president, civil rights and women's rights leader, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/maggie-l-walker.htm?utm_source=person&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=experience_more\">Maggie L. Walker</a>. Today the home is a National Historic Landmark and is part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mawa/index.htm\">Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site</a>.  </p> <p><strong>Architecture</strong></p> The home was built in 1883 by architect George Boyd, a formerly enslaved man from Goochland, VA. His inspiration was the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/italianate-style-architecture.htm\">Italianate style of architecture</a> that lasted in the United States from the mid 1800s to the 1890's, inspired by the style of Italian villas. One of the main features of the Italianate style that can be seen on the Maggie L. Walker home is the low angled roof and highly decorated overhanging eaves. The eaves are also supplemented with decorated brackets called corbels supporting the weight of the eaves. Another one of the features indicating the Italianate influence is the tall narrow windows on the front of the house. The Italianate style heavily accentuated vertical structures and also utilized window sashes, which can also be seen on the Walker house. The porch of the house is also a common piece of Italianate style buildings in the United States and the columns, both locate outside and inside the home, evoke the memory of the Italian Renaissance. The interiors of the Italianate style were less defined than the exteriors, however there were some notable ideas present in the Walker home. One of them is that most of the rooms will have multiple entrances and exits, and this is very evident in the Walker home with most rooms having three doorways, even the bedrooms, which all connect to each other and to the hallway. <h4>Before the Walker Family</h4> While the most famous family that resided in this house would be Mrs. Walker and her family, she was not the originally owner of the home. Originally built in 1883, the home's original owner would be Doctor James Ferguson and his family. When the Ferguson family moves into the home, it would only be a two floor, five room house. This isn't as much information known about the family in the home as there would be for the second family to live in this home, the Jones.<br /> <br /> Doctor Robert E Jones and his family would be the second owners of 110 ½ E. Leigh Street and would own the home until 1904 when Maggie L. Walker buys the home. During their time in the home in the 1890's, they would make several major structural changes to the home, which would then be inherited by the Walker family when they move in.<br /> <br /> One of the largest changes the Jones family makes to the home is adding several upstairs bedrooms to the home. When they first move into the home, there would only be two upstairs rooms, but they grow the house by extending the hallway and adding five more rooms on the second floor.<br /> <br /> They also add a key feature to the house today, the kitchen. Previous to their upgrade, the kitchen was not attached to the house, but they added it onto the first floor at the rear of the house, making cooking easier, especially since the kitchen and dining room were now connected to each other.<br /> <br /> The third major addition added to the home by the Jones was the west wing on the first floor that Dr. Jones used as a waiting room and examination room for his patients. This change would give the home one of its more unique features which are two front doors, which still exists to this day. The Jones family would eventually sell the home to Maggie L. Walker in 1904. <h4><strong>Walker Family Moves In</strong></h4> While Maggie L. Walker buys 110 ½ in 1904, she and her family delay their move for another year as they makes two upgrades to the home. One of the upgrades Maggie L. Walker makes to the home before moving in is the installation of electricity throughout the home. Before the electricity is installed, the lighting in the house was all gas-powered and instead of replacing all the light features, they were retrofit to be electric powered keeping the old gas aesthetic with the functionality of electricity. The other major upgrade Mrs. Walker would add to the house was a central heating system using a furnace in the basement of the home, replacing the need for fireplaces to heat the home. The fireplaces would still be used by the family for relaxing evenings in together.  <br /> <br /> When the upgrades finished the Walker family would move into the house at 110½ E. Leigh Street. There are originally six members of the family that move into the house together. Maggie L. Walker and her husband Armstead, their two sons, Russell E.T. Walker and Melvin DeWitt Walker, their foster daughter, Margaret \"Polly\" Anderson, and Mrs. Walker's mother, Elizabeth Mitchell.<br /> <br /> Throughout the 1900s and 1910s, the Walker family continued to change the house adding furnishings and making more minor changes, such as adding a pressed tin ceiling in the dining room. The family also changed through this time as well, growing in number as both sons would marry, with Russell marrying Harriet \"Hattie\" Naomi Frazier in 1912 and Russell would marry Ethel B. Robinson in 1919. Polly would also marry a man named Maurice Payne and all three of the married couples would continue to reside in the home with Mrs. Walker and her husband Armstead, and her mother Elizabeth. The Walker family would continue to grow as as both Russell and Melvin each have a daughter and son before 1920 and Melvin would have two more daughters in the early 1920s to bring a total of four grandchildren into the home by 1924.<br /> <br /> As the Walker family grew in numbers, so did the house, as Mrs. Walker decided through the 1920s to add rooms onto the house to suit a larger family. One of the main additions added to the home would be when the side porch on the west side is transformed into an interior room. This new interior room would be known by Mrs. Walker's grandchildren as Melvin's Den, as Melvin Walker would use this room to host his friends and guests for games of poker or relaxing music nights using an electric victrola located in the room.  <br /> <br /> The larger of the additions that would take place at the Walker home during the 1920s would be a large addition of many rooms on the back-side of the home on both the second and ground floor. Added to the rear of the house, these rooms on the bottom floor would serve a variety of purposes for the family, such as a room with three sinks and a stove to do laundry, a bathroom, which the first floor lacked before the addition, and also a bedroom use by Polly and Maurice. The second floor of the addition added several rooms used mostly by Melvin's side of the family, including a bedroom for Melvin and Ethel, their two daughters, Mamie Evelyn and Elizabeth, and a sleeping porch used by their son, Armstead.<br /> <br /> One of the last major changes to the structure of the home would be added in 1928 when an elevator is added onto the rear most room of the house. Earlier in her life, Mrs. Walker was diagnosed with diabetes and it will take a toll on her life. By the beginning of 1928, she experiences weakness in her legs that makes walking difficult. She first adopts a set of leg braces, and while they were cumbersome, they helped to stave of the coming paralysis. Mrs. Walker took action as her condition developed and employed Charles T. Russell to design the elevator, as he had also designed her additions and also several of the buildings for the Independent Order of St. Luke. Finally finished between March 17th and March 24th, 1928. <h4>The House After Maggie L. Walker</h4> Maggie L. Walker continued to live in 110½ E. Leigh Street with her family until she passed away December 15th, 1934. Initially, the home would come under the ownership of Melvin Walker, Mrs. Walker's only surviving son. Melvin only owned the house for less than a year as he passes away in 1935. Shortly after this happens, Hattie NF Walker, Russell's widow, would gain ownership of the home and continued to live there with her daughter, Maggie Laura Walker and Polly. Hattie would follow in Mrs. Walker's footsteps by becoming the Right Worthy Grand Secretary for the Independent Order of St. Luke in 1937. When Hattie Walker becomes owner of the home, she makes it her mission to keep the house as Mrs. Walker wanted it, so she keeps many of the furniture and objects Mrs. Walker collected during his time in the home. She thought that the best way to keep Mrs. Walker's memory alive is to keep the house as she intended. For more than 30 years Hattie Walker preserved the home with the dream of turning it into a museum to honor the legacy of her mother-in-law, Maggie L. Walker. While Hattie Walker would pass away in 1974, her dream of turning the home into a museum was realized through her daughter, Maggie Laura Walker, when she sold it to the National Park Service in 1979 where it is still preserved as part of the Maggie L. Walker National Historic Site.",
    "audioDescription": "The Maggie L. Walker Historic Home is a two-story red brick building located on Leigh St. in Jackson Ward. The front porch is raised off street level and is surrounded by Greek style columns with a tiled floor. It is covered by a green and white awning and has two entrances, a main double-door entrance and a smaller side entrance once used as an office entrance. The front of the house on the second floor is an enclosed sunporch overlooking Leigh Street. The home and garage combined take up nearly all of the available space in the lot so very little room lies between the home and the buildings next door. There are 28 rooms inside the home, consisting of several bedrooms, a kitchen, dining room, library, den, laundry room and parlor.

    "bodyText": "The W.W. Brown home is the fourth house from the corner of Price and Jackson Streets. This Federal-styled brick home, with beige trim, is located at 105 West Jackson Street at the intersection of Chamberlayne Parkway and Jackson Street. Built in the 1840s, this is the former home of Reverend William Washington Brown. Brown was born in 1849 in Habersham County, Georgia and escaped from slavery as a boy and traveled throughout the South. He later joined the Union Army and attained an education.<br /> <br /> He was summoned to Richmond around 1881 by members of the temperance organization, the True Reformers, and subsequently transformed the True Reformers into one of the largest African American fraternal and business enterprises in America. The 7 True Reformers made African American business history when, in March of 1888, they received a charter from the state of Virginia to open the Savings Bank of the Grand Fountain of the United Order of True Reformers. Thus, the True Reformers bank became the first chartered by African Americans in America. The bank opened for business on April 3, 1889 in Brown’s home, here at 105 West. Jackson Street. The symbolic date of April 3 was chosen because it was the anniversary month and date of the arrival of Union troops in Richmond after the fall of the city at the end of the Civil War. It should be noted that the former Capital Savings Bank of Washington, D.C. received its charter in October of 1888 and opened shortly thereafter and prior to the opening of the True Reformers bank. However, the True Reformers bank retained the distinction of having been the first African American-owned bank chartered in America. The bank was later housed in the True Reformers Hall in the 600-block of North Second Street. The bank collapsed in 1910.",

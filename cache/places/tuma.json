At that time, the village was located on the other side of the Santa Cruz River. Although he chose Guevavi to be the <em>cabecera </em>(headquarters) where the priest would live, he and other priests continued to visit Tumacácori￼, sing the Mass, and tend to mission business. There is no record of an adobe church having been built while the village was on the east side of the river.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff2d1174-089a-4e83-b380-b7a346cec46d}{142}\" paraid=\"1803006028\">In November of 1751, a group of O'odham led by Captain General Luis Oacpicagigua (“Ahk-pee-ah-CUK-ya”) rebelled against the Spanish and Yoeme who had moved into their land.

    "audioDescription": "Rising from an open area east of the church and north of the convento fragment this structure appears as a low, rounded, smooth, plaster-covered wall about 2 feet thick and about 1 foot tall. It appears as a rectangular, plastered, stone outline about 50 feet long and about 15 feet wide protruding from the otherwise flat soil and sparse vegetation of the park grounds. There is an opening in the eastern width of the foundation outline about 5 feet wide, indicating where the main doorway once was. The sight of the Jesuit church footprint from the eastern side is dominated by the background view of the imposing and contrastingly preserved structure of the more recent Franciscan church. With its bell tower on the left and sacristy dome on the right, it overshadows the simple, low rectangular outline in front of you.",

They established it as a mission, naming it San Gabriel de Guevavi. Subsequent missionaries called it San Rafael and San Miguel, resulting in the common historical name of Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi.</p> <p>In 1701, Guevavi was established as a district headquarters and <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/juan-de-san-martin.htm\">Juan de San Martin</a> was assigned as the first resident priest.

The first <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/franciscan-missionaries.htm\">Franciscan</a> priest, <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/juan-crisostomo-gil-de-bernabe.htm\">Juan Crisóstomo Gil de Bernabé</a>, arrived in 1768 and began the mission with about fifty families. Unfortunately the Apaches attacked in 1769 and killed all but two of the few Spanish soldiers guarding the mission. In 1770 and 1771, the Apaches continued their attacks and the cabecera was moved to <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/tuma/historyculture/tumacacori.htm\">Tumacácori</a>. Antonio de los Reyes, Bishop of Sonora, on 6 July 1772 wrote a report on the condition of the missions in the Upper and Lower Pimeria Alta.</p> <p><em>\"The village of Guevavi is situated on a open and fertile plain beside an arroyo with good land where the Indians cultivate their individual fields of wheat, Indian corn, other crops, and one small community farm. The church on the inside is adorned with two altars and a small side chapel with paintings in gilded frames. In the sacristy are three chalices, two dishes with cruets, one pyx, a ciborium, a censer, and a baptismal shell - all silver - vestments of every kind and color and other ornaments for the altar and divine services. According to the census book, which I have here before me, there are nineteen married couples, five widowers, seven widows, twelve orphans, the number of should in all eighty-six.\" - translated by Kieran McCarty</em><br /> <br /> Guevavi was abandoned for the last time in 1775. After sitting abandoned since the 1770s, Guevavi's ruins were added to Tumacácori National Historical Park in 1990. The late Ralph Wingfield, a local rancher, donated the ruins to the <a href=\"http://www.americanarchaeology.org/\">Archaeological Conservancy</a> which, in turn, donated it to the National Park Service.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The site is sprawling, including large open landscapes of mesquite and creosote brush in desert upland. A large rock outcrop offers an overhead view of the river bed, usually dry and sandy, with gently sloping banks on either side. Across the road, mountains are visible. The mission site itself is a barely perceptible square outline of low, raised berms of earth, with the adobe remnants of the church oriented north-south along the western edge. The adobe walls run parallel to each other, about 5 feet high except where they slope down to the ground on the south side. On the northwest end, the adobe wall rises to about 10 feet in height. The walls are uneven, coated with a mud plaster on the top, with exposed adobe bricks along their faces.",

    "audioDescription": "In front of you is a rectangular, nearly square shaped building about 12 feet in width, 10 feet in depth and 6 feet tall. Made from daubed mud, the outside wall surface of the building is the brown-grey color of the surrounding earth, and is roughly textured. The roof is constructed of support beams made from mesquite branches about 5 inches in diameter. These can be seen protruding at the top of the mud walls at the roof line. The roof also contains sticks of ocotillo, a common desert shrub with long, straight, thorned branches about 1/2 inch to 1 inch thick and up to 12 feet long. The ocotillo sticks are laid side by side and sealed together by mud, forming the roof and creating an almost flat, somewhat wavy roof shape which hangs a few inches over the perimeter of the building on each side. There are no windows, but there is a doorless entrance about 2 feet wide and 5 feet high located slightly right of center as you look at the front of the building. An open-air, flat-roofed portico stands a few feet in front of the mud house. Its structure is comprised of mesquite branches overlaid with ocotillo branches. The ramada roof is supported by 9 rustic mesquite branches stripped of bark and about 3 to 5 inches in diameter. These are evenly spaced, creating a covered walkway leading to the entrance of the of the ki and providing shade to a broad area in front of it. On the ground below are four grinding stones. Inside the dwelling is a concrete floor with a thick layer of dirt over the top. It is dark except for the rectangle of light from the small entrance. The mesquite branches and ocotillo sticks that provide the building's structure are visible, and the mud walls appear similar to the outside walls.",

    "audioDescription": "The storeroom building is a roughly rectangular, roofless adobe structure located slightly northeast of the Franciscan church. Approaching the structure from the outside, it appears as a simple brown, plastered adobe structure with wavy, jagged walls of uneven heights. The front wall disappears to the right into a mound of grass-covered ground. Visible through the doorway is a steep plaster-coated staircase. Some light shines down into the open, roofless structure. As you enter the storeroom, the wide bank of 8 very steep stairs faces the doorway and rises all the way to the top of the wall. A nearby sign asks visitors to refrain from walking on the stairs. Attached to the stairs on both the left and right, sits a tall, rectangular, chest-high, plaster-covered adobe structure that appears much like an ancient counter or shelf. To the right, on the eastern side of the room, the wall is formed into a low adobe bench running the length of this side, with circular indentations on the top of the bench, many holding large, red clay pots. High above the pots near the top of this wall, a circular dark, wooden beam stretches the length of the wall resting on two square adobe pillars that are part of the wall structure. Perpendicular to this beam another beam emerges from the adobe wall stretching across the width of the structure. Another identical beam structure on the other side of the doorway is visible, although there are no pots on the other side of the room. High on the east and west walls, multiple holes are visible in a horizontal line, suggesting where other wooden beams may have previously pierced the adobe walls. On the north and south walls, the main notable features are another chest-high counter or shelf-like adobe square column which sits under a circular indentation or opening in the wall.",

La tranquilidad de estos espacios naturales unió a las comunidades españolas e indígenas para saborear valores culturales comunes: belleza y utilidad.<br /> <br /> El jardín del patio en Tumacácori fue construido en 1939 como parte de la construcción de la era “New Deal” del centro de visitantes. Su diseño, al igual que el del centro de visitantes, fue inspirado por otras misiones de la Pimería Alta. Participaron varias agencias, pero los diseños originales fueron realizados por dieciséis jóvenes que trabajaban por el Civilian Conservation Core (CCC). Se dejaron tres árboles de mezquite nativos en su lugar, los cuales continúan creciendo en el jardín. El olivo (Olea europaea), el granado ornamental (Punica granatum) y el árbol casto (Vitex agnus-castus) sobreviven hasta hoy. Cuando se tuvo que quitar el albaricoque (Prunus armeniaca) original, una semilla de ese árbol proporcionó su reemplazo.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Upon entering the courtyard garden, visitors are reminded of a Spanish colonial courtyard garden refuge. Vine-covered garden walls formed by the surrounding buildings enclose the central space which is often full of color with the bright greens of the plants’ foliage and a variety of flower colors. In the center of the garden is a fountain pool with turquoise-colored plaster/cement interior bordered by an octagonal pool wall with a brick bench-top. The fountain is filled with water and features a cream-colored fountain-head scalloped basin held up by a graceful pedestal. Circling the central fountain and various planting beds are garden paths made of brick pavers laid in a herringbone design. One of these paths also leads to the restrooms. The garden plants exhibit a wide and beautiful diversity of form, shape and size, and include a number of trees that provide shade to visitors. The plants displayed include both some local desert species with characteristic spiny or succulent leaves, as well as European species. Plant markers note the genus, species and common names of plants. Low adobe-style benches on the north and south sides of the fountain offer multiple places to sit. Warm yellow painted arches of the main park building’s stuccoed walls are also visible.",

Todos los aspectos de la vida diaria estarían sujetos a transformación—comida, idioma, ropa, agricultura y religión. En el modelo de la misión se pueden ver viviendas y talleres de adobe, terrenos agrícolas, ganado y la acequia principal. Una comunidad misionera podría ser considerada como una academia de entrenamiento residencial donde los indígenas aprendieron y adoptaron una nueva forma de vida. El plan era que el sacerdote misionero siguiera adelante después de diez años, cuando la comunidad pudiera sostenerse. De hecho, pasarían más de 100 años antes del siglo XIX, cuando se colocaron los primeros ladrillos para la iglesia misionera que ves hoy.<br /> <br /> En solo unas décadas, Tumacácori paso de ser un pueblo O’odham a una visita fronteriza y luego una cabecera. Su gente también cambió. Los O’odham pasaron a ser conocidos como los “Pima” y los “Papago”, y sus tierras la Pimería Alta. Fueron bautizados con nombres españoles, se les dio ropa de estilo español, y se les asignaron trabajos españoles. Cuidaban ganado doméstico en lugar de cazar animales silvestres y regaban árboles frutales que fueron transportados a través del océano. <br /> <br /> Hoy, la gente O’odham todavía lleva el legado de la colonización. Debido a que ellos no grabaron sus historias en un idioma escrito, explorar su historia requiere empatía, inferencia y respeto por la tradición oral de los O’odham. Los descendientes de las comunidades de la misión todavía viven a nuestro alrededor.</p>",

Further northeast of the church courtyard area, the model displays miniature renditions of the acequia or irrigation canals, and the orchard. This mission model display is the centerpiece of the room you are standing in and offers a small-scale view of what the grounds may once have looked like. This view contrasts with the scene of the actual Tumacácori church and grounds visible through large open, arched windows of this room.

La gente caminaba desde aquí para asistir a los servicios de la iglesia, trabajar en el convento o ir a los campos, jardines y huertas entre la plaza y el río.<br /> <br /> La lomita larga y baja a la izquierda del sendero protege lo que queda de las viviendas de adobe. Las viviendas estaban conectadas en una línea que corre de norte a sur. La ramada a la derecha se parece a una cocina al aire libre de una familia de la misión. Tome un momento para imaginar cómo era antes la comunidad de la misión: los sonidos de animales, niños corriendo y jugando en la plaza, bueyes y carretas yendo y viniendo. Aquí hay un pueblo en acción.<br /> <br /> En la plaza se podían escuchar muchos idiomas diferentes. Algunos sacerdotes procedían de España, pero otros de Austria, Suiza, Italia o Baviera. Los O’odham tenían muchos dialectos. Los Yoeme, ahora conocidos como los Yaqui, hablaban un idioma totalmente diferente. Los Nde, ahora conocidos como Apache, compartían raíces lingüísticas con los Navajo.<br /> <br /> La proximidad de los vecinos en el núcleo de la misión contrasta a los pueblos tradicionales O’odham. Allí, hogares familiares generalmente pueden agruparse, pero no comparten paredes, espacios cerrados, ni otras instalaciones. La densidad de la comunidad misionera probablemente contribuyó a la propagación de enfermedades europeas como el sarampión, la viruela y el tifus.</p>",

Más tarde, los misioneros y exploradores dependerían de estas redes existentes para colonizar el área.<br /> <br /> En 1775, una expedición de aproximadamente 240 personas y casi mil vacas y caballos siguieron este río durante la primera parte de su viaje a establecer el primer asentamiento europeo en la bahía de San Francisco. El Sendero Histórico Nacional Juan Bautista de Anza fue designado para conmemorar este movimiento masivo e importante de colonos a través de esta región.<br /> <br /> Hoy día, el Sendero Anza conserva esta historia importante y al mismo tiempo proporciona un espacio valioso para recrear al aire libre.

Cuando se acercaba la temporada de las lluvias, las familias se mudaban a lugares donde canales poco profundos podrían dirigir el agua a sus campos. Los O’odham que vivían cerca de un río redirigían el agua del río directamente hacia los campos de maíz, frijoles, calabazas, agave y melones.<br /> <br /> Con los españoles llegaron las ideas europeas de irrigación. La estructura de ladrillos de adobe al frente de ti es parte de la acequia madre. Este canal principal traía agua del río Santa Cruz, aproximadamente una milla al sur, hacia la misión. El lado más angosto podría cerrarse, elevando el nivel del agua para satisfacer varias funciones. Como compuerta, dirigía el agua hacia la huerta al este. Como tanque de agua, era conveniente para llenar ollas de barro y llevar agua a las casas para beber y cocinar. Debido a que tenía una superficie roja pulida, probablemente también se usó como lavandería, o lugar para lavar ropa y platos, e incluso posiblemente para bañarse.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The visible remnant of the acequia or irrigation ditch appears as a roughly rectangular depression in the earth about 10 feet long, 4 feet wide and 2 feet deep. Looking down into the structure, the fired adobe brick walls appear like crumbling, grey, retaining walls that would have once held water in a rectangular pool. The east and west long sides of the rectangular acequia are made of about 6 courses of adobe brick rising at a 90 degree angle from the dusty, dirt floor. The shorter north and south ends are comprised of soil and slope up gradually to meet the surrounding surface of the ground. On the north end of the structure, the sloped opening to the surrounding surface of the ground is a narrow funnel created by a short, diagonally curved brick dam extending from the adjacent east side partially across the width of the structure, leaving a narrow, upwardly sloping, rocky soil-covered opening to the surrounding ground. Where the edge of the acequia meets the surrounding ground, a row of reddish brown bricks forms a flat surface flush with the ground and the wall of the structure. Some of these edging pavers are covered with a protective plaster coating. A faint remnant of the historic ditch’s patch remains visible on either side of the rectangular structure. A trail follows its route downstream.",

Esta diversa comunidad de plantas sostiene a una gran biodiversidad de insectos, aves y mamíferos. Hoy, el bosque de mezquite de Tumacácori protege especies en peligro como el Cuclillo Pico Amarillo (Coccyzus americanus) y otras especies poco comunes. El bosque le proporcionó a los O’odham, y más tarde a los españoles, con leña, medicinas, y comida. <br /> <br /> Las flores de mezquite dan polen y néctar para fauna en la región. Las flores están agrupadas en espigas largas llamadas amentos. Cuando se fertilizan, las flores forman vainas verdes largas como de frijol. Crecen y maduran durante el verano, cambiando a color moreno claro con rayas rojas. Las vainas se pueden comer en todas las etapas de su crecimiento.  <br /> <br /> Los O’odham las comían como verdura cuando estaban verdes, y las vainas maduras las molían para obtener una harina dulce con sabor a nuez. La semilla es preferida por muchos animales, incluyendo las liebres, ratones, rata-canguro, rata montera y los jabalís.<br /> <br /> Dos especies de mezquite se encuentran en esta región, mezquite miel (Prosopis glandulosa) y mezquite terciopelo (Prosopis velutina). El mesquite terciopelo domina el paisaje de Tumacácori. Algunos teorizan que la introducción española de ganado aceleró la expansión de los bosques de mezquite en la Pimería Alta.</p>",

Tierra y agua se mezclan hasta formar una pasta espesa de barro. El barro se echa a formas rectangulares de madera hasta llenar bien el molde y luego se deja secar al sol. Este estilo eficiente que utiliza la tecnología de construcción con tierra se ha utilizado a través de miles de años, pero requiere mantenimiento constante. La humedad, ya sea del suelo o precipitación, deteriora los ladrillos de adobe, rendiendo la estructura inestable.<br /> <br /> Los españoles favorecían la aplicación de yeso de cal como capa protectora en sus edificios de adobe. Se recolectaron muchas toneladas de piedra caliza y se trasladaron a los hornos de cal (caleras) de la misión. Se encendía un fuego debajo de una parrilla de metal y las altas temperaturas “cocían” la piedra caliza durante varios días hasta que se podía machucar en un polvo fino. Luego, ese polvo se mezclaba con agua y arena para hacer una pasta que se podía aplicar en capas sobre las paredes de adobe.<br /> <br /> Recolección de piedra, mezclar yeso, y revestir las grandes estructuras requería el trabajo de muchos trabajadores. Para los O’odham, la calera probablemente representó un cambio significante en su estilo de vida. Anteriormente, vivían en un paisaje variable, en edificios que cambiaban con él. La visión del mundo europea priorizaba la permanencia y el desafío al desgaste y la erosión natural. Este cambio influiría como la gente de la región vivía y pensaba durante los siglos por venir.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The lime kiln is a circular, below-ground well-like structure about 6 feet in diameter. The walls of the lime kiln extend about 1 foot above the ground and are covered on the top and exterior by a brownish-cream colored plaster coating. The rounded flat surface of the wall is about a foot wide. As you look down into the underground interior of the lime kiln, the walls appear to be made of dried, brown, adobe brick with a layer of red colored bricks at the bottom about 5 feet down. The floor of lime kiln is sandy gravel. Back above ground, a hexagonal, brown, metal fence with horizonal rails surrounds the entire circular kiln structure protecting it from climbing or entry.",

Aunque el campanario parece estar en ruinas, ha cambiado poco desde que se fueron los últimos residentes en 1848.

The top wall of the tower has a jagged and unfinished look, although the roman arch of the belfry remains. A metal bell hangs by a rope from a weather-worn beam under the arch of the open belfry. Open sky shows through as a background to the bell in the rectangular arched opening of the belfry. To each side of the central, open belfry opening is a rectangular statue niche with a cracked, beige plaster shell motif inlaid at the arched top of each niche.

Los difuntos estaban bien vestidos al ser enterrados. Frecuentemente se incluían algunos artículos personales en la tumba, la cual se cubría con rocas. Los O’odham a veces quemaban artículos que habían pertenecido a la persona que falleció y le pedían al difunto que estuviera en paz y no volviera a molestar a los vivos. Hoy en día, continúa una mezcla de creencias y ceremonias tradicionales y católicas entre los O’odham.<br /> <br /> Los catorce nichos en las paredes que rodean el cementerio hubieran ocupado pinturas o esculturas católicas de las “Estaciones de la Cruz”. En el centro se encuentra la capilla mortuoria. El plan quizá era de cubrir el edificio circular con una cúpula. Una familia podía pasar tiempo con el ser querido que falleció en este cuarto antes del entierro. <br /> <br /> Aunque existen registros de los entierros de Tumacácori de 1755 hasta 1825, el primer entierro en este cementerio ocurrió en 1822. El primer cementerio estaba junto a la iglesia de la época de los jesuitas. Muchos de los que fallecieron fueron víctimas de las terribles epidemias de viruela, sarampión y tifus que arrasaron por las misiones. Algunos murieron durante los ataques de los Apaches. La mayoría de los entierros de Tumacácori fueron niños menores de cinco años.<br /> <br /> Aunque los registros describen casi 600 entierros en Tumacácori, cualquier evidencia de tumbas de la era de la misión fueron destruidas por el clima, ganado y vándalos. Familias que se mudaron a esta área después de que los residentes O’odham se fueron continuaron usando este cementerio para enterrar a sus difuntos. La pequeña Juanita Alegría, quien murió de influenza a los nueve meses en 1916, fue la última persona enterrada en Tumacácori.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "An expansive square-shaped outdoor area surrounded by an adobe wall opens before you. About 75 feet in length on each side, this thick adobe wall encloses the large space and gives an appearance of a park-like area. About 8 feet tall and 2 feet thick, the cemetery walls have a smooth, brownish-beige plaster coating. The wall is a few feet higher on the northeast portion of the wall and it is also punctuated by visible bullet holes in this section. The top of the wall is covered by a protective layer of brick and plaster that overhangs the wall slightly. Spaced at about every twenty feet near the top of the wall are 14 hollowed, arched niches. In the west Cemetery wall, the eye is drawn to a brown, painted wooden door, covered by a triangular brick transom that leads to the church grounds on the northwest side of the church. Mountains rise in the distance behind the west wall. The center of the cemetery is mostly an open space with gravelly soil and very sparse, grassy vegetation. Three gracefully branched mesquite trees sit in the central part of the space and one occupies the northeast corner providing some shade in these areas. Wooden crosses marking graves in the northern part of cemetery provide a background to a larger, beige plastered grave monument shaped like a small coffin, topped on one end by a painted wrought iron cross decorated with a metal monument name plate and flowers. The name plate displays the name Juanita Alegria, born in 1915 and laid to rest in 1916. The mortuary chapel is a roofless, circular building about 16 feet in diameter and 15 feet high standing near the entrance to the Cemetery. The outer walls of the building appear to have small, decorative pieces of fired red brick stuck into the adobe walls. The upper portion of the wall has a plaster covering over this pebbled adobe. About a foot below the top of the building, a row of horizontally laid, fired and burnished red bricks create a decorative line around the building, and above this row of bricks at the top of the building is a cornice made of curved, fired and burnished bricks laid vertically in a decorative pattern. Outside of the south side of the mortuary wall, a colonial-style wooden cross with the name Soto etched on it sits atop one end of a grave-shaped mound of stones. Around the curve of the building to the west, the mortuary building is open to visitors via an arched doorway about 4 feet wide facing the western cemetery gate. Entering through this doorway reveals the 3 foot thickness of the mortuary walls. Inside, the circular, roofless view above opens to the sky and is framed by the decorative brick cornice design at the top of the building. Below, gravelly soil over concrete comprises the floor. The mortuary walls, like other adobe brick structures at Tumacácori, reveal a view of both grey adobe bricks, and a patchy combination of various brownish-colored plaster coatings, many etched with cracks. Near the top of the wall, about 5 feet from each side of the door, are circular openings to the outside that are about 4 inches in diameter and give the appearance of small tunnels in the thick walls.",

En ese momento, el pueblo estaba ubicado al otro lado del río Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Aunque eligió a Guevavi como la cabecera donde viviría el sacerdote, él y otros sacerdotes continuaron visitando a Tumacácori, cantando la misa y atendiendo los asuntos misioneros. No hay registro de que se haya construido una iglesia de adobe cuando el pueblo estaba en el lado este del río.<br /> <br /> En noviembre de 1751, un grupo de O’odham organizados por el capitán general Luis Oacpicagigua (“Ahk-pee-ah-CUK-ya”) se rebelaron contra los españoles y los Yoeme que se habían mudado a sus tierras. El conflicto resulto en el abandono de las comunidades misioneras durante más de un año.<br /> <br /> Los españoles comenzaron a construir un presidio, un puesto militar, en Tubac. Cuando todos regresaron, el pueblo de Tumacácori se trasladó a esta ubicación, la cual estaba más cerca y en el mismo lado del río que el nuevo presidio.<br /> <br /> El cimiento que vez enfrente de ti es la huella de la primera iglesia de la comunidad, la cual fue construida en la primavera de 1753. No se sabe la fecha en que se terminó de construir, pero se sabe que estuvo en uso en el verano de 1757.<br /> <br /> Esta pequeña iglesia permaneció bajo la dirección de los sacerdotes jesuitas hasta que fueron expulsados en 1767. Un año después llegaron los franciscanos para seguir el proyecto misionero en la Pimería Alta. Ellos continuaron usando este edificio hasta que la iglesia nueva estaba lista para uso en 1822.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Rising from an open area east of the church and north of the convento fragment this structure appears as a low, rounded, smooth, plaster-covered wall about 2 feet thick and about 1 foot tall. It appears as a rectangular, plastered, stone outline about 50 feet long and about 15 feet wide protruding from the otherwise flat soil and sparse vegetation of the park grounds. There is an opening in the eastern width of the foundation outline about 5 feet wide, indicating where the main doorway once was. The sight of the Jesuit church footprint from the eastern side is dominated by the background view of the imposing and contrastingly preserved structure of the more recent Franciscan church. With its bell tower on the left and sacristy dome on the right, it overshadows the simple, low rectangular outline in front of you.",

El convento era la parte operativa de la misión. Funcionaba como un espacio comunitario de trabajo y un centro gubernamental. Hubiera sido un espacio viviente con los sonidos de gente hablando, trabajando, y moviéndose aquí y allá.<br /> <br /> Los cuartos se alinean en forma de U alrededor de un patio central. A lo largo de la sección al norte, donde todavía se puede ver una lomita elevada larga, las evidencias arqueológicas sugieren que aquí se encuentra una cocina, herrería, carpintería, una sala para tejer, área para trabajar el cuero de ganado, y molino para grano. El almacén es todo lo que queda de la sección del oeste del convento. La sección al sur incluía la habitación del sacerdote, oficinas, y una entrada arqueada que se dirigía al patio interior. El patio central probablemente estaba plantado con árboles, flores ornamentales, y plantas medicinales y para consumir. Una arcada, ósea un pasillo techado con arcos apoyados sobre columnas y bancos empotrados a lo largo, se encontraba frente a los cuartos. Este espacio sombreado hubiera sido un lugar atractivo y agradable para juntarse con y saludar a los vecinos. La arcada y el jardín del patio del centro de visitantes se construyeron para replicar esta experiencia.<br /> <br /> Para los residentes O’odham, el convento de la misión pudo haber sido un lugar donde la tradición y el cambio chocaban. Una multitud de herramientas, tecnologías y alimentos nuevos ahora estaban disponibles. En lugar de yuca o fibras de algodón, un tejedor podría usar lana. En lugar de hueso o piedra podían fabricar herramientas de metal. Pero la adopción de estos cambios tuvo un costo social y cultural.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The convento complex refers to the open square shaped building and courtyard area to the east of the Franciscan church and storeroom. Now, with the convento building ruins mostly underground, it appears as an open space about half the size of a football field. In the central open area, the most notable feature is the low-to-the-ground plaster-covered remains of the foundation of the older Jesuit church. On the north, a low berm of sparsely vegetated earth runs east-west along the length of the area marking the covered ruins of the row of rooms that formed the north wall of the courtyard.

    "audioDescription": "Built from earthen-colored adobe bricks, the church facade reflects the preserved yet not restored look of a nineteenth century Spanish colonial church. The facade shows both original adobe brick, as well as some of the smooth, beige, plaster coating. On the left, an arched espadaña or pediment made of bricks frames a large, darkened doorway with arched wooden doors. The front door spans about one eighth of the length of the structure. The large doorway is symmetrically framed on each side by a pair of columns which together hold up a cornice supporting two pairs of additional pillars above which frame the large second-story window. These pillars are slightly closer together than those below. All pillars have Egyptian style capitals at their tops, and between each pair of pillars is an empty niche holding a round, pendant-shaped statue pedestal and framed above by a pointed, Moorish-style arch. Above the second floor, on the left side of the church, the top part of the facade rises to form a semicircular shape which holds atop its center, a small, round, plaster-covered finial anchoring a simple wooden cross. On the right side of the building, there is large window on the first floor to the right of the doorway. Above it, at various places in the otherwise plain facade, there are a few round and square holes in the building, the diameter of wooden beams, which were once used to hold scaffolding. Above these, a rectangular, brick bell tower, the tallest part of the church, rises higher than the left side of the church facade. Its central belfry opening is framed above by an arch and bordered on the left and right by oval-shaped niches.",

Hoy, solo quedan dos fragmentos; el almacén de dos pisos en la esquina al noroeste, y estos cuartos. Justo enfrente de usted estaba la entrada arqueada que se dirigía hacia el patio del convento, adornado con una pequeña cúpula arriba. El padre también vivía en esta sección del complejo.<br /> <br /> Originalmente, Tumacácori fue solo una visita, una estación que misioneros católicos visitaban de vez en cuando. No fue hasta 1768 que Tumacácori se convirtió en una cabecera, una misión donde se encontraba un residente sacerdote. Esto probablemente causó una interrupción significante para los O’odham de Tumacácori. Con solo visitas ocasionales del sacerdote, podían continuar abiertamente con sus prácticas religiosas y tradiciones sociales. Ahora, bajo la mirada atenta de un sacerdote residente, tenían que ocultar esas prácticas para conformar con los valores españoles y católicos.   <br /> <br /> Esta estructura continuó sirviendo a la comunidad de Tumacácori mucho después de la era de la misión. A fines del siglo XIX y principios del siglo XX, esta sección del convento sirvió como residencia, escuela y luego como museo del nuevo Monumento Nacional de Tumacácori. El piso original de un cuarto, con diseño “Herringbone” (espina de pez), fue duplicado y protege el piso original debajo de él. Más que cualquier otra estructura aquí, se han tratado muchas técnicas de preservación para protegerlo.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This is a rectangular, walled, roofless ruin of this structure made of adobe brick and covered with a smooth brown plaster. The outside corners of the convento fragment are rounded, and on the western side of the structure there is a wooden-framed doorway extending about 1 foot above the surrounding plaster walls. Entrance via this doorway is blocked by a railing; however, one of the interior rooms is visible from the outside of this doorway and appears empty with floor of sandy, gravel ground sparsely covered with vegetation. Veined with cracks, the roofless adobe walls are quite uneven at the top and covered by a flat row of thin, red paving-type bricks. The structure's southern facing wall is held in place by four bulky, tapezoidal-shaped buttresses also covered with light brown adobe plaster. There is a horizontally rectangular, weathered wood-framed, double window opening to the right side of the four buttresses, and a single window opening to the left of the buttresses. In the center two buttresses is a worn, gray wooden doorway. Viewed from the inside, the structure is divided into two rectangular rooms separated by a worn wooden door frame. In the room in front of and to the east of the entrance door, one of the primary visible features is the rust-colored, dusty remains of a herringbone brick floor. The other notable feature is the rounded-cornered, traditional adobe fireplace with a conical chimney built into the corner of the room. A horizontally rectangular, double window opening made of weather-worn wood is located on the north side of the room near the fireplace, and it offers a view of the Franciscan church to the northwest, and the spacious church grounds to the north marked with the low-walled outline of the remains of the Jesuit church. The view is framed distantly to the north by a low berm of grass-covered earth that contains the buried remains of the north side of the convento structure.",

La cosecha de fruta del saguaro se celebra con baile, canto y cuentos, y la preparación y el tomar del vino de fruta de saguaro, esencial para llamar a las nubes que traigan las lluvias de verano.  <br /> <br /> El establecimiento de una misión trajo nuevos frutos, importados de Europa y considerados esenciales para una vida “civilizada” por los sacerdotes y colonos. Como agricultores, los O’odham les dieron la bienvenida a estos nuevos cultivos. El trigo, cultivado durante el invierno, proporcionaba una cosecha durante una temporada de recursos limitados. Los caballos, las vacas, las ovejas, las cabras y los pollos proporcionaron transporte, labor, fibra, y fuente conveniente de proteína.<br /> <br /> El complejo de la misión incluía un jardín y huerta amurallado, protegiendo el contenido de los ciervos y el ganado. Arboles nativos, incluyendo el cumbro (Celtis reticulata), crecen a lo largo de los cimientos de esas paredes de adobe. Dentro del espacio original de 1.86 ha (4.6 acres), la comunidad cultivó vegetales y árboles frutales. Los árboles favoritos trasladados desde Europa incluían durazno, granada, membrillo y higo. Tan recientemente como en 1938, los duraznos crecían al borde de la acequia de la misión, estabilizando el bordo y aprovechando la humedad que se filtraba a través de las paredes de barro.<br /> <br /> Los árboles frutales que ve aquí hoy crecieron de semillas y esquejes de árboles frutales de variedades antiguas – propagados de árboles antiguos que se encontraban en huertas y patios históricos en todo el sur de Arizona. La nueva huerta se dedicó en 2007.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Throughout the orchard, grass and other short vegetation covers the ground and is punctuated with a variety of about 100 fruit trees planted equidistantly about 12 feet away from each other. Wide, open rows invite visitors to explore the space, and benches are located on the eastern side of the orchard providing a spot to rest. Some trees, such as the peaches, are widely branched and about 10-15 feet tall, while others like the pomegranate and fig are more compact and about 4-8 feet tall. Also present are plum trees, standing about 10-12 feet tall and displaying a narrower growth habit along with their characteristic purple/black bark. Each tree is circled at its base by raised, black edging that holds brown, pecan shell mulch and a few small white irrigation spouts, giving the orchard a neat and well-tended appearance. Also staked into the ground at the base of each tree is a metal marker noting the tree species.",

El interior del ki daba refugio durante las noches frías, pero la mayoría de las actividades del hogar se llevaban a cabo debajo o alrededor del wa:ato. Aunque muchos residentes de la misión vivían en las habitaciones de adobe de estilo español en frente de la plaza y la iglesia, es posible que algunos hayan seguido viviendo en hogares tradicionales.<br /> <br /> Los O’odham todavía construyen y usan estructuras como esta. Es construida con troncos largos de mezquite, ramas de ocotillo, costillas de saguaro, y barro.

    "audioDescription": "In front of you is a rectangular, nearly square shaped building about 12 feet in width, 10 feet in depth and 6 feet tall. Made from daubed mud, the outside wall surface of the building is the brown-grey color of the surrounding earth, and is roughly textured. The roof is constructed of support beams made from mesquite branches about 5 inches in diameter. These can be seen protruding at the top of the mud walls at the roof line. The roof also contains sticks of ocotillo, a common desert shrub with long, straight, thorned branches about 1/2 inch to 1 inch thick and up to 12 feet long. The ocotillo sticks are laid side by side and sealed together by mud, forming the roof and creating an almost flat, somewhat wavy roof shape which hangs a few inches over the perimeter of the building on each side. There are no windows, but there is a doorless entrance about 2 feet wide and 5 feet high located slightly right of center as you look at the front of the building. An open-air, flat-roofed portico stands a few feet in front of the mud house. Its structure is comprised of mesquite branches overlaid with ocotillo branches. The ramada roof is supported by 9 rustic mesquite branches stripped of bark and about 3 to 5 inches in diameter. These are evenly spaced, creating a covered walkway leading to the entrance of the of the ki and providing shade to a broad area in front of it. On the ground below are four grinding stones. Inside the dwelling is a concrete floor with a thick layer of dirt over the top. It is dark except for the rectangle of light from the small entrance. The mesquite branches and ocotillo sticks that provide the building's structure are visible, and the mud walls appear similar to the outside walls.",

    "audioDescription": "As you walk into the main church entrance down the entrance ramp, you enter the Nave. This is the long, narrow body, or main corridor of the church measuring about 100 feet in length and 20 feet in width. A narrow, arched adobe brick doorway rises to the right, leading through a vaulted tunnel to the baptistry. Near the arched main entrance to the church, there are two columns, one on each side of the nave, that rise from the floor to about 10 feet in height, now diminished to adobe ruin. Two more columns, closer to the front of the church, can be seen on each side of the Nave rising to the ceiling from a tapered decorative base about 10 feet above the floor. Each column holds a tall, narrow niche with a corbel or statuary shelf, which is now empty. The floor of the nave is made of burnished, dark red bricks. Two side altars line each wall of the nave along the length of the room. Each of these altars is now a rectangular mound of adobe brick ruins, rising from the floor to varying heights between a few inches off the floor to about 4 feet, and protected from visitors by stanchions made of wooden posts laced with thick rope. Tall, narrow arched statue niches are recessed into the walls above the altars. A few colonial style, unadorned, dark wooden benches line the walls between the altars. The walls are made of exposed, time-worn adobe bricks that are grey-brown in color. In some places along the walls, especially on the upper portions, a whitish, age-stained plaster coating covers the aged bricks in large irregular shapes, having fallen off or been damaged over the course of centuries. On both sides of the nave, there are many uneven holes in the walls, some fist-sized and some much larger, resulting from weathering, vandals, and treasure hunters from previous centuries. Light enters in a stream from a window above the main entrance door to the church, and from a window on the eastern wall about 30 feet in front of the entrance. The long, narrow space of the nave leads the visitor's sight forward to the south end of the church, the sanctuary, which rises at the top of 5 adobe brick stairs at the front of church. The stairs are covered by an arched entrance and flanked on the right side of the nave by the simple reconstructed base of the pulpit, protruding from the wall as an inverted triangular structure about 4 feet off the floor.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Cuando obtuvo su independencia de España, la nueva nación de México no valoró a las misiones por su propósito original de convertir a los nativos a ciudadanos de España. Los sacerdotes nacidos en España fueron deportados, incluyendo el último sacerdote residente de Tumacácori en 1828. Las familias de la misión permanecieron aquí otros veinte años. Por razones que no grabaron en registros, los residentes de Tumacácori se mudaron en 1848. Las mujeres cargaron en sus espaldas las canastas con los preciosos santos a San Xavier del Bac. Dejaron atrás su iglesia, cementerio, campos, y hogares.<br /> <br /> Con la compra de Gadsden en 1854, Tumacácori se convirtió en parte de los Estados Unidos. El sistema de reservas para personas indígenas de los EE. UU. limitó el territorio legal de los O’odham a cinco reservaciones: las naciones de San Xavier, Tohono (desierto) O’odham, Gila River (Río Gila), Salt River (Río de Sal), y Ak-Chin Pima (Pima del Río).<br /> <br /> Hoy día, los Tohono O’odham y Pima son conocidos por sus canastas hermosas, tejidas con materiales recolectadas en los desiertos y ríos de su tierra natal. Los Yoeme (Yaqui) son famosos por sus tallas de madera y danzas religiosas, los Apache por sus abalorios. Muchos todavía hablan los idiomas de sus antepasados.<br /> <br /> Después de cientos de años de matrimonios, la creación de nuevas familias y la mezcla de tradiciones, resultó un grupo nuevo: el mestizaje de México. Sabores como chiles, carne asada y tortillas reflejan esta mezcla de orígenes. Compartir alimentos tradicionales, recién hechos en cocinas como esta, nos conecta con nuestra herencia compartida.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The ramada is a square-shaped, open-air pergola or roofed shelter with no walls. It measures about 12 feet by 12 feet in size, and sits in the open community plaza area northeast of the visitor center building and southeast of the church. The roof is made of ocotillo covered with a thin layer of board wood and supported by a metal, mesh roof frame. The roof is held up by posts of thick tree branches. The roof provides plenty of shade beneath the ramada. The floor is the same as the surrounding open community plaza, mostly dirt with scattered low-growing vegetation. This rustic structure provides shelter to a few rustic, wooden tables with metallic tops that form a serving counter on one side, and on the other side a hand-made cement enclosure with a comal (flat surface for cooking tortillas). The rustic, outdoor oven appears to have been used recently and is stained with black soot. Burned wood charcoal is present under the comal. Next to the oven sits a stack of cut wood and sticks, and inside the cooking ramada sits a chair.",

Comienza en el valle de San Rafael, fluye al sur hacia México, luego cambia dirección de nuevo hacia los Estados Unidos. Aquí, fluye del sur al norte, y finalmente se une con el Río Gila. El río crea un hábitat esencial y un corredor de vida silvestre para especies amenazadas y en peligro de extinción.<br /> <br /> Donde la roca subterránea es menos profunda, el agua es forzada a la superficie. Los O’odham instalaron sus pueblos en estos lugares, para aprovechar de una fuente de agua segura. Los colonos hicieron lo mismo.<br /> <br /> El río proporcionaba no solo agua para beber y para regar los cultivos, sino también un hábitat para la red de vida compleja que sostenía los asentamientos humanos. Proporcionaba cada canasta, comida, articulo de ropa, medicina y práctica cultural. Literalmente, cada elemento que una persona tocaba a lo largo de su vida se conectaba directamente con el río Santa Cruz.<br /> <br /> Hoy día, el hábitat de álamos y sauces a lo largo del rio Santa Cruz es uno de los hábitats poco comunes en los Estados Unidos— y está en peligro de extinción. Las comunidades de plantas y animales del río y la calidad del agua están amenazadas por el cambio climático y el uso moderno de las tierras a su alrededor. La sección de río que fluye por Tumacácori consiste casi totalmente de aguas residuales que han pasado por un proceso de depuración. Este tratamiento se lleva a cabo en la Planta Internacional de Tratamiento de Aguas Residuales de Nogales en Río Rico, Arizona. Aunque esta agua suplementaria ha permitido la recuperación de poblaciones del Gila topminnow (Poeciliopsis occidentalis) en peligro de extinción, no es adecuada para el consumo humano. Evita el contacto con el agua en el rio.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Santa Cruz river runs from south to north in a winding channel about 30 feet wide. The flow passes very slowly and the water is shallow. The river banks are eroded and appear as if the water flow increases and decreases frequently. Lining the banks on both sides of the river are towering cottonwood trees, hundreds of feet tall, creating a tunnel of tree canopy above the river. On the river banks, branches, leaves and other debris are scattered in the understory along with some grasses and other moisture-loving vegetation.",

La protección de sus muros gruesos ofreció un refugio bienvenido a los que viajaban hacia California en busca de oro, y a los soldados y vaqueros mexicanos y estadounidenses.

    "audioDescription": "An arched doorway on the east side of the sanctuary opens to a ramp leading down to the sacristy. This is a dark room about 15 by 15 feet square. The room has a high, barrel-vaulted ceiling and a small doorway leading to the outside on the east side of the room. An arched window opening to the north also lets light into dark space. Four steps with deep treads made of fired brick lead from the Sacristy floor to a gated entranced to the pulpit. The sacristy floors are the same dark red, polished bricks that are present in the rest of the church. The walls are made of adobe bricks and they exhibit similar deterioration as those in other areas of the church, with patches of once white, now weathered and stained plaster interspersed with unprotected grey adobe brick. The vaulted ceiling appears supported on its east-west axis by an arched beam, covered in plaster, now faded and grey. Smudged with charcoal black and grey soot, the ceiling shows the stain from many campfires built in post mission times by soldiers, travelers and others seeking shelter here. Traces of some of these visitors are seen in the signatures, dates and other graffiti etched into the brick and plaster in numerous places in the sacristy.",

Durante las partes más sagradas de la ceremonia, el padre cantaba las palabras mirando hacia el altar, con su espalda a la congregación. Las escrituras se leían del púlpito, el cual fue reconstruido en la pared al este cerca al santuario. El servicio se realizaba en una combinación de latín, español y O’odham.<br /> <br /> Parados bajo la alta cúpula, se puede imaginar las decoraciones pintadas con colores brillantes en las paredes y los techos, la luz de las velas parpadeando, los parroquianos arrodillados en la nave, y el sonido de cantos, oraciones y canciones reverberando por el cuarto. La combinación de estas experiencias intentaba crear una distancia mental del trabajo arduo que ocurre justo afuera de las puertas.<br /> <br /> Las personas O’odham y Yoeme de la misión podrían haber encontrado extraños los rituales de la misa católica después de la primera introducción. La práctica de arrodillarse, ponerse de pie y luego arrodillarse nuevamente, durante una ceremonia realizada principalmente en lenguas extranjeras, fue sin duda confusa para algunos. Sin embargo, con el tiempo, estas costumbres extrañas se convirtieron en algo familiar y se mezcló con las creencias espirituales y religiosas de las comunidades indígenas. Hoy en día, muchas personas O’odham y Yoeme practican esta tradición religiosa singularmente entrelazada.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Stepping up the stairs through the archway to the sacristy, the altar rises on the back wall in the center of the burnished red brick floor. The altar is a simple, rectangular adobe brick structure about 5 feet wide, 3 feet high and 3 feet deep. The high domed ceiling rises approximately 40 feet above the floor. The ceiling plaster color is varying shades of white, cream and grey with remnants of black stenciling. The walls are made of adobe brick which are greatly deteriorated with dozens of holes of varying sizes. In scattered areas, weathered plaster covers the adobe brick walls in large patches. One of the most captivating visual features of the sanctuary is the faded, decorative painting that can be dimly seen on each side of the altar. The decorative motif shows red painted draperies drawn back on each side of a central dome. On the wall behind the altar is a black painting of rectangular blocks. Faded floral garlands are also stenciled around the upper walls of the sanctuary above a row of painted brown-red picture frames. On opposite sides of the arched entry are faded paintings representing the holy communion – a chalice with grapes and a sheaf of wheat. Still visible in many places just below the faded orange colored circular cornice or bottom \"edge\" of the dome is a repeated pattern of small black squares, painted to appear as a \"trompe l'oeil, or \"optical illusion\" architectural feature appearing as square stones holding up the cornice.",

El evento empezó en 1965 con una misa católica dentro de la iglesia de la misión en honor al padre Eusebio Francisco Kino. En 1971 el evento anual incluyo la misa conmemorativa y actividades adicionales durante el resto del día. La Fiesta rápidamente creció y el espacio en frente de la iglesia no era adecuado así es que se movió a este terreno que había sido cultivado.<br /> <br /> Cada año, la Fiesta de Tumacácori reúne a personas de todas las culturas del Valle de Santa Cruz durante dos días de celebración. Cada cultura tradicional de Tumacácori está representada en música y baile. Se invita a las organizaciones locales sin fines de lucro a que proporcionen información tocante su organización y que vendan artículos artesanales y alimentos tradicionales. Artesanos que representan las culturas O’odham (Tohono O’odham y Pima), Yoeme (Yaqui), Nde (Apache), y tradiciones mexicanas y mexicoamericanas muestran sus habilidades y comparten sus culturas con personas de todo el mundo.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The fiesta grounds are a large, open field to the north of the lime kiln. This open area, about the size of a football field looks like an empty fairground area, with a centrally placed cement pad or stage, and a number of rustic ramada or hand-built pergola type structures scattered around the outside edges of the area. A few cement benches are on the south side of the grounds. About 30 small brown, painted wooden structures in the shape of an inverted U stick out of the ground on the south side of the grounds at intervals of about 8 feet. Some picnic tables are also present. The grounds are bordered on the north and east by a row of tall bushes and trees, and to the west by a metal gate and a parking lot on the frontage road. Paths lead east to the mission grounds and Anza Trail, and south to the lime kiln and mission grounds.",

    "audioDescription": "Facing the church façade, 3 square or rectangular-shaped pits sit in front of the church to the right of the door. The first of these pits is square, about 5 feet in width and length, extending about 1 foot above ground and about 3 feet below ground. It is made of red brick, but almost completely covered by a beige plaster coating inside and out. Looking down into the vat, the bottom is plaster covered, though chipped and cracked in places. The low above-ground wall is about 1 foot high. Sitting adjacent to this vat, the middle of the 3 vats is a slightly larger rectangular shape constructed of layered red brick with some plaster coating also visible inside. The third vat is the smallest and most shallow, barely rising above the ground with red brick appearing only one layer high above ground, and only about a foot deep. The bottom of this shallow pit is covered with wide, red paving bricks. To the right of the 3 vats, a ditch runs eastward underneath the adjacent walkway. These pits are a visible aspect of the church façade area; however, little about their physical appearance gives any clue to their purpose.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The name Calabazas first appears in a baptismal record of June 2, 1756. It was evidently established as a mission earlier that year when Father Francisco Xavier Pauer relocated at least seventy-eight Pimas to the site from their village of <em>Toacuquita</em>, a Spanish rendition of the Pima words \"<em>do'ag cugidaga</em>,\" meaning \"peaked mountain.\" This village was located closer to the Santa Cruz River. When the mission was moved up away from the river, it was given the name \"San Cayetano de Calabazas.\" <em>Calabazas</em> means \"squash\" or \"gourds\" in Spanish -- the name may be a reference to the wild \"coyote gourds\" that grow in the area or to the domestic squash cultivated by the O'odham. Records are scanty, but it is known that construction of the church was half complete in 1761 and was functional by 1773.</p> <p>Father Antonio de los Reyes on 6 July 1772 submitted a report on the condition of the missions in the Upper and Lower Pimeria Alta. This was his report on San Cayetano de Calabazas as translated by Father Kieran McCarty:</p> <blockquote dir=\"ltr\"> <p><em>The village of San Cayetano at Calabazas lies two leagues to the east of Guevavi on an open plain with good lands, but the Indians do little or no farming at all. There is no church nor house for the Missionary. According to the Census book, which I have here before me, there are seventeen married couples, four widowers, seven widows, the number of souls in all sixty-four.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>On October 17, 1775, Father Pedro Font said mass at Calabazas during the expedition to California led by Juan Bautista de Anza. The church, houses and the granary were set on fire during an Apache attack in 1777. Calabazas was abandoned in 1786 when the last of the O'odham left because of continuing problems with the Apaches.</p> <p>From 1807 to 1830, it was used as a farm for the Tumacácori mission. In 1808, several non-Indians moved into Calabazas and restored the chapel. But again, the Apaches attacked, set fire to the buildings and carried off the sacred vessels and vestments. In 1844, Calabazas was sold to Manuel Gándara, governor of Sonora. In 1853, Gandara had 6,000 head of stock and converted the church into a ranch house. After the Gadsden Purchase, the ranch house (the old Jesuit church) served a number of purposes -- customs house, post office, and dwelling. Fort Mason was established at Calabazas in 1864 by the California Volunteers. However, 300 of the 400 men got sick with malaria and so the fort was abandoned. By 1878, Calabazas was totally abandoned with only a roofless shell remaining.</p> <p>In 1960, Father Norman Whalen from Tombstone, Arizona recruited preservation volunteers who capped the walls and laid a cement foundation. The Arizona Historical Society took over site management and ownership in October of 1974. Like Guevavi, Calabazas was added to Tumacácori National Historical Park in 1990. Though Padre Kino never set foot there, the spirit of the master promoter of the Pimeria Alta is certainly present.<br /> <br /> Access to Calabazas is restricted to participants on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/see-more-missions.htm\">guided tours</a>.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A large metal roof shelters the adobe remnants of a church. At the north side, the roof extends in a leg to the east and then down to create a corrugated metal wall. Remaining exterior adobe walls extend in a north-south orientation over about 30 feet. Some dividing walls still exist inside the space, as well as doorways and window openings. At the south east corner of the fenced area, a remnant structure built from stone and mortar still stands.",

It begins in the San Rafael Valley, flows southward into Mexico, then makes a U-turn back into the United States. Here, it flows from south to north, eventually joining the Gila River. The river creates essential habitat and a wildlife corridor for threatened and endangered species. </p> <p paraeid=\"{789655bc-7d2a-4a59-8c1a-83ee971079b9}{100}\" paraid=\"1636554113\">Where underlying bedrock slopes up, the water is forced to the surface. The O’odham situated their villages in these locations, known as “gaining reaches,” to take advantage of the reliable water source. Later settlers followed suit. </p> <p paraeid=\"{789655bc-7d2a-4a59-8c1a-83ee971079b9}{106}\" paraid=\"1780625867\">The river provided not only water for drinking and irrigation, but habitat for the complex web of life that supported human settlement. It contributed to every basket, meal, article of clothing, medicine, and cultural practice. Literally every item a person touched over the course of a lifetime connected back to the Santa Cruz River corridor. </p> <p paraeid=\"{789655bc-7d2a-4a59-8c1a-83ee971079b9}{122}\" paraid=\"1700881466\">Today, the cottonwood-willow environment along the Santa Cruz is one of the most rare and endangered habitats in the United States. The river‘s plant and animal communities and water quality are threatened by climate change and modern land use. The stretch of river that flows through Tumacácori is now composed almost entirely of treated effluent, released from the Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Facility in Rio Rico, Arizona. Although this supplemental water source has supported the return of the endangered Gila topminnow (<em>Poeciliopsis occidentalis</em>), it is not safe for human consumption. Avoid contact.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Santa Cruz river runs from south to north in a winding channel about 30 feet wide. The flow passes very slowly and the water is shallow. The river banks are eroded and appear as if the water flow increases and decreases frequently. Lining the banks on both sides of the river are towering cottonwood trees, hundreds of feet tall, creating a tunnel of tree canopy above the river. On the river banks, branches, leaves and other debris are scattered in the understory along with some grasses and other moisture-loving vegetation.",

The fired adobe structure before you is part of the <em>acequia madre</em>, the main irrigation channel that brought water to the mission from the Santa Cruz River a mile or more to the south. The narrowed end could be closed, raising the elevation of the water to serve various functions. As a <em>compuerta</em>, or diversion box, it turned water from the ditch into the orchard to the east. As a holding tank, it was convenient for filling <em>ollas</em>, earthen jars, to carry water back to the houses for drinking and cooking. Because it had a polished, red surface, it was probably also used as a <em>lavandería</em>, or place for washing clothes and dishes, and possibly even bathing.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The visible remnant of the acequia or irrigation ditch appears as a roughly rectangular depression in the earth about 10 feet long, 4 feet wide and 2 feet deep. Looking down into the structure, the fired adobe brick walls appear like crumbling, grey, retaining walls that would have once held water in a rectangular pool. The east and west long sides of the rectangular acequia are made of about 6 courses of adobe brick rising at a 90 degree angle from the dusty, dirt floor. The shorter north and south ends are comprised of soil and slope up gradually to meet the surrounding surface of the ground. On the north end of the structure, the sloped opening to the surrounding surface of the ground is a narrow funnel created by a short, diagonally curved brick dam extending from the adjacent east side partially across the width of the structure, leaving a narrow, upwardly sloping, rocky soil-covered opening to the surrounding ground. Where the edge of the acequia meets the surrounding ground, a row of reddish brown bricks forms a flat surface flush with the ground and the wall of the structure. Some of these edging pavers are covered with a protective plaster coating. A faint remnant of the historic ditch’s patch remains visible on either side of the rectangular structure. A trail follows its route downstream.",

To the right of the entrance, an arched window opening at waist height reveals the 9-foot thick walls that create a tunnel of light extending from the outside into the dark space.

Although the bell tower appears to be in ruin, it has changed little since the last residents left in 1848. The fired bricks of the bell arches never received their finishing coats of plaster.

Open sky shows through as a background to the bell in the rectangular arched opening of the belfry. To each side of the central, open belfry opening is a rectangular statue niche with a cracked, beige plaster shell motif inlaid at the arched top of each niche. A number of small, square, evenly spaced holes are visible across the width of the bell tower.

    "audioDescription": "An expansive square-shaped outdoor area surrounded by an adobe wall opens before you. About 75 feet in length on each side, this thick adobe wall encloses the large space and gives an appearance of a park-like area. About 8 feet tall and 2 feet thick, the cemetery walls have a smooth, brownish-beige plaster coating. The wall is a few feet higher on the northeast portion of the wall and it is also punctuated by visible bullet holes in this section. The top of the wall is covered by a protective layer of brick and plaster that overhangs the wall slightly. Spaced at about every twenty feet near the top of the wall are 14 hollowed, arched niches. In the west Cemetery wall, the eye is drawn to a brown, painted wooden door, covered by a triangular brick transom that leads to the church grounds on the northwest side of the church. Mountains rise in the distance behind the west wall. The center of the cemetery is mostly an open space with gravelly soil and very sparse, grassy vegetation. Three gracefully branched mesquite trees sit in the central part of the space and one occupies the northeast corner providing some shade in these areas. Wooden crosses marking graves in the northern part of cemetery provide a background to a larger, beige plastered grave monument shaped like a small coffin, topped on one end by a painted wrought iron cross decorated with a metal monument name plate and flowers. The name plate displays the name Juanita Alegria, born in 1915 and laid to rest in 1916. The mortuary chapel is a roofless, circular building about 16 feet in diameter and 15 feet high standing near the entrance to the Cemetery. The outer walls of the building appear to have small, decorative pieces of fired red brick stuck into the adobe walls. The upper portion of the wall has a plaster covering over this pebbled adobe. About a foot below the top of the building, a row of horizontally laid, fired and burnished red bricks create a decorative line around the building, and above this row of bricks at the top of the building is a cornice made of curved, fired and burnished bricks laid vertically in a decorative pattern. Outside of the south side of the mortuary wall, a colonial-style wooden cross with the name Soto etched on it sits atop one end of a grave-shaped mound of stones. Around the curve of the building to the west, the mortuary building is open to visitors via an arched doorway about 4 feet wide facing the western cemetery gate. Entering through this doorway reveals the 3 foot thickness of the mortuary walls. Inside, the circular, roofless view above opens to the sky and is framed by the decorative brick cornice design at the top of the building. Below, gravelly soil over concrete comprises the floor. The mortuary walls, like other adobe brick structures at Tumacácori, reveal a view of both grey adobe bricks, and a patchy combination of various brownish-colored plaster coatings, many etched with cracks. Near the top of the wall, about 5 feet from each side of the door, are circular openings to the outside that are about 4 inches in diameter and give the appearance of small tunnels in the thick walls.",

The convento was the operational part of the mission. It functioned as a shared, community workspace and governmental center. It would have been alive with the sounds of people talking, working, and moving about. The rooms aligned in a U-shape around a central courtyard. Along the north wing, where a long raised mound is still visible today, archeological evidence suggests a kitchen, ironworker's shop, carpentry shop, weaving room, leather shop, and grain grinding mill. The storeroom is all that remains of the west row of the convento. The south wing included the priest’s quarters, other office spaces, and an arched entrance to the interior courtyard. The central courtyard was likely planted with trees, ornamental flowers, and medicinal and edible plants. An arcade – a covered walkway lined with arches and built-in benches – ran in front of the rooms. It would have been a shady, inviting, and pleasant place to meet and greet one’s neighbors. The arcade and courtyard garden of the visitor center were built to replicate this experience.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{d2ad0579-e333-4f41-8140-8efe89593b31}{114}\" paraid=\"1272546086\">For its O’odham residents, the mission’s convento may have been a place where tradition and change clashed. A host of new tools, technologies, and food sources had become available. Instead of yucca or cotton fibers, a weaver could use wool. Instead of bone or stone, one could craft tools from metal. But adopting these changes came at a social and cultural cost.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The convento complex refers to the open square shaped building and courtyard area to the east of the Franciscan church and storeroom. Now, with the convento building ruins mostly underground, it appears as an open space about half the size of a football field.

On the north, a low berm of sparsely vegetated earth runs east-west along the length of the area marking the covered ruins of the row of rooms that formed the north wall of the courtyard.

It wasn’t until 1768 that Tumacácori became a cabecera – a mission that housed a resident priest. This likely caused a significant disturbance for the O’odham of Tumacácori. With only occasional visits from the priest, they could openly continue their traditional religious and social practices. Now, under the watchful eye of a resident priest, they had to conceal those practices in order to model Spanish and Catholic values.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff2d1174-089a-4e83-b380-b7a346cec46d}{72}\" paraid=\"1213708685\">This structure continued to serve the Tumacácori community long after the mission era. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, this remaining section of the convento served as a residence, a school, and later housed the museum of the fledgling Tumacácori National Monument.

    "audioDescription": "This is a rectangular, walled, roofless ruin of this structure made of adobe brick and covered with a smooth brown plaster. The outside corners of the convento fragment are rounded, and on the western side of the structure there is a wooden-framed doorway extending about 1 foot above the surrounding plaster walls. Entrance via this doorway is blocked by a railing; however, one of the interior rooms is visible from the outside of this doorway and appears empty with floor of sandy, gravel ground sparsely covered with vegetation. Veined with cracks, the roofless adobe walls are quite uneven at the top and covered by a flat row of thin, red paving-type bricks. The structure's southern facing wall is held in place by four bulky, tapezoidal-shaped buttresses also covered with light brown adobe plaster. There is a horizontally rectangular, weathered wood-framed, double window opening to the right side of the four buttresses, and a single window opening to the left of the buttresses. In the center two buttresses is a worn, gray wooden doorway. Viewed from the inside, the structure is divided into two rectangular rooms separated by a worn wooden door frame. In the room in front of and to the east of the entrance door, one of the primary visible features is the rust-colored, dusty remains of a herringbone brick floor. The other notable feature is the rounded-cornered, traditional adobe fireplace with a conical chimney built into the corner of the room. A horizontally rectangular, double window opening made of weather-worn wood is located on the north side of the room near the fireplace, and it offers a view of the Franciscan church to the northwest, and the spacious church grounds to the north marked with the low-walled outline of the remains of the Jesuit church. The view is framed distantly to the north by a low berm of grass-covered earth that contains the buried remains of the north side of the convento structure.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Once it gained its independence from Spain, the new nation of Mexico no longer valued the missions for their original purpose of converting native people into European-style citizens. Priests born in Spain were deported, including Tumacácori’s last resident priest in 1828. The mission families stayed on for another twenty years. For reasons that they did not record, in 1848 the residents of Tumacácori moved away, the women carrying their precious <em>santos </em>(saint statues) on their backs in burden baskets to San Xavier del Bac. They left behind their church, cemetery, fields, and homes.<br /> <br /> With the Gadsden Purchase in 1854, Tumacácori became part of the United States. The U.S. reservation system eventually limited the legal territory of the O’odham to five sister reservations: the San Xavier and Tohono (desert) O’odham, and Gila River, Salt River, and Ak-Chin Pima (river) nations.<br /> <br /> Today, the Tohono O’odham and Pima are known for their beautiful basketry, woven using materials collected from the deserts and rivers of their homeland. The Yoeme (Yaqui) are famous for their carvings and religious dance, the Apache for their beadwork. Many still speak the languages of their ancestors.<br /> <br /> After hundreds of years of mixing, marrying, creating new families, and blending traditions, a new people emerged: the <em>mestizaje </em>of Mexico.

    "audioDescription": "The ramada is a square-shaped, open-air pergola or roofed shelter with no walls. It measures about 12 feet by 12 feet in size, and sits in the open community plaza area northeast of the visitor center building and southeast of the church. The roof is made of ocotillo covered with a thin layer of board wood and supported by a metal, mesh roof frame. The roof is held up by posts of thick tree branches. The roof provides plenty of shade beneath the ramada. The floor is the same as the surrounding open community plaza, mostly dirt with scattered low-growing vegetation. This rustic structure provides shelter to a few rustic, wooden tables with metallic tops that form a serving counter on one side, and on the other side a hand-made cement enclosure with a comal (flat surface for cooking tortillas). The rustic, outdoor oven appears to have been used recently and is stained with black soot. Burned wood charcoal is present under the comal. Next to the oven sits a stack of cut wood and sticks, and inside the cooking ramada sits a chair.",

Its design, like that of the adjacent visitor center, was inspired by other missions in the Pimería Alta. Several agencies were involved, but the original plantings were carried out by sixteen young men employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Three native mesquite trees were left in place and continue to grow in the garden. The olive, ornamental pomegranate, and monk’s pepper trees survive to this day. When the original apricot tree had to be removed, a seed from that tree provided its replacement.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Upon entering the courtyard garden, visitors are reminded of a Spanish colonial courtyard garden refuge. Vine-covered garden walls formed by the surrounding buildings enclose the central space which is often full of color with the bright greens of the plants’ foliage and a variety of flower colors. In the center of the garden is a fountain pool with turquoise-colored plaster/cement interior bordered by an octagonal pool wall with a brick bench-top. The fountain is filled with water and features a cream-colored fountain-head scalloped basin held up by a graceful pedestal. Circling the central fountain and various planting beds are garden paths made of brick pavers laid in a herringbone design. One of these paths also leads to the restrooms. The garden plants exhibit a wide and beautiful diversity of form, shape and size, and include a number of trees that provide shade to visitors. The plants displayed include both some local desert species with characteristic spiny or succulent leaves, as well as European species. Plant markers note the genus, species and common names of plants. Low adobe-style benches on the north and south sides of the fountain offer multiple places to sit. Warm yellow painted arches of the main park building’s stuccoed walls are also visible.",

    "audioDescription": "Built from earthen-colored adobe bricks, the church facade reflects the preserved yet not restored look of a nineteenth century Spanish colonial church. The facade shows both original adobe brick, as well as some of the smooth, beige, plaster coating. On the left, an arched espadaña or pediment made of bricks frames a large, darkened doorway with arched wooden doors. The front door spans about one eighth of the length of the structure. The large doorway is symmetrically framed on each side by a pair of columns which together hold up a cornice supporting two pairs of additional pillars above which frame the large second-story window. These pillars are slightly closer together than those below. All pillars have Egyptian style capitals at their tops, and between each pair of pillars is an empty niche holding a round, pendant-shaped statue pedestal and framed above by a pointed, Moorish-style arch. Above the second floor, on the left side of the church, the top part of the facade rises to form a semicircular shape which holds atop its center, a small, round, plaster-covered finial anchoring a simple wooden cross. On the right side of the building, there is large window on the first floor to the right of the doorway. Above it, at various places in the otherwise plain facade, there are a few round and square holes in the building, the diameter of wooden beams, which were once used to hold scaffolding. Above these, a rectangular, brick bell tower, the tallest part of the church, rises higher than the left side of the church facade. Its central belfry opening is framed above by an arch and bordered on the left and right by oval-shaped niches.",

The Fiesta quickly outgrew the space in front of the church and was moved to this area of previously farmed land. </p> <p paraeid=\"{789655bc-7d2a-4a59-8c1a-83ee971079b9}{74}\" paraid=\"1885759364\">Each year, the Tumacácori Fiesta brings together people from all the cultures of the Santa Cruz Valley for two days of celebration. Each culture traditional to Tumacácori is represented in music and dance. Local non-profit organizations are invited to provide information and to sell handcrafted items and traditional foods. Artisans and craftspeople representing O’odham (Tohono O’odham and Pima), Yoeme (Yaqui), Nde (Apache), Mexican, and Mexican-American traditions demonstrate their skills and share their cultures with people from all over the world. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The fiesta grounds are a large, open field to the north of the lime kiln. This open area, about the size of a football field looks like an empty fairground area, with a centrally placed cement pad or stage, and a number of rustic ramada or hand-built pergola type structures scattered around the outside edges of the area. A few cement benches are on the south side of the grounds. About 30 small brown, painted wooden structures in the shape of an inverted U stick out of the ground on the south side of the grounds at intervals of about 8 feet. Some picnic tables are also present. The grounds are bordered on the north and east by a row of tall bushes and trees, and to the west by a metal gate and a parking lot on the frontage road. Paths lead east to the mission grounds and Anza Trail, and south to the lime kiln and mission grounds.",

At that time, the village was located on the other side of the Santa Cruz River. Although he chose Guevavi to be the <em>cabecera </em>(headquarters) where the priest would live, he and other priests continued to visit Tumacácori￼, sing the Mass, and tend to mission business. There is no record of an adobe church having been built while the village was on the east side of the river.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff2d1174-089a-4e83-b380-b7a346cec46d}{142}\" paraid=\"1803006028\">In November of 1751, a group of O'odham led by Captain General Luis Oacpicagigua (“Ahk-pee-ah-CUK-ya”) rebelled against the Spanish and Yoeme who had moved into their land.

When everyone returned, the village of Tumacácori was moved to the present location nearer to and on the same side of the river as the new presidio. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff2d1174-089a-4e83-b380-b7a346cec46d}{160}\" paraid=\"213230342\">The outline that you see before you marks the footprint of the community’s first church, begun in the spring of 1753.

    "audioDescription": "Rising from an open area east of the church and north of the convento fragment this structure appears as a low, rounded, smooth, plaster-covered wall about 2 feet thick and about 1 foot tall. It appears as a rectangular, plastered, stone outline about 50 feet long and about 15 feet wide protruding from the otherwise flat soil and sparse vegetation of the park grounds. There is an opening in the eastern width of the foundation outline about 5 feet wide, indicating where the main doorway once was. The sight of the Jesuit church footprint from the eastern side is dominated by the background view of the imposing and contrastingly preserved structure of the more recent Franciscan church. With its bell tower on the left and sacristy dome on the right, it overshadows the simple, low rectangular outline in front of you.",

A soil mixture would be mixed with water into a thick paste and then pressed into rectangular wooden forms and left in the sun to dry. This efficient style of earthen technology goes back thousands of years, but requires constant maintenance. Moisture, either from the ground or from precipitation, will erode sun-dried adobe bricks, rendering the structure unstable. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b502ef00-846f-4aac-811f-88c57f6f33ad}{213}\" paraid=\"1339374744\">The Spanish favored limestone plaster as a protective coating on their adobe buildings. Many tons of limestone rocks were gathered and carted to the mission’s lime kilns. A fire was built under a metal grill and high temperatures “cooked” the limestone over several days until it could be hammered into a fine powder. That powder was then made into a paste using water and sand, which was later troweled onto on the exposed adobe brick walls. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b502ef00-846f-4aac-811f-88c57f6f33ad}{219}\" paraid=\"686887388\">Gathering stone, mixing plaster, and coating the large structures required the labor of many workers. For the O’odham, the kiln probably represented a significant change in their lifestyle. Previously, they lived with a changing landscape, in buildings that changed with it. The European worldview prioritized permanence and defiance of natural weathering. This shift would shape the way that people across the region live and think for centuries to come. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The lime kiln is a circular, below-ground well-like structure about 6 feet in diameter. The walls of the lime kiln extend about 1 foot above the ground and are covered on the top and exterior by a brownish-cream colored plaster coating. The rounded flat surface of the wall is about a foot wide. As you look down into the underground interior of the lime kiln, the walls appear to be made of dried, brown, adobe brick with a layer of red colored bricks at the bottom about 5 feet down. The floor of lime kiln is sandy gravel. Back above ground, a hexagonal, brown, metal fence with horizonal rails surrounds the entire circular kiln structure protecting it from climbing or entry.",

    "audioDescription": "In front of you is a rectangular, nearly square shaped building about 12 feet in width, 10 feet in depth and 6 feet tall. Made from daubed mud, the outside wall surface of the building is the brown-grey color of the surrounding earth, and is roughly textured. The roof is constructed of support beams made from mesquite branches about 5 inches in diameter. These can be seen protruding at the top of the mud walls at the roof line. The roof also contains sticks of ocotillo, a common desert shrub with long, straight, thorned branches about 1/2 inch to 1 inch thick and up to 12 feet long. The ocotillo sticks are laid side by side and sealed together by mud, forming the roof and creating an almost flat, somewhat wavy roof shape which hangs a few inches over the perimeter of the building on each side. There are no windows, but there is a doorless entrance about 2 feet wide and 5 feet high located slightly right of center as you look at the front of the building. An open-air, flat-roofed portico stands a few feet in front of the mud house. Its structure is comprised of mesquite branches overlaid with ocotillo branches. The ramada roof is supported by 9 rustic mesquite branches stripped of bark and about 3 to 5 inches in diameter. These are evenly spaced, creating a covered walkway leading to the entrance of the of the ki and providing shade to a broad area in front of it. On the ground below are four grinding stones. Inside the dwelling is a concrete floor with a thick layer of dirt over the top. It is dark except for the rectangle of light from the small entrance. The mesquite branches and ocotillo sticks that provide the building's structure are visible, and the mud walls appear similar to the outside walls.",

All aspects of daily life would be subject to transformation – food, language, clothing, agriculture, and religion. In the mission model you can see adobe buildings for residences and workshops, agricultural lands, cattle, and the main irrigation ditch. A mission community could be considered a residential training academy where indigenous people learned and adopted a new way of life. The plan was for the missionary priest to move on after ten years, when the community could sustain itself. In fact, more than 100 years would pass beforethe turn of the 19th century, when the first bricks would be laid for the mission church you see today.<br /> <br /> Tumacácori went from being an O’odham village to a frontier <em>visita </em>(satellite mission) to a <em>cabecera </em>(headquarters mission). Its people changed as well. The O’odham became known as the “Pima” and the “Papago,” and their lands the <em>Pimería Alta</em> (land of the upper Pima). They were baptized with Spanish names, given Spanish-style clothing, and assigned Spanish jobs. They tended to domestic livestock rather than hunting wild game, and irrigated fruit trees that came from oceans away. </p> <p paraeid=\"{dfb4ab41-585f-4bba-bb28-8ef886f8a288}{11}\" paraid=\"325370160\">Today, the O’odham people still carry with them the legacy of colonization. Because they did not record their stories in a written language, exploring their history requires empathy, inference, and respect for O’odham oral tradition. The descendants of mission-era communities are still living all around us.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Sitting in the middle of an open alcove corner room is a small-scale model of the mission grounds encased in a plexiglass display case measuring about 4 feet by 4 feet. The model provides an aerial view of the grounds as they may have appeared during mission times.

Further northeast of the church courtyard area, the model displays miniature renditions of the acequia or irrigation canals, and the orchard. This mission model display is the centerpiece of the room you are standing in and offers a small-scale view of what the grounds may once have looked like. This view contrasts with the scene of the actual Tumacácori church and grounds visible through large open, arched windows of this room.

    "audioDescription": "As you walk into the main church entrance down the entrance ramp, you enter the Nave. This is the long, narrow body, or main corridor of the church measuring about 100 feet in length and 20 feet in width. A narrow, arched adobe brick doorway rises to the right, leading through a vaulted tunnel to the baptistry. Near the arched main entrance to the church, there are two columns, one on each side of the nave, that rise from the floor to about 10 feet in height, now diminished to adobe ruin. Two more columns, closer to the front of the church, can be seen on each side of the Nave rising to the ceiling from a tapered decorative base about 10 feet above the floor. Each column holds a tall, narrow niche with a corbel or statuary shelf, which is now empty. The floor of the nave is made of burnished, dark red bricks. Two side altars line each wall of the nave along the length of the room. Each of these altars is now a rectangular mound of adobe brick ruins, rising from the floor to varying heights between a few inches off the floor to about 4 feet, and protected from visitors by stanchions made of wooden posts laced with thick rope. Tall, narrow arched statue niches are recessed into the walls above the altars. A few colonial style, unadorned, dark wooden benches line the walls between the altars. The walls are made of exposed, time-worn adobe bricks that are grey-brown in color. In some places along the walls, especially on the upper portions, a whitish, age-stained plaster coating covers the aged bricks in large irregular shapes, having fallen off or been damaged over the course of centuries. On both sides of the nave, there are many uneven holes in the walls, some fist-sized and some much larger, resulting from weathering, vandals, and treasure hunters from previous centuries. Light enters in a stream from a window above the main entrance door to the church, and from a window on the eastern wall about 30 feet in front of the entrance. The long, narrow space of the nave leads the visitor's sight forward to the south end of the church, the sanctuary, which rises at the top of 5 adobe brick stairs at the front of church. The stairs are covered by an arched entrance and flanked on the right side of the nave by the simple reconstructed base of the pulpit, protruding from the wall as an inverted triangular structure about 4 feet off the floor.",

    "audioDescription": "Throughout the orchard, grass and other short vegetation covers the ground and is punctuated with a variety of about 100 fruit trees planted equidistantly about 12 feet away from each other. Wide, open rows invite visitors to explore the space, and benches are located on the eastern side of the orchard providing a spot to rest. Some trees, such as the peaches, are widely branched and about 10-15 feet tall, while others like the pomegranate and fig are more compact and about 4-8 feet tall. Also present are plum trees, standing about 10-12 feet tall and displaying a narrower growth habit along with their characteristic purple/black bark. Each tree is circled at its base by raised, black edging that holds brown, pecan shell mulch and a few small white irrigation spouts, giving the orchard a neat and well-tended appearance. Also staked into the ground at the base of each tree is a metal marker noting the tree species.",

The mission records are a treasure trove of information, but require some skill to interpret as they were handwritten with quill pen in now-antique Spanish.

The protection of its thick walls offered welcome shelter for gold-seekers on their way to California, and for Mexican and U.S. soldiers and cowboys. These tired travelers recorded their stays not in mission record books, but on the walls. The darkened ceiling and many names are proof of the numerous fires made, dinners cooked, and stories told in this space.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "An arched doorway on the east side of the sanctuary opens to a ramp leading down to the sacristy. This is a dark room about 15 by 15 feet square. The room has a high, barrel-vaulted ceiling and a small doorway leading to the outside on the east side of the room. An arched window opening to the north also lets light into dark space. Four steps with deep treads made of fired brick lead from the Sacristy floor to a gated entranced to the pulpit. The sacristy floors are the same dark red, polished bricks that are present in the rest of the church. The walls are made of adobe bricks and they exhibit similar deterioration as those in other areas of the church, with patches of once white, now weathered and stained plaster interspersed with unprotected grey adobe brick. The vaulted ceiling appears supported on its east-west axis by an arched beam, covered in plaster, now faded and grey. Smudged with charcoal black and grey soot, the ceiling shows the stain from many campfires built in post mission times by soldiers, travelers and others seeking shelter here. Traces of some of these visitors are seen in the signatures, dates and other graffiti etched into the brick and plaster in numerous places in the sacristy.",

Here, the priest, dressed in brightly-colored vestments, led the Mass. During the most sacred parts of the ceremony, he sang the words facing toward the altar, his back to the congregation.

The practice of kneeling, standing, and then kneeling again, during a ceremony conducted in primarily foreign tongues, was no doubt confusing for some. Eventually, however, these strange customs became familiar and blended with the spiritual and religious beliefs of the indigenous communities. Today, many O’odham and Yoeme people practice this uniquely intertwined religious tradition. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Stepping up the stairs through the archway to the sacristy, the altar rises on the back wall in the center of the burnished red brick floor. The altar is a simple, rectangular adobe brick structure about 5 feet wide, 3 feet high and 3 feet deep. The high domed ceiling rises approximately 40 feet above the floor. The ceiling plaster color is varying shades of white, cream and grey with remnants of black stenciling. The walls are made of adobe brick which are greatly deteriorated with dozens of holes of varying sizes. In scattered areas, weathered plaster covers the adobe brick walls in large patches. One of the most captivating visual features of the sanctuary is the faded, decorative painting that can be dimly seen on each side of the altar. The decorative motif shows red painted draperies drawn back on each side of a central dome. On the wall behind the altar is a black painting of rectangular blocks. Faded floral garlands are also stenciled around the upper walls of the sanctuary above a row of painted brown-red picture frames. On opposite sides of the arched entry are faded paintings representing the holy communion – a chalice with grapes and a sheaf of wheat. Still visible in many places just below the faded orange colored circular cornice or bottom \"edge\" of the dome is a repeated pattern of small black squares, painted to appear as a \"trompe l'oeil, or \"optical illusion\" architectural feature appearing as square stones holding up the cornice.",

Although this supplemental water source has supported the return of the endangered Gila topminnow (<em>Poeciliopsis occidentalis</em>), it is not safe for human consumption. Avoid contact.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Santa Cruz river runs from south to north in a winding channel about 30 feet wide. The flow passes very slowly and the water is shallow. The river banks are eroded and appear as if the water flow increases and decreases frequently. Lining the banks on both sides of the river are towering cottonwood trees, hundreds of feet tall, creating a tunnel of tree canopy above the river. On the river banks, branches, leaves and other debris are scattered in the understory along with some grasses and other moisture-loving vegetation.",

    "audioDescription": "The storeroom building is a roughly rectangular, roofless adobe structure located slightly northeast of the Franciscan church. Approaching the structure from the outside, it appears as a simple brown, plastered adobe structure with wavy, jagged walls of uneven heights. The front wall disappears to the right into a mound of grass-covered ground. Visible through the doorway is a steep plaster-coated staircase. Some light shines down into the open, roofless structure. As you enter the storeroom, the wide bank of 8 very steep stairs faces the doorway and rises all the way to the top of the wall. A nearby sign asks visitors to refrain from walking on the stairs. Attached to the stairs on both the left and right, sits a tall, rectangular, chest-high, plaster-covered adobe structure that appears much like an ancient counter or shelf. To the right, on the eastern side of the room, the wall is formed into a low adobe bench running the length of this side, with circular indentations on the top of the bench, many holding large, red clay pots. High above the pots near the top of this wall, a circular dark, wooden beam stretches the length of the wall resting on two square adobe pillars that are part of the wall structure. Perpendicular to this beam another beam emerges from the adobe wall stretching across the width of the structure. Another identical beam structure on the other side of the doorway is visible, although there are no pots on the other side of the room. High on the east and west walls, multiple holes are visible in a horizontal line, suggesting where other wooden beams may have previously pierced the adobe walls. On the north and south walls, the main notable features are another chest-high counter or shelf-like adobe square column which sits under a circular indentation or opening in the wall.",

The first of these pits is square, about 5 feet in width and length, extending about 1 foot above ground and about 3 feet below ground. It is made of red brick, but almost completely covered by a beige plaster coating inside and out. Looking down into the vat, the bottom is plaster covered, though chipped and cracked in places. The low above-ground wall is about 1 foot high. Sitting adjacent to this vat, the middle of the 3 vats is a slightly larger rectangular shape constructed of layered red brick with some plaster coating also visible inside. The third vat is the smallest and most shallow, barely rising above the ground with red brick appearing only one layer high above ground, and only about a foot deep. The bottom of this shallow pit is covered with wide, red paving bricks. To the right of the 3 vats, a ditch runs eastward underneath the adjacent walkway. These pits are a visible aspect of the church façade area; however, little about their physical appearance gives any clue to their purpose.",

He led the expedition to California that resulted in the founding of the city of San Francisco in 1776. The expedition included 240 colonists orginally from Sinaloa and Sonora, 63 of whom were living in Tubac. The colonists gathered over 1,000 head of livestock--cattle, horses, and mules--at Tubac for the expedition. The group departed from the presidio on October 23, 1775. <br /> <br /> Tubac Presidio State Historic Park is managed by Arizona State Parks with generous support from volunteers and the Friends of Tubac Presidio and Museum.

Prehistoric people followed the river to trade with neighbors. The O’odham farmed along the river, using the floodplain and low banks to grow crops. Later, missionaries and explorers would rely on these existing networks to colonize the area.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{786b25a4-b8c9-4a00-9eed-84dcbd982fb4}{12}\" paraid=\"1803544016\">In 1775, an expedition of approximately 240 people and nearly a thousand head of livestock followed this river on the first part of a journey that would establish the first European settlement on the San Francisco Bay. The Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail was designated to commemorate this massive and important movement of settlers across the nation. </p> <p paraeid=\"{786b25a4-b8c9-4a00-9eed-84dcbd982fb4}{22}\" paraid=\"1775176081\">Today the Anza Trail preserves this important history while also providing valuable outdoor recreational space. At Tumacácori, it passes through habitat that supports the most diverse migratory bird population outside of the tropics. Hikers, runners, and riders can travel along this route. Even a casual stroll connects visitors to the residents and travelers of history.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "At this intersection, the Anza trail runs north and south. To the east, the trail continues to the river overlook. There is colorful wayside exhibit with information about the Anza expedition commemorated by the intersecting trail. This point marks the junction of trails – to the west, trails lead back to the mission grounds. To the east, the trail leads to the river. The Anza trail runs north and south. A nearby bench invites visitors to rest.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Once it gained its independence from Spain, the new nation of Mexico no longer valued the missions for their original purpose of converting native people into European-style citizens. Priests born in Spain were deported, including Tumacácori’s last resident priest in 1828. The mission families stayed on for another twenty years. For reasons that they did not record, in 1848 the residents of Tumacácori moved away, the women carrying their precious <em>santos </em>(saint statues) on their backs in burden baskets to San Xavier del Bac. They left behind their church, cemetery, fields, and homes.<br /> <br /> With the Gadsden Purchase in 1854, Tumacácori became part of the United States. The U.S. reservation system eventually limited the legal territory of the O’odham to five sister reservations: the San Xavier and Tohono (desert) O’odham, and Gila River, Salt River, and Ak-Chin Pima (river) nations.<br /> <br /> Today, the Tohono O’odham and Pima are known for their beautiful basketry, woven using materials collected from the deserts and rivers of their homeland. The Yoeme (Yaqui) are famous for their carvings and religious dance, the Apache for their beadwork. Many still speak the languages of their ancestors.<br /> <br /> After hundreds of years of mixing, marrying, creating new families, and blending traditions, a new people emerged: the <em>mestizaje </em>of Mexico.

    "audioDescription": "The ramada is a square-shaped, open-air pergola or roofed shelter with no walls. It measures about 12 feet by 12 feet in size, and sits in the open community plaza area northeast of the visitor center building and southeast of the church. The roof is made of ocotillo covered with a thin layer of board wood and supported by a metal, mesh roof frame. The roof is held up by posts of thick tree branches. The roof provides plenty of shade beneath the ramada. The floor is the same as the surrounding open community plaza, mostly dirt with scattered low-growing vegetation. This rustic structure provides shelter to a few rustic, wooden tables with metallic tops that form a serving counter on one side, and on the other side a hand-made cement enclosure with a comal (flat surface for cooking tortillas). The rustic, outdoor oven appears to have been used recently and is stained with black soot. Burned wood charcoal is present under the comal. Next to the oven sits a stack of cut wood and sticks, and inside the cooking ramada sits a chair.",

These trees, about 15-20 feet high form a canopy along the trail, and are seen everywhere in this landscape. Growing alongside the mesquite trees are also hackberry trees and elderberries. Beneath and around the mesquite trees are a variety of grasses and low-growing forbs, and a few types of thorned bushes.",

The top wall of the tower has a jagged and unfinished look, although the roman arch of the belfry remains. A metal bell hangs by a rope from a weather-worn beam under the arch of the open belfry. Open sky shows through as a background to the bell in the rectangular arched opening of the belfry. To each side of the central, open belfry opening is a rectangular statue niche with a cracked, beige plaster shell motif inlaid at the arched top of each niche. A number of small, square, evenly spaced holes are visible across the width of the bell tower.

    "audioDescription": "Built from earthen-colored adobe bricks, the church facade reflects the preserved yet not restored look of a nineteenth century Spanish colonial church. The facade shows both original adobe brick, as well as some of the smooth, beige, plaster coating. On the left, an arched espadaña or pediment made of bricks frames a large, darkened doorway with arched wooden doors. The front door spans about one eighth of the length of the structure. The large doorway is symmetrically framed on each side by a pair of columns which together hold up a cornice supporting two pairs of additional pillars above which frame the large second-story window. These pillars are slightly closer together than those below. All pillars have Egyptian style capitals at their tops, and between each pair of pillars is an empty niche holding a round, pendant-shaped statue pedestal and framed above by a pointed, Moorish-style arch. Above the second floor, on the left side of the church, the top part of the facade rises to form a semicircular shape which holds atop its center, a small, round, plaster-covered finial anchoring a simple wooden cross. On the right side of the building, there is large window on the first floor to the right of the doorway. Above it, at various places in the otherwise plain facade, there are a few round and square holes in the building, the diameter of wooden beams, which were once used to hold scaffolding. Above these, a rectangular, brick bell tower, the tallest part of the church, rises higher than the left side of the church facade. Its central belfry opening is framed above by an arch and bordered on the left and right by oval-shaped niches.",

It is likely that men and women were separated by sex, as was the colonial manner. Here, indigenous people learned and practiced new religious traditions in new languages. They adopted new deities and established a new worldview under the direction of the padres. In this space, there were tears, both happy and sad. There was loss, celebration, learning, and change. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b34dbc52-88af-485d-b512-35b4e2ee37fe}{132}\" paraid=\"1768517039\">Shortly after the residents left in 1848, the roof timbers were taken by local settlers for construction elsewhere. For the next seventy years, the nave was exposed and heavily damaged by weather. Looters, seeking Jesuit treasure that never existed, dug holes in the walls and floors.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "As you walk into the main church entrance down the entrance ramp, you enter the Nave. This is the long, narrow body, or main corridor of the church measuring about 100 feet in length and 20 feet in width. A narrow, arched adobe brick doorway rises to the right, leading through a vaulted tunnel to the baptistry. Near the arched main entrance to the church, there are two columns, one on each side of the nave, that rise from the floor to about 10 feet in height, now diminished to adobe ruin. Two more columns, closer to the front of the church, can be seen on each side of the Nave rising to the ceiling from a tapered decorative base about 10 feet above the floor. Each column holds a tall, narrow niche with a corbel or statuary shelf, which is now empty. The floor of the nave is made of burnished, dark red bricks. Two side altars line each wall of the nave along the length of the room. Each of these altars is now a rectangular mound of adobe brick ruins, rising from the floor to varying heights between a few inches off the floor to about 4 feet, and protected from visitors by stanchions made of wooden posts laced with thick rope. Tall, narrow arched statue niches are recessed into the walls above the altars. A few colonial style, unadorned, dark wooden benches line the walls between the altars. The walls are made of exposed, time-worn adobe bricks that are grey-brown in color. In some places along the walls, especially on the upper portions, a whitish, age-stained plaster coating covers the aged bricks in large irregular shapes, having fallen off or been damaged over the course of centuries. On both sides of the nave, there are many uneven holes in the walls, some fist-sized and some much larger, resulting from weathering, vandals, and treasure hunters from previous centuries. Light enters in a stream from a window above the main entrance door to the church, and from a window on the eastern wall about 30 feet in front of the entrance. The long, narrow space of the nave leads the visitor's sight forward to the south end of the church, the sanctuary, which rises at the top of 5 adobe brick stairs at the front of church. The stairs are covered by an arched entrance and flanked on the right side of the nave by the simple reconstructed base of the pulpit, protruding from the wall as an inverted triangular structure about 4 feet off the floor.",

The mission records are a treasure trove of information, but require some skill to interpret as they were handwritten with quill pen in now-antique Spanish.

The protection of its thick walls offered welcome shelter for gold-seekers on their way to California, and for Mexican and U.S. soldiers and cowboys. These tired travelers recorded their stays not in mission record books, but on the walls. The darkened ceiling and many names are proof of the numerous fires made, dinners cooked, and stories told in this space.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "An arched doorway on the east side of the sanctuary opens to a ramp leading down to the sacristy. This is a dark room about 15 by 15 feet square. The room has a high, barrel-vaulted ceiling and a small doorway leading to the outside on the east side of the room. An arched window opening to the north also lets light into dark space. Four steps with deep treads made of fired brick lead from the Sacristy floor to a gated entranced to the pulpit. The sacristy floors are the same dark red, polished bricks that are present in the rest of the church. The walls are made of adobe bricks and they exhibit similar deterioration as those in other areas of the church, with patches of once white, now weathered and stained plaster interspersed with unprotected grey adobe brick. The vaulted ceiling appears supported on its east-west axis by an arched beam, covered in plaster, now faded and grey. Smudged with charcoal black and grey soot, the ceiling shows the stain from many campfires built in post mission times by soldiers, travelers and others seeking shelter here. Traces of some of these visitors are seen in the signatures, dates and other graffiti etched into the brick and plaster in numerous places in the sacristy.",

The practice of kneeling, standing, and then kneeling again, during a ceremony conducted in primarily foreign tongues, was no doubt confusing for some. Eventually, however, these strange customs became familiar and blended with the spiritual and religious beliefs of the indigenous communities. Today, many O’odham and Yoeme people practice this uniquely intertwined religious tradition. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Stepping up the stairs through the archway to the sacristy, the altar rises on the back wall in the center of the burnished red brick floor. The altar is a simple, rectangular adobe brick structure about 5 feet wide, 3 feet high and 3 feet deep. The high domed ceiling rises approximately 40 feet above the floor. The ceiling plaster color is varying shades of white, cream and grey with remnants of black stenciling. The walls are made of adobe brick which are greatly deteriorated with dozens of holes of varying sizes. In scattered areas, weathered plaster covers the adobe brick walls in large patches. One of the most captivating visual features of the sanctuary is the faded, decorative painting that can be dimly seen on each side of the altar. The decorative motif shows red painted draperies drawn back on each side of a central dome. On the wall behind the altar is a black painting of rectangular blocks. Faded floral garlands are also stenciled around the upper walls of the sanctuary above a row of painted brown-red picture frames. On opposite sides of the arched entry are faded paintings representing the holy communion – a chalice with grapes and a sheaf of wheat. Still visible in many places just below the faded orange colored circular cornice or bottom \"edge\" of the dome is a repeated pattern of small black squares, painted to appear as a \"trompe l'oeil, or \"optical illusion\" architectural feature appearing as square stones holding up the cornice.",

As the monsoon season approached, families would move to locations where shallow irrigation channels delivered rainwater to their fields.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{d95ce187-fd8b-4f96-8174-0f8c9ce461b6}{15}\" paraid=\"1374705230\">The O’odham living along streams channeled river water directly into rich fields of corn, beans, squash, agave, and melons. </p> <p paraeid=\"{d95ce187-fd8b-4f96-8174-0f8c9ce461b6}{25}\" paraid=\"693132084\">With the Spanish came European ideas of irrigation. The fired adobe structure before you is part of the <em>acequia madre</em>, the main irrigation channel that brought water to the mission from the Santa Cruz River a mile or more to the south. The narrowed end could be closed, raising the elevation of the water to serve various functions. As a <em>compuerta</em>, or diversion box, it turned water from the ditch into the orchard to the east. As a holding tank, it was convenient for filling <em>ollas</em>, earthen jars, to carry water back to the houses for drinking and cooking. Because it had a polished, red surface, it was probably also used as a <em>lavandería</em>, or place for washing clothes and dishes, and possibly even bathing.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The visible remnant of the acequia or irrigation ditch appears as a roughly rectangular depression in the earth about 10 feet long, 4 feet wide and 2 feet deep. Looking down into the structure, the fired adobe brick walls appear like crumbling, grey, retaining walls that would have once held water in a rectangular pool. The east and west long sides of the rectangular acequia are made of about 6 courses of adobe brick rising at a 90 degree angle from the dusty, dirt floor. The shorter north and south ends are comprised of soil and slope up gradually to meet the surrounding surface of the ground. On the north end of the structure, the sloped opening to the surrounding surface of the ground is a narrow funnel created by a short, diagonally curved brick dam extending from the adjacent east side partially across the width of the structure, leaving a narrow, upwardly sloping, rocky soil-covered opening to the surrounding ground. Where the edge of the acequia meets the surrounding ground, a row of reddish brown bricks forms a flat surface flush with the ground and the wall of the structure. Some of these edging pavers are covered with a protective plaster coating. A faint remnant of the historic ditch’s patch remains visible on either side of the rectangular structure. A trail follows its route downstream.",

    "audioDescription": "An expansive square-shaped outdoor area surrounded by an adobe wall opens before you. About 75 feet in length on each side, this thick adobe wall encloses the large space and gives an appearance of a park-like area. About 8 feet tall and 2 feet thick, the cemetery walls have a smooth, brownish-beige plaster coating. The wall is a few feet higher on the northeast portion of the wall and it is also punctuated by visible bullet holes in this section. The top of the wall is covered by a protective layer of brick and plaster that overhangs the wall slightly. Spaced at about every twenty feet near the top of the wall are 14 hollowed, arched niches. In the west Cemetery wall, the eye is drawn to a brown, painted wooden door, covered by a triangular brick transom that leads to the church grounds on the northwest side of the church. Mountains rise in the distance behind the west wall. The center of the cemetery is mostly an open space with gravelly soil and very sparse, grassy vegetation. Three gracefully branched mesquite trees sit in the central part of the space and one occupies the northeast corner providing some shade in these areas. Wooden crosses marking graves in the northern part of cemetery provide a background to a larger, beige plastered grave monument shaped like a small coffin, topped on one end by a painted wrought iron cross decorated with a metal monument name plate and flowers. The name plate displays the name Juanita Alegria, born in 1915 and laid to rest in 1916. The mortuary chapel is a roofless, circular building about 16 feet in diameter and 15 feet high standing near the entrance to the Cemetery. The outer walls of the building appear to have small, decorative pieces of fired red brick stuck into the adobe walls. The upper portion of the wall has a plaster covering over this pebbled adobe. About a foot below the top of the building, a row of horizontally laid, fired and burnished red bricks create a decorative line around the building, and above this row of bricks at the top of the building is a cornice made of curved, fired and burnished bricks laid vertically in a decorative pattern. Outside of the south side of the mortuary wall, a colonial-style wooden cross with the name Soto etched on it sits atop one end of a grave-shaped mound of stones. Around the curve of the building to the west, the mortuary building is open to visitors via an arched doorway about 4 feet wide facing the western cemetery gate. Entering through this doorway reveals the 3 foot thickness of the mortuary walls. Inside, the circular, roofless view above opens to the sky and is framed by the decorative brick cornice design at the top of the building. Below, gravelly soil over concrete comprises the floor. The mortuary walls, like other adobe brick structures at Tumacácori, reveal a view of both grey adobe bricks, and a patchy combination of various brownish-colored plaster coatings, many etched with cracks. Near the top of the wall, about 5 feet from each side of the door, are circular openings to the outside that are about 4 inches in diameter and give the appearance of small tunnels in the thick walls.",

The convento was the operational part of the mission. It functioned as a shared, community workspace and governmental center. It would have been alive with the sounds of people talking, working, and moving about. The rooms aligned in a U-shape around a central courtyard. Along the north wing, where a long raised mound is still visible today, archeological evidence suggests a kitchen, ironworker's shop, carpentry shop, weaving room, leather shop, and grain grinding mill. The storeroom is all that remains of the west row of the convento. The south wing included the priest’s quarters, other office spaces, and an arched entrance to the interior courtyard. The central courtyard was likely planted with trees, ornamental flowers, and medicinal and edible plants. An arcade – a covered walkway lined with arches and built-in benches – ran in front of the rooms. It would have been a shady, inviting, and pleasant place to meet and greet one’s neighbors. The arcade and courtyard garden of the visitor center were built to replicate this experience.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{d2ad0579-e333-4f41-8140-8efe89593b31}{114}\" paraid=\"1272546086\">For its O’odham residents, the mission’s convento may have been a place where tradition and change clashed. A host of new tools, technologies, and food sources had become available. Instead of yucca or cotton fibers, a weaver could use wool. Instead of bone or stone, one could craft tools from metal. But adopting these changes came at a social and cultural cost.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The convento complex refers to the open square shaped building and courtyard area to the east of the Franciscan church and storeroom. Now, with the convento building ruins mostly underground, it appears as an open space about half the size of a football field. In the central open area, the most notable feature is the low-to-the-ground plaster-covered remains of the foundation of the older Jesuit church. On the north, a low berm of sparsely vegetated earth runs east-west along the length of the area marking the covered ruins of the row of rooms that formed the north wall of the courtyard. To the south is the still-standing remnant ruins of part of southern courtyard row of rooms, now known as the convento fragment, or convento ruins.",

It wasn’t until 1768 that Tumacácori became a cabecera – a mission that housed a resident priest. This likely caused a significant disturbance for the O’odham of Tumacácori. With only occasional visits from the priest, they could openly continue their traditional religious and social practices. Now, under the watchful eye of a resident priest, they had to conceal those practices in order to model Spanish and Catholic values.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff2d1174-089a-4e83-b380-b7a346cec46d}{72}\" paraid=\"1213708685\">This structure continued to serve the Tumacácori community long after the mission era. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, this remaining section of the convento served as a residence, a school, and later housed the museum of the fledgling Tumacácori National Monument. A herringbone-pattern floor currently duplicates and protects the original floor beneath one room. More than any other structure here it has seen many preservation techniques tried to protect it. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "This is a rectangular, walled, roofless ruin of this structure made of adobe brick and covered with a smooth brown plaster. The outside corners of the convento fragment are rounded, and on the western side of the structure there is a wooden-framed doorway extending about 1 foot above the surrounding plaster walls. Entrance via this doorway is blocked by a railing; however, one of the interior rooms is visible from the outside of this doorway and appears empty with floor of sandy, gravel ground sparsely covered with vegetation. Veined with cracks, the roofless adobe walls are quite uneven at the top and covered by a flat row of thin, red paving-type bricks. The structure's southern facing wall is held in place by four bulky, tapezoidal-shaped buttresses also covered with light brown adobe plaster. There is a horizontally rectangular, weathered wood-framed, double window opening to the right side of the four buttresses, and a single window opening to the left of the buttresses. In the center two buttresses is a worn, gray wooden doorway. Viewed from the inside, the structure is divided into two rectangular rooms separated by a worn wooden door frame. In the room in front of and to the east of the entrance door, one of the primary visible features is the rust-colored, dusty remains of a herringbone brick floor. The other notable feature is the rounded-cornered, traditional adobe fireplace with a conical chimney built into the corner of the room. A horizontally rectangular, double window opening made of weather-worn wood is located on the north side of the room near the fireplace, and it offers a view of the Franciscan church to the northwest, and the spacious church grounds to the north marked with the low-walled outline of the remains of the Jesuit church. The view is framed distantly to the north by a low berm of grass-covered earth that contains the buried remains of the north side of the convento structure.",

A soil mixture would be mixed with water into a thick paste and then pressed into rectangular wooden forms and left in the sun to dry.

Many tons of limestone rocks were gathered and carted to the mission’s lime kilns. A fire was built under a metal grill and high temperatures “cooked” the limestone over several days until it could be hammered into a fine powder. That powder was then made into a paste using water and sand, which was later troweled onto on the exposed adobe brick walls. </p> <p paraeid=\"{b502ef00-846f-4aac-811f-88c57f6f33ad}{219}\" paraid=\"686887388\">Gathering stone, mixing plaster, and coating the large structures required the labor of many workers. For the O’odham, the kiln probably represented a significant change in their lifestyle. Previously, they lived with a changing landscape, in buildings that changed with it. The European worldview prioritized permanence and defiance of natural weathering. This shift would shape the way that people across the region live and think for centuries to come. </p>",

As you look down into the underground interior of the lime kiln, the walls appear to be made of dried, brown, adobe brick with a layer of red colored bricks at the bottom about 5 feet down.

    "audioDescription": "The storeroom building is a roughly rectangular, roofless adobe structure located slightly northeast of the Franciscan church. Approaching the structure from the outside, it appears as a simple brown, plastered adobe structure with wavy, jagged walls of uneven heights. The front wall disappears to the right into a mound of grass-covered ground. Visible through the doorway is a steep plaster-coated staircase. Some light shines down into the open, roofless structure. As you enter the storeroom, the wide bank of 8 very steep stairs faces the doorway and rises all the way to the top of the wall. A nearby sign asks visitors to refrain from walking on the stairs. Attached to the stairs on both the left and right, sits a tall, rectangular, chest-high, plaster-covered adobe structure that appears much like an ancient counter or shelf. To the right, on the eastern side of the room, the wall is formed into a low adobe bench running the length of this side, with circular indentations on the top of the bench, many holding large, red clay pots. High above the pots near the top of this wall, a circular dark, wooden beam stretches the length of the wall resting on two square adobe pillars that are part of the wall structure. Perpendicular to this beam another beam emerges from the adobe wall stretching across the width of the structure. Another identical beam structure on the other side of the doorway is visible, although there are no pots on the other side of the room. High on the east and west walls, multiple holes are visible in a horizontal line, suggesting where other wooden beams may have previously pierced the adobe walls. On the north and south walls, the main notable features are another chest-high counter or shelf-like adobe square column which sits under a circular indentation or opening in the wall.",

The low above-ground wall is about 1 foot high. Sitting adjacent to this vat, the middle of the 3 vats is a slightly larger rectangular shape constructed of layered red brick with some plaster coating also visible inside. The third vat is the smallest and most shallow, barely rising above the ground with red brick appearing only one layer high above ground, and only about a foot deep. The bottom of this shallow pit is covered with wide, red paving bricks. To the right of the 3 vats, a ditch runs eastward underneath the adjacent walkway. These pits are a visible aspect of the church façade area; however, little about their physical appearance gives any clue to their purpose.",

Its design, like that of the adjacent visitor center, was inspired by other missions in the Pimería Alta. Several agencies were involved, but the original plantings were carried out by sixteen young men employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Three native mesquite trees were left in place and continue to grow in the garden. The olive, ornamental pomegranate, and monk’s pepper trees survive to this day. When the original apricot tree had to be removed, a seed from that tree provided its replacement.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Upon entering the courtyard garden, visitors are reminded of a Spanish colonial courtyard garden refuge. Vine-covered garden walls formed by the surrounding buildings enclose the central space which is often full of color with the bright greens of the plants’ foliage and a variety of flower colors. In the center of the garden is a fountain pool with turquoise-colored plaster/cement interior bordered by an octagonal pool wall with a brick bench-top. The fountain is filled with water and features a cream-colored fountain-head scalloped basin held up by a graceful pedestal. Circling the central fountain and various planting beds are garden paths made of brick pavers laid in a herringbone design. One of these paths also leads to the restrooms. The garden plants exhibit a wide and beautiful diversity of form, shape and size, and include a number of trees that provide shade to visitors. The plants displayed include both some local desert species with characteristic spiny or succulent leaves, as well as European species. Plant markers note the genus, species and common names of plants. Low adobe-style benches on the north and south sides of the fountain offer multiple places to sit. Warm yellow painted arches of the main park building’s stuccoed walls are also visible.",

All aspects of daily life would be subject to transformation – food, language, clothing, agriculture, and religion. In the mission model you can see adobe buildings for residences and workshops, agricultural lands, cattle, and the main irrigation ditch. A mission community could be considered a residential training academy where indigenous people learned and adopted a new way of life. The plan was for the missionary priest to move on after ten years, when the community could sustain itself. In fact, more than 100 years would pass before the turn of the 19th century when the first bricks would be laid for the mission church you see today. <br /> <br /> On October 17, 1775, Father Pedro Font held mass at the mission as Juan Bautista de Anza marshalled his forces at Tubac. The mission also contributed a small herd of cattle to the expedition.<br /> <br /> Tumacácori went from being an O’odham village to a frontier <em>visita </em>(satellite mission) to a <em>cabecera </em>(headquarters mission). Its people changed as well. The O’odham became known as the “Pima” and the “Papago,” and their lands the <em>Pimería Alta</em> (land of the upper Pima). They were baptized with Spanish names, given Spanish-style clothing, and assigned Spanish jobs. They tended to domestic livestock rather than hunting wild game, and irrigated fruit trees that came from oceans away. </p> <p paraeid=\"{dfb4ab41-585f-4bba-bb28-8ef886f8a288}{11}\" paraid=\"325370160\">Today, the O’odham people still carry with them the legacy of colonization. Because they did not record their stories in a written language, exploring their history requires empathy, inference, and respect for O’odham oral tradition. The descendants of mission-era communities are still living all around us.<br /> <br /> The visitor center is a National Historic Landmark and includes a museum. Visits to Calabasas and Guevavi can be arranged at the park's headquarters. A trail connects Tumacácori and Tubac along the Santa Cruz river through beautiful riparian habitat containing cottonwoods and mesquite. Look for several large ramadas enclosing interpretive panels about Anza's Expeditions and the natural history of the area.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Sitting in the middle of an open alcove corner room is a small-scale model of the mission grounds encased in a plexiglass display case measuring about 4 feet by 4 feet. The model provides an aerial view of the grounds as they may have appeared during mission times. Miniature figures portray the major elements of the Tumacácori mission: The Franciscan church flanked on the north by the cemetery, storeroom, and on the northeast by buried ruins of workshops in the courtyard arcade, and the south by the convento complex arcade area and courtyard walls. Further northeast of the church courtyard area, the model displays miniature renditions of the acequia or irrigation canals, and the orchard. This mission model display is the centerpiece of the room you are standing in and offers a small-scale view of what the grounds may once have looked like. This view contrasts with the scene of the actual Tumacácori church and grounds visible through large open, arched windows of this room. Today’s Tumacácori is now in various states of preservation, stabilization and ruin.",

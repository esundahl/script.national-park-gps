    "bodyText": "Andersonville National Cemetery began as a burial ground for the nearly 13,000 Union soldiers who died in Camp Sumter military prison during the Civil War. These prisoners of war were buried shoulder to shoulder in trenches. In 1865, after the end of the Civil War, the Union Army came and established the site as a national cemetery. Today over 20,000 of our nation's military men and women, representing nearly every American conflict, rest in honor on these hallowed grounds. Andersonville is the only national cemetery managed by the National Park Service that is still open and continues to provide burial services to American military service members, veterans, and their families.",
    "audioDescription": "A low, red brick wall encloses about 26 acres of landscaped turf interspersed with large trees. Thousands of small white headstones, inches apart, mark the graves of soldiers buried in trenches. Larger white marble headstones spaced further apart mark the graves of other military service members. The paved road leads up to a circle with a large flag pole flying a US and a POW/MIA flag. The landscape is interspersed with large marble and granite monuments honoring the dead.",

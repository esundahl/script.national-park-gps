    "bodyText": "The Alvino House is the oldest intact adobe structure in Big Bend National Park. The building represents the everyday life of the many families who lived and farmed along the Rio Grande. This building was constructed around 1901 by Cipriano Hernandez, one of the Hispanic settlers who farmed near Castolon. He raised vegetables and grain for sale to the mining camps. Corn, beans, squash, tomatoes, and melons were common crops grown by families along the Rio Grande. <br /> <br /> As the population grew, Hernandez enlarged his home and used the space to open a small store where he sold supplies to his neighbors. In 1918, Alvino Ybarra moved into the house. In 1922, Alvino married Teofila Luna and raised three sons and three daughters in the house. Even in this remote area, education was a priority, so the Ybarra children attended school for four months in Castolon, then four months in Terlingua, as there were not enough teachers to keep both schools open for an entire school year.<br /> <br /> Alvino earned his living by operating the engines that powered the cotton gin and the water pump that brought water from the Rio Grande to irrigate the fields. He worked from 5 a.m. to sundown, earning premium wages for the area of $1.50 per day. This was further supplemented by working as a La Harmonia Company tenant farmer. The Alvino House also served as a civil center for area residents. Alvino’s family set aside a room as a religious shrine, where a priest performed masses, baptisms, and weddings several times a year. The community also celebrated holidays at the Alvino House, coming together as friends and family.<br /> <br /> Teofila Ybarra died in 1936, but Alvino continued living here until 1957, when he moved to Alpine. Several of their grandchildren still live in the Big Bend region.The Alvino House affords a close look at a recently repaired and stabilized adobe structure. Adobe masons from Santa Helena, Mexico used their expertise to restore this structure in 1994. The men manufactured adobe bricks on the site, shored up the sagging roof, and repaired the walls. The berm around the foundation of the structure was built in 2008 to protect it from floodwaters.",
    "audioDescription": "A large one-story adobe house with a flat roof sits in a low area near the paved road. Other historic buildings of adobe and wood dating from the 1920s are nearby, as well as a temporary building housing a concession store. The surrounding desert vegetation includes creosotebush, cacti, ocotillo, and mesquite trees.",

Swift, powerful floodwaters will cut down through any kind of bedrock, but the tuff is better able to resist the widening effects of sideward erosion.\" To the right of the exhibit panel is a fenced viewing platform on the rim of the canyon.

Arroyos are animal highways between mountain and desert habitats, providing pockets of moisture and dense underbrush for concealment or ambush. Here predator meets prey. At daybreak the arroyo grows still again. A peccary’s cloven hoof prints and other tracks may be the only evidence of animals passing by. To observe nocturnal activity, drive slowly and look for shining eyes. Stop at a pullout, cut your lights, and listen. Rarely seen even by long-time Big Bend residents, mountain lions are most active at night. Deer, skunks, and peccaries (javelinas) are their favorite prey.\"",

This fluvial system deposited the sands and muds that created these colorful ancient soils. Fossils and bones of ancient animals have been found throughout the park where these colorful soils exist. This was also a time of great change for life on Earth. Around 65 million years ago, dinosaurs went extinct, making way for the rise of mammals.",

Looking into the wide drainage below the wayside, one sees cream-colored clay hills with bands of yellow, orange, purple, red, and white. Beyond the drainage is the imposing bulk of Maverick Mountain. Text for the Badlands Wayside: The thin layer of gravel at your feet rests on colorful layers of slippery bentonite clay. Because bentonite swells when wet, exposed badlands slopes tend to slump away along fracture lines, collapsing the canyon back toward its rims. Notice the mounds of slump material at the base of the painted hills. The dry streambed in the canyon floor is more typical of desert erosion. After sudden storms in the mountains, flash floods roar down the channel, carving the canyon deeper and deeper. Immediately after a rain, the banded clays and mineral oxides have darker, more dramatic hues.",

The beginning of the trail follows the Blue Creek drainage towards the mountains. As you climb, the trail passes through open grassland and eventually the pine woodlands of the Chisos Mountains. <br /> The Blue Creek trail ends at the junction with the Laguna Meadow Trail. From there, it's another 3.75 miles down to the parking area in the Chisos Basin, or a return of 5.5 miles.<br /> <br /> You can hike this trail either direction—starting in the mountains and hiking down to Homer Wilson Ranch or starting at the ranch and hiking up. It's best if you have two vehicles and can leave one at either end of the trail.<br /> <br /> For a pleasant day trip, walk up the Blue Creek drainage to the red rocks and return (about 3 miles round-trip, with 240 feet elevation gain). This short hike is particularly interesting for birders, butterfliers, wildflower enthusiasts, photographers, and geologists. <h3>Accessibility</h3> The lower part of the Blue Creek Trail is a sandy, rocky wash. Watch for rock cairns along the way. The trail climbs out of the wash at several points and the cairns help you locate entrance and exit points. The trail narrows and becomes steep and rocky as you ascend into the mountains.<br /> <br /> Parking for several vehicles is available at the trailhead. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed, or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail. <h4> </h4>",

A walk along the Rio Grande leads to the entrance of a magnificent limestone gorge that splits the Sierra del Carmen Mountains. Along the way, look for ancient fossils that existed when this area was under an ocean, and pre-historic grinding holes that indigenous inhabitants used in food production.<br /> <br /> This area is also a great place for scenic photography. The colors on the Sierra del Carmen at sunset are well worth the journey. During summer months, it is best to explore the canyon in the mornings, since daytime temperatures often exceed 110 degrees. Water and good footwear are essential items here, and for any hike in the Chihuahuan Desert. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> From the parking lot, this trail climbs a small rise before descending to the Rio Grande. The trail surface is rock and dirt. Once down at river level, the trail transitions to sand and the remainder of the walk is a flat, pleasant stroll along the river. Eventually the high limestone walls and the river prevent further travel and it's time to turn around and head back to the trailhead.<br /> <br /> The paved parking lot provides parking for about 15 vehicles. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Bring plenty of water!</span></em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike.

    "audioDescription": "The trailhead for the Boquillas Canyon Trail is located near the Rio Grande. The tall escarpment directly ahead is the Sierra del Carmen. The canyon walls are about 1200 feet high and are comprised of gray limestone. The trail climbs a small hill, and near the top of the steps are a number of holes in the rock that ancient people used for grinding food. The trail proceeds down the hill and then parallels the river. The trail is composed of sand and river cobbles. Willows and other riparian plants line the river.

Tall cottonwoods—and even a palm tree—mark the location of the spring. At the overlook, you can turn around and retrace your steps to the trailhead, or follow a steep, rocky trail down to the spring itself. From the spring, follow the drainages around to the trailhead. This route is unmarked, so be sure to have a topographic map and some knowledge of wayfinding. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The trail to the spring overlook is a well-marked path. In places, the trail passes over patches of loose rocks and crosses small hills. The trail beyond the overlook is much more difficult and involves climbing down a steep, rocky slope and following sandy washes.<br /> <br /> A paved pull-out at the trailhead offers parking for several vehicles. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail. <h4> </h4>",
    "audioDescription": "At the trailhead is a sign that reads: \"Burro Spring Trail. The Burro Spring Trail leads across the desert to a bluff overlooking a small spring. Large trees and thick vegetation provide evidence of water near or at the surface, and speak to the power of how water can change a landscape. The volcanic geology in this area includes numerous dikes, which force groundwater upward to the surface, creating life-giving desert springs. Desert wildlife seek out water sources such as this. Watch for tracks, scat, and other signs of animals, such as coyote, fox, deer, javelina, jackrabbits and other desert dwellers. Remember to help protect the desert and wildlife by packing out your trash, burying human waste more than 200 yards away, and maintaining a safe distance from animals.\" The gravel trail passes through creosote and prickly-pear scrub on its way towards a valley separating two red-rock mountains.",

    "bodyText": "When you think of Big Bend, do you envision camels? Probably not, but at one time there were in fact camels in the park, or at least what would later become the park. They were brought to Texas in 1856 at the behest of the Secretary of War, one Senator Jefferson Davis, to determine their use for military and other purposes. Two expeditions, one in 1859 and one in 1860 proved the worthiness of these “ships of the desert” in hauling men and freight under the most grueling conditions imaginable. Visit this wayside to find out the rest of the story.",
    "audioDescription": "This exhibit is located next to a pullout on the road between Persimmon Gap and Panther Junction. From the wayside one is looking directly east across a flat, sparsely vegetated desert landscape to a line of mountains roughly 2 miles away. The mountains are split by a canyon, and evidence of a rockfall in 1987 is highlighted on the cliff face to the left. The section of cliff where the rockfall occurred revealed the white color of the limestone rock, and can be seen on clear days from Panther Junction, 24 miles to the south. Text on the wayside: You will probably not see any camels in the park, but they would look perfectly at home in this landscape. In 1859 and 1860, camel caravans passed through Dog Canyon, directly to the east. Convinced that camels could help patrol the new southwest frontier, the U.S. War Department shipped thirty-three camels and their native handlers from North Africa to Texas. Big Bend, with several days' ride between watering holes, offered ideal conditions for the test. Each camel in the 1859 expedition carried more than 400 pounds of equipment, traveled at least 72 hours without water, and survived on the ubiquitous creosotebush that no other stock would eat. The Civil War and a burgeoning railroad brought an end to the camel experiment. Summarizing the camels' performance at Big Bend, Lt. Edward L. Hartz noted that they crossed terrain of the \"most difficult nature\", covering between 20 and 34 miles a day, and in 60% of the time it would have taken men and horses.",

    "bodyText": "The buildings at Castolon are a remnant of Big Bend's pioneer and military history. Castolon experienced a rich cross-cultural mingling, as the Hispanic culture was a melding of Spanish and indigenous peoples of the region. Anglo-American settlers later entered the area, learning survival methods from the previous settlers and forming a bicultural community with the Mexican settlers. These rural families in Big Bend survived in a harsh landscape, compounded by the Mexican Revolution that began in 1910. During this time, bandits from Mexico took advantage of the chaos to raid small border communities, causing some families on both sides of the Rio Grande to abandon their homes.<br /> <br /> A raid on Glenn Springs in 1916 convinced the War Department that federal intervention was necessary for the safety of border communities. Thousands of soldiers were dispatched throughout the Big Bend area. Camp Santa Helena was established at present-day Castolon by U.S. Army troops of the 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> cavalries. Initially a series of tents, work began on a permanent post in 1919, with the first structures completed in 1920. The Mexican Revolution ended in late 1920 and the troops were reassigned elsewhere. The newly completed buildings saw minimal military use. In 1925, La Harmonia Company purchased the abandoned military buildings. La Harmonia Store was moved into the barracks building and an official post office was added to the store's services. The post office closed in 1954. La Harmonia Company was vital to the existence of individual ranchers and the farming families living in the remote villages of Castolon, La Coyota, El Ojito, and Terlingua de Abajo. The store remained in business until 1961, when La Harmonia Company holdings were incoporated into Big Bend National Park.<br /> <br /> Tragedy struck on May 22, 2019, when a fire in Mexico to jumped the Rio Grande. With temperatures around 110 degrees Fahrenheit, the fire spread quickly and showered embers on the shade structures of La Harmonia Store and the historic latrine. Despite valient efforts, structural and wildland fire crews could not safely extinguish the fire before both buildings suffered extensive damage. Luckily, firefighters saved many other buildings, artifacts, vital utilities, and nearby Cottonwood Campground. Although damaged, the buildings remain a rich remnant of Big Bend's pioneer and military past. The National Park Service is consulting with adobe experts, historic architects, and structural engineers to determine whether these structures can be salvaged or rehabilitated. A temporary restroom and concession was added to the area. The visitor center is now housed in the historic Garlick House.",

It emcompasses parts of New Mexico, Texas, and northern Mexico. Big Bend's part of the Chihuahuan Desert is one of the most diverse, with many different life zones supporting an astonishing variety of plants and animals, including 450 species of birds! <br /> There are many ways to observe signs of life in the desert. Footprints of mammals and birds provide clues to the abundance of life in the surrounding area. Look carefully as you make your way down trails or dry washes - you may see signs of animals having dined on plants - evidence of life in what appears to be a foreboding landscape.",
    "audioDescription": "Facing the sign, you are looking towards the southeast, towards Mexico. The high line of cliffs in the distance is the Sierra del Carmen, extending from the park into Mexico. Between where you are standing and the cliffs is low desert, some of the hottest areas in the park during the summer. Widely spaced desert plants, including creosotebush, cacti, and low shrubs dominate the surrounding landscape. This is a great location from which to watch a sunset. The setting sun illuminates the Sierra del Carmen, turning the limestone rock pink, orange, and purple.",

These pillars or \"chimneys\" of rock have been an important landmark over the centuries. The base of the southernmost chimney is marked with pictographs (painted images) and petroglyphs (images carved into the rock) estimated to be from the Archaic and Late prehistoric periods. Remember, do not touch rock art as skin oils can damage them. The area also contains pieces of fence posts and barbed wire, remnants from the ranching period of the park. Beyond the Chimneys, the trail continues for a longer hiking option. The Old Maverick Road is at the end of the trail, 7.5 miles away (one way distance). Continue down this trail, which passes near Pena Spring and Pena Mountain, for these additional desert vistas.\" Beyond the sign, the dirt and gravel trail wanders through a creosote grassland. In the far distance, the stone wall of the chimneys can be seen. Ever further, on the horizon is Santa Elena Canyon.",

It is not uncommon to see tracks and scat of black bear, mountain lion, and gray fox along Chisos Mountains trails. Carmen white-tail deer, rock squirrels, whiptail lizards, spotted towhees, tufted titmice, and Mexican jays are also common in these mountains.<br /> <br /> <strong>The following trails depart from this loction:</strong><br /> Pinnacles Trail to Emory Peak Trail, Boot Canyon, Juniper Canyon Trail and Northeast Rim<br /> Laguna Meadow Trail to South Rim and Blue Creek Trail</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Text on Chisos Mountains Trails sign: \"The volcanic Chisos (chee-sos) Mountains are a world apart from the low Chihuahuan Desert. A mountain island surrounded by a hot desert sea, the Chisos cover more than 40 square miles of forested slopes, rugged canyons, and rocky spires. Hiking trails that leave from this trailhead can reach many of the canyons, ridges, and spectacular views. Safety Precautions: Carry Water There is no water along these trails. Always carry and drink plenty (1 gallon per person per day). Be Prepared Take good footwear, sunscreen, a hat, and a map. Bear and Mountain Lion Country Both live here, but are secretive and rarely seen. Know what to do in the event of a sighting. Do not approach the animal. If it appears aggressive, hold your ground, wave your arms, shout, throw stones, and scare it away. Report all sightings to a park ranger. NEVER RUN. Understand Your Limits You are at high elevation. Pick a trail that suits your abilities. Do not push your party any harder or faster than its weakest member can handle comfortably. When you get tired, rest or turn back. Remember that you are here to enjoy yourself. Destinations: The South Rim A rocky palisade of cliffs perched high above the desert floor. Great for an all-day hike or overnight backpack. Twelve miles round-trip. Elevation gain of 2,000 feet. Emory Peak via Pinnacles Trail A 9-mile, round-trip hike reaches the highest point in Big Bend National Park. Elevation gain of 2,500 feet. Window View An easy .25-mile loop with great views of the Window. Boot Canyon Search for rare birds as you hike through a moist wooded canyon with some of Big Bend’s tallest trees. Ten miles round-trip. Elevation gain of 1,600 feet. The Window Hike down into beautiful wooded canyon to the top of a high pouroff. From here: 5.6 miles round-trip; 980-foot descent. From campground: 4.4 miles round-trip; 500-foot descent.\" Photos: South Rim, Emory Peak, Mexican Jay (Aphelocoma ultramarima), Black Bear (Ursus americanus), and Mountain Lion (Felix concolor) Photo: A grassy mountain meadow with large Juniper trees surrounded by a rocky canyon wall.

Study the shapes of the peaks to make sense of the geologic battleground, this jumble of eruptions and underground flows. Angular blocks like Casa Grande are stratified layers of lava and ash--remnants of flows from nearby volcanoes. Rounded features like Ward Mountain were subterranean domes of magma that became prominent as erosion scraped away thousands of feet of overlying sedimentary layers.\" Beside an image of Ross Maxwell, the text reads: \"Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive commemorates Big Bend's first superintendent, Ross Maxwell, who published classic studies of the area's geology.\"",

A wheelchair accessible sidewalk with a curb cut leads to an information panel that is mounted on a stonework base. Behind the panel are views of several peaks of jagged, red rock that make up the Chisos Mountains. The panel shows a photo of a small mountain valley with desert shrubs and evergreen trees surrounded by taller mountain peaks of bare, pink and tan colored rock. The panel also shows illustrations of Douglas fir, Arizona pine, Piñon pine, Drooping juniper, and Gray oak. Text from sign: Tree Zone The world of trees begins at this elevation. As you ascend the lower mountain slopes, you will enter a woodland of junipers, oaks, and Mexican piñons. If you hike to higher elevations, along the Colima or Pinnacles Trails, you can enter a forest of tall Arizona pines and Douglas fir. Trees thrive in the increased rainfall and cooler daytime temperatures of these peaks, but the growth pattern is not simply a function of altitude. Look for denser thickets along north-facing slopes and in shaded drainages. On sunny, south-facing terrain, grasses dominate and thorny fingers of desert – ocotillo and lechuguilla – sometimes invade. Green Gulch was once covered with forest. Lumbering turned it into grassland, and overgrazing in the early 1940s reduced it to desert scrub. Now protected from human interference, the canyon is becoming a mix of mountain and desert vegetation. Zona de árboles El mundo de los árboles comienza en esta elevación. Mientras asciende las elevaciones de las montañas bajas, entrará en una región arbolada de enebros, robles, piñon mexicanos. Si camina hacia una elevación más alta a lo largo de las sendas Colima y Pinnacles, puede entrar en un bosque de altos pinos Arizona y de pinos Oregón. Los árboles crecen con vigor en las precipitatación acrecentada y en las temperaturas más frescas de estas cumbres, pero la norma de crecimiento no es solo la función de la altitud. Busque los matorrales densos a largo de inclinaciones con orientación al norte y en los drenajes sombreados. En los terrenos asoleados, con inclinación al sud, la grama domina y los dedos espinosos del desierto – ocotillo y lechuguilla – a veces invaden el terreno. Green Gulch estuvo alguna vez cubierto con árboles. La industria maderera lo convirtió en tierra de pastoreo y el apacentar excesivo lo redujo a matorrales del desierto. Ahora protegida de la intervención humana, el cañón se está convirtiéndose en una mezcla de vegetación desértica y montañosa.

    "bodyText": "In the early 1920s, the La Harmonia Company began farming cotton in the floodplain of the Rio Grande. This steam engine was used to pump water from the Rio Grande to irrigate the cotton fields and other crops. The Morse engine was used to run the cotton gin. Originally, cotton was hauled to Marathon to be ginned, which proved costly and impractical. To save money, in 1923, a gin was built in Castolon. Ginning cotton removes the seeds, which decreases the weight and shipping costs.<br /> <br /> In the first year of operation, 146 bales of cotton were ginned from cotton grown by La Harmonia Company tenant farmers. Later, when cotton was found to be a viable crop, farmers from Johnson’s Ranch to Lajitas were bringing their cotton to Castolon to be ginned. In 1925, the gin had its best year with 251 bales. The arrival of the Pink Boll worm in 1927 was the beginning of the end for cotton in the region. By 1942, La Harmonia Company was ginning its last cotton crop of a mere 54 bales.<br /> <br /> This gin stood near Cottonwood Campground until 1978 when a flood swept most of it downstream. The foundation for the warehouse and remnant scraps of metal are still visible near the amphitheater.",

In 1922, businessman Wayne Cartledge began to sow that high-dollar commercial crop in these river-bottom fields. Cartledge also introduced steam and gas-powered irrigation pumps that boosted his harvests. After 1923, he increased the value of his cotton by “ginning” it before he sold it- that is, by mechanically separating the tiny seeds from the fibers. By 1942, mounting costs and falling prices ended La Harmonia’s cotton venture. Only the machines you see here today are left to remind us of this foray into large-scale farming.\" Spanish translation on sign: Bonanza algodonera Antes de la década de los 1920 nadie jamás cultivaba el algodón en este sector del río Bravo del Norte. En 1922 el empresario Wayne Cartledge empezó a sembrar este provechoso cultivo comercial en sus campos aluviales. También Cartledge introdujo bombas de riego con poder de vapor o gasolina para aumentar su producción. Después del año de 1923, La Harmonía agrandaba el vapor de su algodón por su desmotarlo antes de venderlo- es decir separar mecánicamente las semillas minúsculas de los copos fibrosos. Peso de gastos crecientes y precios disminuidos se acabó su aventura de algodón en 1942. Hoy sólo la maquinaria que se ve aquí nos recuerda de esta aventura en la agrícola de gran escala.",

Primarily a desert of Mexico, only a small portion extends across the United States border to meet the mountains and prairies of the north. The desert's position between the eastern and western Sierra Madre ranges in Mexico shields it from incoming oceanic precipitation, so rainfall here averages only 10 inches or less annually. The Chihuahuan Desert receives most of its precipitation from summer thunderstorms sweeping off the Gulf of Mexico in July and August. With its huge expanses, the Chihuahuan Desert is an eco-region that has received less exploration and study than other desert areas. Based on current discoveries, however, it is thought to be perhaps the most biologically diverse desert in the world.",

Prickly pear often hybridize, so a single plant may have the characteristics of more than one species. As you can guess, this can make exact identification confusing and difficult. Most species of prickly pear produce an edible fruit in mid-summer. Sweet and nutritious, the fruits have been harvested for generations by all who have lived in the Big Bend region. In Mexico, the immature pads are often collected in early spring and eaten as a vegetable or pickled relish. Look in the gourmet section of your supermarket for \"nopalitos\" - a tasty gift from the desert.",

Most varieties have a combination of detachable spines and tufts of barbed bristles. The variety observed next to this stop is known as a blind prickly pear because it doesn't have the long spines.

As succulents, both candelilla and cactus are able to store water in the stems; both are leafless to help avoid water loss; and both are covered with a protective, waxy coating that conserves water. The wax covering the candelilla plants is quite heavy, making it a useful ingredient in chewing gum, cosmetics, car wax, shoe polish, and many other products.",

These rock layers were laid down on the floor of an ancient sea during the Cretaceous Period about 95 million years ago. <br /> The change in the character of these two rock formations represents a change in the ancient environment and likely indicates a deepening of the ancient sea. The Del Rio Clay would have been deposited in relatively shallow water near the shore, while the Buda Limestone was deposited in deeper water. This change was probably not sudden; rather, the contact represents a gap in the rock record, probably caused by erosion of the top of the Del Rio Clay before the limestone was deposited. Later, these rock layers were uplifted to form the mountains surrounding you by the same tectonic forces that created the Rocky Mountains.",

The softer mudstone below it forms a slope and is partially covered by rockfall from the limestone, as well as shrubs, yucca, and creosotebush.

These tree-like succulents can reach an impressive 30 feet in height and 2 feet in diameter, crowning these giants as monarchs of this desert.<br /> The giant daggers are spectacular at anytime, but in the late spring (April-June) they burst into bloom with hundreds of creamy white flowers, each up to four inches long, on branched flower spikes. A bloom stalk with flowers can weigh up to 70 pounds! Like all yuccas, this giant depends on the little pronuba moth for pollination to continue the fragile balance of life. The female moth gathers the pollen into a tiny ball which she holds beneath her \"chin\". She then carries it to another yucca flower where she deposits her eggs into the flower ovary and spreads the pollen on the receptive stigma. The hatched moth larvae feed on the developing seeds, but overlook enough to allow for future generations of yuccas and moths.",

The larger dagger yucca are impressive in their height and girth, while the younger yucca are harder to tell apart from the torrey yucca.

In addition, during Big Bend's ranching era cattle ate the sweet and protein-rich pods of mesquite once the grasses became less abundant. The hard seeds of the mesquite pass through the digestive tract of cattle, which transports the seeds some distance away from the mother tree, increasing the spread of the mesquite tree.",

Each of the four deserts of North America contain distinctive plants, called indicator plants, that grow exclusively in that desert environment. Lechuguilla is the \"indicator plant\" for the Chihuahuan Desert, as it grows in this region and nowhere else. Like its other relatives in the agave family (commonly known as century plants), the lechuguilla blooms only once and then dies. This plant lives between 3 to 20 years, storing up energy to produce its tall bloom stalk. While it can produce seeds, lechuguilla reproduces mainly from offshoots from the parent plant before it flowers. Did you know that the leaf of lechuguilla is composed of fibrous strands that are used to make rope, and the processing of this fiber was one of the early industries here in the Big Bend?",
    "audioDescription": "The point of focus is the lechuguilla plant, which grows very well on limestone soils and can be found in abundance on the east side of the park. Lechuguilla, like most agaves, is an evergreen rosette: the well-armed leaves are arranged in spiral ranks around a thick, shortened stem. The plant is well armed by spines at the tips of the leaves, which can be very painful if you are unlucky enough to come in contact with one.",

The creosotebush is a medium-to-large evergreen shrub that has numerous flexible stems projecting at an angle from its base. It has small, pointed, yellow-green leaves and one inch-wide yellow flowers that bloom from February - August. After the creosotebush blooms the flower turns into a small white fuzzy fruit capsule that has 5 seeds. Due to a toxin produced in its roots, this bush rarely has other plants crowded around it.",

Small 2-inch leaves will grow from the stems when there is enough moisture. Dense clusters of red tubular flowers grow from the end of the stems from March through June.

Sometimes affectionately known as \"old shag\" because of its appearance, it has tough fibers curling along the leaf edges and a cloak of old leaves that protects the trunk. Many people associate the desert with the cactus family, but the Chihuahuan Desert tends to be dominated instead by woody plants such as yuccas and lechuguillas. While different in physical characteristics, yuccas and cacti do share some of the same adaptations to survive in desert environments, such as spiny protection and the ability to store moisture.",
    "audioDescription": "Torrey yucca are scattered all along Dagger Flat Road, as well as throughout the park. They vary in height from 3-15 feet, and the trunk typically has a single stem. The flower head may extend up to 2 feet on the upper portion of the stem. The flowers are bell-shaped, 2-3 inches long, creamy-white, and waxy. The leaves are 2-4 feet long, straight and rigid, ending in a sharp spine 1-2 inches long. This species was named for John Torrey (1796-1873), who designated this yucca as a new variety in 1859.",

The first Americans baked the \"heart\" of the sotol for food. Today you would be more likely to find these baked hearts fermented and distilled into a tequila-like liquor, also called sotol.The ribbon-like leaves of the sotol have distinctive curved teeth on the margin.",
    "audioDescription": "The view and surroundings are beginning to change from flat desert to low mountains, and a good portion of the road is now loose sand. This gain in elevation introduces a new plant, sotol, which is sometimes confused with yucca. The base of the sotol is a crowded cluster of ribbon-like leaves, 1-3 feet long. They have spiny teeth along the margins that curve backwards toward the base. The sotol produces an unbranched flower stalk 5-10 feet tall, with dense clusters of small white flowers on the upper third of the stalk.",

These hills are the eroded remains of a volcanic sill, a body of dark volcanic rock that was shot up from a plume of magma deep in the earth. However, it did not erupt. A rock layer above the magma prevented it from continuing to the surface. The magma, under incredible pressure, instead found a weakness that made moving horizontally easier than breaking through the cap above it; thus it injected itself between two layers of light-colored limestone. This event happened over 10 million years ago when the rock around you was still deep underground. Erosion has since worn away those rocks, exposing the volcanic sill that was once hidden. Soils weathered from the sill are more acidic than the surrounding limestone soils, producing more favorable growing conditions for some plants, and less favorable for others. Look for a change in plant types as you pass beyond the dark sill.",

The vegetation along the first half of this drive is typical of lower elevations, with creosotebush, lechuguilla, cacti, ocotillo, and cholla. As the road gains elevation, different plants such as persimmon tree, littleleaf leadtree, mesquite, and yuccas become more prominent. The drive ends in an enclosed valley that hosts thousands of giant dagger yucca. These yucca can be over 12 feet tall and in the spring their enormous white blooms decorate the hills like flaming candlesticks.",

It undergoes periodic conservation treatment that allows visitors to see a great example of adobe architecture. The entire system of irrigation ditches remain visible throughout the farm complex. The ditches extend from the building eastward through the campground, and almost 1/2 mile north of the Rio Grande Village visitor center. Some of the ditches are currently used to provide water to the campground and the Black Hawk nesting area. A portion of the irrigation complex north of the campground is being removed to restore that area to conditions similar to the pre-homestead era.  ",

Just 100 yards to the west, tall cliffs follow the course of the river toward the hot springs. These cliffs are made up of ancient limestone and are about 200 feet high on both sides of the river.

It is a pleasant hike in the early morning or late afternoon hours when temperatures are moderate. The majority of the trail passes through scant desert vegetation, including creosote bush, cacti, and grasses. It is important to note that after a good rainfall the trail and surrounding soil turns into a clay mud that forms thick clumps on hiker's shoes and makes walking difficult. At 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the trailhead, the trail enters a (normally) dry wash. A metal sign marks the intersection. Pay close attention to this location before continuing, as it can easily be missed on the return trip. Take a left turn here and follow the rocky wash the remaining 0.5 mile (0.8 km) into Dog Canyon. High limestone walls quickly envelope hikers and one is able to walk between the towering cliffs of the canyon and out the other end. Most hikers turn around where the canyon ends and repeat the journey back to their vehicles. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The first 1.5 miles of the trail is fairly flat walking on a sand and dirt trail. The last 0.5 miles is in a rocky drainage which makes for very unstable footing.

    "audioDescription": "The Dog Canyon trailhead is located next to a pullout on the road between Persimmon Gap and Panther Junction. From the parking lot one is looking directly east across a flat, sparsely vegetated desert landscape to a line of mountains roughly 2 miles away. The mountains are split by a canyon, and evidence of a rockfall in 1987 is highlighted on the cliff face to the left. The section of cliff where the rockfall occurred revealed the white color of the limestone rock, and can be seen on clear days from Panther Junction, 24 miles to the south. Text on the Dog Canyon Trailhead sign: \"The Dog Canyon trail is a cairn-marked path over the desert flats, leading to a small canyon splitting the Deadhorse Mountains. This canyon was named from a story originating during Big Bend's early ranching period. Decades ago, a dog was found guarding an oxen-drawn wagon in a canyon about 5 miles south of Persimmon Gap. The owners of the oxen were never found, and their identity remains one of the mysteries of Big Bend. The loyal dog, meanwhile, had a canyon named for it. Dog Canyon is a gorge cut by Nine Point Draw through the Deadhorse Mountains, where massive layers of limestone rise vertically out of the canyon floor. Rock in this area is the oldest in the park, and includes a mix of Glen Rose, Santa Elena, Buda and Boquillas limestone. These layers have been faulted, uplifted, and overturned by the same mountain-building forces that built the Rocky Mountains. Before the creation of Dog Canyon, this part of the park was likely a closed basin with a playa lake.\" Trail Safety: \"Bring plenty of water; a minimum of 2-3 liters per person Wear protective clothing, like sun hats and long sleeves. This trail has no shade until the very end of the canyon. Be aware of wildlife, such as snakes and mountain lions; maintain a safe distance.\" Trail rules: \"No pets or bicycles on any trails No collecting or possessing of plants, animals, minerals, or artifacts Do not feed or approach wildlife Pack out your trash Permits required for backpacking Drone or UAV use prohibited in park\"",

Later they built an impressive adobe home on top of the mesa. Roof width in the Castolon area was limited by the length of vigas (wood ceiling beams), which were typically from the small local mesquite or cottonwood trees. Dorgan used his expertise as an architect to design this atypical house. The petrified wood fireplace in the center of the house was more than just decoration; it provided a place for the vigas to meet in the center of the room, making his house twice as wide and deep as other Castolon homes.<br /> <br /> Dorgan owned pumps and irrigation equipment, which he leased to James Sublett for several years. Dorgan also sold vegetables and employed several area families, including the Garcia family of La Coyota, to crate and ship vegetables.<br /> <br /> The Dorgan’s left their Big Bend property in 1938 due to business and health issues. The Dorgan and Sublett business partnership also dissolved. In 1941, Dorgan leased the property to A.F. Robinson who intended to open the “Mexitex Resort”, evidently hoping to benefit from the national park which was being established in the area at that time. The resort failed, and Dorgan sold his holdings for inclusion in Big Bend National Park.",

En la década de 1930, Dorgan y su esposa, Avis Ann, construyeron esta casa de adobe en la mesa, con ventanas grandes en el frente y una chimenea doble que se daba a la gran sala central. Los Dorgans desocuparon su propiedad en Big Bend en 1938 y en 1941 la alquilaron a A.F.

The first structure is a stone farmhouse with an exhibit detailing the significance of the farm and the families that lived here. The wide dirt trail continues east through grasses and desert scrub to a small grove of mesquites with a shaded bench, then proceeds to the second structure, La Casita.<br /> From here, the trail ascends a moderately steep hill. At the top of the hill, the trail forks. What remains of the Sublett house is to the right (this area is especially fragile - stay on the trail). The left fork leads to the Dorgan house, where the fireplace and part of the walls are still standing. Take a look through the windows and enjoy a spectacular view of several Big Bend landmarks - the Chisos Mountains, Emory Peak, and Mule Ears to the north and east; Santa Elena Canyon to the southwest. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The trail is rock and sand with portions crossing sandy washes. This short path has one climb of 56 feet from the second adobe structure to the two structures located on top of the hill. <br /> A dirt pullout at the trailhead provides parking for two vehicles. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike.

The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife.

Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail.",

    "bodyText": "Dugout Wells was once known as the \"Cultural Center of the Big Bend.\" The railroad reached Marathon in 1882, which drew people to the area with the hopes of making a life in West Texas. In the early 1900s, ranchers and farmers began to move into what is now Big Bend National Park. The Green family and their neighbors, the Averys, began to run livestock in the area around this spring. Community members built a schoolhouse which attracted children from the immediate area. This development made the area the social center for the surrounding families. <br /> <br /> The Green family, as well as other homesteaders, did the best they could for many years to make their ranches and farms work. Some were more successful than others. The Great Depression had a tremendous impact on everyone in the area, some stuck it out, some left for \"better\" places. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1930s, the state of Texas began to purchase and acquire property in this part of Brewster County. On June 6, 1944, the state gave the federal government the deed to over 700,000 acres with the aim of establishing the first national park in Texas. Six days later, on June 12th, Congress acted and officially created Big Bend National Park.<br /> Dugout Wells is just one of many places in the park to see the remnants of early 20th-century farming and ranching history. ",
    "audioDescription": "Text on exhibit at Dugout Wells: \"Tall cottonwoods in the desert are a sure indicator of running water. Here, moisture seeps from a bed of gravel in the Chisos Mountains' east flank. Around 1900, a settler dug out a spring to pool the seepage, and later improved the flow with a windmill. As you enter the grove of trees you will experience an instant change in climate. Look and listen for signs of wildlife attracted to the greater variety of plants. The relatively dense vegetation makes this oasis an excellent site for birdwatching.\"",

The word <em>tinaja</em> (pronounced \"tin-AH-ha\") is Spanish for \"large earthen jar\" and in Big Bend refers to natural water holes, usually formed by erosion. <br /> <br /> A small parking spot marks the trailhead. The trail to the tinaja is 1/2 mile each way, and provides access into a small canyon lined with spectacular limestone geology.  Walk up the canyon to the tinaja carved into the creekbed. The tinaja holds water year round. Be very careful along the edge. Desert animals seeking water are often lured to the steep walled tinaja, only to fall in and drown when they cannot climb out the smooth sides. <br /> <br /> The trailhead is located approximately 5 miles along the rugged, primitive <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/old-ore-road.htm\">Old Ore Road</a>. The Old Ore is extremely rocky and challenging to all but the most capable vehicles. <strong>Do NOT </strong>attempt to reach this trail without a <strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">rugged high-clearance four-wheel drive vehicle with sturdy tires</span></strong>. Do not attempt this road with a regular car, minivan, or motorhome. </p> <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> <p>The hike to Ernst Tinaja involves a 5 mile drive along the rugged, primitive, Old Ore Road, and then a walk of 1/2 mile each way. The hike is mostly flat, but consists of deep sand with stretches of bedrock. To access the best viewing of the tinaja requires scrambling on and over some smooth limestone boulders and ledges. <br /> <br /> <strong style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem;\">Hike Smart</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Bring plenty of water!</strong></em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Eat</strong></em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Sun protection</strong></em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em><strong>Don't leave people behind</strong></em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Be aware of wildlife</strong></em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed, or fed.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Ernst Tinaja is natural waterhole in the bedrock of a brightly colored limestone canyon.

Following paths of least resistance, molten material welled up into subterranean faults of fissures 17 million years ago. All dikes, including Big Bend's, cut across other beds of rock.

The benign-looking drainage shows evidence of the flash floods that have roared underneath this bridge. Desert willows grow along the banks and partially in the drainage, testifying to their hardiness and fast-growing nature. Looking beyond the drainage, the highway heads south towards the Chisos Mountains, which can be seen towering high above the desert. Text on the wayside: Few people witness flash floods, but this dry wash shows the aftermath. The wide, steep-sided channel demonstrates the flood's scope and power. From the streambed rubble of plant debris, gravel, and occasional bones, you can envision a muddy torrent churning with uprooted shrubs, tons of rock and sand, and struggling desert creatures. Thunderheads over distant peaks may be your only warning of a flash flood. Within minutes, the torrent becomes a trickle, and the next day the wash is completely dry again - waiting.

It was inhabited by Fred Garlick, who served as the farm manager for Wayne Cartledge’s La Harmonia Company. After inclusion into Big Bend National Park, rangers continued to use the Garlick House as an office. The Garlick House is one of many examples of adobe structures in Big Bend. Adobe was a common style of construction and for good reason. Made from dirt mixed with straw, grass, or manure, adobe costs nothing but time and labor. With occasional maintenance, it can last almost indefinitely. ",

    "audioDescription": "The exhibit panel features a photograph of Goat Mountain with volcanic features outlined in white. Below the image is a series of four graphic images showing how Goat Mountain was formed. The panel text reads: \"Goat Mountain. Some 29 million years ago, volcanoes dominated the ancient Big Bend. Many of the formations along the Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive, including Goat Mountain, originated in this volcanic past. A new theory (diagrams below) tells a tale of fiery explosions and massive volcanic domes. An initial large explosion created a crater within older, layered volcanic rock. Possibly the explosion occurred when rising magma (molten rock beneath the earth's crust) came into contact with water trapped in the older lava, causing it to flash into steam. Silica-rich magma continued surging upward, causing repeated pyroclastic eruptions (a mixture of super-heated gas, ash, and rock fragments). The flows partially filled the crater, and formed a collar of steaming volcanic material around the vents. Similar pyroclastic material is visible at Tuff Canyon and Burro Mesa Pouroff. Over time, the gas content of the magma decreased, and the final eruptions produced thick, slow-moving, silica-rich lava (magma that reaches the surface). The lava formed thick domes that were higher than, and spread over, the crater walls. A dozen or so similar volcanic domes dotted the landscape between Burro Mesa and Castolon. About 27 million years ago, the region was uplifted and faulted and erosion began to shape the land we see today. The overlying silica-rich lava was resistant to erosion and formed steep, jointed cliffs. The weaker pyroclastic deposits below are eroding away, exposing a dike (magma intrusion) that may represent part of the original feeder system.\"",

Do NOT attempt to reach this trail with a passenger car, minivan, or RV. </strong></span></p> <p><strong><em>Dogs and other pets are not allowed on any trails in the park.</em></strong></p> <p>The trail leads to a group of balanced rocks in the heart of Grapevine Hills. This is a great hike for families with kids. nitially, the trail follows a gravel wash, then climbs steeply for the last quarter mile into the boulders. The last section requires crossting steep, rough bedrock, and negotiating a challenging landscape of boulders. Stay on the trail, and watch carefully for the directional arrows that point the way to the balanced rock. <u>Use extreme caution</u>, especially coming back down. Grapevine Hills is an exposed laccolith, with many giant rounded boulders. These boulders are tempting to climb, but it is important to watch out for snakes who like to hang out in their protective shade. </p> <h4>Accessibility</h4> <p>The first 0.75 miles (1.2 km) of the trail is relatively easy, dipping in and out of a sandy wash, with a gradual rise in elevation. The last 0.25 mile (0.4 km) involves a climb up a steep rocky slope. <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\"><strong>Please take extra caution on the climb back down</strong></span>, as the rocks are covered with a loose layer of sand and gravel that makes for a slippery descent. Park rangers regularly respond to foot/leg/ankle injuries on this trail.<br /> <br /> There is NO shade anywhere along this desert trail.<br /> <br /> A dirt parking lot at the trailhead provides parking for about ten vehicles.</p> <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <p><em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed, or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The trailhead begins at a dirt parking lot and winds its way along a dry, sandy wash. The surrounding hills have a rosy brown color to them and are eroded into slightly rounded shapes. One gets the feeling of walking through large rock hallway to a dead end. At the head of the drainage the trail leaves the wash and climbs steeply through the boulders. The trail ends at a series of large boulders that have fallen on top of each other to resemble a window. Text on trailhead sign: The Grapevine Hills Trail leads through a desert wash surrounded by eroded hills before climbing through boulders to a balanced rock. Most of the trail is a flat walk, but the last quarter mile is a steeper climb over rocks. The surrounding Grapevine Hills is a laccolith, formed by magma that welled up near the Earth's surface into a dome-shape roughly 38-27 million years ago. The magma cooled underground, and has become exposed by erosion over time. While hiking, look for large calcite crystals within these rocks; the calcite was deposited from minerals dissolved in water that moved along fractures in the rock. Calcite crystals like these are among the clues that help geologists find and understand faults. Within these hills are examples of typical Chihuahuan Desert plants. In the creek bed near the trail, additional water resources allow plants like Texas Persimmon to grow. Look for these stately shrubs, characterized by smooth grey bark and small evergreen leaves. Fruit from the persimmon provides an important food source for wildlife, such as fox and javelina. Trail safety: Bring plenty of water; a minimum of 1-2 liters per person. Wear protective clothing, like sun hats and long sleeves. Pay attention to creek bed crossings and trail signs to avoid getting lost. Trail rules: No pets or bicycles on any trails. No campfires. Smoking permitted in areas with sparse vegetation. No collecting or possessing plants, animals, minerals or artifacts. Pack out your trash. Do not approach or feed wildlife.",

    "audioDescription": "Standing at this wayside, one looks west and south towards the higher Rosillos Mountains and the low Chihuahuan Desert that surrounds them. The Rosillos Mountains are the eroded remains of a laccolith, which was a volcanic intrusion, and thus exhibit a rough, knobby appearance. These mountains are carved by numerous canyons that drain into the surrounding desert. The low desert is sparsely vegetated, with some areas showing huge tracts of bare soil. In various places, park personnel have deposited lines of dead vegetation. Text on the wayside panel: Can damaged lands be restored? The vast desert in front of you was once viable rangeland. By the time this land was purchased by brothers Edward and Houston Harte in 1958, the area was dramatically altered by overgrazing, field crop production, and modifications to drainage. Despite consultation with the Soil Conservation Service, the Harte brothers were unable to halt soil erosion and restore desert grassland habitat. Restoration of native grassland continues with a long-term National Park Service project called \"Grasslands Not Badlands\". Habitat restoration is a complex science and a time-consuming process. Over the years, and through trial and error, park staff have researched and developed different techniques to encourage growth of native grass species. A successful method has evolved to plant strips of vegetation perpendicular to the flow of water across the landscape. These strips slow the flow of run off after it rains and let the soil absorb more moisture. This prevents soil erosion. Will the park succeed in restoring desert grasslands? It will take many years but National Park Service scientists will continue to refine their techniques as the attempt to heal the damaged landscape. In 1984 the Harte brothers generously donated their 67,125-acre North Rosillos ranch to the Nature Conservancy with the intent that the land ultimately go to Big Bend National Park. In 1989 the Nature Conservancy fulfilled the brothers' wish by conveying 56,720 acres to the park. It was the single largest donation since the park's establishment in 1944.",

The line camp at the base of Signal or Carousel Mountain was built for the ranch foreman, Lott Felts.<br /> <br /> A 0.5 mile hike leads down the hill to the line camp, a circular corral with snubbing post, dipping vats, an old chicken coop, and other ranch remains.<br /> Hikers can access the Blue Creek and Dodson trails from this point. ",
    "audioDescription": "An exhibit on a stone bench shows two photographs of the historic ranchhouse in the valley below, and an early 20th-century black and white photo of sheep and goats resting on a slope in the foothills of the Chisos Mountains. The exhibit text reads: \"Homer Wilson Ranch. The buildings below look like an active ranch, though this line camp was abandoned in 1945. Take the short trail down into the canyon for a closer view. The foreman's house makes eloquent use of native materials: reed ceiling from the river, timbers from the mountains, and large stones from Blue Creek Canyon. Nearby are the ruins of a bunkhouse, a circular corral, and a dipping vat for sheep and goats--just enough remains to evoke the era of frontier ranching.\" The caption for the historic photo reads: \"Homer Wilson's 4,000 sheep and 2,500 goats escaped the summer heat and found abundant grassland on the slopes up-canyon.\" Beyond the exhibit is a broad valley lined by volcanic hills. The prominent mountain is pointed at the top with a broad base and is known as Signal or Carousel Mountain. The ranchhouse mentioned in the exhibit is at the base of the mountain. Blue Creek, usually a dry wash, runs through the valley, splitting it in two.",

Hidden in the brush are the remains of a corral with a central snubbing post, a dipping vat for sheep and goats, and a ranch house with a shady porch. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The rock and gravel trail follows the old road down a steep hill and across two drainages that may flood during the rainy season. The trail climbs the bank of Blue Creek and leads to the ranchhouse. Other features of the line camp are hidden in thick brush, connected by an indistinct trail. <h4>Hike Smart</h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed, or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "The Langford Hot Springs are a very popular spot for park visitors. The area was also a popular place for ancient Americans for thousands of years. The confluence of Tornillo Creek and the Rio Grande was especially inviting as important food sources are available in greater quantities than the area further from the river. The hot water emanating from the edge of the river was, and is, inviting to all who found this spot. Evidence of ancient people is found on the rocks in the form of pictographs and petroglyphs. While the meaning is lost to time, one can ponder their relevance, or simply enjoy the view. <br /> <br /> J.O Langford had heard of the springs, and since he was in ill health, decided to homestead here since hot springs were purported to heal all ills. He improved the water catchment and started to develop a commercial enterprise that attracted tourists and those seeking health benefits. Mr. Langford left for a few years during the Mexican Revolution, but returned to begin business once again. He constructed the motor court, found just down the trail, to provide overnight lodging to guests. The business attracted customers from the United States and Mexico. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, Maggie Smith took over operations and continued doing business even after the creation of the park. The post office and resort closed in 1952.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

According to an advertisement published in 1933, \"Light housekeeping rooms, furnished, except linens, blankets, and pillows, rent for $1 per day; $6 per week; baths 25 cents each; patients with contagious diseases 50 cents a bath; room, board, and baths $3 per day. Or you can, free of charge, camp outdoors under the shade of the trees, and fish in the waters of the Rio Grande.\" Built of stone with a concrete floor, each room was decorated with paintings of burros, horsemen and other scenes by Mrs. Guy Lee of Marathon. Today you can peer inside the windows and doorways and view remnants of those colorful paintings.",
    "audioDescription": "A long rectangular building constructed of cut limestone blocks sits several hundred yards from the Rio Grande. Across the front of the building are multiple doors and windows constructed for the individual motel rooms. The windows and doors are covered with screens, but one can peer inside and still see sections of adobe walls and the colorful drawings that once graced their surfaces. A dirt trail coming from the parking lot passes in front of the motel and continues on to the hot springs.",

People came from all around - to get mail, trade, or just catch up on the local news. The mail carrier made weekly trips from Marathon to Hot Springs, staying two nights in the little house which he built near the post office.<br /> In 1942, the Langfords sold their property to the State of Texas for eventual donation to Big Bend National Park. The hot springs and post office/store continued to be operated as a concession by Maggy and H. Baylor Smith. Maggy operated them alone from 1944, when her husband died, until 1952. She was known for her kindness and ability to get along with her neighbors south of the border, often assisting as mid-wife and rendering first aid. In 1974, Hot Springs was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",

    "audioDescription": "The view from this wayside encompasses the sotol-grassland habitat that is found throughout the park between the elevations of 3,500 - 5,000 feet (1,066 - 1,524 meters). In the distance are the peaks of the Christmas Mountains, which are located just outside the park boundary to the west. Text on the wayside: The desert appears deserted at noon. Except for a few lizards and the pink flash of a western coachwhip snake, nothing moves across ground that can reach temperatures of 150 degrees Fahrenheit. The apparent emptiness reflects biological adaptations. To the patient observer, this scene can reveal animals specifically attuned to desert extremes. The jackrabbit in the shade of a creosotebush, the kangaroo rat deep in its burrow, the mule deer hidden in an arroyo, are all merely waiting for the evening's cooler temperatures. Kangaroo rats have deep burrows with a year-round relative humidity between 30 and 50 percent. Jackrabbits' large, translucent ears function like radiators, dissipating body heat through a rick network of blood vessels. Mule deer sometimes feed along roadside drainage ditches where extra moisture make the grass juicier. Coyotes search for roadkills, hunt a variety of rodents, and even browse on plants. You are most likely to spot the collared peccary, or javelina, in early morning or late evening. Look for evidence of chewed pricklypear. The red racer or western coachwhip can tolerate temperatures up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Most other snakes are nocturnal.",

A few crumbling foundations are all that remain of the community, although La Coyota was once home to nearly a dozen Mexican and Mexican-American families. In 1884, Don Severiano Chavarria moved to this area with two sons and two daughters. His third daughter, Petra, was born the following year. His family eventually expanded to include eleven sons and five daughters, and as new families moved to the area, a community was born.<br /> <br /> The family of Matilde and Theodora “Lola” Garcia also called La Coyota home. They built an adobe home and raised two boys and two girls. Mr. Garcia sometimes worked for his neighbor, Albert Dorgan, or as a cowboy for Cartledge’s ranching operation. He also worked for Homer Wilson on the Blue Creek Ranch at the base of the Chisos Mountains. In the winter, Garcia worked in the mercury mines at Terlingua, and his children attended school in Study Butte. Mrs. Garcia took care of the children, cows, goats, and chickens. The children helped at home and sometimes crated vegetables on Dorgan’s farm or rode horseback, helping their father with cattle roundups.<br /> <br /> The families of La Coyota fared well with plenty of meat, fish, water, and vegetables. They also bought supplies at the La Harmonia Store or from stores in Study Butte and Terlingua. But life was not without its difficulties. Measles, rashes, stomach disorders, and fevers were common. The families cured many illnesses using traditional remedies from desert plants and herbs, but advanced medical care was far away. Many of the graves in the local cemeteries are those of children.<br /> <br /> Please treat historic sites with respect. Remember that archeological and historical items are protected by law.

The soldiers, however, probably never occupied the building, as the Revolution ended and troops were withdrawn shortly after its construction. The buildings were purchased by Wayne Cartledge and Howard Perry, partners in La Harmonia Company. Perry was the millionaire owner of the Chisos Mining Company in nearby Terlingua, and Cartledge was his bookkeeper until they formed La Harmonia Company in 1918. Cartledge named the company “La Harmonia” as he hoped to encourage peaceful relations (harmony) in the area. La Harmonia Company was vital to the existence of individual ranchers and the farming families living in the remote villages of Castolon, La Coyota, El Ojito, and Terlingua de Abajo.<br /> <br /> Imagine this frontier store as it was in the 1920s-- stocked with a wide variety of merchandise that catered to the diversity of clients on both sides of the river. Screwworm medicine and saddles were available for use on local ranches. Patent medicines, quinine capsules, toothache drops, and liniment helped residents pull through without a local doctor. Staple groceries, shoes, and clothing were also for sale. More exotic items like wedding veils and lace could be specially ordered. Bundles of wolf, mountain lion, and skunk pelts (mostly from northern Mexico) added to the scene and smell. Conversations in English and Spanish filled the air. The store remained in business until 1961, when La Harmonia Company holdings were incoporated into Big Bend National Park.<br /> <br /> Tragedy struck on May 22, 2019, when a fire in Mexico to jumped the Rio Grande. With temperatures around 110 degrees Fahrenheit, the fire spread quickly and showered embers on the shade structures of La Harmonia Store and the historic latrine. Despite valient efforts, structural and wildland fire crews could not safely extinguish the fire before both buildings suffered extensive damage. Luckily, firefighters saved many other buildings, artifacts, vital utilities, and nearby Cottonwood Campground. Although damaged, the buildings remain a rich remnant of Big Bend's pioneer and military past. The National Park Service is consulting with adobe experts, historic architects, and structural engineers to determine whether these structures can be salvaged or rehabilitated. A temporary restroom and concession was added to the area. The visitor center is now housed in the historic Garlick House.",

    "bodyText": "<p>J.O. Langford's impressive bathhouse is long gone; today the spring is contained by the foundation remains of the bathhouse, on the north bank of the Rio Grande. Relish a primitive bathing experience while enjoying unparalleled scenery.</p> <p>Along a stretch beginning upstream of Rio Grande Village, a series of thermal springs emerge adjacent to the Rio Grande. All of the hot springs in this region are believed to be related to normal faults. These Basin and Range type faults formed between 18 and 23 million years ago. Today, groundwater circulating deep in the earth becomes heated before it returns to the surface as hot springs.</p> <p>The most famous of the thermal features along the Big Bend of the Rio Grande is the Langford Hot Springs. Located where Tornillo Creek enters the Rio Grande, some four miles upriver from Boquillas Canyon and the Mexican village of Boquillas. The natural springs at the site are known as Boquillas Hot Springs. <em>Boquillas</em> is Spanish for \"little mouths\" and refers to the many small streams or arroyos that drain this part of the Sierra del Carmen range and flow into the Rio Grande. Later, when the springs were promoted for their health benefits, the settlement and spa resort there was called Hot Springs, and a post office by that name was established at the site in July 1914. Although there are several other small hot springs in the area, these larger and more accessible springs are the best known.</p> <p>Hot spring water is considered old water, fossil water, ancient and irreplaceable. Heated by geothermal processes and emerging at 105° F., the water carries dissolved mineral salts reputed to have healing powers. The water contains calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, and lithium. The springs' flow rate in 1936 was 250,000 gallons a day, but more recent measurements show a decrease. The therapeutic value of heat has long been touted as a remedy of both body and soul.</p> <p>Be aware that some hot springs can burn you either with the scalding effects of heat or the caustic nature of the water chemistry. Use caution when bathing and limit the exposure of children to the warm waters.</p> <h2><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Visiting the Langford Hot Springs</span></h2> <p>Contact <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/contacts.htm\">Big Bend National Park</a> for more information and before visiting to get any current conditions or updated information.  </p> <h3>The Rules</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Be respectful of others; soak only, and use no soaps or oils.</p> </li> <li> <p>Swimming is not recommended; be aware that adjacent river currents and depths can be unpredictable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Please help to keep the area clean by picking up trash.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alcoholic beverages and glass containers are prohibited.</p> </li> <li> <p>Overnight camping in the area of the Hot Springs is prohibited.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is illegal to purchase items from vendors operating on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Directions</h3> <h4><strong>Hot Springs Road</strong></h4> <p>The two-mile gravel road descends down a rough, narrow wash to the Hot Springs Historic District and trailhead area. <em>Note: Motor homes and oversize vehicles are prohibited on the one-way sections of the Hot Springs road.</em></p> <h4><strong>Hiking to the Hot Springs</strong></h4> <p>From the trailhead, the hot spring is a 0.5 mile round trip.

    "bodyText": "In May of 1909, J.O. Langford, his wife, Bessie, and their 18-month old daughter, Lovie, moved to land he had recently acquired around the hot springs. Their first home was an abandoned<strong> </strong>dug-out, over whose rock walls they stretched a tent. In November 1909 Langford completed a one-room adobe cabin, 12x14 feet and 9 feet high, on a bench of land 150 feet above the river and overlooking the hot springs. During their second year of occupation, Langford enlarged his house by building two more rooms of stone. Unfortunately, this structure has since entirely disintegrated. The only elements that can be seen today are the remains of the poured concrete floor of the stone addition.<br /> The picture shown was the two-room stone addition to the original adobe structure, which can barely be seen through the doorway. The date of the photo is unknown, but the fact that the structure is deteriorated suggests that it was photographed after 1942, when the land was sold for eventual donation to the national park.",
    "audioDescription": "The Langford House is situated on a limestone hill, about 150 feet above the Rio Grande. From this location, one has a view of the river and the surrounding terrain, both in the United States, and across the river into Mexico. The vegetation includes low desert cactus, ocotillo, creosotebush, and mesquite, as well as low trees, cane, and tamarisk that are associated with water. The only visible remains of the Langford house are the concrete floor that was poured when the addition was built.",

Most of the trail is rocky or covered with loose pebbles. Please be aware of your footing.</p> <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <p><em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration.

    "audioDescription": "This trailhead sign is accessed from a narrow, parking lot that is large enough to accommodate about fifteen cars. A wheelchair accessible sidewalk leads to an information panel that is mounted on metal legs. Behind the panel, the hiking trail ascends along a drainage with trees and desert plants. The panel shows a photo of Juniper Canyon, a large canyon covered in green vegetation and surrounded by a rocky rim. The panel also shows a topographic map of the Lost Mine Trail, the Chisos Basin Road, and Juniper Canyon. Photo courtesy of Tim McKenna Text from sign: \"The Lost Mine Trail climbs to the side of Lost Mine Peak, offering spectacular views of Juniper Canyon and the Northeast Rim of the Chisos. These vistas begin around 1 mile up and continue to the top of the trail. Lost Mine Peak was named for the legend of the lost mine of the Chisos. As the story goes, Spanish explorers discovered ore here on their quest for silver and gold. They enslaved the native Chizo tribe and forced them to work the mine, blindfolding them to keep the location of the mine secret. According to the legend, the Chizo revolted, killing every last Spanish captor and sealing the entrance of the mine. Some say, by standing on the doorway of the church of San Vicente, Mexico, the first light on Easter morning will shine on the mine’s hidden location. The Lost Mine of the Chisos remains legend, as no ore bearing rocks have been reported from these hills. Whether this is just a story passed around campfires, or based on truth, the peak and all it includes is forever protected and preserved.\"",

Shallow surface roots collect all available water, which the cactus stores in thick, waxy-covered pads, or stems. The pads are a good source of moisture, fiber, and nutrients for animals that brave the spines. Rodents bite into the edges of the pads between the spines, while javalinas have tough mouths that allow them to eat the entire pad, spines and all. The juicy ripe purple fruits are also a good food source for many animals.",

    "bodyText": "In the early 1900s, black bears were common in the Chisos Mountains. By the time the national park was established in 1944, there were virtually no resident bears left. Shooting and trapping by ranchers, federal predator control agents, recreational hunters, and loss of habitat contributed to their decline. Individual bears occasionally wandered in and out of the park from Mexico, but only scattered sightings were reported from the 1940s through the 1980s. In the late 1980s visitors began seeing bears in increasing numbers, and in 1988 a visitor photographed a female with three young cubs in the Chisos Mountains. Observations increased in the 1990s, and in 1996 visitors reported 572 sightings in one year! Today, visitors regularly observe bears throughout the Chisos Mountains, and sometimes even in the desert areas of the park. The recolonization of the black bears in Big Bend is truly a remarkable natural event.",
    "audioDescription": "At this location is a metal sign that talks about what to do if a person encounters a black bear and what to do if one encounters a mountain lion. The basic message is the same for both animals: make yourself look big, yell, wave your arms around, and do not run.",

According to legend, the workers eventually rebelled, killed their enslavers, and sealed the mine entrance to prevent further exploitation. There is no evidence to support this legend, and geologists don't believe that silver would form in the rocks of the Chisos Mountains. However, the name adds an air of mystery to this mountain. ",

A good portion of the trail follows a gravel wash lined by Mexican persimmon, Mexican buckeye, and desert hackberry trees. The wash is bounded by volcanic hills with layers of yellow and orange ash-flow tuffs. Large congomerate boulders litter the valley bottom. The trail ends at the pouroff—a 100-foot tall vertical channel carved into rock that funnels water from the mesa above.<br /> <br /> During the rainy season, flashfloods may race down the wash. Be careful and don't get caught in the canyon during a storm. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The upper part of the trail is a fairly flat dirt and rock path. After about 0.25 miles, the trail descends into the wash via a series of uneven steps. The wash is gently-sloped, coarse sand and gravel. <br /> The trailhead is at the end of a paved road. Sixteen pull-in parking spaces and one handicap spot offer plenty of parking. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed, or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow.

    "audioDescription": "A trailhead sign at the beginning of the trail reads: \"The Lower Burro Mesa Pouroff trail is an easy walk that leads through a gravel creek bed to a narrow box canyon where water has carved a deep channel into Burro Mesa. This 100-foot pouroff attests to the power of water that floods this canyon during summer rains. Burro Mesa gives evidence of Big Bend's volcanic past. The yellow and orange bands across the bluffs are ash-flow tuffs, which show the layered beds crated as they were deposited. The top of the cliff is formed from Burro Mesa Rhyolite. Pouroffs are seasonal waterfalls. During rainy times water might flow through these drainages in powerful flash floods, continuing to carve the channel. Without much permeable soil to soak in to, the water continues downhill quickly, often with the flow ending within a few hours after a rainstorm. Water might continue to slowly flow beneath the surface of the gravel creek bed, causing water to seep down the face of the pouroff for days before drying again.\"",

With a little imagination, you can get a feeling for the work of these early pioneers and their contributions to Big Bend's rich human history. The remains of the mine stand today as a symbol of a time when \"quicksilver was king\" and as a vivid reminder of the cycle of human activities and nature's reclamation.<br /> <br /> The mine is located on the northern end of Mariscal Mountain, deep in the interior of Big Bend National Park. Easiest access to the area is via the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/primitive-dirt-roads.htm\">River Road east,</a> which begins just west of Rio Grande Village. The mine is located approximately 22 miles down the gravel road. This is a remote and primitive dirt road. A high clearance vehicle (<em>with at least 8 inches of clearance or more from the lowest point of the frame, body, suspension, or differential, to the ground</em>) is always required, and after any rains, the road will require four-wheel drive. Always check with a park ranger for current road conditions before setting out. Allow at least one-half day for this excursion.</p> <h4>Safety Precautions and Regulations</h4> <p>While exploring the area, remember to leave all objects in place in the park; collecting is prohibited. Because they are old, fragile, and unsafe, please stay off of the remaining structures. Avoid handling the bricks of the Scott Furnace and condensers or handling mine tailings as they may contain poisonous concentrations of mercury. Finally, be careful around the mine shafts; although most are fenced, they are vertical and deep, and other unfenced shafts may exist in the area.</p> <h4>Learn more about the Mariscal Mine:</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/bibe/learn/historyculture/mariscalmine.htm\">Mariscal Mine - Big Bend National Park</a></p>",
    "audioDescription": "Abandoned since the 1940s, and isolated by its remote location in the middle of Big Bend National Park, the Mariscal Mine is the best preserved mercury mining site in the state of Texas, and is a listed historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. From the parking area, a rugged trail leads uphill for 1/2 mile through the ruins of the mine. Stone buildings, condenser piping, rubble, and assorted mining equipment still remain. Views in all directions are spectacular. Several mine shafts exist throughout the site, and visitors must be vigilant and careful while exploring the site.",

The trail plus the loop is approximately 14 miles (22 km) in length, with about 3,800 feet (1,158 meters) of cumulative elevation change.<br /> <br /> The second trail that branches off is the <strong>Ore Terminal Trail</strong>, which follows the route of the ore tramway that came from the Puerto Rico mine in Mexico to the terminal at the top of a ridge above Ernst Valley. This trail is about 8 miles (13 km) in length, with about 800 feet (244 meters) of elevation change.<br /> <br /> The third trail is the <strong>Strawhouse Trail</strong>, which terminates at the Telephone Canyon Trail to the north. This Strawhouse Trail is about 14 miles (22 km) one-way, with about 1,600 feet (487 meters) of elevation change.<br /> <br /> All of these trails are best experienced in temperatures below 80 degrees (26 Celcius).<br />   <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> These three trails traverse rocky ground covered in loose pebbles, making it necessary to place your feet with care. In addition, all of these trails involve large elevation changes - hiking poles are recommended to assist with balance.<br /> <br /> The dirt parking lot provides parking for about 5 vehicles.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700;\">Hike Smart</span><br /> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail.",

    "audioDescription": "From the Maverick parking area, a view to the east reveals the large bulk of the Chisos Mountains, towering over the desert. To the south, one can see the 1,500 feet deep Santa Elena Canyon, appearing as if a doorway through a line of cliffs. To the north, it's possible to follow the paved road as it passes through desert flats of ocotillo, creosotebush, and cactus. Text on the bulletin boards: Big Bend in Close-up - From a vehicle, the desert flats can appear lifeless. On foot, your focus shifts and an unseen wilderness comes to life with a rasping of locusts and a trickling of sand down a tiny burrow. After visiting the park's major features, change your mode of touring; become a desert rat for a while. Dugout Wells is a good place to start, where an oasis punctuates the sun-baked dazzle of the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Trail. Or improvise your own trails: flash floods are rarely witnessed, but by walking any dry wash you can discover the dramatic results - the tumbled boulders and brief outburst of wildflowers. You can reduce Big Bend's giant-scale geology to human scale by hiking park trails such as Tuff Canyon, Santa Elena Canyon or the \"Window\". Big Bend National Park - From the rim of the cool, pine-scented Chisos Mountains, you can gaze across most of the park to distant mountain ranges in Mexico. From the depths of Santa Elena Canyon you can see only a thin ribbon of sky. A drive across Big Bend is also a vertical journey through sharply contrasting environments, an adventure for the perceptions. By walking one of the many short trails you can begin to discover the park's hidden life. Cactus flowers bloom from desert hardpan that is pocked with mysterious burrows. Painted buntings, summer tanagers, and other bird species that winter in the tropics next along the lush banks of the Rio Grande. At Big Bend, time has many dimensions. An abandoned ranch along Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive can evoke an entire era. At the Fossil Discovery Exhibit, prehistoric mammal bones are clues to the park's tropical past.",

The variety of features here show the result of erosion carving both the hard and soft rock layers, some of which are nearly horizontal while others dip at steep angles. The different colors result from minerals and weathering of the rocks.",

    "bodyText": "You are approaching an area known as Tornillo Flat, a long plain formed by the erosive action of Tornillo Creek and its tributaries. Prior to 1920, settlers describe Tornillo Flat as a grassland covered by tobosa grass. Pronghorn once ran here over the grassy flats. This grassland provided some of the best range in West Texas, allowing for the birth and growth of successful ranches.<br /> <br /> However, decades of overgrazing by livestock began to eliminate the grasses. Drought killed what remained. Once the protective grass cover was removed, erosion stripped the precious topsoil away and the land lost its ability to hold water. <br /> <br /> Can damaged lands be restored? The National Park Service has taken on the challenge of restoring native grasses with a long-term project called \"Grasslands Not Badlands.\" Over the years, and through trial and error, park staff have researched and developed different techniques to encourage growth of native grass species. A successful method has evolved to lay lines of dead vegetation perpendicular to the flow of water across the landscape. These strips slow the flow of run off after it rains and let the soil absorb more moisture. This technique is visible on both sides of the road between mile markers 11 and 10. ",
    "audioDescription": "Between mile markers 11 and 10, one has a good view of the sparsely vegetated flatlands surrounding the road. There are numerous areas where the ground is completely bare of living plants. In these bare areas, long lines of dead plant material such as branches and root balls have been laid out perpendicular to the direction water would flow. These piles have also been placed in depressions and other low areas where water might gather. If you didn't know otherwise, you might suppose that dead plant material was naturally deposited in those areas from gravity and rain. To the west of the road, one has their last good view of the Rosillos Mountains before leaving them behind.",

As the road gains elevation, different plants such as persimmon tree, littleleaf leadtree, mesquite, and yuccas become more prominent. The drive ends in an enclosed valley that hosts thousands of giant dagger yucca.

The Dead Horse are part of a larger range, the Sierra del Carmen, which extend into Mexico. The limestone in these mountains formed from sediments deposited by the last sea to cover this area. Millions of years later, the birth of the Rocky Mountains raised this land. Intense pressure uplifted and tilted great blocks of earth including the Sierra del Carmen and Dead Horse Mountain ranges. The Rio Grande cuts across this uplifted block, carving Boquillas Canyon, one of the park's three great canyons, with walls 1,200 feet high.  ",

They appear as one unbroken ridgeline, but they are in fact cut by numerous canyons. These canyons branch off into dry drainages, some of which are quite wide, and appear like long valleys between the higher ridges. Little water is present in these drainages, except following infrequent rains, so typical desert vegetation predominates.",

But some days the air quality is so poor that those mountains are lost in a haze of pollution. <br /> <br /> Over half of Big Bend's visibility impairment is due to sulfates, while organic carbons, nitrates, and wind-blown particles account for the remaining components. Sources of sulfate particles include coal-fired power plants, metal smelters, refineries, and other industrial facilities.<br /> <br /> Air quality here varies significantly by season. Prevailing winter winds are from the north and west, while summer winds are usually from the south and east. Air masses arriving from the southeast bring the highest concentrations of sulfates and create the poorest visibility. Research indicates that, during this peak period, pollution originates from sources in the eastern United States, east Texas, and northeast Mexico. <br /> <br /> What can be done? The National Park Service works cooperatively with the Environmental Protection Agency, the state of Texas, and Mexico to improve visibility in Big Bend. The use of modern emission-control technology on existing pollution sources, the careful placement and control of new industry, and the involvement of concerned citizens can help to restore visiblity.",

In fact, over 1,200 species of plants are found here. Because the land and climate can be uncompromising, life forms have adapted in remarkable ways. Dark colors absorb too much heat, so a strategy for plants to survive in the desert is to be light-colored. At some point during your visit, look closely at the plants (but not too close) and note that most of them are armed with thorns, spines, or barbs. The needles on plants prevent animals, including humans, from bothering them. On some plants the tightly netted spines provide shade and act as a windbreak.",

The molten material bulged into a mushroom shape, coming to rest on top of older rock layers and doming the others above it.

The Chisos Mountains to the north boast the highest peak in the park at 7,820 feet (2,383 meters) and rise dramatically from the lower desert.

Although the real source of the canyon's name is unknown, it was called \"Canon del Perro\" by the Spaniards in the late 1700s. When the United States won control of this Big Bend territory, the army was sent to map it. In the late 1850s numerous expeditions surveyed the area. The rugged terrain and climate caused the army to experiment with camels as beasts of burden. Lt. William Echols led his 1859 camel expedition through Dog Canyon. The unique experiment ended when the Civil War erupted. <br /> Ahead, a roadside exhibit gives more information about the camel experiment and expeditions. During cooler months, consider a half-day hike to Dog Canyon from the exhibit pullout.",

Some of the oldest rocks in the park reveal themselves in the walls of the canyon.",

Piles of large boulders and debris litter the base of the cliff where small shrubs and trees have been growing for the last 30 years.

Most of the year this unique plant appears to be nothing more than a cluster of gray thorny stalks that many people mistake for a cactus. With adequate rain, ocotillo will produce numerous bright green leaves that allow for a \"spurt\" of growth. When the soil dries, the leaves drop off to conserve moisture. Although the plant appears dormant, it can still photosynthesize through the green stripes on its bark.",
    "audioDescription": "One of the dominant plants in this section of the road is appears foreign to most people. It averages 6-10 feet (1.8-3.0 meters) in height and is composed of individual vertical stalks to normally do not branch. During dry periods, the stalk appears gray and lifeless, but when it rains the stalk swells up, turns brown and green and sprouts many small leaves all over the stalk.",

The Fossil Discovery Exhibit, 1/2 mile down the road, allows visitors to experience Big Bend's prehistoric plants and animals, and the world they lived in, through 130 million years of geologic time. Specimens from Big Bend's remarkable fossil record and vivid artwork illustrate the fascinating story of Big Bend's ancient life. A short trail also leads to a panoramic view of nearby geologic points of interest, and highlights the sediments that protect Big Bend's fossils. In addition to the main building and trail, the area around the exhibit includes covered picnic tables, a play area, and a vault toilet.<br />  ",

Next to the picnic tables is a kids play area with several structures made to look like dinosaur bones in the process of being excavated. A roughly 20-foot piece of metal has cut-outs that recreate a large dinosaur. The second \"activity area\" is the main exhibit, which is composed of several outdoor, covered rooms. These rooms are connected with a level floor and each hold glass displays that showcase fossils found in Big Bend National Park. In the central area, there are 3 casts of dinosaurs found in the park. The third \"activity area\" is a paved path that climbs a hill to an overlook. Spaced out along the paved path are three waysides discussing the geology of the area. Nearing the top of the hill the paved path ends and the trail becomes a series of rock steps that end at the top of the rise. There is one remaining wayside at the top of the hill that discusses the Chisos Mountains, which are visible to the south.",

For much of the journey, the trail crosses rolling desert terrain, descending into dry washes and climbing over low divides. Watch for cottonwood trees in the washes. Tallest of the desert trees, cottonwoods mark the location of a spring or water that is relatively close to the surface. Near the end of the trail, you'll skirt a large, rock corral. Continue past the corral and down the drainage to a small spring. The cool, shaded slope is covered with maidenhair ferns. Cattails line the slow-moving spring flow. Sit on the rocks and listen to the sound of water in the desert. Watch for birds coming into the trees, leopard frogs hopping into the water, and dragonflies patrolling the stream. <br /> <br /> Beyond the spring, the Mule Ears Trail connects to the Smoky Creek Trail. Smoky Creek is an 18.3-mile desert hike that connects to the northern end of the Dodson Trail. <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> Watch for loose gravel and unsteady footing on this rolling dirt and rock trail. You'll need to navigate a number of short, but steep climbs out of the washes and across the divides.<br /> <br /> The paved parking lot at the trailhead provides parking for about 15 vehicles. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail. ",
    "audioDescription": "The trailhead sign reads: \"Mule Ears Spring Trail. The Mule Ears Spring Trail leads across the foothills of the mountains, crossing various ridges before leading to a year-round spring. as the trail skirts around Trap Mountain, look for the large cottonwoods that mark Trap Spring on the northern end of the trail. Near the end of the trail is a rock corral. Dry stone construction like this was a popular way to build in the Big Bend, as it didn't require hauling mortar to remote locations. Nearly a century later, many of these walls are still intact, which is a testament to the skill of the builders. These walls have stood the test of time, but remain fragile. Visitors climbing on rock walls have damaged these structures. Just past the stone corral is Mule Ears Spring. The spring itself is overgrown with shrubs, but maidenhair ferns and cattails also grow there. Also look for riparian wildflowers such as cardinal flower, long-spur columbine, and orchids. Please tread lightly, never stepping or damaging this fragile vegetation.\" Beyond the trailhead sign, the rock and gravel path ascends a hill through desert scrub vegetation.",

    "bodyText": "Curtis and Nina Hannold started a ranch near this location in 1908. Like many early homesteaders in Big Bend country they had to be self-sufficient, resilient, and enterprising. Mr. Hannold supplemented the family income by teaching school at Dugout Wells, seven miles to the south. Stop at this exhibit to learn more about the Hannold family and why Nina chose this location for her final resting place.",
    "audioDescription": "Looking south from this wayside, one has a fantastic view of the Chisos Mountains, rising abruptly from the low desert. The highest point, Emory Peak (7,820 feet) is visible in the middle of the range. The gravesite and wayside are situated on a level bench with the paved road running to the west and a drainage carving the bench to the north. This location affords a 360 degree view, as there are no trees in the immediate area. Text on the wayside: \"This grave is one of the few visible traces of Curtis and Nina Hannold's pioneer homestead. In 1908 the Hannolds moved here from Oklahoma by covered wagon. While Nina took care of the ranch and three children, Curtis supplemented their income by teaching school at Dugout Wells eight miles away. At age 29, Nina contracted uremic poisoning during pregnancy, and died September 30, 1911. She asked to be buried on this hill overlooking the spring where she had often read to the children in the shade of the cottonwoods. There are other settler's stories scattered throughout Big Bend, but most of the evidence has been reclaimed by the desert or lost in the vastness.\"",

In 1914, he sold the land to Clyde Buttrill, who hired James Sublett to operate the farm and store previously run by Hernandez. Sublett built the adobe buildings located here before selling the land to two Texas Rangers, Bates and Jones, in 1918. The next year they sold the land to the newly formed La Harmonia Company.<br /> <br /> The La Harmonia Store opened in early 1919 and soon became an important part of the Castolon community, due to the integrity and common sense of Wayne Cartledge. Cartledge developed a reputation as a fair businessman who helped his neighbors, regardless of citizenship or language. Fluent in Spanish and English, he settled disputes, translated letters, provided banking services, and acted as a wholesale distributor of American-made merchandise bound for the remote villages of northern Mexico. In many ways, Wayne Cartledge seemed determined to validate La Harmonia’s name by working for peaceful and harmonious relations between the people of western Texas and northern Mexico.",
    "audioDescription": "Three adobe buildings lie ahead of the exhibit sign. A small building, a large one with a flat roof, and a second large building with a pointed tin roof stand next to a curve in the road. The surrounding open desert is interspersed with plants such as cacti, creosote bushes, and mesquite trees. Text on the Exhibit Panel La Harmonia Store: During the Mexican Revolution, life on the border was often chaotic. This adobe structure stood as a symbol of harmony in that perilous time. In 1918, Howard Perry, owner of the Chisos Mining Company in Terlingua, and his bookkeeper, Wayne Cartledge, established a new company called La Harmonia. Spanish for “Harmony,” the name reflected Cartledge’s hope for a peaceful relations among the people of southwest Texas and northern Mexico. The first La Harmonia store was housed in these adobe buildings from 1919 until the end of the Mexican Revolution in 1921. It stocked a variety of merchandise, catering to farmers on both sides of the Rio Grande. With the departure of U.S. Army troops, the store was relocated to its present location in the troop barracks of Castolon. Spanish Translation: Tienda La Harmonia: Durante la Revolución Mexicana, la vida en la frontera era caótica. Esta edificio de adobe se representó como un símbolo de harmonía en este tiempo tumulto. En 1918, Howard Perry, dueño de la compañía Chisos Mining en Terlingua, y su socio Wayne Cartledge, establecieron una nueva compañía llamada La Harmonía. Este nombre reflejo la esperanza de Cartledge de premover relaciones pacíficas entre la gente de Texas y México. Estos edificios de adobe sirvieron como la primera tienda La Harmonia desde 1919 hasta el fin de la Revolución en 1921. Ofreció un gran surtido a los agricultores y rancheros de ambos lados del río. Con la salida del cuerpo militar estadounidense, la tienda se mudó a las barracas militares de Castolon.",

    "bodyText": "Named for the Texas persimmon trees growing here, Persimmon Gap is an ancient place. Almost 300 million years ago, this area was a great mountain range. But even as the mountains rose, erosion wore them down. After millions of years, only gentle hills remained. Then the land slowly subsided until, 150 million years ago, a sea covered this area and buried the hills with sediment. Later, the same uplift that raised the Rocky Mountains raised the present-day Santiago Mountains around you. Their creation thrust up the long-buried rock from the older mountains. In the hills across the road from the visitor center that ancient rock is exposed...the oldest rock in the park!",
    "audioDescription": "Standing at Persimmon Gap, one feels like they have traveled through a man-made pass in the mountains. The Santiago range lies on both sides of the road, with the low gap offering the only passage through. Like entering a portal to a hidden valley, the landscape of Big Bend National Park stretches out before you. The Rosillos Mountains rise immediately to the south, offering a clue to the even higher Chisos Mountains that are just out of view.",

Here they dug a well, put in a garden, and built holding pens for horses, chickens, and a milk cow. Like other ranchers in the area, the Nails ran stock and dealt with drought, predators, and isolation. The Nail Family has left the Big Bend, but the well they dug still pumps, keeping their trees and shrubs alive. Listen for birdsong, and rustlings in the grass.

The old road curve was known as Dead Man's Curve, due to a shooting that occurred here in the early 20th century.",

Above those cliffs, black bear and Montezuma quail roam a mountain wilderness of ponderosa pine forest and wildflower meadows. Birds and whitetail deer native to the Sierra del Carmen are often sighted in Big Bends' Chisos Mountains - across an international border but part of the same ecosystem.",

The first part of the trail is a boardwalk over a small pond that showcases riparian plants and animals. The trail proceeds up and around a small ridge that has a 360-degree view of the Rio Grande, the Sierra del Carmens in Mexico, and the Chisos Mountains in the park.<br /> <br /> This trail is great for first time as well as seasoned visitors. The mornings are alive with birdsong and animal life, and the late evenings showcase the colors of a typical Big Bend sunset.  <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> This trail begins from the back end of the campground. A level path leads to a wheelchair-accessible boardwalk that crosses a wetland area. The trail then becomes dirt and gravel and climbs to the top of, and back down, a small hill with the aid of wooden logs for steps. <br /> There are two small pullouts at the back end of the campground which provide parking for about four cars.  <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail. ",
    "audioDescription": "The Rio Grande Village Nature trail begins near site 18 in the campground. Surrounding the trailhead is a dense thicket of mesquite, huisache, willows, and other riparian plants. Just 100 feet down the trail you reach the pond, which is surrounded by cane. A short bridge crosses the pond and brings you to the higher portion of the trail. As you leave the pond, there is a change to common Chihuahuan desert plants like prickly pear cactus and creosote bush. The creosote has a pungent odor which is unmistakable. As you follow the trail, a vista provides views to the south into Mexico, to the village of Ojo Caliente. The terrain on both sides of the river are very similar. When you reach the top of the trail, about 200 feet higher than the pond, a sweeping vista of the surrounding area awaits. You can see the Sierra del Carmen mountains to the east and the Chisos Mountains to the west. The trail then leads back down the hill and returns to the pond and the trailhead.",

The sandy floodplain around you is home to tail-dragging lizards, long-eared jackrabbits, raccoons, and other animals. Take some time to explore the river and its surroundings. Listen for bird song and the splashes of turtles entering the water. Peer into the river and search for fish. Close your eyes and feel the wind against your skin, the warmth of the sun, and notice the lack of loud noises. Many people say one of the things that impresses them the most about Big Bend is the silence. What do you hear at this location?",
    "audioDescription": "Standing on the bank of the Rio Grande one can see across into Mexico. Depending on the time of year, the river can vary between one to five feet deep, and have a flow between 20-500 cubic feet per second. The majority of the year it holds around two to three feet deep. As the river flows downstream through this area it butts up against a limestone cliff, which causes it to curve to the left.",

The Big Bend Mosquitofish, Gambusia gaigei, is an endangered species that inhabits this warm fresh-water spring, and is found nowhere else in the entire world. This rare fish has the smallest range of any vertebrate and its survival is threatened by the Western Moquitofish, Gambusia affinis. It is believed the Western Mosquitofish entered this pond courtesy of periodic flooding of the Rio Grande. The National Park Service provides protected breeding ponds to ensure the survival of the Big Bend Mosquitofish.",

As at the first stop, one is completely surrounded by tall cane. Looking over the side of the platform and into the water reveals both mosquitofish and tilapia swimming in the pond.",

    "bodyText": "One of the most bizarre-looking plants found along this trail is the ocotillo. At first glance, ocotillo (pronounced “Oh-co-TEE-yo”) looks like a tall, spindly shrub that died - a cluster of drab, gray stalks covered in sharp half inch spines, and no obvious signs of life like leaves along the branches. This bare bones appearance is actually part of ocotillo’s desert survival strategy. Plants lose most of their water through their leaves during photosynthesis. Ocotillo and several other desert plants have adapted to desert life by moving the photosynthesis into their stems. This strategy of photosynthesis is not as efficient or as productive as in typical plants, but the plants do save a lot of water and that is the principal issue for a desert dweller. Leaves are either not produced, or only produced during wet times of the year when the water losses are affordable to the plant. <br /> The real surprise though is in the spring when seemingly “dead stalks” of ocotillo burst into bloom. Slender clusters of bright red orange, tubular flowers form at the ends of the stalks, and in areas with abundant ocotillo plants it can look like a red haze is hanging just above the plants from a distance! Ocotillo are often mistaken for cactus, but in fact they are a member of a small, unrelated family of primarily South American plants, of which it is the northernmost representative. ",

The River Spur Trail contours along limestone ledges for a short distance before becoming a sandy path that ends at the Rio Grande. The river provides opportunities to view wildlife, especially birds, turtles, and fish. <br /> The Overlook Loop Trail climbs a limestone hill to a rocky outcrop that provides great views of the Rio Grande, the Sierra del Carmens, and the Mexican towns of Boquillas and Ojo Caliente. This hilltop is one of the best locations in the park from which to view both sunrise and sunset. As the name implies, the Loop Trail reconnects with the Nature Trail at a point previously passed on this trail. ",
    "audioDescription": "At this junction one has a choice between taking a trail to the right, which slowly descends to the Rio Grande, or staying on the main trail, which climbs the nearby hill. A brown metal sign at the junction says River Spur Trail with an arrow pointing to the right, and Overlook Loop Trail, with an arrow pointing straight ahead. The green vegetation that surrounds the Rio Grande is visible off to the right.",

The mortars are archeological features once used by indigenous hunter-gatherer bands of Big Bend to prepare food. Native peoples returned to these sites to grind seeds and vegetation for consumption using stone or wooden pestles. Baked sotol and lechuguilla, pinon nuts, and prickly pear fruits are among the foods once prepared in the mortars.<br /> While it is difficult to date the use of mortars with certainty, archeologists believe that certain sites in the Park were used seasonally for up to four thousand years. Though simple in appearance, the number and grouping of mortars may be able to tell us both about size and social structure of the bands using them. Two to seven mortars are typically spaced at the distance a few people preparing food could converse. Their presence near springs, water holes, and the Rio Grande underscores the importance of reliable water sources to humans in the area.",

Due to its length and usually rough road conditions, allow a full day to drive from end to end.<br /> <br /> Before heading out on this road, be well prepared for safe backcountry driving with plenty of water, a jack, and good spare tire.

Highlights include spending time in one of the most remote areas in the lower 48 states, and visiting several historic sites along the way, including the remains of the Mariscal Mine.

The river eroded through the surface layers and cut steep-sided canyons in the more resistant Lower Cretaceous limestones. Today you can see those ancient limestone formations exposed in the canyon walls.

At river level one sees a mixture of Chihuauan desert plants such as cacti and shrubs, as well as mesquite trees, tamarisk, and giant cane. The imposing limestone walls of the canyon rise 1,500 feet above the river, visible for many miles to the east and west. Text for the 1st Exhibit Panel: River Running: On any day you might see rafts emerge from Santa Elena Canyon. Modern equipment and techniques enable river runners to negotiate the rapids upstream, but the trip was not always this safe. Unable to scout the broken, almost impassable terrain, the 1852 Boundary Survey launched an empty wooden boat at the canyon entrance. Only splinters and broken planks emerged at the canyon mouth. In 1882 a team of surveyors an Texas Rangers made the first documented journey through Santa Elena Canyon, though they portaged around the Rock Slide. Once they entered the sheer-walled gorge there was no escape, no place to climb out. Spanish translation of 1st Exhibit Panel: El viajar en balsa: En cualquier día se puede ver balsas salir del Cañón de Santa Elena. Los equipos y las técnicas modernas permiten a los viajeros en balsa dirigir los rabíon, pero el viaje no siempre fue tan seguro. Por no poder de explorar el terreno quebrantado e intransitable, en 1852 la Agrimensura Internacional de Fronteras soltó una lancha de madera vacía a la entrada del cañón. Solo las astillas y las tablas rotas salieron de la boca del cañón. En 1882, un equipo de agrimensores y los Texas Rangers hicieron el primer viaje documentado por el Cañón de Santa Elena, aunque transportaro sus balsas alrededor del Resbaladero de Piedra. Una vez que entraron en la garganta de lados abruptos no hubía ningún escape, ni lugar a donde salir. Text for the 2nd Exhibit Panel: Santa Elena Canyon: Except during flood season, the quiet waters below do not seem powerful enough to have carved Santa Elena Canyon. Hike the short trail to the river and look closely at the water, cloudy with sand and silt. Like liquid sand paper, the swift current files away at Santa Elena’s hard limestone, cutting it deeper. In a raft or canoe you can actually hear the grit hissing along the hull. Spanish translation of 2nd Exhibit Panel: Cañón de Santa Elena: Con la excepción del tiempo de inundación, las aguas tranquilas no parecen ser lo suficientemente fuertes para haber excavado el Cañón de Santa Elena. Camine por el sendero corto hacia el río y observe atentamente que el agua se oscurece, por arena y cieno. Como líquido de papel de abrasivo, la corriente rápida lima la piedra caliza de Santa Elena, cortándola más profundamente. En una balsa o en una canoa se puede escuchar el silbido de los granos de arena raspando la corteza.",

To access the trail, hikers must first cross the bed of Terlingua Creek, and climb a short but steep bank. Conditions change constantly at this location. As the trail enters the canyon mouth, it climbs a series of concrete steps to a high viewpoint. From the viewpoint, the trail slopes gradually down to the river’s edge and continues winding among large boulders until it ends abruptly where the canyon wall meets the Rio Grande. This is one of the narrowest places in the seven-mile long Santa Elena Canyon. Rest for a bit, and listen for the descending notes of the canyon wren or the call of the raven high along the canyon walls.</p> <h4><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Safety Alert: Santa Elena Canyon Trail</span></strong></h4> <p>To access the trail into the canyon, you must first cross the bed of Terlingua Creek, and climb a short but steep bank. Conditions change constantly at this location. Depending upon recent rains, Terlingua Creek may be dry sand, thick mud, or flowing water. Carefully assess conditions before attempting to cross. Many hikers try to keep their feet dry and take long circuitous routes up Terlingua Creek into dangerous cliff areas. This is NOT the maintained trail and can be extremely dangerous. </p> <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> <p>This trail may be impassable due to flooding during the summer rainy season. Check with park staff about the current trail condition. Wear old shoes in case the Terlingua Creek crossing is muddy. If the water here is deep and swift,<u> do not cross</u>. Just enjoy the spectacular views into the canyon, and try again in drier weather.<br /> <br /> A paved parking lot at the trailhead provides parking for about 20 vehicles.</p> <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <p><strong><em>Bring plenty of water!</em></strong><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Eat</em></strong><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Sun protection</em></strong><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun.<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Don't leave people behind</em></strong><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Be aware of wildlife</em></strong><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed or fed.<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Don't stack rocks</em></strong><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The trailhead is located next to a horseshoe-shaped parking lot at the end of Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive. Past the trailhead, you will walk through a wall of heavy vegetation composed primarily of tamarisk and willows, until you come the banks of the Rio Grande and Terlingua Creek. The high limestone walls of Santa Elena Canyon are visible where the Rio Grande exits the canyon. The trail gradually enters the canyon and parallels the right wall until reaching a point where one can walk no further on dry land. A mixture of desert plants such as blind prickly pear and Hechtia share the landscape with giant cane and other river plants. Text From Santa Elena Canyon Trail Exhibit: \"The trail enters between the walls of spectacular Santa Elena Canyon, and ends where the cliffs meet the Rio Grande. The walls of the Canyon rise 1,500 feet from the banks of the Rio Grande, making this one of the most dramatic and popular places to view the river. The sheer face of this canyon was formed by the Terlingua Fault, which is mostly covered in gravel. Calcite crystals filled in cracks formed by this fault and can be seen along the trail. The deepest channel of the Rio Grande is the international boundary, with each half of this canyon protected by a national park. The southern side belongs to the Area Protegida del Cañón de Santa Elena (Mexico) and the northern side is within Big Bend National Park (USA). During wet times, abrupt rises to Terlingua Creek can make this trail impassable. Always watch for distant rainfall that could lead to flash flooding to avoid becoming stranded within the canyon. Trail Rules: No pets or bicycles on any trails No collecting or possessing plants, animals, minerals, or artifacts Do not feed or approach wildlife Pack out your trash All boating/rafting requires a permit Drone/UAV use prohibited within the park\"",

    "bodyText": "James and Melissa Belle Sublett arrived in the Castolon area in 1913. In 1914, the Subletts moved into the Alvino House, running the store for four years before starting large-scale farming in the area. In 1918, Sublett purchased four sections of land at this location, and called his operation Grand Canyon Farms. Mr. Sublett was one of the first settlers in the Big Bend area to actively farm the Rio Grande floodplain on a large scale. Using mule-drawn Fresno scrapers and lightweight blades he owned from his days as an earth moving contractor for the Southern Pacific Railroad, Sublett leveled fields and improved irrigation in the Castolon area.<br /> <br /> Over the years, the floodplain the Subletts farmed has become overgrown with mesquite and tamarisk trees. The National Park Service is attempting, to a certain degree, to restore the historic landscape at the Sublett farm using mechanical brush removal and prescribed fire. When the property became part of Big Bend National Park, it was unfortunately demolished, as it was not part of the natural landscape and was not yet considered to be of historical value.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The foundation of the former Sublett house sits atop a mesa. In the distance the Chisos Mountains, Emory Peak, and Mule Ears are visible to the north and east; Santa Elena Canyon is to the southwest. At the bottom of the hill a dirt trails winds through grasses and cacti to a small grove of mesquites. From the ruins of the Sublett’s stone farmhouse, the Dorgan-Sublett trail leads down to the historic La Casita adobe structure, or across the mesa top to the Dorgan House. Text on the Exhibit Panel Vanishing Heritage: In 1918 the Subletts built an adobe house on this hilltop with an extraordinary view over their farmland on the Rio Grande floodplain below. Now all that remains is the view. In the early years of Big Bend National Park, historic structures like the Sublett adobe were either destroyed or allowed to deteriorate because they were not thought of as part of the natural scenery. Today historic preservation treatments protect these traces of a vanishing heritage. Spanich Translation: Patrimonio desaperecido: En 1918, los Subletts construyeron una casa de adobe aquí en esta colina con una vista importante sobre sus cultivos abajo en los terrenos aluviales del río Bravo. Hoy solo queda es la gran vista. En los primeros años del Parque Nacional Big Bend, las estructuras históricas como esta casa fueron desrrumbadas o dejadas caer sin reparacion porque no fueron consideradas parte del paisaje natural. Hoy en día, los tratamientos de preservación histórica conservan estos vestigios de un patrimonio desapereciendo.",

During wetter periods Oak Creek may be flowing, and must be crossed several times. Use caution on this trail: the top of the Window pour-off is slickrock with no railings. Keep in mind that it is an easy downhill walk to the Window, but the return trip is a challenging climb of 900 feet. It is important to start this hike early in the morning to avoid hiking during the heat of the day. Bring more water than you think you will need! <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The trailhead begins from a paved walkway near the Chisos Basin Store and quickly transitions to dirt. The first mile of the trail is the steepest, with wooden log steps to break up the descent down the rocky dirt path. The last 0.25 mile of the hike is in a slickrock canyon where footing becomes difficult. The combination of rocky steps and wet, slippery surfaces requires extra care and attention to avoid a fall. <h4><strong>Hike Smart</strong></h4> <em>Bring plenty of water!</em><br /> Carry 1 liter of water per person per hour that you plan to hike. The importance of carrying enough water in this hot, dry climate cannot be overstated!<br /> <br /> <em>Eat</em><br /> Your body needs food for energy and salts and electrolytes to replace what it's losing from perspiration. The dry climate at Big Bend means that sweat often evaporates almost instantly; your body is likely losing lots of moisture and salts without you even realizing it. Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed or fed.<br /> <br /> <em>Don't stack rocks</em><br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow. Randomly stacked rocks can lure hikers off the correct trail.<br />  ",

Here, Blue Creek, fed by rains in the distant Chisos Mountains, has carved a spectacular canyon through layers of volcanic tuff and basalt.<br /> <br /> 30 million years ago, ash and particles ejected from a nearby volcanic vent accumulated here while still glowing hot.

    "audioDescription": "From the trailhead, one has a great view into the canyon below, as well as the surrounding desert terrain. Nearby to the southeast is the prominent peak known as Cerro Castellan. The canyon is composed of a relatively soft, crumbly gray rock known as tuff. After heavy rains it is possible to hear the sound of large amounts of water flooding the canyon on its way to the Rio Grande.",

After navigating a small pouroff, follow cairns through the boulders. Some boulder-scrambling is required. The first canyon empties into a sandy wash. Follow the wash until you reach a deeper slick-rock pouroff that drops into a grotto-like cavern. Again, moderate bouldering skills are necessary to climb back out of the grotto. If you're sure you can get back out, descend into the grotto. The trail ends at the Burro Mesa Pouroff—a steep chute that funnels water to the drainage below after a heavy rain.  <h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4> The trail is rocky in parts and sandy once you reach the wash. Boulder-scrambling is required in several places. <br /> A paved pullout at the trailhead provides parking for about 6 vehicles. <h4><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Georgia, Times, \"Times New Roman\", serif; font-size: 1.5625rem; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Warning</span></strong></h4> Do not hike this trail during stormy weather.

Eat plenty of salty snacks to keep your body's salt-to-water ratio in balance.<br /> <br /> <em>Sun protection</em><br /> Carry sunscreen and use it liberally. Hats are also strongly recommended. It may seem strange to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants in hot weather, but many hikers choose lightweight, breathable clothing which covers their arms and legs to protect themselves from the sun. <br /> <br /> <em>Don't leave people behind</em><br /> If you're hiking in a group, make sure the person in the back always has someone to help.<br /> <br /> <em>Be aware of wildlife</em><br /> Keep an eye out for snakes, and remember to maintain a safe distance between yourself and all wildlife. Animals in the park are wild and should never be approached, harassed, or fed.<br /> <br /> Don't stack rocks<br /> Cairns are stacks of rocks which are sometimes used to mark trails in areas where they are hard to follow.

From a distance the peaks appear treeless, but the Chisos' higher slopes are forested with oak, pine, and juniper. As you travel the park, be alert to subtle differences in vegetation and wildlife habitat. Change elevation, and encounter different worlds. As you ascend Chisos Basin Drive, desert scrub gradually turns to grassland, scattered junipers begin to appear, and dense woodland fills the highest canyons.

At the end of the trail is a volcanic dike. This magma intrusion forms a barrier that forces groundwater to the surface, creating Ward Spring. The spring itself is not accessible, surrounded by a dense growth of willow, walnut, and sumac. Ward Spring was named for Johnnie Ward, cowboy on the G4 Ranch. At age 15 he started working for the ranch and quickly provided his worth, earning respect among his peers. In 1884 he discovered a new spring after a blizzard replenished the area's water sources. The ranch manager named it Ward Spring in his honor. Homer Wilson purchased this land in 1929 and established a sheep and goat ranch. He set up a system of irrigation pipes and tanks to provide water for his livestock. Part of this pipe system can still be seen along this trail today.\" In the distance is an igneous dike running parallel to the road. The tops of trees are framed by a notch in the dike. The trees indicate the location of Ward Spring.",

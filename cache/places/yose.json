    "bodyText": "<p>Starting in 1891, U.S. Army soldiers were among the first guardians of the recently established Yosemite National Park, protecting the park for twenty-three years before the creation of the National Park Service in 1916. The Army was well-suited for the work. Troops patrolled the park’s backcountry to ensure the land was protected from illegal grazing, poaching, and logging. Each summer, over 200 soldiers, usually cavalry, rode from the Presidio of San Francisco to protect both Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks. In 1899, 1903, and 1904, African-American buffalo soldiers also served in the Sierra Nevada.</p> <p>Yosemite encompasses vast areas of rugged, roadless terrain. To access such remote places for patrolling, Army officers trained in engineering at West Point supervised the construction of vital infrastructure such as roads, trails, and buildings. These challenging construction efforts gave birth to Yosemite’s backcountry trail system, used by hikers today.</p> <p>The Acting Superintendent’s Office was the headquarters for the Army officer in charge of Yosemite National Park. This building was originally constructed at Camp A.E. Wood, the present-day site of the Wawona Campground. Named after Captain Abram Epperson Wood, the first Army officer to serve as Acting Superintendent of Yosemite National Park, Camp A.E. Wood was the summer home for U.S. Army troops from 1891 through 1905. In 1906, the State of California returned Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove to the federal government to be managed as part of Yosemite National Park, and the headquarters moved to Yosemite Valley. Later this building was moved to the Yosemite History Center.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This small A-frame wooden cabin has an orange door located left of center. There is a cement patio and a shingled porch roof, slanting downward from the building, held up by two wooden posts. A single window sits above the porch and a smoke stack off the left side of the roof. Between the porch roof and the window is a black and white sign that reads: Office of the Acting Superintendent, Yosemite National Park. A flagpole waving the American flag and picnic table are in front of this structure. An exhibit sign reads: On October 1, 1890, a national preserve of 932,600 acres was established, surrounding Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias. Between 1891 and 1913, cavalry troops from the Presidio in San Francisco spent the summer months here to protect and administer the area. After several seasons, they succeeded in abating sheep herding in the delicate high country meadows. The troops built miles of high Sierra trails for patrol purposes, trails suitable for visitors as well. In addition, they dealt with wildfires, poachers and lost travelers. This particular building was erected in Wawona as headquarters for the commanding officer who acted as superintendent of the Park. From here, troops visited the big trees, patrolled the high country and stocked lakes and streams with trout to provide fine angling.",

    "bodyText": "<p><i>“Half Dome was perfectly inaccessible, being probably the only one of all the prominent points about Yosemite which has never been and will never be trodden by human foot.” </i>Josiah Whitney, California State Geologist, 1869</p> <p>George Anderson, a Scottish immigrant, came to Yosemite around 1868, working a variety of jobs to make ends meet in Yosemite Valley during the warm summer months. During the winter, Anderson lived in this modest cabin, which was originally located in Big Meadow (now Foresta).</p> <p>Anderson applied his skills as a blacksmith and trail builder to open new pathways for sharing the beauties of Yosemite. His most daunting challenge was to find a way to the “perfectly inaccessible” summit of Half Dome, and through persistence, innovation, and guts, Anderson became the first known person known to have accomplished that feat. On that final steep slab of Half Dome, Anderson drilled holes and hammered in iron bolts of his own making, precariously standing on each bolt while painstakingly driving in the next. Shortly after his first ascent of Half Dome, Anderson began guiding others to the top.</p> <p>Besides creating this adventurous and popular hiking route up Half Dome, Anderson also built several other famous trails in Yosemite, including sections of the Mist Trail to Vernal and Nevada Fall.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This small log cabin has a steep roof, with rows of vertical shingles. it has a door made of vertical wooden planks, set left of center, with a larger window to its right and a small window to its left. A stone chimney rises up along the right sight of the structure. An exhibit sign reads: Mountaineer Artists' paintings excited the curiosity of folks, and interest in the area grew rapidly. In 1864, the Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias were granted to California as a public trust. At first, travel into these areas was only on foot or horseback. But soon, nationwide and local improvements in transportation, such as the transcontinental railroad (1869) and stage roads into Yosemite Valley (1874), made travel more practical. Men such as Scots emigrant George Anderson proved many of these visitors needs, serving as blacksmiths, cooks, and trail guides. Anderson himself built many of the trails still used in the Valley area. In October, 1875, he succeeded in scaling the back side of Half Dome, and visitors used his rope for several years thereafter to make their own ascents. Anderson used this floorless cabin as his residence at Big Meadow, northwest of Yosemite Valley, when not working elsewhere in the area.",

After visiting Yosemite for the first time in 1898, Jorgensen was granted permission to build a home and a studio on the banks of the Merced River in Yosemite Valley (near today's Sentinel Bridge). From this summer home, Jorgensen produced paintings of his famous surroundings. For twenty years, he lived among the towering cliffs and waterfalls with his wife and fellow artist Angela.</p> <p>Chris Jorgensen often worked with watercolors, allowing for quick, spontaneous paintings to be completed in the field, rather than in the studio. He loved plein air painting, or painting outdoors. Beyond providing shade, the umbrella he holds in the image below helped with color perception in the harsh sunlight.</p> <p>The bungalow in the Yosemite History Center, part of Jorgensen's Yosemite property, represents an era when artists were some of the best advocates for the preservation of wild places. Yosemite’s landscapes inspired artists to create, and as they shared their art with those unable to experience nature’s beauty first-hand, their creations inspired others to preserve Yosemite as a public park.</p> <p>Even today, Yosemite stirs visitors to connect creatively with the landscape. Photos, paintings, and written accounts of Yosemite are now more popular, and more shareable, than ever.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Upon entering the Badger Pass Ski Area, ski slopes and chairlifts can immediately be seen in the distance. Driving further onto the property, parking spots start to become available on both sides of the road before approaching the main ski lodge, which is on the right. The ski lodge is a two-story building and has two dining areas, an activity's desk, a sports shop, locker rooms, and alpine rental shop. On the back side of the ski lodge are several ski slopes, differing in grade and difficulty level, a few chairlifts, and an A-frame ranger station. Back in front of the ski lodge, the road continues past a Nordic ski center on the left, which is in a brown trailer, before circling around into a large parking area. Some parking spaces are labeled for overnight parking only, and requires a wilderness permit. All other parking spots are available to all visitors. The road eventually loops back around to the ski lodge area, with the option to turn right to exit the premises and meet up with the Tioga Road.",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit is the second stop of 12 on the Big Trees Loop Tour. A wooden boardwalk with wood and metal fencing, curves outward to get a closer look at the trees. Several giant sequioas line the path ahead and make other visitors look small. Shrubs and saplings are near to the fence, while some large, mature sequoias can be seen in the distance. A wayside exhibit adhered to the wooden fence is titled, Anatomy of a Giant. Panel text reads, these massive trees grow bigger and live longer than almost any other living things on earth. Which of the following factors do you think is most important to their longevity? <br /><br />Insulating Bark - Rich with tannins and up to two feet (.61 m) thick, giant sequoia bark protects the trees from threats such as fire, insects, and disease. <br /><br />Many Tiny Seeds - Germinating from a seed no bigger than an oat flake, a mature giant sequoia can produce as many as 400,000 seeds per year. <br /><br />Lifelong Growth - Sequoias never stop growing. They are among the fastest growing trees on earth and continue adding volume throughout their lives. <br /><br />Widespread Roots - Sequoia root systems grow out, not down, and extend 100-200 feet (30-60 m) from a tree's trunk. These shallow roots can fuse with other giant sequoias in order to share resources, as opposed to competing for them. <br /><br />Bronze Tactile Relief: a section of a sequoia tree trunk is located to the immediate left of the exhibit panel. It has bumpy striations running up and down it.<br /><br />Illustration: A cross section of a sequioa tree and its roots cover the right side and bottom of the exhibit panel. Below ground, the roots are very shallow and spread throughout the bottom of the panel. Above ground, the thick tree trunk rises off the panel, before it reaches the crown. A separate illustration of a sequioa cone shows an egg shaped cone, the criss-crossing indentations. Three small, oat-like seeds fall from it.",

A long wood bench with metal armrests is along the fence. A wayside exhibit adhered to the wooden fence is titled, How Giants Fall. Panel text reads, giant sequoias can live and grow for thousands of years. They can survive lightning strikes, fires, droughts, and winter snows. They have natural defenses against insects and fungus. But they are not invincible.<br /><br />Severe, repeated fires and soil erosion can weaken the sequoias' foundations, making them vulnerable to toppling under pressure from heavy snow or high winds. <br /><br />Humans threaten the giant sequoias as well. In the early history of California, people logged thousands of sequoias, carved tunnels through trees, and created roads and trails that damaged roots and interfered with water flow. Now human-caused threats, such as air pollution, pathogens, and climate change may jeopardize the trees' long-term survival. Their future depends on how we treat the earth. <br /><br />Illustration: The large trunk of a giant sequoia tree is leaning to the right, as roots snap, and are unearthed from the ground, as if it's in the midst of falling.",

A wooden boardwalk with wood and metal fencing, curves outward to get a closer look young giant sequoias and saplings near the boardwalk. Shrubs and other plants and trees grow in this area. A long wood bench with metal armrests is near the center of the boardwalk, while a single-person bench with a back and arm rest is next to the fence. A wayside exhibit adhered to the wooden fence is titled, Stages of Life. Panel text reads, each tiny sequoia seed has the potential to become a mighty tree, but only few encounter the right conditions to reach maturity. The slender young sequoias around you beat great odds in finding the perfect mixture of soil moisture, temperature, and sunlight necessary to germinate and grow.<br /><br />Over the next few centuries, these slim saplings may grow to be 250-300 feet (76-91 m) tall. They will increase in volume, developing wide buttresses at their bases. Their upper limbs will expand, becoming as thick as the trunks of other trees, and their lower limbs will drop off. After they reach their full height, their crowns will become round, often with a broken (or snag) top. <br /><br />Illustration: Four trees are side by side. A small sapling, a larger cone-shaped tree, which is a young sequoia, a tall giant sequoia that has a full, round crown, and a larger giant sequioa with a snagged trunk at its top.",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit is the ninth stop of 12 on the Big Trees Loop Tour. A dirt path lined with wood railings, leads to a massive giant sequoia, that is about 26 feet in diameter and over 200 feet long, laying on the ground, with its large root system exposed at its right end. The roots of the tree about are about 20 to 25 feet in height and look like a wood coral reef, with multiple branches curling and extending upward. A cross-cut of a tree trunk is nearby and used for seating purposes. A wayside exhibit titled, The Fallen Monarch is next to the path. Panel text reads, an enduring mystery, no one knows how old this tree is or when it fell. Initially encounted by the Traditionally Associated Tribes of Yosemite and later photographed with countless visitors, it remains a memorable feature of the grove.<br /><br />Although the bark and sapwood have decayed, the remaining heartwood is fortified with tannins. This natural compound protects the tree, and it may take several more centuries to decompose. <br /><br />Illustration: A fallen tree lays on the ground.

    "audioDescription": "Approaching the Big Trees Loop Trailhead from either the parking area or the shuttle drop off area, the most noticeable feature is the fenced-in pathway that zigzags between towering giant sequoias as it makes its way deeper into the grove. <br /><br />On the right side of the path entranceway sits a row of trash and recycle bins and a split log that serves as a long bench. To the left of the entranceway are several interpretive panels, a drinking fountain, and a bronze, tactile relief model of the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias (Caution: The bronze, tactile relief model is often in direct sunlight and could be too hot to touch). <br /><br />Three interpretive panels are lined up against a waist high fence. The first panel is titled A Way of Life Continues and explains the origins of stewardship of the grove by local native tribes, the Bishop Paiute Tribe, Bridgeport Indian Colony, Mono Lake Kutzadika Tribe, North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians of California, Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians, Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, and Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians. There is a sepia toned picture of a group of people, with a caption that reads, some members of the Tribal Working Group, Yosemite Conservancy, and NPS staff. There is also an area titled Greetings from the Traditionally Associated Tribes of Yosemite National Park, that contains five different tribal translations. There is also a map that shows the ancestral homelands of the park's Traditionally Associated Tribes, which are marked by a red dot in areas surrounding Yosemite. <br /><br />The second panel is titled Visiting the Mariposa Grove. There is a map showing all the trails in the Mariposa Grove, and a list containing hiking trail options that range from easy, to moderate, to strenuous. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. A call-out box titled Grove Etiquette reads, You are visiting a truly special place. Please take care to not damage this grove or impact the experience of other visitors. Please stay on designated trails and respect fenced areas. Be a steward of the grove - please no climbing or graffiti. Strive to leave no trace. No dogs, no collecting, no bikes. <br /><br />A third panel is titled A Legacy of Conservation and shows a sepia toned picture of Abraham Lincoln, as well as a picture of a National Park Service (NPS) uniform hat and belt, to show the significance of the sequoia cones featured on both the NPS uniform hat band and belt.<br /><br />A sign at the trailhead reads, Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias.",

In spring, it thunders; you can expect to get wet! In some cases the spray is so strong, you may not even be able to easily access the end of the trail. During the rest of the year, look for its characteristic light, swaying flow. Expect icy and very slick conditions in winter. A paved trail leads from the parking area to the base of this waterfall, which flows year-round. Although paved, this is trail is not wheelchair accessible due to its grade.</p> <h3>Overview</h3> <ul> <li>0.5 mi. (0.8 km) round trip</li> <li>80 feet (24 m) elevation gain</li> </ul> <h3>Hours</h3> <p>Year-round</p> <h3>Getting Here</h3> <p>Located in Yosemite Valley at the intersection of Southside Drive and Wawona Road (Highway 41).</p> <h3>Rules & Regulations</h3> <ul> <li>Leashed pets are allowed on this trail.</li> <li>Keep your food within arm's reach at all times and do not feed the wildlife.</li> <li>Carry out all trash and food waste (fruit peels, shells, etc.).</li> </ul> <h3>Hazards & Warnings</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Stay back from the stream.</strong> The boulders are treacherously slick. If you fall in, icy water will quickly incapacitate you and the strong currents can batter you to death against the rocks.</li> <li>You may store food inside your car (out of sight, with windows completely closed) only during daylight hours. Empty your car of all food, drinks, coolers, toiletries, and trash after dark. Even an empty candy bar wrapper is enough temptation to entice a bear to break into your car. Vehicles containing food after dark may be impounded and/or cited.</li> </ul> <h3>Accessibility</h3> <p>The base of Bridalveil Fall is not wheelchair accessible due to its grade.</p> <h3> </h3>",

The sign reads Cathedral Lakes, and has an icon of a backpacker and an arrow that points south. Limited roadside parking is available on both sides of the road. The northside of the road is an open meadow with panoramic views, while the south side of the road is forest. Along the roadside parking, near the beginning of the Cathedral Lakes Trail are four brown food lockers, three green recycle bins, three brown trash bins, then another six food lockers. A little further down the road are five portable restrooms, summer only. A yellow metal sign with a black outline and black text reads, warning, bear damage is common in this parking area. The sight or odor of food in your vehicle greatly increases the chance of your car being damaged! Federal regulations state that all food be removed from your vehicle and stored in the bear-proof boxes located in each campsite. Don't be bear careless! An illustration of a black bear is at the top of the sign. <br /><br />A wooden sign at the trailhead has text carved out of it that reads, Cathedral Lakes - 3.5 miles, Sunrise H.S.C. - 7.8 miles, and Yosemite Valley - 21 miles. The dirt path descends into the forest. A slender, four-sided, wooden post sticks out of the ground and reads, no camping, on all four sides.",

    "audioDescription": "Approaching Cooks Meadow can be a different experience throughout the seasons. In summer, the plants and grasses in the meadow are tall, erect, and green. In fall, the plants and grasses appear to be trampled, lay flat, and look dry, and yellow. In winter, the meadow may be snow-covered, and in spring, it may glisten and sparkle first thing in the morning due to frost. There is a raised boardwalk that circles the meadow with wayside exhibits along the way. From the middle of the meadow, trees no longer obscure the view, and a 360 degree panoramic view of the near 3,000 foot cliff walls open up. Facing north, the upper Yosemite Falls is showcased above the treeline. To the east, the iconic Half Dome is seen, also above the treeline. To the south, Glacier Point and Sentinel Rock rise above the treeline, and to the west, the length of the valley walls go into the distance and curve to the right, showing off the mighty works glaciers played in carving out such a broad valley.",

From 1858 to the present, eighteen hotels and inns have been built in many parts of the Valley. Other conveniences such as saloons, boathouses, photographic studios, laundries, and livery stables once dotted the landscape. In the early 1900s, less than 10,000 people per year visited this Valley. Most of them complained of dust from wagon wheels and hoofed animals, smells made by the livestock, and landscapes spoiled by farming and grazing. There were telegraph and telephone wires, power poles, and poor sewer systems. At that time, an awareness was growing that special places should be spared from these types of intrusions.</p> <p>The Organic Act of 1916 established the National Park Service and set its purpose \"...to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"</p> <p>Past generations had the foresight to protect this land and now our generation must improve upon and continue that legacy.</p> <p>As you walk to the next stop, try to imagine what sorts of threats--both natural and human-caused--people feared could harm the Valley.</p>",

For example, early visitors to Yosemite misunderstood the essential role of fire, viewing it as merely destructive and dangerous and responding to it with alarm and fear. We now understand that suppressing natural lightning-caused fires can ultimately harm the plants and animals that have adapted to it. The place in which you now stand exemplifies the ill effects of past fire suppression policies.</p> <p>Look at the surrounding old oak trees that are shadowed by taller, neighboring pines and cedars. Weakened from competition for sunlight, the oaks are vulnerable to heart rot, root rot, and predatory insects. Prior to years of fire suppression, natural fires once cycled through portions of the Valley every 15 to 20 years. These fires created conditions in which the oaks would thrive.</p> <p>Modern scientific research continues to determine how best to simulate natural fire conditions. At present, fire management teams oversee a prescribed fire program that returns fire to each meadow every 5 to 8 years. Fire contributes valuable nutrients to the soil for meadow grasses and sedges and also kills young pine saplings. In the last 150 years, the total meadow area in this Valley has dwindled from over 800 acres to fewer than 400 because of the gradual invasions by surrounding pines and cedars.</p> <p>Besides periodic fires, meadow and wetland plants need periodic flooding and the formation of high water tables. As you walk to the next stop, see if you can locate sources of water for this environment.</p>",

You can see Indian Canyon (also called Lehemite) from this location. It is the first deep canyon to the right of Yosemite Falls. Despite this initial displacement, their culture survived. Later, some gradually returned, found employment, and lived together in small groups here in the Valley.

    "bodyText": "<p>You are facing east. In the meadow to the left of the trail is an old river channel where yellow water lilies grow in the summer months. Every spring during high water, the Merced River reclaims this channel and water flows across this trail. Early hotel owners sought to drain areas like this to reduce mosquito ponds and dry the meadows enough to plow for hay production.</p> <p>The main Merced River channel is south of the trail. Its flow changes dramatically with the seasons. Runoff from melting snow is most volumninous in May. By August or September, Yosemite Falls is usually dry and the river flow is less than one percent of its spring maximum. Major floods occurred five times in the 20th century. Although flooding may be inconvenient for us, these waters are vitally important to meadows, wetlands, riparian zones, and river systems.</p> <p>The Merced River Plan provides direction for the protection and enhancement of this Wild and Scenic River and all of its \"Outstandingly Remarkable Values.\" Facilities will be removed from the floodplains where possible, and valuable natural habitat along the river will be restored. These include the immediate riparian areas - trees and shrubs along the riverbank - and meadow wetlands where the diversity of plants and animals is greatest. The river is the lifeblood of the Yosemite Valley ecosystem. This plan will ensure its health well into the future.</p> <p>What would you hope people's experience of Yosemite to be like in the future?</p>",

One hundred years ago, this cluster of trees was open meadow. New park plans call for reclaiming priceless, natural beauty and allowing natural processes to prevail. Now, interestingly, humans will affect change for the sake of restoration. Cook's Meadow has already been the focus of two important restoration projects - an old building site was re-contoured in 1993, and an old roadbed was removed in 1998. A wonderful surprise emerged when imported fill material was removed during the restoration: many species of native plants, including some rare and endangered species, sprouted from seeds dormant for nearly a century. These newly restored areas are carefully monitored and what is learned here will be applied to future meadow restoration projects.</p>",

In particular, the shape of the roofline and wraparound covered deck are uncommon features of the area. Inside, exposed trusses along with paneled walls and ceilings set the design of this building apart from other rustic interiors in the park.</p> <p>The modern-day registration building was constructed as a post office in 1920 and shares many aesthetic similarities with the modern-day lounge building. It was modified to accommodate registration functions in 1959.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The front office building is a small, wood, structure that you enter from the right side, check-in at the front desk which extends across the length of the building, then walk out the opposite side of the building. The front side of the building is made up of six panels, which each have 15 square window panes that go from near the floor to the ceiling. The lounge building is a single-story structure with a large covered porch. The building is covered in wood shingles and paneling. There are unpeeled log accents around the doors and windows as well as unpeeled log pillars around the porch. The covered porch has a wood plank floor with two steps leading up to it. There are paned windows all around the building and a set of glass paned double doors at the entrance.",

The family first lived in an abandoned barn and had to carry household water from a nearby stream in a five-gallon oil can. Shortly after, they built their own house, which included plumbing.</p> <p>To support her growing family, Bridget began selling bread and baked goods from her home while raising eight children. With increasing numbers of tourists visiting Yosemite, Bridget helped meet food service demands by baking up to fifty loaves of bread a day in her small household oven. From her porch, she sold bread and home-cooked meals to Yosemite locals and toursits, each loaf selling for 12½ cents.</p> <p>Around 1898, the Degnans built a larger home and Bridget purchased a large brick commercial dutch oven for a more permanent bakery. She could then bake 400 loaves a day, and began serving full meals on her front porch to locals and park visitors. Her bakery (pictured below) was originally connected to their family home near the chapel in Yosemite Valley and is an important reminder of Yosemite's early visitor services. Bridget's legacy continued when her children opened an even bigger bakery in 1958, still open today as Degnan's Kitchen in Yosemite Village. It remained family-owned until 1972.</p>",

Her initially small operation grew to a substantial enterprise.</p> <p>During Mission 66, Degnan’s was still a family-operated business also known as Degnan-Donohue, Inc. Frank Donohue, Bridget Degnan’s grandnephew, led the business at the time of Mission 66. Donohue agreed to the National Park Service’s request to construct a modern facility, continuing the Degnan’s legacy. Donohue partnered with well-known mid-century modern architect Frank Lloyd Wright to draft a design for the new Degnan’s building. Much to Wright’s chagrin, the National Park Service rejected the proposed design, deeming it too futuristic. Director Conrad Wirth famously critiqued Wright’s design by calling it “a mushroom dome type of thing.</p> <p>”Walter Wagner and Partners, a firm from Fresno, created the distinct A-frame structure we know today. Its floor-to-ceiling windows are a signature of mid-century park designs, and the prominent wood elements and interior fireplace remind the visitor of a mountain lodge.</p>",

To the right side of the road is a forest that extends to the base of El Capitan. The meadow can be a different experience throughout the day and with every season. In summer, the plants and grasses stand tall and erect and are a vibrant green. In fall, the meadow appears to be trampled, and the tall grasses may lay flat, and look dry, and yellow. In winter, the meadow may be snow-covered, and in spring, it may glisten and sparkle first thing in the morning from frost. Throughout the day and even into the night, people find a spot to enjoy unobscured views of climbers, spotted on the vertical rock wall. At night, climbers turn on their headlamps to settle into their portaledge, or hanging cots, for the night, creating polka dots of light scattered across the rock wall. Also at night, during a full moon, the rock walls are lit up by the bright light of the moon.",

    "audioDescription": "The Elizabeth Lake Trailhead is found at the end of a long parking lot in the midst of the Tuolumne Meadows campground. Campsites are situated on one side of the parking area, while six food storage lockers line the other side. A restroom with running water and flush toilets are near the food storage lockers. A green recycle dumpster and brown trash dumpster are to the right of the restrooms, next to the path that leads to the trailhead. At the trailhead, a wooden sign reads, Tuolumne Meadows H.S.C. 1.8 miles, Elizabeth Lakes 2.3 miles, and Sunrise H.S.C. 9.6 miles. Two small signs prohibiting dogs and bicycles are posted. <br /><br />A two-sided sign, each side containing three panels, stands near the food storage lockers. <br />The first panel on the front side of the sign, which is facing the parking lot, is blue and white and reads, Food Storage Regulations, and has an illustration of a person bending down, putting food into a food storage locker, at the bottom of the panel. Text reads, bears attracted to human food and garbage may become dangerous and, tragically, may have to be killed. <br /><br />To protect Yosemite's bears, store all food in the locker provided. Because of a bear's powerful sense of smell, \"food\" can be any item with a scent, regardless of packaging. Bears are attracted to items we don't typically think of as food, such as canned goods, bottles, drinks, soap, cosmetics, toiletries, trash, ice chests (even when empty), and unwashed items used for preparing or eating meals. <br /><br />Treat your trash like food and keep it in your food locker or dispose of it promptly in a dumpster. Bears are clever and agile. Keep your locker closed and latched at all times. <br /><br />Only have food items out while you are actually using them. Otherwise, keep them locked up. Improper food storage may result in impoundment of your food or car, a fine of up to $5,000, and/or revocation of your camping permit. <br /><br />The second panel is pink and black, is titled, Warning: Black Bears, and has an illustration of a black bear running away from two adults, one man hitting a pot with a ladle, and a woman yelling and clapping her hands. A young boy peaks out from behind the man. <br /><br />Panel text reads, bears that lose their natural fear of people may become aggressive. When that happens, they may have to be killed.<br /><br />If you see a bear anywhere in the campground, act immediately to scare it away. Make as much noise as possible by yelling and banging pots together. If there is more than one person, stand together to present a more intimidating figure, but do not surround the bear. Report all sightings to a park ranger. <br /><br />The third panel is brown and white, is titled, Do Not Feed Animals, and has an illustration of a chipmunk eating an acorn, at the bottom of the panel. <br /><br />Caption: There is plenty of natural food in the park for all wildlife. <br /><br />Panel text reads, national parks provide opportunities to see wild animals in their domain. Keep wildlife wild! Feeding a wild animal is like giving it a death sentence. The animal becomes a beggar and unhealthy, making it vulnerable to diseases, predators, dangerous behavior, and cars. <br /><br />Though appealing and seemingly tame, wild animals may bite or scratch and can spread diseases and inflict serious - or fatal - injuries. Maintain a safe distance and do not feed the animals! <br /><br />The first panel on the back side of the sign, is blue and white and is titled, Campground Regulations. Text reads, about 700,000 people camp in Yosemite every year. Your compliance with these rules will help maintain this natural site for future generations.<br /><br />Campers - Reservations required; 14-day total May 1 to September 15; maximum 6, including children, per campsite. <br />Vehicles - 2 per campsite<br />Checkout - 12 noon<br />Quiet Hours - 10pm to 6am<br />Fires - Use only provided grills; gather only dead and down wood that must fit in fire ring; put out fires cold before leaving or going to sleep; read specific fire alert information.<br />Bears - Proper food storage required<br />Pets - Keep pets on leash at all times<br />Dishwashing - Scrape food into trash. Do not drain dishwater or sewage onto the ground. Dump gray water only into toilets in restrooms. RVs should use dump stations. <br />Trash - Use recycle bins; deposit trash in dumpsters<br />Other Rules - Do not dig or level sites, or move boulders; do not move tables from site to site; no nails, axes, or knives in trees<br />Emergency - Police, fires, medical, dial 911<br />Ranger - Call 209/372-4025, after 5pm call 209/379-1992<br /><br />The second panel is green and white, is titled, Campfires, and has an illustration of a campfire on the left side of the panel. Text reads, today's campfire smoke can impair tomorrow's scenic views and air quality. Please obey restrictions. <br /><br />Campfires are permitted only in established fire rings. Never leave a campfire unattended; douse fire with water prior to going to bed or leaving campsite. Down or dead firewood may be gathered outside Yosemite Valley. Use of power saws prohibited. <br /><br />The third panel is also green and white, is titled, Pets, and has an illustration of a woman walking a dog on a leash near a forest, in the lower left corner. Panel text reads, restrictions on pets are enforced parkwide to protect the park's natural features and to avoid conflicts with wild animals. Pets must be on leash no longer than 6 feet and attended at all times; do not leave pets or pet food outside at night. Pets are not allowed on trails. Pets are not permitted in group or stock camps.",

This unique lighting effect happens only on evenings with a clear sky when the waterfall is flowing and when the sun is at the right angle in mid– to late February.

    "audioDescription": "The paved parking area for Gaylor Lakes Trailhead is located on the north side of Tioga Road at Tioga Pass, near the east entrance to the park. It is marked by a brown metal sign that has a white outline and white text. The sign reads Gaylor Lakes, and has an icon of a backpacker and an arrow that points north. In the parking area, a cobblestoned facility with a wooden roof holds two vault toilets on the east end of the lot. One green recycle bin, one brown trash bin, and an inoperable payphone are between the restroom and the trailhead. One brown food locker is near the trailhead. Three signs line the dirt path at the Gaylor Lakes Trailhead. The first sign is separated into five sections. Two small square panels on top, a large map in the middle, and two small square panels on bottom. The top left panel is maroon with white text and reads, Gaylor Lakes Trailhead, the lure of ore once brought a different visitor here. This trail leads to the historic district of the Great Sierra Silver Mine. Gaylor Lakes Basin is 1 mile. To protect the water quality, overnight camping is not allowed in the Gaylor Lakes watershed. Caution - historic open mining pits exist off trail. The top right panel is blue with white text and reads, Wilderness Regulations, the natural integrity of Yosemite's high country depends on you. Help protect the wilderness, and avoid a citation, by following these regulations.Camp at least four trail miles from all developed areas. Pets, firearms, and bicycles are prohibited in wilderness. Stay on the trails; shortcutting switchbacks kills vegetation and causes erosion. Maximum group size for cross-country travel is eight people.Avoid disturbing wildlife and other visitors by keeping quiet on the trail and in camp. Use a gas stove for cooking; wood fires are allowed only below 9,600 feet in existing fire rings using dead and downed wood. Leave campsites as you find them; do not build windbreaks, fire rings, hitch racks, chairs, drainage trenches, or other \"improvements.\"Pack out everything you carry in; do not burn trash. Wilderness permit required for all overnight use. A series of three white circles containing three different icons are outlined in red and have a red diagonal line slashing through the middle. The three icons are of a gun, a dog, and a person on a bicycle.The large middle panel is a detailed map of the eastern portion of the park. Roads, trails, peaks, and lakes are labeled. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at 209/379-1035. The bottom left panel is yellow with black text and reads, Black Bears - the health and well-being of Yosemite's bears depends on you. Bears are intelligent, curious, adaptable, and hungry. Human food, however, is harmful to bears and other animals here. Keep wildlife wild by using these food storage methods.At the trailhead: Remove all food, ice chests, and scented items from you car. Store them in food storage lockers where available. Never feed bears or other wildlife. In the backcountry: store food, garbage, and scented items in bearproof canisters, available at front country locations. Keep items stored whenever you are not eating. Remember, bears are active day and night. Scare away any bears you see by making loud noises and acting aggressively. Report all bear incidents. The bottom right panel is blue with white text and reads, Water Quality - clean, sparkling water is one of the joys of the high country. Wildlife, wilderness visitors, and people downstream all need clean water to stay healthy. Protect your water supply by following these regulations and suggestions:Camp at least 100 feet (40 steps) from water.Deposit human waste in a six-inch-deep hole at least 100 feet from water; carry out toilet paper.Wash dishes and yourself at least 100 feet from water; even biodegradable soap pollutes.Carry a large water container and limit your trips to collect water; eroded stream banks and lake shores contribute to poor water quality. Stay on the trails; shortcutting switchbacks increases erosion and leads to silt-filled streams.Giardia lamblia is a disease-causing protozoan that can be present in all Sierran water; treat all water before drinking. The second sign is separated into four small, square panels stacked on top of each other. The Top panel is maroon with white text and has an illustration of two craggy, pointy peaks in the distance, and tall conifers in the foreground. The panel reads, Entering Yosemite Wilderness. \"Wilderness is...an area retaining its primeval character and influence...\" (Wilderness Act of 1964). The beauty and ecological importance of the land before you was recognized by Congress in 1890 when it established Yosemite National Park and again in 1984 when it designated almost 95 percent of Yosemite as wilderness. In wilderness, the earth and its community of life are left unchanged by human activity and visitors can experience natural quiet and solitude. This area will retain these",

    "audioDescription": "A small stone structure with a wooden roof sits atop a hill. Inside the hut is a half circle terrace, allowing open views of Half Dome and Yosemite's high country. A few exhibit panels are mounted to the back walls of the stone hut. A long, blue, exhibit panel has a text bar that reads: Landscape in Motion - Anchored in granite, the scene before you appears permanent. Yet changes, both incremental and sudden, defines this landscape. Photo: A small stone structure with a wooden roof sits atop a hill. Thick dark clouds cast shadows on Half Dome in the background. A tall tree is in the forefront. Photo caption: For over a century, Yosemite's geologic story has intrigued, inspired, and challenged visitors. In 1925, Yosemite Natural History Association built this Geology Hut as an observatory to educate visitors about Yosemite's geologic past. Text on the left side of the panel reads: Imagine one scene from Yosemite's past: Ice surrounds you. A chill wind blows above rivers of ice that originate at the Sierra Nevada crest and flow down valleys. For most of the past few million years, ice dominated Yosemite's landscape. Repeated glaciations removed the soil, eroded the bedrock underneath, and carried away tons of rock debris. Now consider the spectacular view you experience today. The scene-shaping continues. Since glaciers have receded, rockfalls transform the shape of granite cliffs while rivers and waterfalls slowly wear away valley walls and floors. The results of these landscape changes are visible all around you in the magnificent view from Glacier Point. Five illustrations are lined up to the right. Illustration 1: A narrow v-shaped canyon runs from near the top of the illustration to bottom. Half Dome looks somewhat different but is still the only noticeable feature. Illustration 1 caption: Yosemite granites cooled miles beneath the earth's surface as early as 100 million years ago. As tectonic forces uplifted the Sierra Nevada, powerful rivers and creeks cut Yosemite's canyons and valleys, carving the landscape into V-shaped canyons. (10 to 3 millions years ago). Illustration 2: Ice nearly fills a valley to the tops of its rock walls. The tip of Half Dome and a few other peaks are peaking out of the ice. Illustration 2 caption: As the climate cooled, a series of glaciers entered river-covered valleys-plucking, polishing, and transporting rocks. The largest glaciers filled Yosemite Valley almost to the top of Half Dome. (3 million to 20,000 years ago). Illustration 3: A valley is half-way filled with ice. The valley walls are exposed and appear more widened than before. Illustration 3 caption: Repeated glaciations eroded valleys, steepened granite walls, and sculpted many of the dramatic landforms we see today. (3 million to 20,000 years ago). Illustration 4: A lot of water flows through a wide valley with steep cliff walls. Illustration 4 caption: As the last major glacier melted and receded, Yosemite Valley filled with water and sediment, turning the Valley floor into a shallow lake. The lake eventually filled with sediment, creating a flat valley floor. (20,000 to 10,000 years). Illustration 5: A narrow river snakes through a wide valley with steep cliff walls. Illustration 5 caption: The extensive work of glaciers is visible throughout the park. Waterfalls leap from hanging valleys. Rockfalls from the glacially steepened cliffs widen the Valley. (10,000 years ago to present). A wall-mounted glass case holds a topographic map labeled: Geologic Map of Yosemite Valley, Yosemite National Park, California. A black and white xeroxed copy of a topographic map labeled: Map of Ancient Glaciers of the Yosemite Region, is placed at the bottom of the case. Three postcards thumbtacked to the enclosed cork board show an illustration of the firefall, Half Dome with a lightning strike, and Half Dome cables. Steps lead down to a terrace below the Geology Hut. A metal exhibit panel and a viewing scope are located on the cement path. The metal panel shows the names of peaks in viewing distance from this point. The high country peaks, from left to right, are Mt. Hoffman, Polly Dome, Mt.

The natural features on the rim of or near Yosemite Valley are, from left to right, Washington Peak, North Dome, Basket Dome, Mt. Broderick, Grizzly Peak, Liberty Cap, Nevada Fall (594 feet), Vernal Fall (317 feet), and Panorama Cliffs. In Yosemite Valley, MIrror Lake and Tenaya Canyon are labeled. The current elevation is 7,214. Text in the lower right corner reads: The story of Yosemite's geology is told at the museum located in Yosemite Village. Open daily.",

Half Dome is one of the most well-known features in Yosemite. To understand how this impressive feature formed, we have to journey back in time again, this time about one hundred million years ago, when the granitic bedrock of Yosemite was forming.<br /> <br /> Yosemite looked very different one hundred million years ago. Towering volcanoes existed here then making up a vast mountain chain similar to the modern Andes Mountains in South America. Deep below the volcanoes, the slipping of one tectonic plate under another created pools of hot, fluid rock called magma. Some of the magma rose to the surface and erupted from the volcanoes, but most of it cooled very slowly deep below the surface, forming the large, interlocking crystals that make up the granite of Yosemite. You may be wondering how rocks that formed miles below the surface are now exposed on the surface. Over tens of millions of years, the towering volcanoes were slowly eroded away, removing a great weight that caused the granitic rocks to rise, eventually revealing them surface. The material eroded from the volcanoes was transported west to the Central Valley of California, where the sediment is miles thick - a hidden but impressive testament to the power of erosion.<br /> <br /> After the granite of Half Dome was revealed, erosional forces set upon sculpting it further. Chief among these erosional forces were glaciers, which repeatedly scraped along both sides of Half Dome, steepening the slopes. A large vertical fracture in the granite formed a weakness that glaciers could exploit, leading to the sheer face of Half Dome. The summit of Half Dome was never overtopped by glaciers, so its rounded shape results from a different kind of erosion called exfoliation. Exfoliation is the process by which slabs of rock break and peel away along curving parallel fractures similar to the skins of an onion. On the sheer face of Half Dome, exfoliation causes rockfalls that occur every few years.<br /> <br /> Please follow the path to your left toward the Merced River to find the next stop. As you walk to the next stop, think back to the sign we saw at the beginning and recall that image of Yosemite Valley underwater. How does that image contrast with the Merced River that you see today?</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>On March 26, 1872 the famed naturalist and conservationist, John Muir, was sleeping in a cabin nearby when he was shaken awake by a strong earthquake. This quake, known as the Owens Valley earthquake, was one of the largest earthquakes in California's history, with a magnitude of at least 7.5 on the Richter scale. This earthquake originated near the town of Lone Pine and shook most of eastern California and parts of Nevada. John Muir recounted his experience that night.<br /> <br /> \"...one morning about two o'clock I was aroused by an earthquake; and though I had never before enjoyed a storm of this sort, the strange, wild thrilling motion and rumbling could not be mistaken, and I ran out of my cabin, both glad and frightened, shouting, \"A noble earthquake!\" feeling sure I was going to learn something. The shocks were so violent and varied, and succeeded one another so closely, one had to balance in walking as if on the deck of a ship among the waves...<br /> Then, suddenly, out of the strange silence and strange motion there came a tremendous roar. ... and I saw ... falling ... thousands of ... great boulders ...pouring to the valley floor in a free curve luminous from friction, making a terribly sublime and beautiful spectacle-an arc of fire fifteen hundred feet span, as true in form and as steady as a rainbow, in the midst of the stupendous roaring rock-storm. It seemed to me that if all the thunder I ever heard were condensed into one roar it would not equal this rock roar at the birth of a mountain talus.\"<br /> <br /> The arc of fire that Muir saw was due to a phenomenon call triboluminescence. This occurs when quartz strikes against more quartz, creating sparks. As granite contains abundant quartz, the grinding and pulverizing of rocks as they tumbled down the cliff looked to Muir like streaks of orange fireworks. As you look towards the cliff, many of the boulders you see are likely from this event. Many other rockfalls occurred in Yosemite that night as a result of the violent shaking, including one near Nevada Fall that knocked an old hotel there off its foundation. The rockfalls triggered by the 1872 earthquake are among the largest in Yosemite's recorded history but they are small compared to some ancient rockfalls that occurred deeper in Yosemite's past. The boulders on either side of the trail here are from a much larger rockfall than the one John Muir observed.<br /> <br /> When a rockfall occurs, it exposes a scar of fresh white granite on the cliff, and the resulting talus also gleams with fresh granite. You'll notice that most of the boulders along the trail here are covered with lichen and moss. This tells us that these boulders have been sitting here undisturbed for a very long time. In fact, we have dated this rockfall, using a technique that determines how long the boulders have been exposed on the surface, and we found that it occurred about 3,000 years ago. This rockfall was so large that it traveled all the way to the Merced River. Extremely large rockfalls like this are called rock avalanches. This particular rock avalanche is made up of nearly one and a half million tons of rock! We have dated the other rock avalanches in Yosemite and found that there is a strong link to earthquakes, just as John Muir observed on that fateful night in 1872. As you make your way to the final stop on this tour, look around at the vast field of boulders and imagine the chaos that took place here just a few thousand years ago.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>As you made your way to this stop you surely noticed one of the most iconic features in Yosemite; the cascading waterfalls of Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls. Together these waterfalls plunge a total of 2,425 feet, or about 740 meters, making Yosemite Falls one of the tallest waterfalls in the world. Yosemite Falls is unlike other waterfalls in Yosemite and the Sierra Nevada. To illustrate what makes Yosemite Falls so different, we'll have to travel back in time hundreds of thousands of years to a time when glaciers filled Yosemite Valley to the rim.<br /> <br /> Glaciers are masses of ice that form from the accumulation of snow, and that flow downhill under their own weight. As they move, glaciers scrape and pluck at the bedrock, excavating and transporting huge amounts of sediment. When glaciers melt, they drop the rocky debris they had been carrying in mound-like ridges called moraines.<br /> <br /> There have been many glacial periods over the last few million years, glaciers repeatedly advanced into Yosemite Valley from the high country and then retreated back. The most recent time that a glacier occupied Yosemite Valley was about 20,000 years ago. At that time, the glacier extended to as far west as Bridal Veil Fall and reached about two-thirds of the way up the cliffs. Earlier glacial periods were larger, with glaciers extending west as far as the town of El Portal and reaching the rim of Yosemite Valley.<br /> <br /> Hundreds of thousands of years ago, Yosemite Creek didn't leap directly off the cliff, but rather cascaded down the steep gully that you can see to the left of the falls. What caused the creek to shift position? We can't see it from here, but behind Yosemite Falls there is a moraine left behind by one of those ancient glaciers. The moraine diverted the Yosemite Creek from its path down the steep gully and forced it directly off the cliff. This unique geological accident created one of the tallest waterfalls in the world and one of the most iconic features in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> As you walk to the next stop make some observations about the ground surface that surrounds the trail.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Sentinel Bridge is a great place to experience Half Dome. Many photographers enjoy gathering here to take pictures of Half Dome and its reflection in the Merced River, especially when the colors of sunset play on its rock face. The bridge is completely made of stone and is slightly arched. A wayside exhibit is affixed to the metal railing that is adhered to the stone barrier-wall on the bridge. On the east side of the bridge, tall trees line the banks of the river and Half Dome rises over the tree line. A wayside exhibit is titled, The Story of Half Dome, and has an orange-toned, faint, background photo of textured granite rock. Text reads, millions of years ago the granite block of Half Dome was larger, but there never was a matching half. Undercut by glaciers near the base, slabs of rock fell away from a broad vertical crack in the granite, leaving a sheer face. Remnants of the missing rock still project from Half Dome's rim. <br /><br />There are more granite domes here than in any other place in the world. Massive granite domes from when large curved layers of rock \"exfoliate\" or slab off. <br /><br />Illustrated brochure: A side profile of Half Dome, with dark shadows in the front and low laying clouds floating below its face. In the background, some grey peaks cross the skyline and the sky is a bright orange and yellow. The text reads Yosemite Valley, on top, and Southern Pacific, on bottom.<br /><br />Caption: c. 1910<br /><br />Black and white postcard: Half Dome and trees surrounding it have an almost symmetrical reflection in the Merced River. <br /><br />Caption: Half Dome from Sentinel Bridge, postcard, c. 1940. Since the mid-19th century, countless images of the park's most famous dome, Half Dome, have been circulated. Its profile has become an enduring and instantly recognizable symbol of Yosemite. <br /><br />A section on the left side of the panel has a header that reads, An Ahwahneechee Tale of Half Dome. Text below it reads, long ago, two travelers, Tissiak and her husband, Tokoyee, fought with each other. He became so angry that he began to beat her; enraged, she hurled her basket of acorns at him. As they stood facing each other, they were turned to stone for their wickedness. The acorn basket (Basket Dome) lies upturned beside Tokoyee (North Dome) and the rock face of Tissiak (Half Dome) is stained with her tears. <br /><br />Photo: Half Dome is illuminated with the orange light of the alpen glow. Behind Half Dome, other mountains a lit as well, and the sky is full of dark clouds. <br /><br />",

Some of the talus boulders can be quite large. These boulders were once a part of the cliff face and broke loose in events called rockfalls in which boulders fall, bounce and roll down the cliffs and talus piles. The gigantic boulder in front of you now is from a rockfall that occurred about 3,000 years ago. This boulder is one of the largest you will see in Yosemite Valley but boulders like this are actually fairly common. All of them represent past rockfalls. Since glaciers retreated from Yosemite Valley, rockfalls became the dominant geological force eroding the cliffs and they still occur today. Rockfalls happen year-round, with an average of about one event every five days. As of 2020, there have been 16 deaths and more than one hundred injuries related to rockfalls in Yosemite.<br /> <br /> Geologists study rockfalls to help the Park Service reduce risk. Research has identified areas in Yosemite Valley at the highest risk from rockfalls. The Park Service use this information to move buildings out of these areas or changed how the buildings are used. These efforts led to a 95% reduction in risk from rockfalls. However, that does not mean people are completely safe. Rockfalls are inherently unpredictable, in part because there are many natural forces that can trigger rockfalls, ranging from rainfall to earthquakes. Rockfalls are a natural force shaping this landscape but they also present a hazard that we need to be aware of as we enjoy this beautiful park.<br /> <br /> As you walk along the trail east of the Chapel, take note of the large boulder field on both sides of the trail - what observations can you make about it?</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>On most days, the Merced River flows peacefully beneath Superintendents Bridge. However, on January 2, 1997 the Merced was a raging torrent. The 1997 flood is the most damaging in Yosemite's recorded history. In the center of the valley, floodwaters were more than 10 feet, or 3 meters, deep. The flood damaged roads and infrastructure, resulting in prolonged closure of Yosemite Valley. The metal marker attached to the bridge indicates the height of the five largest floods in recorded history. Compare your height to the flood water level of 1997 to get a sense of the depth of water above the bridge. Now compare it to the four other major floods. What do these floods all have in common besides their large size? Here's a hint: What time of year did these floods occur? That's right, they all occurred during the winter months.<br /> <br /> Yosemite, like the rest of California, receives most of its annual precipitation in just a few months, usually between November and March. During these cold winter months, especially at high elevations, the precipitation falls as snow. In the high country, snow depths can be tens of feet deep. Typically, the snow will melt as temperatures warm in the summer and the rivers gently rise in response. This means that there is usually a several month-long lag between the time when the snow falls and when the rivers rise. However, in some years warm, tropical storms originating near Hawaii make their way to California. The warm air accompanying these storms raises the snowline to a higher elevation. The snowline is an elevation line, controlled by air temperature, that divides rain from snow. In Yosemite, the wintertime snowline is usually around 6,000 feet, or about 1,800 meters, but during these warm storms, snowline can rise to 10,000 feet, or more than 3,000 meters, elevation. If the snowline is higher, this means that more rain is falling over the watershed instead of snow. You've probably seen heavy rain running off a parking lot. Well, heavy rain running off large areas of granite bedrock looks similar. The combination of heavy rain and melted snow across the entire watershed produces extreme flood events. It is under these conditions that the largest, most damaging floods in Yosemite's history have occurred. As global temperatures warm the snowline in Yosemite is likely to increase in elevation also increasing the likelihood of future floods.<br /> <br /> Our next stop is at a huge boulder behind the Chapel, across Southside Drive. To get there, please use one of the two crosswalks crossing Southside Drive and watch for cars. The trail picks up at the far end of the parking lot next to the Chapel.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A wooden bridge with wood posts and railings expands across the Merced River. Trees line the banks of the river, up and down stream. A wayside exhibit is affixed to the wooden railing and is titled Twentieth Century Floods. The exhibit panel has a background photo of Half Dome and surrounding rock formations reflected in a large body of water in an area that spills into a meadow. Panel text reads, in the 20th century, five dramatic winter floods inundated this area. This marker indicates how high the Merced River floodwaters rose during those years. A table shows three columns with headers that read, date, cubic feet/second at Happy Isles Gauging Station, and Height of water level above this bridge. Five rows of data are below each header. The first row reads, December 11, 1937 - 8,400 cubic feet/second - 2.7 feet. The second row reads, November 18, 1950 - 9,260 cubic feet/second - 3.9 feet.

    "audioDescription": "Glacier Point offers views from an upper terrace and a lower terrace. The upper terrace shows the northern part of Yosemite Valley and beyond, while the lower terrace shows views to the east. Looking north from the upper terrace, the northern granite walls of Yosemite Valley are seen, including Yosemite Falls and Royal Arches. The Merced River snakes through the valley while patches of meadow show through the heavy forest. A metal wayside exhibit is mounted to the railing and is titled Glacier Point Upper Terrace, Yosemite National Park. Text to the bottom left of the panel reads: As glaciers retreated from the Valley, they left piles of rock and gravel debris (called moraines) in their path. Behind the moraines, the waters of the Merced River collected, creating ancient Lake Yosemite. The lake gradually filled with river-carried sediments leaving behind the flat Valley floor. Yosemite Guardian Galen Clark, and other residents, dynamited the moraine in 1890 to lower the water table. As the ground became less saturated, more trees grew and Valley meadows began to shrink. <br /><br />Illustration: A panoramic view of a portion of Yosemite Valley and beyond shows, from left to right, iconic features found in the area. to the far left, a rock juts out over the valley and is labeled Overhanging Rock, 7,200 feet. To the right of that, on the other side of the valley is a multi-tiered waterfall labeled Yosemite Falls: drops 2,425 feet. Below the waterfall, on the valley floor, over a bunch of trees is a label that indicates where Yosemite Valley Lodge is located. A littler further to the right, still on the valley floor is Yosemite Village, then a little further, a label that indicates where The Ahwahnee is. Continuing to the right, above the valley walls are one peak and two domes. Mount Hoffman at 10,850 feet, North Dome at 7,542 feet, and Basket Dome at 7,612 feet. On the valley floor, Royal Arches is labeled on the valley walls, then Mirror lake is in a valley between North Dome and Half Dome. Finally, to the far right is Half Dome at 8,842 feet. Text to the far right of the panel reads: Ancient Yosemite Creek cascaded thousands of feet into a deep, V-shaped canyon carved by the Merced River. During the Ice Age, glaciers gouged out the canyon into an even steeper U-shape with vertical walls. Yosemite Creek was left hanging 2,600 feet above the valley floor. The creek now plummets over the precipice as Yosemite Falls. When the winter's snowmelt disappears, usually by later summer. Yosemite Falls dwindle and often dry up completely. Looking to the east from the lower terrace, the eastern granite walls of Yosemite Valley are seen, including Half Dome. The Merced River snakes through the valley and cars can be seen maneuvering through the developed areas of the valley, like the campgrounds and Half Dome Village. A metal wayside exhibit is mounted to the railing and is titled Glacier Point Lower Terrace, Yosemite National Park. Text to the bottom left of the panel reads: From this vantage point, you can see about one-quarter of Yosemite National Park. The pointed peaks in the distance were unglaciated. Although glaciers quarried rocks from their sides, they never rode over their tops (the peaks would be smooth and rounded if they had). At the height of the Ice Age, which spanned some two million years, ice filled Yosemite Valley and reached a height 700 feet above where you are standing. The shape of the valley below you is a result of the carving actions of those ancient ice fields. Illustration: A panoramic view of a portion of Yosemite Valley and beyond shows, from left to right, iconic features found in the area. to the far left, Mount Hoffman at 10,850 feet, North Dome at 7,542 feet, and Basket Dome at 7,612 feet are grouped near each other. Further to the right are Mt. Watkins at 8,500 feet, Tenaya Peak at 10,301 feet, and Echo Peaks at 11,040 feet. On the floor of Yosemite Valley are Mirror Lake, with Tenaya Canyon right above it. Finally, to the far right are Cloud's Rest at 9,926 feet and Half Dome at 8,842 feet.",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit is the third stop of four on the Grizzly Giant Tour. A wood railing circles around most of the Grizzly Giant. The soft, spongy, textures of the reddish-brown sequoia trunk is noticable. Black burn scars surround the tree. The path splits.

His left hand is placed in the left pocket of his open coat, while the other hand rests at his side. His long pants are tucked into his knee-high boots.

His hands are clasped behind his back.<br /><br />Quote: The first night we camped in a grove of giant sequoias.

As you near its base, look at the fires scars that remain. Fire plays a very important role in the growth of a giant sequoia.<br /> <br /> Giant sequoias have a dependency on natural fires for reproduction, which was not understood until the early 1960s. Lightning-caused fires reduce the competition from other evergreens, burn away the leaf litter on the forest floor, and leave a thin layer of nutrient-rich ash over the mineral soil, creating perfect conditions for seedlings to sprout. Look at the forest floor around you. Can you see the soil? Or, do you see leaf litter covering the soil?<br /> <br /> Also, the heat from a fire dries some of the mature trees' green sequoia cones, causing a shower of fresh seeds to fall onto a perfectly-prepared seedbed. When winter comes, snow blankets the Mariposa Grove. As the snowpack melts the following spring, sunlight, moisture, fresh seeds, ash, and mineral soil combine to create a sequoia nursery.<br /> <br /> To reduce the leaf litter and promote giant sequoia reproduction, the National Park Service began igniting \"prescribed burns,\" that are deliberately set and closely monitored by rangers, during spring and fall. When the forest returns to a more natural state, these management fires will most likely be discontinued. Then nature can resume its cycle of lightning-caused fires every five to twenty years. Read this wayside exhibit to learn more.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit is the first stop of four on the Grizzly Giant Tour. A cement path lined with boulders and wood railings leads directly to a large sequoia tree that is noticably larger in girth than all the surrounding trees. A black, charred, triangular burn scar concaves into the trunk of the tree at its base. Thick, tree-sized branches spread out from the trunk, some turning upward. A wayside exhibit titled, Enduring Giant, is next to the path. Panel text reads, the Grizzly Giant is one of the Mariposa Grove's most notable trees. Standing 209 feet (63.7 m) tall, it is 28 feet (8.5 m) in diameter and 96 feet (29 m) in circumference at its base.<br /><br />Notice the blackened fire scars around the tree's base. Fires have burned here once every five to twenty years on average. <br /><br />The Grizzly Giant, like other older sequoia trees and those damaged by lightning or fire, has a snag top due to loss of sapwood and a reduced ability to move water from roots to crown. <br /><br />Look about halfway up for a large branch bending skyward. At nearly seven feet (2 m) in diameter, it is larger than the trunks of most of the trees around you. <br /><br />Illustration: A mature giant sequoia with a full crown, thick branches, and wide base is the central figure in this side-by-side camparison graphic. To the sequoias right is a pine tree that's a tad shorter, has a slender trunk, and thin, wispy, branches. To the sequioas left is the statue of liberty, pedastal included, whose torch raises just a tiny bit above the height of the sequoia. At the base of the sequioa, about one-twentieth its size, is a shuttle bus with a group of people standing outside of it, making them look miniature in scale. <br /><br />Caption: A giant sequoia is shown here in relation to the Statue of Liberty, people standing next to a shuttle bus, and a mature ponderosa pine. <br />",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit is the fourth stop of four on the Grizzly Giant Tour. The accessible path leads from the Grizzly Giant, down a hill to a large sequioa tree that has a tunnel carved out of its base. The wayside exhibit is titled, The Surviving Tunnel Tree, is next to the path. Panel text reads, walk through this living tree and look for evidence of it healing itself. Bark of this sequoia is growing inward in an attempte to close over its wound - the large tunnel carved in 1895. Thought to have served as a lower elevation winter replacement for the more famous Wawona Tunnel Tree, this tree became the second tunneled in this grove. <br /><br />The Wawona Tunnel Tree fell in 1969 after serving as a portal to the past for over 75 years. Although weakened, the California Tunnel Tree survives today and offers us a glimpse into early tourism promotion and transporation. Both trees were helpful in publicizing the Mariposa Grove and promoting its inclusion into Yosemite National Park in 1906. <br /><br />Black and white photo: A black, open-top, classic car is parked below a deeply furrowed giant sequoia trunk that has a hole in it. A sign above the entrance to the tree tunneled tree reads, California. A park ranger stands near the steering wheel, outside the vehicle, while a passenger sits in the back seat. <br /><br />Caption: Park ranger and passenger driving a government vehicle through the California Tunnel Tree c. 1920s. Notice the tree's name nailed to the tree above the tunnel.<br /><br />An informational map of the sequioa grove is also situated along the path, near the tunnel tree. The map is framed in large timber logs with log posts. The map reads Mariposa Grove. The key indicates light blue dotted lines are accessible trails, and thin, black, dotted lines are secondary trails. Icons for shuttle bus stops, restrooms, accessible parking, general parking, and mature giant sequoias are listed. Near the bottom left corner of the map is the Grove Arrival Area. Icons for restrooms, hiking, parking, and a shuttle stop are in the area. Major trails start here, all indicated by green, brown, light blue, and orange thick and thin, dotted lines. Small bunches of mature giant sequioa icons are in the area, which are individual bush-like circles, like looking down on a broccoli floret. The most concentrated bunch of mature giant sequoia icons are at the top of the map by a Mariposa Grove Cabin. Horse trails and restroom are located throughout the grove. Iconic trees are listed, a few examples being Fallen Monarch, Bachelor and Three Graces, Grizzly Giant, California Tunnel Tree, Faithful Couple, Clothespin Tree, Telescope Tree, and Fallen Wawona Tunnel Tree.

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit is the second stop of four on the Grizzly Giant Tour. This wayside is facing the opposite directiong from the Grizzly Giant, toward an open area that is covered in dried pine needles and pine cones. The wayside exhibit is titled, The World Below, and is next to the path. Panel text reads, although these towering trees draw our gaze upward, the true source of their strength comes from below. Giant sequoias rely on wide, shallow root systems to maintain balance and absorb water and nutrients from the soil.<br /><br />Hidden beneath your feet is a dynamic world of microscopic life. Tiny organisms recycle organic matter and create underground air pockets, making space for water from snowmelt or wetlands to nourish the trees. <br /><br />Illustration: A small mouse digs a passageway into the the soil, similar to other bugs, worms, and centipedes. A root grows horizontally, near the grounds surface. A magnifying glass magnifies a section, showing smaller insects and organisms. A foot steps on a section of the ground, crushing down into the soil near the root, collapsing what air pockets and insects were there. <br /><br />Caption: Stepping off trail, even for a quick photograph, compacts the loose, open soil and prevents water from reaching the trees' roots. As you approach the Grizzly Giant, look for markers that show the outer limit of the root system, which can extend 200 feet (61 m)<br />from the tree.",

    "audioDescription": "From shuttle stop 16, a paved side path, lined with several types of trees and bushes, leads past the restrooms, to the Happy Isle Art and Nature Center. Along the way, another paved path intersects and leads to the isles in the river to the left and toward the Fen to the right. As you approach the stone and timber building, the American flag waves on a tall flagpole to the right side of the path, and a wooden sign on the left reads, Happy Isles Nature Center, explore the world of nature. The building has stone siding and high-pitched wooden rooves. <br /><br />A large sign near the entrance of the building reads, let nature inspire your curiosity and creativity here beside the Merced River. Outside, observe the wonders all around you: tranquil trees, rushing water, a lush fen, and rocky slopes. Look for signs of wildlife along the river. Can you spot tracks in the earth, or birds winging overhead?<br /><br />When the center is open, step inside to enjoy family friendly programs, explore fascinating ecosystems and create your own park-inspired artwoork with Yosemite Conservancy. See postings for seasonal hours and art program schedule or visit yosemiteconservancy.org.<br /><br />A collage of photos show a painting of Half Dome using warm colors to indicate the alpenglow, a female ranger holding a coyote pelt and a replica of a animal skull while a young girl is amazed and has her mouth open. Another photo shows a person painting on an easel with watercolor paints. Lastly, a bird with a deep orange breast and black crown has black wings and tail that are speckled with white. <br /><br />A wayside exhibit titled, A Place for Small Fry, is also on the path near the building. The exhibit panel has a faint, green-toned, background photo of a stone building on the banks of a river. Panel text reads, the Nature Center at Happy Isles is often filled with curious children, but the building once teemed with a different kind of \"small fry\" - baby trout! Built in 1927, the building housed a fish hatchery for thirty years. Since its conversion to a nature center in 1956, thousands of visitors have learned about the wonders of Yosemite's natural world in this rustic building. <br /><br />Black and white photo 1: A man holds up a small girl from behind so she can look into a microscope on an exhibits table. <br /><br />Caption: Children and adults alike enjoy the Nature Center's exhibits.<br /><br />Black and white photo 2: Next to a tree-lined body of water, a man on a horse holds a rope that is attached to another horse that walks behind him. A small bundle is on the horse's back. <br /><br />Caption: Transporting trout fingerlings from the fish hatchery to the high country, 1942. <br />",

    "audioDescription": "The trailhead to Harden Lake begins across the street from the White Wolf Lodge front office building. There is a row of parking spaces that are lined with tall pine trees. The trail begins near the center of the parking row and enters into the forest. Two trailhead signs are posted. The first sign is brown with white text and shows the mileage of several hiking destinations that begin at this trailhead. The sign reads, Lukens Lake - 2.3, Harden Lake - 5.7, Ten Lakes - 9.7, Pate Valley - 10.4, Smith Meadows - 11.1, Yosemite Valley - 13.9, Hetch Hetchy - 17.0. The other sign is also brown with white text and lists wilderness regulations. The sign reads, Entering Yosemite Wilderness - Wilderness Permit is required for all overnight use. Please store food properly. Help protect the wild animals by keeping them wild. Wood fires are prohibited above 9,600 feet to protect fragile alpine areas. Please do not construct new fire rings. The use of gas stoves is encouraged in all areas. Select an existing campsite 100 feet or more (40 steps) from water, trails, and dry water courses. Help protect water quality by not washing anything in lakes and streams. Bury human waste at least six inches deep 100 feet from water. Must pack out all toilet paper. Shortcutting is dangerous and contributes to erosion. Please stay on established trails. Maximum group size is 15 people, or 8 maximum for off trail travel. Stock groups are limited to travel on trails only. All stock must be picketed 100 feet from water. Please scatter or bury all manure. Pack out all you pack in. Pick up extra trash when possible.

    "audioDescription": "The Hetch Hetchy Reservoir is accessible by way of a one-way loop road. Just beyond the O'Shaughnessy Dam, the road starts to go up hill, at which point, multiple roadside parking spots are available on the right side of the road. Cars are able to pull directly into the diagonal spaces, right off of the main road. A knee-high stone barrier and a cement curb, line the parking area. A few tall trees grow on the opposite side of the stone barrier. Beyond the stone barrier is a deep valley, which the waters of the dam empty into. A narrow stream makes its way through the V-shaped valley. Near the top of the hill where the parking area is located, across the street, are a few picnic tables. A wayside exhibit inside a log frame stands nearby and reads, Recreation tips: <br /><br />Bring plenty of water when hiking. Summer months can be very hot.<br />Bears are active in the area. You can help keep Yosemite's bears wild and alive by storing all food in a bear-proof storage canister available at park entrance stations. Speeding cars are a common cause of bear and other wildlife casualties, so please drive safely at all times. <br />Enjoy the area but leave no trace behind. Pack out what you pack in. Stay on the trails to avoid erosion and to protect the landscape and water quality.<br />Fishing is allowed from the bank of the reservoir, but please use artificial bait and obtain a valid fishing license before entering the park. <br />Overnight backpacking requires a Yosemite National Park wilderness permit, available at the entrances. Day hiking requires no permit. <br />Please exercise caution when hiking near the Tuolumne River or around waterfalls. These areas can be very slippery, and the force of the water can be dangerous, especially during high flows between late spring and early summer. <br /><br />Photo: Two people with large backpacks are on a trail, facing away from the camera, looking down a deep valley that has a river running through it. <br /><br />Caption: Leave no trace outdoor ethics<br />Plan ahead and prepare<br />Travel and camp on durable surfaces<br />Dispose of waster properly<br />Leave what you find<br />Minimize campfire impacts<br />Respect wildlife<br />Be considerate of other visitors. <br />Please learn, practice, and pass on Leave No Traces outdoor skills and ethics.

She faces away from the camera. She is in a meadow with a tall waterfall in the background.<br /><br />Caption: Suzie and Sadie McGowan (Mono Lake Paiute), Yosemite Valley, 1901.<br /><br />Panel text reads, American Indians of the Yosemite region were the original stewards of this area, living sustainably from the ecosystem's plants and animals for many years before the first Euro-American visitors arrived. The very name \"Hetch Hetchy\" is derived from Indian words for grasses and seeds common to this area. Please respect these extraordinary lands, as portions are considered sacred by the tribes and are protected under federal law. <br /><br />Photo: Two wildflowers are shown. One wildflower is deep red and is sprouting from a crack in a rock. It is labeled stonecrop. The other flower is pink and yellow and has multiple blossoms on one stem. It is labeled Harlequin Lupine.<br /><br />Panel text reads, the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, while providing water to millions of people, also provides access to spectacular beauty and some of the most pristine wilderness in California. Some of the most colorful and exotic plant species in North America can be viewed in the Hetch Hetchy watershed. More than 1,000 species of wildflowers can be found in the park including Heuchera, California poppy, lupine, wallflower, shooting stars, waterfall buttercups, bright California fuschia, brodiaea, dwarf monkey flower, clarkia, and Sierra leisiga. <br /><br />In the center of the exhibit panel is a glass case that contains a poster that reads, each year, 200 people finish their hike like this...<br />A photo is shown of 8 people carrying a person in a stretcher, down stone steps. <br />Text continues to read, don't let it be you.<br />Stay on the trail! Traveling off trail is a leading cause of hiking accident in Yosemite.<br />Ask about trail conditions before you go.<br />Stay away from swift moving streams and rivers. <br />Carry 2-3 liters of water and stay hydrated.<br />Bring high energy foods.<br />Wear sturdy shoes that protect your ankles.<br />Rest often.<br />Bring a headlamp or flashlight in case you are delayed.<br />Hike smart, and have a safe day!<br /><br />Looking down the hill from the small picnic area, past the parking area, allows for a great view of the blue waters of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and the O'Shaughnessy Dam, which you can walk on.<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>Much of the high country around Yosemite Valley had been claimed by individuals in the late 1800s. Thomas “Tom” Hodgdon acquired land for grazing cattle in Aspen Valley, now within Yosemite National Park. In 1879, Tom hired workers to build an access road, and a two-story cabin, on the land. To build the two-story log cabin, he hired a Chinese American cowboy named Ah Hoy and a neighbor named Franklin Babcock. The Hodgdon family, ranchers from the San Joaquin Valley, grazed cattled on their homesteaded land in Aspen Valley each summer.</p> <p>Tom and family ran a ranching business, grazing cattle in nearby meadows. After these meadows became part of Yosemite National Park in 1890, U.S. Army troops enforced park regulations against grazing by dispersing cattle, and the Hodgdons lost grazing privileges. The family didn’t use the cabin for a while, and patrolling soldiers, and even Army horses, sheltered inside occasionally.</p> <p>No longer able to earn a living with livestock in Yosemite, the Hodgdon family adapted to make money from tourism. In 1882, as part of the Great Sierra Wagon Road, the Hodgdons’ access road was improved upon by Chinese workers, and extended to Tioga Pass for silver mining. When the Tioga Road opened to the public, tourist traffic increased through Aspen Valley. The Hodgdon family used their cabin, and created a complex of new buildings, used for tourist lodging. Eliza Hodgdon, Tom’s spouse, added to the entrepreneurial effort by selling hot meals to hungry travelers.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Behind the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center, a path leads into the Indian Village. A sign is at the apex of the trail, that extends to the left and the right. The sign reads Welcome, heeyeko in Southern Miwok. An arrow points to the right and the sign reads self-guiding trail through the Indian Village of Ahwahnee. An illustrated map shows the layout of the Indian Village. A green circular path with counter clockwise arrows shows the direction to go. A red dot indicates You are here. A series of multi-sized brown circles indicate, from right to left, Acorn graneries, a ceremonial roundhouse, and a sweathouse, all on the outer side of the trail. In the center of the loop trail is the Chief's house, a cabin, indicated by a brown square, and a cluster of bark houses, otherwise known as umachas. A stream runs through the center of the loop trail, right next to the umachas, cabin, and Chief's house. Three-quarters of the way around the loop trail from where the red dot indicates 'You are here,' is an arrow that points downward and reads 'To Museum.' The rest of the sign reads We invite you to follow this trail through a re-constructed Yosemite Indian village of the 1870s. The largest Miwok village in Yosemite Valley, the Village of Ahwahnee, was once in this area. Signs along the path will introduce you to the structures in the village and the plants used by Native people. A stack of booklets are held in a dispenser that reads booklets, 50 cents. There's a coin slot to the right of it.",

    "audioDescription": "This small, one-room stone structure has a wooden, pyramid style roof. There is only one wooden door, no windows. Inside, there is a very low ceiling and a lone steel-framed cot with exposed springs. An exhibit sign reads: Powder House - Jail: The black powder and dynamite used in the routine State work in Yosemite Valley were kept in the \"Tool House\" before John Degnan built this stone magazine in the 1890s. In addition to thick stone walls, the powder house also had six inches of sand in the ceiling as protection from fire. Later, the powder house was converted into a jail, a very poor one. In 1915, two young car thieves escaped by digging away the mortar between the rocks with a leg they had twisted off the rickety steel frame cot. The pair claimed the task was so easy that they waited until after breakfast to perform their escape. Patrol rangers recaptured them, and shackled them by leg irons to the corners. Following this incident, horseshoes were imbedded in the floor to provide a chain or base of greater security. Occasionally, the powder house-jail also served as a morgue.",

    "audioDescription": "The John Muir Trail begins across the street from the Dog Lake Parking lot. Residential housing consisting of wooden cabins with canvas roofs, are located on the west side of the parking area. A large exhibit panel set inside a log frame, stands on log posts next to the Dog Lake trailhead. The panel text reads, welcome to Dog Lake Parking. This trailhead accesses the hike to Dog Lake, Lembert Dome, Young Lakes, and Lyell Canyon, among others. Hiking maps and guidebooks are available at the visitor center. For your safety, please follow trail signs and do not walk along the road. <br /><br />The upper half of the panel is a trail map of the area. Beginning at where the red dot indicates, you are here, yellow lines, representing trails, sprawl out from this point. An icon for parking and accommodations are near to the red dot. A blue line indicates the water of the Tuolumne River and Dog Lake, and a thick white line represents Tioga Road, which runs left to right, with thinner white lines branching off Tioga Road, indicating smaller backroads. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at 209/379-1035. <br /><br />The left column of panel text reads, take a hike! The hike to Dog Lake and/or Lembert Dome begins at the uphill (north) side of this parking lot. Pay attention to signs posted at every trail junction. Remember, this is the \"Dog Lake\" parking area. <br /><br />Dog Lake (moderately strenuous) - Surrounded by forest, this quiet lake is home to many species including water birds, song birds, deer, and dragonflies. Despite its name, pets are not allowed at Dog Lake, nor on any other trail. <br /><br />Lembert Dome (moderately strenuous) - After Gaining 600 feet (183 m) of elevation, look for the trail junction to the summit of Lembert Dome. The trail climbs through the forest to the bare rock of the dome. There is no trail on the rock. Follow the easiest path for panoramic views of Tuolumne Meadows and the surrounding peaks. <br /><br />The Loop (moderately strenuous) - It is possible to combine the Lembert Dome and Dog Lake hikes into a five-mile loop. Study the map for details. Do not walk on the road from the Lembert Dome parking area back to this parking area. Instead, use the trails indicated on the map. <br /><br />Lyell Canyon (easy) - To hike up Lyell Canyon on the John Muir and Pacific Crest Trails, begin at the downhill (south) side of this parking lot. Cross the road at the crosswalk and follow the trail upstream. You can enjoy a short stroll along the river until you are ready to turn around. One mile up the trail you will reach Twin Bridges, a scenic crossing of the Lyell fork. If you're feeling more adventurous, this trail could take you to Mt. Whitney, over 200 miles (322 km) away, or all the way to Mexico. <br /><br />The right column of panel text reads, before you go. Stay on trail. Careless steps damage this fragile landscape. Plants have a short growing season before winter snow blankets the land. <br /><br />Be prepared. Carry plenty of water and high energy food. Bring a map; don't rely on cell phones and GPS. Pack a flashlight in case your hike takes longer than expected. Wear appropriate clothes and shoes. Tell someone where you're going and when you plan to return. <br /><br />Pack out what you pack in. To help this wilderness thrive, leave no trace of your presence. You must pack out your used toilet paper and trash. <br /><br />Never feed wild animals. Human food is unhealthy for wildlife and encourages aggressive behavior. Respect animals at a distance. If an animal changes its behavior due to your presence, you are too close. <br /><br />Pets, bicycles, and strollers are allowed only on roads accessible by vehicle, never on trails. Pets must be on a leash at all times, and owners must bag and dispose of pet waste. <br /><br />Weather can change quickly in the mountains. Be aware of building thunderstorms. Stay off of exposed granite domes, open meadows, and lakes when storms are approaching. <br /><br />Get there safely. Roads in the park are narrow and winding. Protect park wildlife, other visitors, and yourself by obeying posted speed limits and using turnouts. <br /><br />Feeling the altitude? Give yourself a day or two to become accustomed to the altitude. Signs of altitude sickness can include nausea, dizziness, and headache. Descending to a lower elevation can help alleviate symptoms. <br /><br />Wilderness use regulations. Wilderness permits and and allowed bear-resistant food containers are required year-round for overnight trips. They are available at the Yosemite Valley and Tuolumne Meadows Wilderness Centers, Wawona Visitor Center, Big Oak Flat Information Station, and the Hetch Hetchy Entrance Station. No motorized vehicles are permitted. <br /><br />In the middle of the left and right text columns is a small map outline of the entire park. The main roads and areas are the only things labeled. On the far left side of the park is a road that runs north to south. At the top point is Hetch Hetchy, coming down to Big Oak Flat, then down to Wawona, which is near the bottom tip of the park. A little less than half way up the road is an intersection the leads into the Yosemite Valley via a loop road. Just above Yosemite Valley is a road that extend from the left to the right of the park, the Tioga Road, With Tioga Pass labeled at the far right. To the far right of the Tioga Road, near Tioga Pass, is a red dot that indicates, you are here. <br /><br />From north to south, the parking lot slopes downhill a bit. There is a neat line of recycle bins, trash bins, and food storage lockers in the south parking lot. A crosswalk leads across the street to the Lyell Canyon trailhead. A wooden sign reads, John Muir Trail, Tuolumne Pass 6.1 miles, Vogelsang H.S.C. 6.7 miles, Donohue Pass 11.9 miles, Merced Lake 14.7 miles, and Yosemite Valley 27.5 miles. A sign is posted prohibiting dogs on the trail. <br /><br /><br />",

    "audioDescription": "A slightly crescent shaped, paved parking area is near the Lembert Dome/Dog Lake trailhead. Just east of the parking lot, beyond a stand of tall pines, is a granite dome, Lembert Dome. The dome is shaped like a slide, the left side being a steep incline, while the right side has a long gradual decline. At the north end of the parking lot are two dumpsters, a brown one for trash, and a green one for recycling, each having a carabiner to clip their chutes shut. Near the dumpsters is a thin metal post with two signs. The top sign reads, no camping or overnight parking. The second sign reads, no parking any time, and has a two sided arrow pointing left and right. Not far to the right of the dumpsters are the vault toilets, which are two grey structures located on a wooden deck, accessible by steps or a ramp. Next to the restroom is a dirt path that leads into the forest. A wooden sign reads Lembert Dome, Dog Lake Trailhead. Two icons are located within two separate square outlines, and each have a red diagonal line slashing down it's center. The first icon is of a dog and the second icon is of a bicycle. To the right of the trailhead is a large, green tone, exhibit panel, inside a log frame, with log posts.Panel text reads, welcome to Lembert Dome parking. The dome above you was sculpted by glaciers, which have filled Tuolumne Meadows many times over millions of years. If you stood here thousands of years ago during a glacial period, you would be buried under 2,000 feet of ice! This trailhead accesses hikes to Lembert Dome, Dog Lake, Soda Springs, Glen Aulin, and Young Lakes. The upper half of the panel is a trail map of the area. Beginning at where the red dot indicates, you are here, in the middle of the map, yellow lines, representing trails, sprawl out from this point. To the upper left, the trails lead toward Soda Springs and Glen Aulin. To the upper right, the trail splits off to the right to Lembert Dome, before continuing to Dog Lake and Young Lakes. An icon for Parking, picnic area, and restrooms are next to the red dot. Blue indicates the water of Dog Lake and the Tuolumne River, and white represents Tioga Road, which runs left to right, with thinner white lines indicating smaller backroads. For more information about Yosemite maps, please call 209/379-1035The left column of panel text reads, take a hike! The trail to Lembert Dome or Dog Lake begins on your left (west) and passes in front of the bathrooms. Pay attention to signs, posted at every trail junction. Remember, this is the Lembert Dome Parking Area. Lembert Dome is moderately strenuous. The trail climbs 850 feet (259 km) through the forest to the bare rock of the dome. There is no trail on the rock. Follow the easiest path for panoramic views of Tuolumne Meadows and the surrounding peaks. Dog Lake is moderately strenuous. Surrounded by forest, this quiet lake is home to many species including water birds, song birds, deer, and dragonflies. Despite its name, pets are not allowed at Dog Lake, nor on any other trails. The Loop is moderately strenuous. It is possible to combine the Lembert Dome and Dog Lake hikes into a five-mile loop. Study the map for details. Do not walk on the road from the Dog Lake parking area back to this parking area. Instead, use the trails indicated on the map. Soda Springs is easy. Follow the gravel Soda Springs Road on your left. When you reach the gate, continue straight for about a half mile to the Soda Springs and Parsons Lodge. This easy, mostly flat walk opens up to views of the Tuolumne River, Tuolumne Meadows, and the surrounding peaks. Carbonated water bubbles out of the ground at Soda Springs. The Parsons Memorial Lodge has been a reading room, shelter, and place for lively discussion since it was built in 1915. The right column of panel text reads, before you go. Stay on trail.

The caption reads, Yosemite Creek as it pours over the top of Upper Yosemite Fall. Panel text reads, do you wonder what it's like up at the top of Yosemite Falls, before the water spills over the brink? The Falls begin as snow in the granite reaches of Yosemite wilderness. When the snow melts each spring, Yosemite Creek transforms into a free-falling torrent. Watch the comets of spray. Hear the water roar. And from the Lower Fall Bridge, feel the shower of a lifetime! <br /><br />Under a heading that reads, Seasonal Flow, four pictures of Yosemite Falls are shown.<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 1: Two waterfalls are stacked on top of each other. The upper fall is full of water and the lower fall has a slightly more narrow, shorter, stream of water.<br /><br />Caption: Spring - The force and volume of melting snow reaches its peak. <br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 2: Two waterfalls, stacked on top of each other, have dwindled down to a thin, hair-like strand of water.<br /><br />Caption: Summer - As the snowpack in the high country recedes, the flow of water starts to diminish. <br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 3: The Upper Yosemite Fall is more like a wet rock wall. No steady stream of water is seen, just darkened wet spot on the rock wall. <br /><br />Caption: Autumn - When the water dries up, the lichen-stained cliff face traces the course of the waterfalls. <br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 4: A thin stream of water falls over a large granite rock wall. White ice has built up on the rock face on both sides of the thin waterfall. The trees surrounding the lower half of the rock wall are all snow covered. <br /><br />Caption: Winter - The meager spray dribbles over the cliff and freezes.

    "audioDescription": "A wayside exhibit stands in a clearing on the right side of a paved path lined with tall trees that leads to Lower Yosemite Fall. On the left one-quarter side of the exhibit is a bronze tactile panel of a finger-like spire outcrop from off the side of a cliff face. The caption reads, to the right of Upper Yosemite Fall, you can see a finger of granite known as the Lost Arrow. Its name comes from a story about a deer hunter who was in the high country celebrating his conquests. From the cliffs above the Valley, he shot a victory arrow into the air. When the wayward point dropped to the ground, it turned to stone. <br /><br />The remaining right side of the panel is titled, Shaping Yosemite Valley, and has a faint, sepia-toned background photograph of a big pile of boulders. Panel text reads, like giant bulldozers, Ice-Age glaciers carved and plucked rock from Yosemite Valley's granite walls. As the glaciers receded, \"hanging valleys\" were left behind. The streams from these ancient valleys now flow over waterfalls - like Yosemite Falls. <br /><br />Black and white photo: The terrain above Yosemite Falls is covered with snow. Yosemite Falls is full of water as it plummets over the granite precipice. <br /><br />Under a heading that reads, And the Rocks Come Down, panel text reads, all is peaceful and calm now. But imagine what it was like long ago when the boulders to your left tumbled and crashed to the Valley floor. Rockfalls are as central to shaping the face of Yosemite Valley as fire or flood. Long before recorded history, these boulders, known as talus, fell as a result of weathering and erosion. For eons, this ongoing natural process has worked upon Valley walls. When water in cracks repeatedly freezes and thaws, rocks break free. Likewise, lichens, moss, and plant roots can grow in the cracks, helping to pry fragments loose. Be aware that rockfalls can happen at any time. <br />",

The model mimics the terrain on which the Yosemite Falls is found, which includes the high cliff walls, its textures, and its trails. Small bumps found all over the model represent trees. A trail to the left of Yosemite Falls, represented by raised tick marks, has a series of switchbacks leading up about one-third of the rock face before it flattens out to the right for another one-third of the trail, then starts ascending to the immediate left of Upper Yosemite Fall for the remainder of the trail to the top of Yosemite Falls. At the top of the rock face, the trail disperses out to the left, straight, and to the right. Raised, flat lines indicate the trails and roads on the valley floor. Slightly concaved lines, with squiggly textured lines within, indicate waterways in Yosemite Valley. The model reads, Yosemite Falls Area, and has a line of tick marks labeled 0.25 miles.",

    "audioDescription": "The paved parking area for Lukens Lake Trailhead is on the west side of Tioga Road and has three green recycle bins, three brown trash bins, two brown food lockers, and one wayside exhibit titled, Upper Montane. The trailhead is across the street and marked by a brown sign with an icon of a hiker inside a white square outline.<br /><br />Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, this is snow country, where plants and wildlife must cope with a high-mountain climate that brings winter snow that can remain until June. Here, the summers are short, cool, and moist. Only specialized species can survive. The red fir is one such hardy tree that can handle snowloads that exceed 30 feet. This tree grows in pure stands in the upper montane zone. <br /><br />Illustration: a 3-Dimensional, illustrated, cross-section map of the area's terrain has a road winding through the mountains labeled Tioga Road. Below the Tioga Road, a deep valley is labeled Yosemite Valley. Along Tioga Road, to the right of the first two labels is a red dot that is marked, 'you are here.' From the bottom to top of this map, colors transition from orange, to yellow, to green, to blue, to white. On the side of the map, a color-code shows that orange represents the foothills (1,800 to 3,000 feet), yellow represents the lower montane (3,000 to 6,000 feet), green represents the upper montane (6,000 to 8,000 feet), blue represents the sub-alpine (8,000 to 9,500 feet), and white represents the alpine (9,500 - 13,000 feet). <br /><br />Caption: As you travel through the different elevations along the Tioga Road, you can observe habitats similar to those found on an excursion from Mexico to the arctic. <br /><br />Text on the right side of the exhibit panel reads, The plants and animals of the habitat around you are uniquely connected. Interdependence is the only way to suvive within this extreme environment. One important interrelationship involves fungus, flying squirrels, and owls. Root fungi absorb food from trees, while simultaneously improving the roots' water and nutrient absorption. Truffle-like mushrooms growing from this fungus provide a food source for flying squirrels. In turn, owls prey upon the flying squirrel. In this circle of dependency, one missing link might threaten the survival of all.<br /><br />Illustration: A tree above ground and its roots below ground are a part of the main focal point of this illustration. A squirrel digs into the soil and reaches an oval-shaped object that is growing on the tree's roots underground. An owl is hovering in the background.",

    "audioDescription": "The trailhead to Lukens Lake begins across the street from the White Wolf Lodge front office building. There is a row of parking spaces that are lined with tall pine trees. The trail begins near the center of the parking row and enters into the forest. Two trailhead signs are posted. The first sign is brown with white text and shows the mileage of several hiking destinations that begin at this trailhead. The sign reads, Lukens Lake - 2.3, Harden Lake - 5.7, Ten Lakes - 9.7, Pate Valley - 10.4, Smith Meadows - 11.1, Yosemite Valley - 13.9, Hetch Hetchy - 17.0. The other sign is also brown with white text and lists wilderness regulations. The sign reads, Entering Yosemite Wilderness - Wilderness Permit is required for all overnight use. Please store food properly. Help protect the wild animals by keeping them wild. Wood fires are prohibited above 9,600 feet to protect fragile alpine areas. Please do not construct new fire rings. The use of gas stoves is encouraged in all areas. Select an existing campsite 100 feet or more (40 steps) from water, trails, and dry water courses. Help protect water quality by not washing anything in lakes and streams. Bury human waste at least six inches deep 100 feet from water. Must pack out all toilet paper. Shortcutting is dangerous and contributes to erosion. Please stay on established trails. Maximum group size is 15 people, or 8 maximum for off trail travel. Stock groups are limited to travel on trails only. All stock must be picketed 100 feet from water. Please scatter or bury all manure. Pack out all you pack in. Pick up extra trash when possible.

    "bodyText": "<p>Explore and experience the wonder of being surrounded by some of the rarest and most remarkable living things on the planet in the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias.</p> <p>Marvel at the towering giant sequoias in the Mariposa Grove Arrival Area, as you prepare to embark on your grand adventure into the grove.</p> <p>All trails begin here at the Mariposa Grove Arrival Area. They range from a relatively flat stroll to half- or full-day hikes that require strenuous uphill hiking. Each has its own rewards.</p> <h2>Big Trees Loop Trail (easy)</h2> <p>0.3 mile (0.5 km) loop from trailhead, 30 to 45 minutes (wheelchair accessible)</p> <p>Begin at Mariposa Grove Arrival Area. Winding through a forest with many giant sequoias, this trail features the Fallen Monarch and interpretive panels on the life and ecology of giant sequoias. This loop is relatively flat and is wheelchair accessible.</p> <h2>Grizzly Giant Loop Trail (moderate)</h2> <p>2 miles (3.2 km) loop from trailhead, 1.5 to 2 hours</p> <p>Begin at the Mariposa Grove Arrival Area. Start along the Mariposa Grove Trail at the Big Trees Loop and hike past notable trees such as the Bachelor and Three Graces, the Grizzly Giant, and California Tunnel Tree. Vehicles with a disability placard can drive as far as the Grizzly Giant accessible parking and enjoy this area of the grove via a section of trail that is wheelchair accessible.</p> <h2>Guardians Loop Trail<b> </b> (strenuous)</h2> <p>6.5 miles (10.5 km) round trip from trailhead, 4 to 6 hours<br /> 1,200 feet (366 m) elevation gain</p> <p>Begin at Mariposa Grove Arrival Area.

    "audioDescription": "Approaching the Mariposa Grove Trailhead from either the parking area or the shuttle drop off area, the most noticeable feature is the fenced-in pathway that zigzags between towering giant sequoias as it makes its way deeper into the grove. On the right side of the path entranceway sits a row of trash and recycle bins and a split log that serves as a long bench. To the left of the entranceway are several interpretive panels, a drinking fountain, and a bronze, tactile relief model of the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias (Caution: The bronze, tactile relief model is often in direct sunlight and could be too hot to touch). Three interpretive panels are lined up against a waist high fence. The first panel is titled A Way of Life Continues and explains the origins of stewardship of the grove by local native tribes, the Bishop Paiute Tribe, Bridgeport Indian Colony, Mono Lake Kutzadika Tribe, North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians of California, Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians, Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, and Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians. There is a sepia toned picture of a group of people, with a caption that reads, some members of the Tribal Working Group, Yosemite Conservancy, and NPS staff. There is also an area titled Greetings from the Traditionally Associated Tribes of Yosemite National Park, that contains five different tribal translations. There is also a map that shows the ancestral homelands of the park's Traditionally Associated Tribes, which are marked by a red dot in areas surrounding Yosemite. <br /><br />The second panel is titled Visiting the Mariposa Grove. There is a map showing all the trails in the Mariposa Grove, and a list containing hiking trail options that range from easy, to moderate, to strenuous. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. A call-out box titled Grove Etiquette reads, You are visiting a truly special place. Please take care to not damage this grove or impact the experience of other visitors. Please stay on designated trails and respect fenced areas. Be a steward of the grove - please no climbing or graffiti. Strive to leave no trace. No dogs, no collecting, no bikes. A third panel is titled A Legacy of Conservation and shows a sepia toned picture of Abraham Lincoln, as well as a picture of a National Park Service (NPS) uniform hat and belt, to show the significance of the sequoia cones featured on both the NPS uniform hat band and belt. Panel text reads, Welcome to the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias. This forest is legendary, and even sacred, to those who have experienced its majesty-from the seven Traditionally Associated Tribes of Yosemite, to important conservation leaders, and visitors who saw their first sequoia just yesterday. As you explore the grove, you'll be following in the footsteps of countless people who have revered and worked to protect these magnificent trees. This grove is also honored because it is one of our country's first protected public lands. The seeds of the national park movement were sown here when artists, writers, politicians, and early preservationists convinced the US Congress and President Abraham Lincoln to protect the giant sequoias from logging, tourism, and development in the mid-1800s. Every National Park Service ranger carries a reminder of the significance of these trees and the movement they inspired. Look closely at the NPS emblem, belt, and hatband pictured here with the sequoia cone and tree silhouette. A sign at the trailhead reads, Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias.",

    "audioDescription": "The May Lake Trailhead is in a small parking lot located, on a rugged, paved, one-lane road east of the Tioga Road. When the parking lot is at capacity or the road is closed due to snow and ice, an additional two-mile hike, one-way, from the Tioga Road is necessary. A brown trash bin, green recycle bin, and small, brown structure, which holds the vault toilet, line the parking lot. The dirt trail begins in the midst of trees, near a small pond, next to the vault toilet, and is marked by two signs. <br /><br />The first metal sign reads, May Lake High Sierra Camp - 1.2 miles. <br /><br />The second metal sign is brown and reads, Wilderness Permit is required for all overnight use. Please store food properly. Help protect the wild animals by keeping them wild. Wood fires are prohibited above 9,600 feet to protect fragile alpine areas. Please do not construct new fire rings. The use of gas stoves is encouraged in all areas. Select an existing campsite 100 feet or more (40 steps) from water, trails, and dry watercourses. Help protect water quality by not washing anything in lakes and streams. Bury human waste at least six inches deep 100 feet from water. Must pack out all toilet paper. Shortcutting is dangerous and contributes to erosion. Please stay on established trails. Maximum group size is 15 people, or 8 maximum for off trail travel. Stock groups are limited to travel on trails only. All stock must be picketed 100 feet from water. Please scatter or bury all manure. Pack out all you pack in. Pick up extra trash when possible. Three illustrations show three icons in three separate boxes with a red line diagonally slashed across the boxes. The first icon is of a dog, the second of a bicycle, and the third of a person shooting a rifle.<br />",

    "audioDescription": "A small, dirt, roadside parking area is located about 10 yards away from a brown and white sign that reads McGurk Meadow, which has an icon of a hiker inside a white square outline. In the parking area, which is lined with trees, one green recycle bin and one brown trash bin sit next to two brown food lockers. At the McGurk Meadow trailhead sign situated along the road, a dirt path leads into the shaded forest. Two signs are bolted to a metal post. The top sign is brown and white and it reads, Entering Yosemite Wilderness. Wilderness Permit is required for all overnight use. Please store food properly. Help protect the wild animals by keeping them wild. Wood fires are prohibited above 9,600 feet to protect fragile alpine areas. Please do not construct new fire rings. The use of gas stoves is encouraged in all areas. Select an existing campsite 100 feet or more (40 steps) from water, trails, and dry water courses. Help protect water quality by not washing anything in lakes and streams. Bury human waste at least 6 inches deep 100 feet away from water. Bury or pack out toilet paper. Shortcutting is dangerous and contributes to erosion. Please stay on established trails. Maximum group size is 15 people, or 8 maximum for off trail travel. Stock groups are limited to travel on trails only. All stock must be picketed 100 feet from water. Please scatter or bury all manure. Pack out all you pack in. Pick up extra trash when possible.

    "audioDescription": "A small, paved, parking area is next to a main road and is surrounded by forest. A green recycle bin, brown trash bin, and a small, brown, wood, structure, which holds a vault toilet, all line the parking lot. A wayside exhibit, framed in thick, log posts, stands at the trailhead, which appears to be a wide dirt road that is gated at the entrance. <br /><br />The green-toned exhibit panel is titled Merced Grove Trailhead and has an illustrated map, which takes up a majority of the left side of the panel. The map shows a red dot at the bottom of the map, which is labeled, you are here. A yellow squiggle line, representing the trail, makes its way through a faint canopy of trees to the grove. An aerial view of about 12 bold tree tops are shown at the end of the trail, as well as a small cabin. <br /><br />Caption: The path to the Merced Grove is the roadbed of the historic Coulterville Road. Started in 1870, John Taylor McLean invested his entire fortune to ensure the success of the project. Although his efforts failed financially, his contribution resulted in the historic accomplishment of completing the first road into Yosemite Valley. Regularly scheduled stage travel began June 18, 1874. <br /><br />Black and white photo: A classic car is stopped next to a large tree, on a narrow dirt road that passes through a forest of tall trees. <br /><br />Caption: This small grove of about twenty trees was named Crane Flat Grove by the Whitney Survey in 1870. The grove was later re-named Merced Grove, reportedly due to its proximity to the Merced River. <br /><br />Text on the right side of the panel reads, the smallest of Yosemite's three giant sequoia groves, the Merced Grove offers perhaps the best opportunity for a solitary experience among these colossal giants. <br /><br />While enjoying your walk to the grove, consider the rarity of this experience. At one time, sequoias covered an extensive range, but now grow only in isolated groves on the Sierra Nevada's western slope. Limited by specialized growing needs, these trees require both moisture-mostly from winter snowfalls-as well as periodic fire. Frequent burns expose bare mineral soil for seeds to take root. Fire also reduces the number of competing species and opens the forest canopy for sunlight to reach the sun-loving trees. Sequoias appear large and strong; however, their shallow roots are quite vulnerable to damage. Avoid walking in areas immediately surrounding the bases of the trees. Leave cones and other natural items that you find. <br /><br />Illustration: A wedge-like, cross-section illustration that is thick on one end and tapers to a thin edge on the other, shows the slope of the trail. A red dot at the top of the wedge reads, you are here. A yellow line, indicating the trail, squiqqles downhill to the grove of trees. At the bottom of the wedge, an arrow goes from one end to the other and is labeled, 1.5 miles. <br /><br />Trail Conditions: Carry enough drinking water for a fairly rigorous hike. Make sure to allow 3 to 4 hours for a 3-mile round-trip hike. There are no restrooms or running water in the grove. The return uphill is moderately strenuous (600ft. (183 m.) elevation gain). This trail is marked for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in winter. <br /><br />Black and white photo: A small log cabin sits in the midst of a forest. On the front side of the cabin, a door is in the center with one window on each side. A stone chimney rises out of the roof. <br /><br />Caption: The old cabin along this trail was built in 1934 as a summer retreat for park superintendents. More recently, it has served as a retreat and learning space for school children visiting the park.",

Beyond that, they are prohibited.</li> <li>Keep your food within arm's reach at all times and do not feed the wildlife.</li> <li>Carry out all trash and food waste (fruit peels, shells, etc.).</li> </ul> <h3>Hazards & Warnings </h3> <ul> <li>Be aware of slick conditions along the south side of this loop trail during winter and early spring. When winter conditions exist, consider making an out and back trip along the north side of the loop.</li> <li>Stay on the trail! This is especially important during spring and early summer when water levels are highest. When hiking on the south side of the loop, hikers often spot what appears to be an easy way to rock-hop across Tenaya Creek, either just for fun, or as a way to shortcut the loop and rejoin the trail without doing the entire loop. While this crossing is only ankle deep at first, it quickly becomes thigh deep, and, all too often, hikers are swept into dangerous whitewater and pinned against rocks. Don't be tempted to leave the trail, and always remember when approaching moving water to look at the conditions downstream.</li> </ul> <h3>Accessibility</h3> <p>Vehicles with a disability placard are permitted to drive at 15 mph, with emergency flashers on, to Mirror Lake. There are two designated accessible parking spaces available.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A green and white shuttle stop sign stands next to the roadside turnout where the shuttle bus stops. The sign reads, Valley shuttle, Mirror Lake Trailhead, and has the number 17 in white font within a green circle. Next to the sign is a wooden shelter that holds two benches. A yellow chain barrier is set up to help queue the line. A brown trash bin, a green recycle bin, and a wayside exhibit and a sign that has three small panels across the top and a large map on the bottom, are near the shuttle stop shelter. A paved path/road retreats into the trees behind the shelter. The first panel on the sign is yellow with a green bar across the top. Text in the green bar reads, shuttle bus schedule. The text in the yellow section reads, shuttle stop 17, Mirror Lake. From 7am to 10am, service every 30 minutes. From 10am to 7pm, service every 20 minutes. From 7pm to 10pm, service every 30 minutes. <br /><br />The second panel is white with a blue bar across the top. Text in the blue bar reads, Did You Know? Text in the white section reads, Mirror Lake is not really a lake at all. Until the middle of the 20th century, park personnel dredged sand to maintain a pond that reflected the cliffs above. Current park policy is to let the natural succession of pond to meadow occur. During high water, however, you can still see a stunning reflection of Half Dome. Photo: One person stands in ankle-deep snow, with a backpack on the ground by his side, and his back turned from the camera. He is facing a small body of water and the large face of Half Dome which towers over this lake. Snow covers the landscape. <br /><br />Caption: At Half Dome's base, Mirror Lake forms in winter and spring, but is more of a sandy beach during the dry season. NPS photo by Erik Skindrud.<br /><br />The third panel is white with an orange bar across the top. Text in the orange bar reads, Be Bear Aware. Text in the white box reads, Keeping bears away from your food isn't just a way to avoid a fine-it could save a bear's life. Do not store food in vehicles after dark. When not stored in a locker or cabin, food must be within arm's length. Stay at least 50 yards from a bear. If a bear approaches, yell to scare it away. <br /><br />Photo: A reddish-brown black bear with yellow plastic tags on both ears, is hanging halfway out of a parked car's side door window. The door frame is bent half way down, the side view mirror is dangling, and the glass has been busted out. It is dark out. <br /><br />Caption: Bear break-ins can cost thousands of dollars and put visitors and bears at risk. NPS photo by Tammy Evans.<br /><br />A large map showing three different shuttle routes in Yosemite Valley is below. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. <br /><br />The wayside exhibit panel is located on the right side of the path and is titled, Mirror Lake. The panel has a faint, black and white, background photo of a body of water lined with trees and tall, granite, rock faces. Text reads, in the 19th century, Mirror Lake became famous for its magnificent views of surrounding peaks reflected in the water's glassy surface. But the \"lake\" was misnamed - it is simply a broad shallow pool in Tenaya Creek. The reflecting pool varies with the season. By late summer, when Tenaya Creek is no longer fed by melting snows from above, the pool disappears. <br /><br />Under a heading that reads, A Well-Traveled Path, text reads, Mirror Lake was a much publicized attraction for late 19th century tourists. It is still one of Yosemite's most popular hiking destinations. The view of Half Dome's 4,800-foot sheer face, seen from its base, is an attraction any time of the year. <br /><br />Another section of the panel is about mountain lion habitat and reads, you are in a mountain lion habitat. Children should not run ahead or lag behind on the trail. Hiking alone and jogging are not recommended. In the unlikely event that you see a mountain lion, do the following:<br /><br />Stay calm. Do not run. Do not turn your back on the lion.<br />Adults should pick up small children.<br />Make yourself appear as large as possible; raise your arms over your head and open your jacket. <br />If it acts aggressively, wave your arms, shout, and throw rocks and sticks at the lion. <br />If attacked, fight back!<br /><br />Illustration: A mountain lion, standing on a downhill slope, faces to the left with its mouth slightly open and its ears perked. <br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>The very popular John Muir and Mist Trails offer spectacular, up-close views of two large waterfalls, enjoyable scenery along the Merced River, and unique views across Yosemite Valley. About 1 trail mile from the trailhead, beyond the Vernal Fall Footbridge, the Mist Trail and the John Muir Trail diverge. Consider accessing Vernal and Nevada Fall via the Mist Trail, looping around and taking the John Muir Trail back down to the Valley. Prepare for slippery footing and a tremendous amount of waterfall spray in spring and early summer. See more information about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/vernalnevadatrail.htm\">trails</a>. </p> <h2>Water</h2> <p>Drinking water is available at shuttle stop #16, near the trailhead, and also at the Vernal Fall Footbridge (May to October). This is the only drinking water available along the trail, so carry plenty of water for your hike.</p> <h3>Amount of water to bring</h3> <p>Vernal Fall Footbridge 1 quart/liter<br /> Top of Vernal Fall 2 quarter/liters<br /> Top of Nevada Fall 3-4 quarts/liters</p> <h2>Restrooms</h2> <p>Restrooms are located at the shuttle stop, near the trailhead. Additionally, restrooms are located at the Vernal Fall footbridge, approximately 1 mile up the trail (May to October). Vault toilets are available beyond the top of Vernal Fall (along the Mist Trail) and at the top of Nevada Fall (along the Mist Trail).</p> <h2><b>Vernal Fall Footbridge</b> (Moderate)</h2> <p>1.6 miles (2.6 km) round trip; 1-1.5 hours<br /> 400 feet (120 m) elevation gain</p> <h2>Top of Vernal Fall (Strenuous)</h2> <p>2.4 miles (3.9 km) round trip (via Mist Trail); 3 hours<br /> 1000 feet (300m) elevation gain</p> <h2>Top of Nevada Fall (Strenuous)</h2> <p>5.4 miles (8.7 km) round trip (via Mist Trail); 5-6 hours<br /> 2,000 feet (610 m) elevation gain<br /> <br /> You can also take the John Muir Trail to the top of Vernal Fall (via the Clark Point cutoff) and the top of Nevada Fall, or combine the Mist Trail and John Muir Trail into a loop. See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/vernalnevadatrail.htm\">map</a>.</p> <h2>Hours</h2> <p>Year-round, however, the lower portion of the Mist Trail along Vernal Fall closes in winter due to risk of falling ice and rock. Also, the upper portion of the John Muir Trail between Clark Point and the top of Nevada Fall is closed in winter due to treacherously icy conditions. Keep in mind that the sections of trail that remain open in the winter may be very icy and/or snowy. View <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/conditions.htm\">current conditions</a> for trail closures.</p> <h2>Getting Here</h2> <p>Located at Happy Isles at shuttle stop #16. Follow the signs across the bridge to where the trail begins. There is no parking in the immediate area.</p> <h2>Rules & Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>Stay on the established trail: do not swim or wade in the river and do not walk along the edge of the river.</li> <li>Observe warning signs and railings - these exist for your safety.</li> <li>Pets, bicycles, and strollers are prohibited.</li> <li>Do not shortcut switchbacks, which causes rapid trail erosion and results in injuries.</li> <li>Keep your food within arm's reach at all times and do not feed the wildlife.</li> <li>Carry out all trash and food waste (fruit peels, shells, etc.).</li> </ul> <h2>Hazards & Warnings</h2> <p>Carry a head lamp (with fresh or extra batteries) in case you end up hiking more slowly or farther then planned and find yourself hiking back in the dark.<br /> Sprained ankles and knee injuries are common on this trail. There are many areas of loose rock/decomposed granite, mixed with steep steps, and water, which makes for slippery footing in places.</p> <p>Avoid becoming dehydrated or experiencing heat exhaustion. Drink plenty and drink often; pace yourself; rest in the shade; and eat salty snacks.</p> <p>The granite steps along the Mist Trail leading up to the brink of Vernal Fall can be slick and crowded. Consider making a loop by continuing on the trail, past the brink of Vernal Fall and Emerald Pool, taking the cutoff trail to Clark Point, and then hiking down the John Muir Trail.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>This trail is not accessible.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "The small, paved, parking area for Mono Pass Trailhead is located along the south side of Tioga Road. It is marked by a brown metal sign that has a white icon and text. The sign reads, 'Mono Pass,' and has an icon of a backpacker and an arrow that pointing to the right.In the parking area, there are two green recycle bins, two brown trash bins, a row of food lockers, and a small, brown facility, which holds a vault toilet. Two small signs that read, 'no camping,' and 'no dogs,' line the curb, near the trailhead. A wooden fence separates the parking area from the wilderness area.Six signs line the dirt path at the Mono Pass Trailhead. The first sign is a wayside exhibit titled Yosemite Ghost Mines, and has a faded black and white photo of a log structure, too shabby and small to be a cabin, but very cabin-like. Text reads, as early as 1860, prospectors explored Mono Pass in search of rich rock. Here, among the glacially carved granite and craggy peaks of the Sierra crest, these hardy men discovered silver deposits and went to work in hopes of fortune.Buildings of the Past - five log cabins mark the location of the Golden Crown and Ella Bloss miners near Mono Pass. This windswept site was established in 1879 during the Tioga silver boom that also produced Bennettville and the Great Sierra Mine near Tioga Pass. Significant wealth was predicted, but around 1890, the mines were abandoned.A Past Preserved - The cabins are increasingly fragile reminders of mining on the Sierra crest. Please help preserve these valuable historic resources by not using them as campsites or fire shelters. It is illegal to damage, deface, or remove archaeological objects or features from federal land. The second sign is separated into five sections. Two small square panels on top, a large map in the middle, and two small square panels on bottom. The Top left panel is maroon with white text and reads, Mono Pass Trailhead, follow the path of Yosemite's first people, the Miwok, over their trade route to the east.Mono Pass is 3.7 miles and Parker Pass is 5.2 miles. The entire watershed of the Dana Fork of the Tuolumne is closed to overnight camping to protect water quality.The top right panel is blue with white text and reads, Wilderness Regulations, the natural integrity of Yosemite's high country depends on you. Help protect the wilderness, and avoid a citation, by following these regulations.Camp at least four trail miles from all developed areas.Pets, firearms, and bicycles are prohibited in wilderness.Stay on the trails; shortcutting switchbacks kills vegetation and causes erosion. Maximum group size for cross-country travel is eight people.Avoid disturbing wildlife and other visitors by keeping quiet on the trail and in camp.Use a gas stove for cooking; wood fires are allowed only below 9,600 feet in existing fire rings using dead and downed wood.Leave campsites as you find them; do not build windbreaks, fire rings, hitch racks, chairs, drainage trenches, or other \"improvements.\"Pack out everything you carry in; do not burn trash.Wilderness permit required for all overnight use.A series of three white circles containing three different icons are outlined in red and have a red diagonal line slashing through the middle.

Wildlife, wilderness visitors, and people downstream all need clean water to stay healthy.Protect your water suppy by following these regulations and suggestions:Camp at least 100 feet (40 steps) from water.Deposit human waste in a six-inch-deep hole at least 100 feet from water; carry out toilet paper.Wash dishes and yourself at least 100 feet from water; even biodegradable soap pollutes.Carry a large water container and limit your trips to collect water; eroded stream banks and lake shores contribute to poor water quality.Stay on the trails; shortcutting switchbacks increases erosion and leads to silt-filled streams.Giardia lamblia is a disease-causing protozoan that can be present in all Sierran water; treat all water before drinking. The bottom right panel is yellow with black text and reads, Black Bears - the health and well-being of Yosemite's bears depends on you.Bears are intelligent, curious, adaptable, and hungry. Human food, however, is harmful to bears and other animals here. Keep wildlife wild by using these food storage methods.At the trailhead: Remove all food, ice chests, and scented items from your car. Store them in food storage lockers where available. Never feed bears or other wildlife.In the backcountry: Store food, garbage, and scented items in bearproof canisters, available at front country locations. Keep items s",

Blue scraggily lines that look like veins come from the mountains and meet up with a thick blue line, representing a river, which flows through a valley, past forests and towns that are indicated by small triangles. <br /><br />Caption: A watershed is an ara that is delineated by high ridges such as cliffs, hills, and mountains. Rain or snowmelt flows down from the ridges and collects in streams, rivers, and other water bodies, such as lakes and reservoirs. Watershed protection is a top priority because it affects the quality of water for people downstream and everything that lives within these boundaries.",

    "audioDescription": "A view to the left of the large, slightly arched, one-row, parking area shows a ridge line that peaks at Cloud's Rest and continues down to an oddly shaped dome, which is the backside of Half Dome. To the right of and behind the parking area are smooth granite domes that have large boulders randomly scattered across its surface and trees growing out of the cracks of the granite. Near the center of the parking row, is an exhibit area that has three wayside exhibits and a bronze tactile model of the surrounding landscape. The background picture of the first wayside exhibit shows a perspective from a smooth granite dome with large boulders randomly scattered about, allowing views of Cloud's Rest and the backside of Half Dome, and is titled Olmsted Point. A black and white photo of the side profile of an older man with white hair and a white beard and mustache, looking to the left, is in the bottom right corner. The photo is captioned Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr. A subtitle reads, A family legacy. Text below reads, This turnout was named in honor of famed landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), and his son, Frederick, Jr., when Tioga Road opened to automobile traffic in 1961. Olmsted senior was considered the father of American landscape architecture and best known for his design of New York's Central Park. He was chairman of the first commission to manage Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove and wrote a report recommending policy for the care and protection of Yosemite's scenery and wildlife. It is considered a classic national park treatise. Black and white photo: A man with short hair and glasses, wearing a heavy coat and a tie, sits at a table with a pen in his right hand, drawing on a map. Photo caption: Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. Text to the right of the picture reads, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. (1870-1957) also worked in the field of landscape architecture. He collaborated with the National Park Service and was a member of the Yosemite Advisory Board, a group of experts who helped park managers solve problems. He maintained a lifelong commitment to conversation, contributing the guiding language in legislation establishing the National Park Service in 1916. A second exhibit panel titled, Forces of Change, shows a black and white, faded, background photo of a large peak labeled Cloud's Rest and a dome with a smaller dome attached to it, labeled Half Dome. In the forefront, a large boulder rests on a smooth granite surface. Text on the left side of the panel reads, panoramic view. Half Dome stands before you. With a pair of binoculars, you can often see a line of hikers, like ants, climbing up cables to the summit. To the left is the massive northwest face of Cloud's Rest. From its summit (9,926 feet elevation) the sheer granite face, one of the largest in the world, drops nearly 5,000 feet to lower Tenaya Creek. A brief walk to the east side of the parking area will lead to spectacular views of Tenaya Lake, and Mount Conness. Powerful geological forces shaped this landscape. Evidence emerges throughout this granite scene. Chambers of magma deep within the earth slowly crystallized 100-80 million years ago to form hard granite rock. Over time, erosion by rivers and extensive glaciers exposed and sculpted the rock. Black and white photo: Two large boulders sit on a smooth granite surface, that has cracks criss-crossing each other. A man walks on the granite surface, and is a small figure in comparison to the the two large boulders. Caption: These large boulders randomly placed on the bedrock are evidence of the most recent glaciation. The rocks either toppled down slopes onto the glacier or were plucked from the bedrock. They landed here as the ice melted away. Black and white photo: Portions of a smooth granite bedrock seems buffed and shiny as the sun shines on it.Caption: Glacial Polish - Over the last million years, major glaciers have come and gone in Yosemite. Only 20 thousand years ago the most recent glacier extended from the high peaks to the distant horizon. Like rough sandpaper smoothing wood, these glaciers polished the rock you see near here. A third wayside exhibit panel titled Experience Yosemite has a faded background picture of trees and mountains that surround a lake. The lake is labeled Tenaya Lake. Text on the left side of the panel reads, Look and listen - Within this vast granite setting are the sounds of Yosemite's year-round residents. Listen for the occasional alarm whistle of the yellow-bellied marmot, the raucous calls of the Stellar's Jay or Clark's Nutcracker, or maybe the distant rhythmic booming of the male blue grouse trying to attract a mate. Stay long enough and a golden eagle may circle above. Growing twisted and gnarled out of cracks in rocks, Sierra junipers have red, ribbon-like bark and overlapping scales for leaves. Their blue, berry-like cones have a pungent gin-like smell. Juniper berries do not readily germinate unless they pass through the digest",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit is the thirteenth stop of 15 on the Soda Springs and Parsons Lodge Tour. On top of a small hilltop is a cobblestoned structure. The building is mostly made of stacked granite stones. Vertical logs that make up the slightly pitched roof, overhang a few feet on the front side of the building. Five large structural log posts that make up the framework of the building, jut out the sides. An arched doorway with a wooden, arched door is in the center of the front, and one window is on each side of the door. A wooden bench is placed on both sides of the doorway. Large boulders scatter the area. A bronze plaque is affixed to one of the boulders near the building's entrance, which reads, Parsons Memorial Lodge has been designated a National Historic Landmark. This site possesses national significance in commemorating the history of the United States of America. 1987, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior. The nearby wayside exhibit is titled, Parsons Memorial Lodge, and has a black and white photo on the left, two-thirds of the panel. The photo shows a line of over fifty people, most with walking sticks, hiking up a smooth, snowy, slope, in a wavy, snake-like pattern. <br /><br />Caption: An early Sierra Club outing.<br /><br />Panel text reads, as a guide for the early Sierra Club, Edward Taylor Parsons (1861-1914) led hundreds of people on unforgettable high mountain adventures. He also campaigned with John Muir, without success, to keep Yosemite National Park's Hetch Hetchy Valley undammed.<br /><br />In 1915, the Sierra Club built this lodge in Parsons'memory. Orignally a meeting place and reading room. Parsons Lodge continues to be a refuge from afternoon thunderstorms, as well as a center for exhibits and special programs. <br /><br />Photo: A middle-aged man with a full mustache and a top hat, wears a thick suit jacket over a white shirt with gloves that cover his sleeves, and knee-high boots that cover his long pants. <br /><br />Caption: Edward Taylor Parsons<br />",

    "audioDescription": "A roadside turnout with limited parking on the north side of Tioga Road hosts views of a large open meadow and surrounding peaks and domes. A trail to the west of the parking area leads around the outskirts of the meadow, to Pothole Dome, a smooth granite dome that would allow for a slightly higher panoramic view. In the distance, a forest lines the perimeter of the meadow and pointed peaks rise above the tree line. Several signs are posted at the parking area and the start of the path. The first sign in the parking area is a brown sign, outlined in white, and has white text that reads, no camping or overnight parking.The second sign is a small, white, metal sign on a wooden post located on the meadow side of long, large, logs used as barriers to separate the dirt parking from the meadow. A photo on the upper right side of the sign shows several bright, tall, wildflowers in a lush green meadow with a snow covered peak rising above the pine treeline in the distance. The sign reads, meadow restoration in progress. Trails that pass through sensitive habitats, such as Tuolumne Meadows, can have an impact that reaches far beyond the trail. We are currently working to restore this area. Please stay on the main trail shown in blue on the map. Please stay on designated trail.Photo: Two people walk off-trail through a large meadow. In the distance, mountain peaks rise above a dense forest. Map: In a square frame, the Tioga Road is indicated by a blue and white tick line that leads from the upper left corner to the bottom right corner. Above that line, sandwiched between the road and a large white area that indicates the granite of Pothole dome is a meadow, a wetland area represented by an upward-turned, banana shape filled with blue marks. A yellow star and text that reads, \"you are here,\" along with an icon of a hiker inside a red square, which is a trailhead, are along the Tioga Road, one quarter of the way from the top. A blue solid line, which is the Pothole Dome Trail, makes its way around the left side of the banana-shaped wetland area then leads to the right, all the way to the right side of the frame. A red, solid line cuts through the meadow from Tioga Road to Pothole Dome and forks out into two paths, they are marked closed.A wayside exhibit titled Sub-Alpine Zone, is located on the parking side of long, large, logs used as barriers to separate the meadow from the dirt parking area. Text on the left side of the panel reads, the plants and animals in this zone sometimes have only two and a half months to complete a year's work. At this elevation, the snow can be on the ground well into June, only to return as early as September. Bevause this sub-alpine meadow ecosystem is so fragile, even one person crossing it can cause serious damage - especially if it is wet. By following the trail to your left on your hike to Pothole Dome, you can protect plants and animals during their active season.Illustration: a 3-Dimensional, illustrated, cross-section map of the area's terrain has a road winding through the mountains labeled Tioga Road. Below the Tioga Road, a deep valley is labeled Yosemite Valley. Along Tioga Road, to the right of both labels is a red dot that is marked, 'you are here.' From the front to back of this map, colors transition from orange, to yellow, to green, to blue, to white. On the side of the map, a color-code shows that orange represents the foothills (1,800 to 3,000 feet), yellow represents the lower montane (3,000 to 6,000 feet), green represents the upper montane (6,000 to 8,000 feet), blue represents the sub-alpine (8,000 to 9,500 feet), and white represents the alpine (9,500 - 13,000 feet). Caption: As you travel through the different elevations along the Tioga Road, you can observe habitats similar to those found on an excursion from Mexico to the arctic. At the start of the Pothole Dome Trail, a brown sign outlined in white has white text that reads, Entering Yosemite Wilderness - Wilderness Permit is required for all overnight use. Please store food properly. Help protect the wild animals by keeping them wild. Wood fires are prohibited above 9,600 feet to protect fragile alpine areas. Please do not construct new fire rings. The use of gas stoves is encouraged in all areas. Select an existing campsite 100 feet or more (40 steps) from water, trails, and dry water courses. Help protect water quality by not washing anything in lakes and streams. Bury human waste at least six inches deep 100 feet from water. Must pack out all toilet paper. Shortcutting is dangerous and contributes to erosion. Please stay on established trails. Maximum group size is 15 people, or 8 maximum for off trail travel. Stock groups are limited to travel on trails only. All stock must be picketed 100 feet from water. Please scatter or bury all manure. Pack out all you pack in. Pick up extra trash when possible.

    "bodyText": "<p>After twenty-three years protecting the park, the U.S. Army was called away from Yosemite in 1914, and civilians began to assume ranger roles. It was the job of these rangers to protect the natural resources, stop forest fires, and assist visitors. Their duties were made more difficult as automobiles had recently been allowed to enter the park.</p> <p>The ranger patrol cabin was built in 1915 to house rangers at Crane Flat, a busy road junction. Buildings such as this were used as automobile check stations. Here drivers paid a fee to enter the park and were informed of regulations. Along sections of the Big Oak Flat and Wawona roads, automobiles were only permitted to go east, downgrade, on odd hours and west, upgrade, on even hours. At Crane Flat and others Yosemite locations, rangers needed to live close to backcountry patrol routes and roadside stations where they assisted visitors arriving by automobile. In 1916 the National Park Service was created and the rangers living here became some of the first National Park Service Rangers.</p> <p>Gabriel Sovulewski, a Polish immigrant, embodied the administrative transition from the military to the National Park Service in Yosemite. He first saw Yosemite in 1895 while on a summer deployment to the park with the U.S. Army. In 1902, he left the Army and returned to Yosemite to work as a packer and guide. In 1906, Gabriel was placed in charge of Yosemite National Park, serving as the top park official for thirty years. During that time he directed the construction of trails and buildings such as the Ranger Patrol Cabin. Gabriel Sovulewski remained in Yosemite for the rest of his life, and is buried next to his wife, Rose in the Yosemite Cemetery.</p>",

There is a stone chimney on the left side of the structure, and a wooden stump stool in the front. An exhibit sign reads:<br /><br />Ranger Patrol Cabin<br />In 1905, California ceded Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias for inclusion in Yosemite National Park. The ceded land was accepted by the federal government in 1906, adding 31,104 acres to the Park. Thus, after 16 years, the Valley and Grove became part of Yosemite National Park.<br /><br />In 1913, the army stopped coming to the Yosemite, but the National Park Service had not as yet been established. In the intervening three years, fifteen civilian rangers, most of whom were formerly army scouts, were hired to protect the Park and its visitors - a big change from 150 cavalry men the previous year. <br /><br />They were provided with three patrol cabins. This one, built at Crane Flat, incurred the following costs: Materials were $250.98 and Labor equalled $685.36...a wise use of your tax dollar in the early 1900's. These civilian rangers were absorbed into the fledgling National Park Service, created in 1916 to administer or unique national preserves.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Rangers' Club was the first structure build in the National Park Service Rustic architecture style. Stephen T. Mather, the first director of the National Park Service, employed park rangers to guide tourists and protect the park from poachers. In 1920, Mather hired architect Charles Sumner to construct a home for members of his newly organized ranger force, paying $39,380 for the building out of his own pocket. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985 for significance in the development of the Rustic style and is still in use today as a home for seasonal rangers.</p> <p>Sumner designed a large, modified chalet with wood shingles and steeply pitched roofs. Instead of leaving simple corners, every edge of the building is defined with heavy log pilasters, strengthening the connection between the building and surrounding forest edges. The steep roofs shed the winter snows and emphasized the structure's verticality—an homage to the surrounding mountains.</p> <p>Rangers’ Club is a private residence, do not approach the building or disturb the residents.</p>",

The grey roof shingles are very clearly visible on the second story of the building, as the building has an extremely steeply pitched roof. Dormer windows feature throughout the outer faces of the building. All the windows are vertically oriented, multi-paned, and the frames are painted a contrasting light tan.

    "audioDescription": "Sentinel Bridge is a great place to experience Half Dome. Many photographers enjoy gathering here to take pictures of Half Dome and its reflection in the Merced River, especially when the colors of sunset play on its rock face. The bridge is completely made of stone and is slightly arched. Wayside exhibits are affixed to the metal railing that is adhered to the rock barrier-walls on each side of the bridge. On the east side of the bridge, tall trees line the banks of the river and Half Dome rises over the tree line. The wayside exhibit is titled, The Story of Half Dome, and has a orange-toned, faint, background photo of textured granite rock. Text reads, millions of years ago the granite block of Half Dome was larger, but there never was a matching half. Undercut by glaciers near the base, slabs of rock fell away from a broad vertical crack in the granite, leaving a sheer face. Remnants of the missing rock still project from Half Dome's rim. There are more granite domes here than in any other place in the world. Massive granite domes from when large curved layers of rock \"exfoliate\" or slab off. Illustrated brochure: A side profile of Half Dome, with dark shadows in the front and low laying clouds floating below its face. In the background, some grey peaks cross the skyline and the sky is a bright orange and yellow. The text reads Yosemite Valley, on top, and Southern Pacific, on bottom.Caption: c. 1910Black and white postcard: Half Dome and trees surrounding it have an almost symmetrical reflection in the Merced River. Caption: Half Dome from Sentinel Bridge, postcard, c. 1940. Since the mid-19th century, countless images of the park's most famous dome, Half Dome, have been circulated. Its profile has become an enduring and instantly recognizable symbol of Yosemite. A section on the left side of the panel has a header that reads, An Ahwahneechee Tale of Half Dome. Text below it reads, long ago, two travelers, Tissiak and her husband, Tokoyee, fought with each other. He became so angry that he began to beat her; enraged, she hurled her basket of acorns at him. As they stood facing each other, they were turned to stone for their wickedness. The acorn basket (Basket Dome) lies upturned beside Tokoyee (North Dome) and the rock face of Tissiak (Half Dome) is stained with her tears. Photo: Half Dome is illuminated with the orange light of the alpen glow. Behind Half Dome, other mountains a lit as well, and the sky is full of dark clouds. Across the street, on the opposite side of the bridge, another wayside exhibit is affixed to the bridge barrier-wall. The wayside exhibit is titled, River of Mercy, and has a orange-toned, very faint, background photo of an old map of Yosemite Valley. Text reads, early Spanish explorers named the Merced River for Our Lady of Mercy. In Yosemite Valley, later settlers saw the Merced and its tributaries as troublesome as well as merciful. They channeled the wild river, dynamited the glacial moraine at the Valley entrance to lower the water table, and diverted water to quench the thirst of livestock and to power a sawmill. Black and white photo: The banks of a river have receded, and about three feet of roots of two tree stumps are exposed. The river flows nearby.Caption: Overuse damages the riverbanks and riparian life. Black and white photo: A woman in white, water-resistant pants with suspenders, a white t-shirt, boots, and a ponytail inserts a pole into the muddy ground on the banks of a river. Another woman with a t-shirt and gloves, bends down on her knees, and inserts a pole in the ground in the same spot. The river flows nearby. Caption: Volunteers assist park resource managers in revegetating riverbanks.Human alterations have harmed the riparian (river-related) habitat. Introduced fish species gradually outnumbered the native rainbow trout. Human feet have trampled the riverbanks and destroyed streamside plants. Restoration efforts such as replanting, fencing, and elimination of fish stocking are returning the river to a more natural state. A section on the left side of the panel has a header that reads, A Wild and Scenic River. Text below it reads, the Merced River watershed begins in the southeastern portion of the park, primarily in the high country of the Clark and Cathedral Ranges. The river plunges over Nevada and Vernal Falls, then meanders across the flat Yosemite Valley floor. Leaving Yosemite Valley, it winds down the Merced Canyon into the San Joaquin Valley far below. In 1987, recognizing the Merced's pristine beauty, Congress designated its upper reaches in and below the park as a National Wild and Scenic River. Black and white Photo 1: A mountain landscape with sloping hills and pine trees is covered in snow. Snowcapped peaks are in the distant background.Caption: The Merced's pristine waters originate in the melting snows of Yosemite's high country.Black and white Photo 2: A mountain lake glistens and is framed by tree branches.

    "audioDescription": "The Sentinel Bridge Parking area is a prime spot to experience Yosemite Falls. The north side of the parking lot is lined with a wooden fence that separates the sidewalk from the large open meadow that shows views of Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls. Bus stop #11 stands at the southeast side of the parking lot. Four benches, a green recycle bin, brown trash bin, and a small, wood, shelter are all by the bus stop. Further south from the bus stop, a crosswalk leads across the street to the Sentinel Bridge. A few wayside exhibits are located in the parking lot, along the meadow. <br /><br />The first exhibit panel is titled Ecotones: Life on the Edge, and has a faint background photo of a small patch of meadow, containing long grasses and sedges, surrounded with pine trees. Panel text reads, the zone where two habitats merge is called an ecotone. The meadow/forest ecotone is visible here. The water-saturated meadow gives way to the oaks and towering conifers, which can't survive in flood-prone areas. The greatest diversity of wildlife exists in these transition areas where a variety of food and shelter is present. <br /><br />The Changing Landscape - By the 1860s, hotel owners were converting meadows to pastures, gardens, orchards, and hay fields. They suppressed fires because they threatened wooden buildings. They also channeled the Merced River to control flooding and drained boggy areas of the Valley. <br /><br />Black and white photo: Black and white spotted cows graze in an open meadow with towering cliffs surrounding them. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Valley, 1918.<br /><br />Meadows in Peril - Only a century ago the meadows of Yosemite Valley were far more extensive than they are today. With the right balance of water, fire, and soil conditions, a meadow can survive indefinitely. But with the altercation of the water table and fire cycle in the Valley, the natural balance was lost. <br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 1: An aerial view of a meadow below the iconic Half Dome shows larges patches of open meadows with trees scattered here and there. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Valley Meadows, 1899<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 2: An aerial view of a meadow below the iconic Half Dome shows dense stands of trees with only a few small patches of meadow showing.<br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Valley Meadows, 1991<br /><br />Next to the first wayside exhibit, a second one is titled Meltdown, and has a faint background photo of a waterfall coming over a tall, granite rockface. Panel text reads, the high-country snowpack is Yosemite's reservoir. As the snow melts in the spring, torrents of water cascade over Yosemite Falls (on the cliff before you) and over dozens of other waterfalls.<br /><br />Upstream, shallow soil on granite slopes absorbs very little water, Once the snow is gone, usually by late summer, most of Yosemite's waterfalls quickly dwindle. <br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 1: A close up view of a wet rock face. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Falls - Autumn<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 2: A thin stream of water falls over a large granite rock wall. White ice has built up on the rock face on both sides of the thin waterfall. At the bottom of the fall, a pile of snow has built up. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Falls - Winter<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 3: Two waterfalls are stacked on top of each other. The upper fall is full of water and the lower fall has a slightly more narrow, shorter, stream of water.<br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Falls - Spring<br /><br />Black and white comparison photo 4: The two waterfalls that are stacked on top of each other have dwindled down to a think, hair-like strand of a waterfall.<br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Falls - Summer<br /><br />Quote: \"You should stop a while...a little below the head of the fall beside the enthusiastic throng of starry, comet-like waters to learn something of their strength, their marvelous variety of forms, and above all their glorious music, gathered and composed from the snow-storms, hail-, and rain- and wind-storms that have fallen on their glacier-sculptered, domey, ridgy basin.\" - John Muir, The Yosemite, \"How Best to Spend One's Yosemite Time\"<br /><br />Lost Arrow - Seasonal changes affect more than just the waterfalls. Water seeping into cracks and fissures in the cliff face freezes and expands in winter, wedging off blocks of stone. This action constantly reshapes Yosemite Valley. Lost Arrow, the isolated granite pinnacle to the right of Yosemite Falls, was once a part of a solid wall of rock. <br /><br />Black and white photo: A granite spire is shown from above, rising up like a tower. <br />Caption: Lost Arrow from above<br /><br />A nearby sign reads, flood water level, 11pm, January 2, 1997. A double-sided arrow points from left to right. The sign itself stands over six feet high. <br />",

Many rocks are scattered about and have turned a rusty color and have a chalky, white, residue around them. A log enclosure that has an open top and an open door, protects the main hub of the springs. Inside the enclosure, air bubbles are constantly working their way to the surface of a small puddle, bubbling up around small rocks. The wayside exhibit is titled, Soda Springs, and has a black and white photo of four men at the springs, on the right, two-thirds of the panel. The man on the far left is on his hands and knees and has his face down to the ground. The next man to the right is facing away from the camera and has a bucket in his left hand and a ladle in his right. The next man to the right is kneeling down on his right knee, with his left knee propped up and his left arm resting on it. He is holding a cup in his right hand, ready to scoop up some water from the spring. The man on the far right stands with his left hand in his pant pocket and his right hand holding a cup, looking down, watching the spring bubble. Trees and peaks are in the distant background.<br /><br />Caption: Early visitors to Soda Springs, 1872. Jean Baptiste Lembert built the enclosure you see today to protect these springs from grazing animals, c. 1885. <br /><br />Panel text reads, can I drink the water? For thousands of years animals and people have visited these springs. Deer and birds obtain needed minerals. People enjoy the taste of the spring water.<br /><br />These small, carbonated mineral springs are a mystery - even geologists cannot explain why they are here. Although the bubbling water comes out of the ground pure and clean, there is a possibility that people or animals have contaminated the water.",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit is the second stop of 15 on the Soda Springs and Parsons Lodge Tour. Trees start to thin out as this area begins to open into a meadow. Large granite boulders are randomly sitting throughout the meadow. Granite peaks are peaking through the trees to the west. The wayside exhibit is titled, A Glacier-Carved Landscape, and has an illustration of the surrounding area covering the upper two-thirds of the panel. Two domes that overlap each other are in the foreground. The front dome shows the close-up detail of the granite's patchy surface...some areas are textured and gritty, shown by different variances of speckled grey, while other patchy areas are white to indicate its smoothness. The white, smooth areas are labeled, glacial polish and striations. The next dome, a little further in distance, is white and smooth. There are about 13 large round boulders that sit atop its surface, which are labeled erratics. Beyond the domes is a large, flat, open space - the meadow. Beyond the meadow, the terrain slopes upward into a range of high peaks. A sharp, pointed, craggy peak is labeled Cathedral Peak. <br /><br />Panel text reads, imagine a time when it was colder and snow did not melt in summer. The accumulated snow turned to ice. As the ice deepened, its weight caused it to flow as a glacier down the canyon to the west. Glaciers formed here many times in the past two million years. As recently as 20,000 years ago, glaciers covered all but the highest jagged peaks around you. <br /><br />Look for evidence of glaciers such as erratics (boulders moved by glaciers), glacial polish, and striations in the bedrock. Only sharp peaks, such as Unicorn and Cathedral, poked above the 2,000 feet of glacial ice.",

The wayside exhibit is titled, A Place for People. On the right, two-thirds side of the panel, there is a colored photo of an older woman with glasses, wearing a scarf around her head. She is wearing a red, button-down dress with white polka-dots, and a blue and white floral apron around her waist. She is on her knees on a large rock, leaning forward, with both hands grasping a pestle that is pressed down into a pile of acorns inside a shallow hole in the rock.<br /><br />Caption: Acorns were an important food source for both the Sierra Miwok and the Mono Lake Paiute people. The acorns were pounded into flour in bedrock mortars; some of these mortars can be found near Lembert Dome and elsewhere in Tuolumne Meadows. Photo right: Maggie Howard, Mono Lake Paiute, 1942.<br /><br />Panel text reads, for thousands of years, when the snow melted and the deer returned, Native Americans traveled here. During the 1800s, the Mono Trail crossed Tuolumne Meadows, linking Sierra Miwok people from the west and Mono Lake Paiute from the east. For a lengthy period, they traded pine nuts and obsidian from the Mono Basin for acorns and shell beads from west of the Sierra.",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit is the fifth stop of 15 on the Soda Springs and Parsons Lodge Tour. This particular part of the meadow has a bunch of trees enclosing the view. Different types of sedge and grasses grow, as well as some small saplings. Granite boulders are randomly scattered. The wayside exhibit is titled, A Short Growing Season, and has an illustration of a meadow on the bottom two-thirds of the panel. Short grasses grow in different sized, connected, ring-shapes, throughout the meadow. A line of trees and mountainous terrain are along the back edge of the meadow.<br /><br />Panel text reads, few types of plants can survive where the growing season is so short. Almost all of Tuolumne's plants are perennial; most annuals cannot grow here. They do not have enough time each summer to sprout, flower, and seed. The dominant grass-like plant is shorthair sedge. By late summer, the meadow turns amber as the sedge matures and becomes dormant. <br /><br />Illustration: A wispy, tuft of hair-like grasses grow upward, some with small oval-shaped growths at the ends. The roots are short, brown, and just as hairy looking. <br /><br />Caption: Meadow soils are shallow and fragile. Unauthorized trails compact the soil and the ruts can last for centuries. Please stay on designated trails. <br />",

The front of the cabin has a wooden door with a window, offcentered to the right, and a window with shutters on each side end of the building. There are now windows in the back. The nearby wayside exhibit is titled, The McCauley Cabin, and has a black and white photo on the left, two-thirds of the panel. The photo shows a man, a woman, and two young blonde girls standing in front of them. The young girl to the left is shorter than the girl on right, who is wearing checkered pants. A log cabin home is in the background, with boulders and trees surrounding it.<br /><br />Caption: The campground caretakers stayed in the McCauley Cabin. As a young girl, Margaret Eissler (in checkered pants) lived here with her family for six summers (1956-1961). Her childhood experience instilled a love for Tuolumne Meadows that influenced all aspects of her life. She later returned as a ranger-naturalist.<br /><br />Panel text reads, Following Jean Baptiste Lembert's death, the McCauley brothers bought his land for pasture in 1897 and built this cabin. When the land was again put up for sale, Sierra Club members raised money to purchase it in 1912 to keep it uncommercialized. <br /><br />The Sierra Club opened a small campground, and summer after summer campers returned here to renew their connection with these meadows and mountains. In 1973, the National Park Service bought the Sierra Club property. <br /><br />Tuolumne Meadows has found its way into many people's hearts. Follow the river. Take some time to explore. Discover for yourself the wonders of these high meadows.",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit is the sixth stop of 15 on the Soda Springs and Parsons Lodge Tour. The meadow has several trees that obstruct the open view. Small patches of grass grow mixed with small patches of bare, granitic sand. Granite rocks and boulders are randomly scattered. The wayside exhibit is titled, Meadow Dwellers, and has an illustration of a cross-section of a meadow on the top two-thirds of the panel. The illustration projects four layers of a meadow during the winter - an underground layer, a thin layer of air between the ground and the snow, a large layer of snow, and then what is above the snow. The left side of the illustration shows a large tree with its roots spreading out beneath the ground. Perched on one of the tree branches is a small, chipmunk-like animal, with a long, fuzzy, curled tail, labeled chickaree. To the bottom left of the tree is a small, mouse-like animal walking in the air pocket between the ground and snow layer; it is labeled a shrew. Below the ground, in the midst of the trees' roots is a grey squirrel, curled into a ball, sleeping in a pocket that has a tunnel leading to the grounds surface. It is labeled Belding Ground Squirrel. To the right of the tree are two large boulders that are half underground and half above ground. A tunnel leads underground into a pocket beneath a large boulder where an animal with a long, slender body rests on its haunches; it is labeled pocket gopher. A mouse nestles in an airpocket between the ground and snow, next to one of the large boulders. Above the snow layer, a coyote has his head tilted up with its mouth open, as if its howling, and a longtail weasel slithers down the snow. A mountain range is in the background.<br /><br />Caption: There is an air layer called the subnivean zone bewteen the snow and ground where small creatures live during the long winter. <br /><br />Panel text reads, when you look for wildlife here, think small. Birds and rodents are abundant. Deer and bears are here, though seldom seen. To escape the harsh winters, deer and most birds migrate, while marmots and ground squirrels hibernate. Mice, shrews, and gophers remain active under the snow, where they are hunted by small predators like weasels. <br />",

Facing south, a meadow containing tall grasses, several mature pines and a few small saplings spans outward. Granite peaks on the opposite side of the meadow are now more visible. The wayside exhibit is titled, Meadows, and has an illustration of a cross-section of the Tuolumne Meadows area covering the upper two-thirds of the panel. The bottom quarter of the illustration depicts a white wave that starts at a small hill on the left, slopes down into a slump, then slopes back up into another small hill. Beneath the ground, the white wave, which represents granite bedrock is broken up into multiple wavy parallel lines. On top of both the left and right hill is a tree with roots that vein down and outward through the layers of granite, beneath the ground surface. In the downward slump, or basin, between the two hills, an open green meadow is shown. A few granite peaks rise above a tree line in the background. <br /><br />Panel text reads, after the glaciers melted 10,000 years ago, shallow, broad depressions in the bedrock began to fill with sand. Because granite basins hold spring snowmelt, these areas are too wet for trees. Sedges and grasses thrive in these saturated low spots, creating meadows. Meadows are always changing. As they get drier, trees invade the edges and high areas. In wetter times, the trees die and the meadows expand.",

    "audioDescription": "The Sunrise Trailhead is found on the south side of a small, paved, loop driveway and parking area, along the south side of Tioga Road. The turn-off to the parking area is marked with a brown and white sign that shows a white icon of a person hiking inside a white square outline. The parking area is surrounded by trees, with Tioga Road to the north. A brown dumpster, six food lockers, and a small structure containing a vault toilet, line the outskirts of the parking lot. At the trailhead, the dirt path leads through tall trees. Three signs are posted next to the path. The first sign is a metal sign that reads, Sunrise H.S.C. 5.2 miles, Clouds Rest 7.4 miles, and Half Dome 12.5 miles. The second sign is brown and reads, Entering Yosemite Wilderness - Wilderness Permit is required for all overnight use. Please store food properly. Help protect the wild animals by keeping them wild. Wood fires are prohibited above 9,600 feet to protect fragile alpine areas. Please do not construct new fire rings. The use of gas stoves is encouraged in all areas. Select an existing campsite 100 feet or more (40 steps) from water, trails, and dry water courses. Help protect water quality by not washing anything in lakes and streams. Bury human waste at least six inches deep 100 feet from water. Must pack out all toilet paper. Shortcutting is dangerous and contributes to erosion. Please stay on established trails. Maximum group size is 15 people, or 8 maximum for off trail travel. Stock groups are limited to travel on trails only. All stock must be picketed 100 feet from water. Please scatter or bury all manure. Pack out all you pack in. Pick up extra trash when possible. Three illustrations show three icons in three separate boxes with a red slash line diagionally across the boxes. The first icon is of a dog, the second of a bicycle, and the third of a person shooting a rifle. The third sign is a small sign that reads, Hiking to Half Dome? Don't forget your permit. The sign has the silhouette of a man with a backpack climbing up a dome with the aid of cables.",

In the east corner of the parking lot are two large brown trash dumpsters, and one large green dumpster for recycling. The wayside exhibit panel is blue and is bolted to a frame made of thick wooden posts, and is titled, welcome to Tenaya Lake. Half of the panel background is a two-toned picture of a lake that is surrounded by domes and peaks. The other half of the panel is a map. The caption reads, caught between immense granite domes and the clear High Sierra sky, Tenaya Lake is the largest lake in Yosemite National Park. Here, at its eastern end, Tenaya Creek forms a series of braided streams before flowing into the lake. Text reads, if you have a few hours, stroll the flat, paved trail (less than a quarter-mile, round-trip). You'll be rewarded with glimpses of the glacially carved peaks and domes and a spectacular view of the lake emerging through the trees. If time permits, take a picnic to one of the tables on the beach and enjoy a lazy High Sierra afternoon exploring or relaxing in the smooth granitic sand. While hardy souls may be tempted to jump in, remember...Tenaya Lake is fed by snowmelt and stays quite cold!If you have half a day, don't miss the boardwalk, a picnic, or the beach, but (if conditions permit) cross the Tenaya Creek inlet at the southeast end of the beach and follow the trail west along the shore of the lake. This mostly-level stroll takes you toward the Sunrise Lakes Trailhead, joining back with the Tioga Road. Here, you can retrace your steps back or hop on the free shuttle at Stop #10, and ride one stop back to your car (stop #9). It is possible to walk all the way around the lake (2.8 mi/5.2 km), but requires walking along the shoulder of busy Tioga Road. A full-day hike to Tuolumne Meadows - Pick up a trail heading east from Tenaya Lake. This 9-mile one-way hike parallels the Tioga Road, leading to Tuolumne Meadows. At Tuolumne Meadows, pick up the free shuttle for the short ride back to Tenaya Lake. Shuttle Information - The free Tioga Road shuttle runs between Tuolumne Meadows and Olmsted Point. Shuttle schedule changes seasonally and as conditions permit. Check local postings for current schedule. During times of high water, unbridged river or creek crossings can be hazardous. Take extra time and use good judgement when crossing rivers and creeks. Check the weather! Be especially aware of the potential for thunderstorms. If you are hiking, take a map and compass. Tell someone where you are going and when you'll be back. Avoid exhaustion and dehydration. Carry plenty of water and high-energy snacks. The altitude at Tenaya Lake is just over 8,000 feet above sea level. Signs of altitude sickness can include nausea, dizziness, and headache. Descending to a lower elevation can help alleviate symptoms. Scrambling or climbing on rocks can be dangerous. Remember, coming down can be much harder than going up, and wet rocks are slippery. Be prepared to pack out what you pack in; garbage and recycling receptacles are located near the parking area. Map: The map shows Tenaya Lake, indicated by a large, blue, oval shape, slightly tilted, in the center of the map. A white line extends diagonally across the map, from the bottom left to the top right, passing by the north shore of Tenaya Lake. A trail, indicated by red dotted lines, passes by the south shore of the Tenaya Lake and partly follows a few creeks, indicated by a blue solid line, before splitting off into different trails to the left and right. To the left of the lake, icons indicate the start of hiking trails, restrooms, and parking. To the right of the lake, a red dot indicates you are here, and icons indicating trailheads, parking, restrooms, and picnic areas are shown. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. A flat dirt path leads into the forest with several wayside exhibits along the way to the Tenaya Lake shoreline. The first wayside exhibit is titled, disappearing wetlands. Text reads, wetlands like this one have likely been here for the last 10,000 years, providing homes and food for a great variety of plant and animal species. In Yosemite, wetland areas make up only about 3% of the landscape, but are estimated to harbor up to one-third of all the plant species in the Park. They also capture, store, and release melting snow, extending the availability of life-giving water during the dry summer months. Here in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and across the globe, wetlands are disappearing rapidly. Effects from trampling, development, and climate change threaten to alter the delicate wetland ecology forever. In Yosemite National Park, park managers work to prevent loss of wetlands by preserving and restoring wetland areas and building boardwalks to help minimize damage from visitors. Photo:",

    "bodyText": "<table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p>Designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, the Ahwahnee opened in 1927. As an experiment in construction methods, it was built with relatively fireproof materials. Instead of wood, concrete and granite was textured and stained to resemble redwood. The stately building combines rustic and art deco influences. The massing of a central tower and two wings, forming a “Y” shape, is unusual compared to other rustic-era park lodges. The vertical granite buttresses, piers, and chimneys reflect the granite cliffs of Yosemite Valley.</p> <p>In the original design, visitors would enter through the modern-day bar area. Shortly before the opening date, staff noticed that this entrance caused vehicle fumes to fill the hotel. Instead, contractors quickly constructed the covered walkway and porte-cochere entrance in use today.</p> <p>Drs. Phyllis Ackerman and Arthur Pope, renowned art historians, decorated the interior primarily with a bold array of American Indian art of the day. Ansel Adams aptly described the decor as a “miracle of color and design.”</p> <p>The Ahwahnee dining room represents a particularly grand example of rustic influences, with its massive ceilings and opulent but organic details. To preserve the building’s rich heritage, many recent projects have restored existing features and improved building safety to modern standards.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>",

The area is surrounded by different pine and fir trees and has an open view looking westward.\\n\\nThe first wayside exhibit is titled, Cones and Needles. Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, Because of its wide range of elevations, Yosemite encompasses several life zones determined by elevation, moisture, temperature, and exposure to storms. Sometimes, conditions vary significantly within a zone and allow for a micro-climate, a place where the climate contrasts with that of the entire zone. You are in one such micro-climate. Around you, trees that typically grow at higher or lower elevations live in close proximity. Stroll around this area and discover stories of four common Yosemite trees, their relationships with wildlife, and struggles to survive. \\n\\nIllustration: a 3-Dimensional, illustrated, cross-section map of the area's terrain has a road winding through the mountains labeled Tioga Road. Below the Tioga Road, a deep valley is labeled Yosemite Valley. Along Tioga Road, to the right of the first two labels is a red dot that is marked, 'you are here.' From the front to back of this map, colors transition from orange, to yellow, to green, to blue, to white. On the side of the map, a color-code shows that orange represents the foothills (1,800 to 3,000 feet), yellow represents the lower montane (3,000 to 6,000 feet), green represents the upper montane (6,000 to 8,000 feet), blue represents the sub-alpine (8,000 to 9,500 feet), and white represents the alpine (9,500 - 13,000 feet). \\n\\nCaption: As you travel through the different elevations along the Tioga Road, you can observe habitats similar to those found on an excursion from Mexico to the arctic. \\n\\nText on the right side of the exhibit panel reads, cache crop - ever forget where you left your keys? Chipmunks, ground squirrels, and many birds have the same problem. They bury small caches of seeds here and there, and then forget where they put many of these food caches. Consequently, forgetful birds and animals planted many of the trees nearby. \\n\\nA series of four photos show different types of trees. \\n\\nPhoto one is a Red Fir forest, shown with their long branches drooping from the weight of snow that covers them. The trees are tall with pointed tips and reddish bark. \\n\\nPhoto two is a single Lodgepole Pine, which has a conical shape that tapers, and grey bark. \\n\\nPhoto three is a single Jeffrey Pine, which has several large branches shooting off a rather bare trunk. Smaller secondary pine branches shoot off the large primary branches. There is no conical shape to this tree, it is randomly fanned out in all directions. \\n\\nPhoto four is a single Western White Pine, which is a tall, very narrow, slender conical shape, with branches that are arranged in neatly layered horizontal tiers.\\n\\nThe second wayside exhibit is titled, Red Fir, abies magnifica, and has a close-up photo of Red Fir bark on the entire left, one-fifth side of the panel. The bark is reddis-brown and has deep striations. Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, the red fir is a spectacular tree, impressive for its height and girth. It can sometimes rise above 200 feet tall, and be nearly 10 feet in diameter. The bark of mature trees is deeply furrowed with a distinctive reddish hue. \\n\\nIllustration: A brown pine branch shows green needles that are rounded off at the ends, growing directly out of the branch. A rounded pine cone, which has layers upon layers that closely overlap each other, appears to be closed and smooth. Cone size is 9 inches (23 cm).\\n\\nCaption: Tree ID hint - How can you tell a fir from a pine? Think \"F\" for friendly fir. The needles of a fir are soft, and they grow from the branch instead of in bunches. \\n\\nWhen Lightning Strikes - Lightning often hits the tallest of these red firs, leaving snag-topped crowns. These damaged areas provide fertile foraging areas for woodpeckers and sapsuckers looking for grubs. The snags also provide homes for nesting owls and squirrels. \\n\\nIllustration: A speckled owl with horn-like pointy ears sits on a snaggled tree trunk that seems to have snapped apart.\\n\\nThe third wayside exhibit is titled, Western White Pine, pinus monticola, and has a close-up photo of Western White Pine bark on the entire left, one-fifth side of the panel. The bark is brown and looks like square plates or bricks that are stacked vertically. Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, look beyond the red fir log in front of you. The tree with square-like plates on its bark is the Western White Pine. Their trunks are usually straight, and typically their branches are arranged in neatly layered horizontal tiers. They cannot tolerate deep shade and generally grow in open spaces where they can soak up the rays of the sun. The Western White Pine is a hardy tree, thriving under conditions produced by ground fires that create the ide",

    "audioDescription": "A small, paved, roadside turnout on the south side of Tioga Road has an open view of the area's iconic peaks through meadows with flowing streams. There are also two wayside exhibits and three portable restrooms, one of which is designated accessible. \\n\\nOn the west side of the driveway, an open meadow that has large boulders scattered about, transitions into a dense pine forest. A wayside exhibit titled, Disappearing Meadow, sits at the edge of the meadow and paved driveway. Text on the left side of the panel reads, as recently as the 1960s, this area was an open wet meadow that dominated the foreground in this view of the Cathedral Range Mountains. However, the meadows are beginning to dry up, providing better conditions for trees to grow. Current science is documenting the increase in Earth's temperature which is advantageous for trees due to longer, warmer growing seasons. While scientists are still investigating other possible reasons for the changes you see, climate change is likely a primary factor. \\n\\nPhoto: An open meadow has small saplings growing throughout it. In the distance, mountain peaks rise above a line of mature, tall trees. \\n\\nCaption: 1963 view of Cathedral Range from this meadow. \\n\\nPhoto: A small grassy area has a dense stand of pine trees.\\n\\nCaption: In 2009, young trees dominate the same view. \\n\\nBlack and white photo: a man, dressed in a long sleeved shirt, long pants, and cap, stands among hundreds of sheep bunched together in a meadow, with tall trees surrounding the open pasture.\\n\\nCaption: In the late 1800s, cattle ranchers and sheep herders drove their herds into these lush grassy meadows to graze. Human occupation and use increased to accommodate the silver mines established in the Tioga area during the 1870s. These human impacts to vegetation and hydrology may accentuate the effects of climate change. \\n\\nOn the east side of the driveway, a stream snakes through an open meadow that also transitions into a dense forest. A reddish peak rises on the left while a grey, granite peak rises to the right. A wooden sign by the stream reads, domestic water supply - do not contaminate. A wayside exhibit is also stationed here titled, The Core of Volcanoes. Text on the left side of the panel reads, rising before you are two of the highest peaks in Yosemite, Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs. Their reddish-brown color hints at a different origin than the white granites of the other mountains in the park. The metamorphic rocks forming the summit areas of Mounts Dana and Gibbs are the exposed core of an ancient volcanic mountain range that once graced the Pacific coast. Once miles beneath tall volcanoes, they were slowly revealed as erosion stripped away the overlying rocks. \\n\\nPhoto: Two peaks rise above a treeline. The silhouette of the two mountain peaks that are labeled Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, is outlined with a red dotted line.\\n\\nIllustration: The cross-section illustration of the inner and outer workings of a volcano are shown, below and above ground. In the ground, a layer of reddish-orange, oval-like chambers of magma lay horizontally, overlapping and connecting to each other. Thick vein-like paths of magma extend upward through a layer of earth, connecting with the layer of oval chambers above. A small portion of the upper part of the reddish-orange oval chambers is white and is labeled Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, and is noted as crystallizing granite. Above the chambers is a brown area, labeled as metamorphic rock, that slopes up into a peak. A red, thin, vein-like line leads from the magma chambers to the peak and exits as a plume of smoke. Other peaks are in the background.\\n\\nCaption: Magma, or lava, that erupted at the surface created the reddish-brown metamorphic rock of the volcanoes core. Magma that cooled deep beneath the surface crystalized and formed the white granite of the other peaks and domes you see here. \\n",

A pond reflects the reddish-brown mountains that are Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, which rise up over the treeline to the left. To the right, grey granite peaks rise over the treeline in the distance. Large granite boulders are scattered here and there across the flat, open meadow. In the parking lot, a brown sign with a white outline and text reads, no camping or overnight parking. \\n\\nThe meadow area is roped off from the parking area and two small signs are bolted to knee-height wooden posts. The first sign reads, give plants a chance! Please stay off. An illustration of a foot hovering over small plants is inside a red circle with a diagonal line slashing through its center. The second sign reads, area closed - restoration in progress, Yosemite National Park, and has a silhouette of Half Dome.\\n\\nThree wayside exhibits line the curb of the parking lot. The first wayside exhibit, located to the far right of the parking area, is titled, Alpine Zone, and has a faint background photo of a large, smooth, granite peak. Text on the left side of the panel reads, you are now near the alpine zone, which includes the highest elevations in Yosemite. Look a few hundred feet higher, and you can see that trees cannot grow because the rugged terrain is windy, dry, and intensely sunlit. To survive such harsh conditions, plants here lie flat against the ground or crouch between stones. Special pigments in their leaves filter out harmful rays of sunlight. Some plants grow in little pincushion-like bunches. If they stand too tall the wind will dry them out or tear them apart. Their vibrant blossoms burst forth in an extra effort to attract insects. \\n\\nIllustration: a 3-Dimensional, illustrated, cross-section map of the area's terrain has a road winding through the mountains labeled Tioga Road. Below the Tioga Road, a deep valley is labeled Yosemite Valley. Along Tioga Road, to the far right of the road is a red dot that is marked, 'you are here.' From the front to back of this map, colors transition from orange, to yellow, to green, to blue, to white. On the side of the map, a color-code shows that orange represents the foothills (1,800 to 3,000 feet), yellow represents the lower montane (3,000 to 6,000 feet), green represents the upper montane (6,000 to 8,000 feet), blue represents the sub-alpine (8,000 to 9,500 feet), and white represents the alpine (9,500 - 13,000 feet). \\n\\nCaption: As you travel through the different elevations along the Tioga Road, you can observe habitats similar to those found on an excursion from Mexico to the arctic. \\n\\nTwo photos show two different kinds of wild flowers. The first wildflower is called Davidson's penstemon and is light purple. They are growing in a bunch, out of a crack in a granite rock and are short in stature. Their small flowers are a bit long and flute-like, curving outward at the ends. The second photo shows a wildflower called Sky Pilot, which is purple, and has a spherical bulb of multiple flowers that shoot out of an erect stem. They are growing in a bunch in a rocky area. \\n\\nText on the right side of the panel reads, pikas need to get out of the sun periodically to cool down or they risk lethal overheating. These small mammals live in rock piles at high elevations. They gather plants for winter food in nearby areas, frequently returning to the shade of the rocks. As Earth's temperature warms, they will have to spend more time in the rock piles cooling down. If they have to spend too much time cooling down, they won't be able to harvest enough food to survive the winter. \\n\\nPhoto: In the bottom right corner, a small, greyish-brown, furry pika faces left and is leaning forward on a rock. It has black beady eyes, large round ears, and long whiskers. \\n\\nThe second wayside exhibit, located near the middle of the parking area, is titled, High Sierra Stories, and has a faint background photo of a mountain peak that has patches of snow on it. The text reads, these mountains have stories to tell. American Indians have made the journey across the Sierra for thousands of years. Tioga Road existed for decades as a winding, treacherous, single-lane dirt road. Then, in 1961, the National Park Service completed this modern highway which significantly improved visitor access to Tuolumne Meadows and Yosemite Valley. Along this road you will pass countless plants, animals, and evidence of the geologic processes that have shaped the land. \\n\\nIllustration: Four adults and three children walk on a path near gnarled trees, walking toward mountainous terrain. Three of the adults carry large, filled, burden baskets on their back. A child uses a walking stick.\\n\\nCaption: American Indians traveled by foot along this trade route between the east and the west side of the Sierra Nevada. \\n\\nPhoto: A man and two women sit on an open-topped, horse-drawn wagon, on a dirt road that leads",

    "audioDescription": "This arched driveway on the south side of Tioga Road has limited, undefined, parking. A green recycle dumpster and brown trash dumpster are located at the east end of the parking area. Trees surround the lot.\\n\\nTwo wayside exhibits stand side by side on the north side of the parking area. The right wayside exhibit is titled Mutual Survival, and has a background photo of a map of central California. Three recognizable areas are labeled, Lake Tahoe, at the top, middle of the panel, San Francisco Bay Area at the left, middle of the panel, and Mono Lake, toward the right middle of the panel. Two large, faint arrows are positioned in a circular way, signifying a counter-clockwise rotation, on the right side of the panel. In the midst of the circular arrows is a map of Yosemite National Park. Panel text reads, Mutual Survival - the Tioga Road follows roughly the same route as the old Mono Trail. This old trail formed the basis of a network for American Indian trade routes leading from the sea to the desert. People on either side of the mountains used this route to negotiate and trade for food items and other materials important to their daily lives. \\nPhoto Near the San Francisco Bay Area: A string of beads lay on a pink stone, in the sand, next to a seashell.\\n\\nCaption: Trades from the west bartered with shells and jewelry. \\n\\nPhoto in the middle of the Central California map: Many acorns are piled up in a basket, and a heap of long sedges is bundled together, laying on its side.\\n\\nCaption: People in the mountain valleys traded acorns and basket-making materials.\\n\\nPhoto to the upper right of Yosemite National Park: A zoomed-in photo of white granules of salt, and little shrimp swimming bunched together in water. \\n\\nCaption: Salt and alkali fly pupa were trade items from the Mono Lake area. \\n\\nIllustration to the right of Yosemite National Park and Mono Lake: A black rock with shiny, white edges is shown. \\n\\nCaption: Obsidian to make spear and arrow points, knives, and scrapers came from the east. \\n\\nThe left wayside exhibit is titled, High Sierra Stories, and has a faint background photo of a mountain peak that has patches of snow on it. The text reads, these mountains have stories to tell. American Indians have made the journey across the Sierra for thousands of years. Tioga Road existed for decades as a winding, treacherous, single-lane dirt road. Then, in 1961, the National Park Service completed this modern highway which significantly improved visitor access to Tuolumne Meadows and Yosemite Valley. Along this road you will pass countless plants, animals, and evidence of the geologic processes that have shaped the land. \\n\\nIllustration: Four adults and three children walk on a path near gnarled trees, walking toward mountainous terrain. Three of the adults carry large, filled, burden baskets on their back. A child uses a walking stick. \\n\\nCaption: American Indians traveled by foot along this trade route between the east and the west side of the Sierra Nevada. \\n\\nPhoto: A man and two women sit on an open-topped, horse-drawn wagon, on a dirt road that leads through a forest. \\n\\nCaption: By the 1890s, horse-drawn wagons followed Indian migration routes. \\n\\nPhoto: two women stand on a dirt road, next to a soft-top automobile that has two spare tires attached to the rear. \\n\\nCaption: Travelers needed spare tires and plenty of gas in the 1920s. \\n\\nPhoto: Two vintage cars drive side-by-side, taking up the width of the narrow dirt road, while an oncoming car approaches. A large boulder and plenty of trees are right along the roadside. \\n\\nCaption: Motorists in the 1940s traveled slowly, navigating a narrow and treacherous dirt road. \\n\\nPhoto: A bicyclist wearing a helmet rides on a paved road with snowcapped mountains in the background. \\n\\nCaption: In 2009, cyclists enjoy a high country biking experience. \\n\\nPhoto: An older man with a white beard and mustache, a white long-sleeved shirt and black vest, long pants, and a hat, sits horseback, facing to the left. Caption: \"...I have crossed the Range of Light, surely the brightest and best of all the Lord has build; and rejoicing in its glory. I gladly, gratefully, hopefully pray I may see it again.\" - John Muir\\n\\nThe third wayside exhibit is facing the small meadow on the south side of the parking area and is titled, Shrinking Reservoir. The exhibit panel's background photo shows a snow-covered mountain range in the background, and a few building and utility poles on flat terrain in the foreground. Panel text reads, Shrinking Reservoir - The Sierra Nevada is California's reservoir - nature's storage tank of water in the form of winter snow and ice. As the snow gradually melts, it releases the stored water into streams and rivers. The depth of the annual snow pack indicates how much water we will have each year for necessities like drinking water and crop irrigation. In a changing climate, more moisture may come as rain instead of snow. How will it",

Iconic natural features like El Capitan, Half Dome, Sentinel Rock, and the Cathedral Rocks are shown.<br /><br />At the top of the panel, the header reads: A View Through Time<br />Text to the right of the header reads:<br />From this breathtaking viewpoint into Yosemite Valley, you can see three of its remarkable features: El Capitan, Half Dome, and Bridalveil Fall. In March 1851, a local militia (known as the Mariposa Battalion) was dispatched to the area in search of Miwok people suspected of attacking a trading post. The group stumbled upon this view and became the first Euro-Americans to enter Yosemite Valley. <br /><br />A sub-header, placed in a light brown bar to the left of the panel reads: A Burning Tradition<br />Text reads: Miwok people, who called themselves Ahwahneechee, lived in Yosemite Valley for thousands of years. Their traditional practice of regularly burning the meadows and oak woodlands of the Valley contributed to the open landscape first seen by the Mariposa Battalion.<br /><br />Quote, The whole valley had the appearance of park-like grounds, with trees, shrubbery, flowers and lawns, end-quote. - Lafayette Bunnell, 1880<br /><br />Two black and white photos are located side by side, at the bottom of the panel. <br /><br />Left photo: A black and white portrait photo shows an older caucasian man with a beard and long mustache.

He later wrote a book about his first impressions of Yosemite Valley. <br /><br />Right illustration: A pencil drawing of Yosemite Valley shows El Capitan on the left and Bridalveil Fall on the right. In the foreground is a line of tree silhouettes that stretch from the left to the right of the picture.<br /><br />Right Photo Caption: In this 1855 drawing, Valley from Artist's Point, Thomas Ayres captured the open, park-like nature of Yosemite Valley as it looked in the mid-19th century. <br /><br />A bronze tactile relief model of Yosemite Valley is located nearby.",

A green recycle dumpster, brown trash dumpster, and a brown facility, which holds four vault toilets, all line the parking lot. Picnic tables, large tree stump seating, and a wayside exhibit panel, framed in log posts, are at the grove trailhead on the north side of the lot, where the paved road trail then leads into the forest. <br /><br />The green-toned exhibit panel is titled, Welcome to the Tuolumne Grove, and has an illustrated map, which takes up the left side of the panel. The map shows a red dot toward the middle of the map, which is labeled, you are here. A yellow squiggle line, representing the trail, makes its way through a faint canopy of trees upward from the red dot to the sequoia grove. A trail also travels downward from the red dot, leading nowhere specific, and eventually fades out. An aerial view of about 8 bold tree tops are shown at the end of the trail, as well as a tree trunk that has a tunnel through it. <br /><br />Black and white photo: A sequoia tree trunk, with the upper half of the tree gone, has a tunnel carved out of it. <br /><br />Caption: The temptation when visiting the Tuolumne Grove is to turn your eyes to the sky line, accessing the superlative qualities of these massive giants. Take a moment along your trip to reflect on the things that can go by unnoticed - the deep silence that accompanies each snow-muffled winter, the moment each spring when the tiny winter wren begins building her nest, the emergence of the white Pacific dogwood petals. <br /><br />Think also of moments in this grove's recent human history, the jangle of bridles from the first pioneers, pilgrims and discoverers who passed this way, or the rumble of the first automobile engine after the new road was cut. The passage of time through the Tuolumne Grove is marked in small ways, with your experience here being just the most recent. <br /><br />Map: A generalized map of the entire park, labeled Yosemite National Park, shows the three areas to find sequoia groves in the park. They are indicated by a sequoia tree icon. The Tuolumne Grove and Merced Grove are side by side and located on the left side of the map, about half-way down from the top. The Mariposa Grove is located at the bottom tip of the map. <br /><br />Text on the right side of the panel reads, one of the three giant sequoia grove in Yosemite National Park, the Tuolumne Grove contains about 25 mature trees. While enjoying your walk through the grove, consider the rarity of this experience. These few maturing giant sequoias appear large and strong but are facing an unknown future. Climate change-and the resulting changes in hydrology and fire regime-may have an effect on the future of giant sequoias. Avoid walking in areas immediately surrounding the trees. Leave cones and other natural items in the grove.",

    "bodyText": "<h2>Overview</h2> <p>One of Yosemite's oldest historic trails (built 1873 to 1877), the Yosemite Falls Trail leads to the top of North America’s tallest waterfall, which rises 2,425 feet (739 m) above the Valley floor. This trail starts near Camp 4, along the Valley Loop Trail, and immediately begins its climb, switchback after switchback, through oak woodland. You will begin to climb above some trees and into exposed plateaus that offer you a glimpse of what's to come: great views of Yosemite Valley and its many iconic landforms. Do not stray off of the maintained path, as you will find steep drops adjacent to the trail.</p> <p>If you make the one-mile, 1,000 foot climb (via dozens of switchbacks) to Columbia Rock, you will be rewarded with spectacular views of Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, and Sentinel Rock. From there, it is worth the time and energy to hike another 0.5 miles (0.8 km) (some of which is actually downhill!) to get a stunning view of Upper Yosemite Fall. Depending on the season, you may even feel the mist from the fall, which may be welcome respite after the tough climb.</p> <p>The upper half of the trail is steep and rocky, but the arduous climb is well worth the amazing views you will be rewarded with at the top. Here you may be surprised by the small size of Yosemite Creek, which feeds this massive waterfall. Use extreme caution when near the creek and remember you are directly above a waterfall.</p> <h3>Columbia Rock</h3> <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 2 miles (3.2 km) round trip<br /> <strong>Elevation:</strong> 1,000 ft (328 m) elevation gain<br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate<br /> <strong>Time:</strong> 2-3 hours round trip<br /> <strong>Begin at:</strong> Camp 4 area (near shuttle stop #7)</p> <h3>Top of Yosemite Falls</h3> <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 7.2 miles (11.6 km) round trip<br /> <strong>Elevation:</strong> 2,700 ft (823 m) elevation gain<br /> <strong>Difficulty:</strong> Strenuous<br /> <strong>Time:</strong> 6-8 hours round trip<br /> <strong>Begin at:</strong> Camp 4 area (near shuttle stop #7)</p> <h2>Hours</h2> <p>Year-round.</p> <p>The Yosemite Falls Trail is open year-round; conditions vary depending on the season. In spring, when the waterfall is at its peak, this hike is stunning, and you may even get wet from the spray of the waterfall during a section of the hike. In summer, conditions are hot and dry, and the loose decomposed granite along the trail can be slippery. Keep in mind that by August, the water levels are low and you may only see a trickle here. During winter, the lower portion of this trail gets direct sunlight, so hiking can be snow-free while other trails are icy. Visiting Columbia Rock, located one mile up the trail, is a worthwhile trip at any time of year. The upper portion of this trail, which receives little to no sunlight in winter, can be very icy and slippery, or buried beneath feet of snow, making traction difficult. In winter, hiking in the colder early morning or late afternoon hours can be even more dangerous if the trail is icy.</p> <h2>Getting Here</h2> <p>Begin at the Yosemite Falls Trailhead, beyond the Camp 4 parking lot (Yosemite Valleywide shuttle stop #7)</p> <h2>Rules & Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>Pets and bicycles are only permitted on paved bike paths.</li> <li>Pack out what you pack in.</li> <li>Overnight backpackers need a wilderness permit, which can be obtained at the Yosemite Valley Wilderness Center.</li> <li>Bear canisters are required for wilderness food storage for overnight hikers.</li> </ul> <h2>Hazards & Warnings</h2> <ul> <li>Wading and/or swimming upstream from waterfalls is extremely dangerous. Each year, unsuspecting visitors drown or are swept over to their deaths.</li> <li>Stay on trails: taking shortcuts causes trail erosion-and is both dangerous and illegal.</li> <li>Carry (and drink) plenty of water: Be sure to treat river, stream, lake, or spring water.</li> <li>Be prepared for sudden changes in weather and conditions.</li> <li>Feeding and approaching wildlife is dangerous and illegal! Be sure to properly store your food.</li> <li>Rocks in and around waterways are often slippery. Use caution when crossing streams.</li> <li>During winter, the upper portion of this trail, which receives little to no sunlight, can be very icy and slippery, or buried beneath feet of snow, making traction difficult.</li> </ul> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>This trailhead and associated trail is not accessible.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Nearby, a brown sign reads, Four Mile Trail, and has an icon of a hiker inside a square outline and an arrow pointing to the right, next to the roadside parking area, that has limited parking. A noticeable dirt trail starts to retreat into the woods from here. Two green recycle bins, two brown trash bins, and a way side exhibit are in this area. Before entering the forest and starting the ascent, a wooden sign is posted and reads, Glacier Point Four Mile Trail; Union Point - 3.0 miles, Glacier Point - 4.6 miles, Sentinel Dome - 5.2 miles. Dangerous to stray from trail. Horses not permitted off valley floor without guide. <br /> <br />The wayside exhibit near the road is titled, Paths Into Wilderness, and has a faint, sepia-toned photograph of fourteen or more men, sitting on both sides of a log that has been halved and is set for a meal. . The caption reads, trail crew stops for dinner. Panel text reads, James McCauley, an Irish immigrant and proprietor of the Glacier Point Hotel, hired John Conway to survey and construct a trail from Yosemite Valley to Glacier Point. Taking only seven months to build, it was completed in the early summer of 1872. The original trail was four miles long and travelers paid a $1 toll. In the 1920s, the National Park Service lengthened the trail to improve the steeper sections. Today it is 4.6 miles from the Valley to Glacier Point. <br /><br />Black and white photo: One of Yosemite Valley's high, 2,000-foot plus rock walls has a noticeable trail zigzagging its way to the top. <br /><br />Caption: \"...it is the steepest trail out of the valley, zigzagging back and forth a sheer granite wall, one rides up it with little alarm or giddiness.\" - Helen Hunt Jackson, from Ah-Wah-Ne Days: A visit to Yosemite Valley in 1872. Under a heading that reads, Conway - A \"Walkist\", panel text quotes an 1869 article in the Mariposa Gazette, \"John Conway of Sherlock Creek, last Saturday walked from the Sentinel Hotel, Yosemite Valley, to Mariposa in fourteen hours, including all stoppages. He left the hotel about seven o'clock in the morning and made the trip to town by nine o'clock the same evening. The walk did not seem to fatiguw him much, for he soon left town for his home on Sherlock Creek, six miles farther. Mr. Conway says it is no trip at all for him on foot.\" Black and white photo: Two older men stand side by side. The man to the right is wearing a hat, has a mustache and long white bear, and is wearing a black suit with a white collared button-down shirt. He is standing with his hands on his hips, looking off into the distance to the right. The other man is dressed similarly and has a mustache and long grey beard. He is standing with his hands down by his side, gazing to the right. Caption: John Conway, on right, shown here with Galen Clark, used only a simple ship's protractor to survey the Four Mile Trail's route.",

The sign reads, Valley Shuttle, Yosemite Conservation Heritage Center/Housekeeping Camp, and has the number 12 in white font, in a green circle. The area is dense with trees, however, the tall, granite, Valley cliffsides are still visible through and above the tree line. A covered shelter made with wooden beams and a shingled roof, both house two wooden benches. <br /><br />Nearby, a stone building with a steep-pitched roof and a color, texture, and verticality that blends with the Yosemite Valley walls stands. The center section of the building rises up to a steep point, and two smaller wings are built slightly inward on each side. A stonewall extends off the ends of each wing, slanted inward as well, creating a hexagonal structural layout. Steps lead to the center of the hexagonal layout, a small porch area, then up to the front, wooden, pointed arched, door. Four windows line the front side of the building. At the end of the right stone porch wall, a bronze plaque is adhered to the granite, and it reads, LeConte Memorial Lodge has been designated a National Historic Landmark.

    "audioDescription": "A green and white sign stands next to the roadside turnout where the shuttle bus stops. The sign is white with a green bar across the top. Within the green bar, text reads, Valley shuttle and has an icon of a bus. Below the green bar, text reads Mirror Lake Trailhead, and the number 17 is in white font within a green circle. Next to the sign is a wooden shelter that holds two benches. A yellow chain barrier is set up to help queue the line. A brown trash bin, a green recycle bin, and a sign that has three small panels across the top and a large map on the bottom, are near the shuttle stop shelter. A paved path/road retreats into the trees behind the shelter. <br /><br />The first panel of the sign is yellow with a green bar across the top. Text in the green bar reads, shuttle bus schedule. The text in the yellow section reads, shuttle stop 17, Mirror Lake. From 7am to 10am, service every 30 minutes. From 10am to 7pm, service every 20 minutes. From 7pm to 10pm, service every 30 minutes. <br /><br />The second panel is white with a blue bar across the top. Text in the blue bar reads, Did You Know? Text in the white section reads, Mirror Lake is not really a lake at all. Until the middle of the 20th century, park personnel dredged sand to maintain a pond that reflected the cliffs above. Current park policy is to let the natural succession of pond to meadow occur. During high water, however, you can still see a stunning reflection of Half Dome. <br /><br />Photo: One person stands in ankle-deep snow, with a backpack on the ground by his side, and his back turned from the camera. He is facing a small body of water and the large face of Half Dome which towers over this lake. Snow covers the landscape. <br /><br />Caption: At Half Dome's base, Mirror Lake forms in winter and spring, but is more of a sandy beach during the dry season. NPS photo by Erik Skindrud.<br /><br />The third panel is white with an orange bar across the top. Text in the orange bar reads, Be Bear Aware. Text in the white box reads, Keeping bears away from your food isn't just a way to avoid a fine-it could save a bear's life. Do not store food in vehicles after dark. When not stored in a locker or cabin, food must be within arm's length. Stay at least 50 yards from a bear. If a bear approaches, yell to scare it away. <br /><br />Photo: A reddish-brown black bear with yellow plastic tags on both ears, is hanging halfway out of a parked car's side door window. The door frame is bent half way down, the side view mirror is dangling, and the glass has been busted out. It is dark out. <br /><br />Caption: Bear break-ins can cost thousands of dollars and put visitors and bears at risk. NPS photo by Tammy Evans.<br /><br />A large map showing three different shuttle routes in Yosemite Valley is below.

    "audioDescription": "A green and white sign reads: Valley Shuttle, Lower Yosemite Fall. There is a bus stop shelter made with six large cobblestone posts, wooden beams, and it has a wooden roof. There is a bronze relief plaque of Yosemite Falls on the outer northeast corner post. Split logs serve as benches nearby. In front of the bus stop sign is a crosswalk that leads across the street into Cook's meadow. Also, the accessible trail to Lower Yosemite Fall begins north of the shuttle stop. Limited roadside parking is located east of shuttle stop six. Near the bus stop shelter is a large map of trails. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. The map header reads Welcome to Yosemite Falls. On the side of the large map is a smaller header that reads: About Yosemite Falls A sub-header in a brown bar reads: Heights of the Falls<br />The text reads: Upper Fall, 1,430 feet, 435 meters, Middle Cascades, 675 feet, 205 meters, 320 feet, 98 meters, 2,425 feet, 740 meters. <br /><br />Photo, located to the left of the above text, shows an aerial sepia-toned photo of Yosemite Falls, and labels each part of the Falls, Upper Fall, Middle Cascades, and Lower Fall. <br /><br />A sub-header in a brown bar reads: World Ranking<br />The text reads: Yosemite Falls is the tallest waterfall in the United States, and the 5th tallest waterfall in the world. The tallest is Salto Angel in Venezuela at 3,212 feet, 979 meters.<br /><br />A sub-header in a brown bar reads: Source of the Falls<br />The text reads: Yosemite Creek, which flows over this waterfall, is entirely fed by melting snow. It drains an area of nearly 50 square miles. At its peak volume in late spring, 2,400 gallons per second, or 9,000 liters, flow over the lip of the Upper Fall. Every summer, when the snow from this drainage is entirely melted, Yosemite Falls usually run dry. <br /><br />A sub-header in a brown bar reads: Ice Cone<br />The text reads: In winter, a dramatic cone of ice accumulates at the base of the Upper Fall. The maximum height of the cone is documented at 322 feet, about as tall as a 25 story building. When temperatures warm up in early spring, the water from the fall begins to drill a hole at the top of the cone, creating a volcano-like structure, and by mid-April, most of the cone has melted. <br /><br />A sub-header in a brown bar reads: Moonbow<br />The text reads: The full moon in April and May offers a special treat at the base of Lower Yosemite Fall. As the moon rises, the light is captured and refracted in the massive spray of the fall, creating a phenomenon called a moonbow. <br /><br />A sub-header in a brown bar reads: Frazil Ice<br />The text reads: In early spring, frazil ice sometimes forms in waterfalls and creeks when water becomes super cooled by turbulence. Ice crystals form and group into spongy masses which sometimes overflow the creek bed. In 1997 frazil ice was above the railings of the Lower Yosemite Fall bridge, almost completely burying it!<br /><br />Quote: When the afternoon sunshine is streaming through the throng of comets, ever wasting, ever renewed, the marvelous fineness, firmness and variety of their forms are beautifully revealed. - John Muir<br />",

    "audioDescription": "Valley View is located along the left side of Northside drive, as you're about to exit Yosemite Valley. Valley View is next to the river, and showcases the scenery of Yosemite Valley, with El Capitan to the left of the valley and Bridalveil Fall to the right.<br /><br />A wayside exhibit is located next to the Valley View parking area.<br /><br />Photo: The background of this wayside panel is a faint, sepia toned, photo of Yosemite Valley from Valley View. El Capitan is on the left, while Sentinel Rock, the Cathedral Rocks, and Bridalveil Fall are on the left side of the panel. <br /><br />At the top of the panel, the header reads: The Power of Glaciers. <br />Text to the right of the header reads:<br />Following the ancient river channel, a series of glaciers shaped this canyon. When the glaciers melted, they left behind piles of rocks that had been plucked from the cliff walls and carried along in the river of ice. These piles are called moraines. The moraine left behind following the most recent glacial activity dammed the Merced River near Bridalveil Fall. As the glacier melted, a shallow lake formed which eventually filled in with small rocks and sediment. This accounts for the flat valley floor we see today. <br /><br />A sub-header, placed in a light brown bar to the left of the panel reads: An Everchanging Landscape<br />Text reads: Although glaciers ended their work here over 14,000 years ago, Yosemite remains a dynamic place. The Merced River continues to shape this valley. On January 2, 1997, floodwaters covered the parking lot here to a depth of 6 feet. <br /><br />Two small, square, black and white illustrations are located beneath the text. <br /><br />Photo 1: An aerial view looking into Yosemite Valley shows a glacier that starts in Yosemite's backcountry, moving forward past Half Dome, and ending just after El Capitan and Bridalveil Fall. The glacial ice rise about halfway up the Valley walls.<br /><br />Photo 1 Caption Header: 30,000 years ago<br />Photo 1 Caption Text: The last glacier to flow through Yosemite Valley was at its peak. As you can see at the bottom of this illustration, the moraine forms a low ridge at Bridalveil Fall. <br /><br />Photo 2: An aerial view looking into Yosemite Valley shows the steep walls of Yosemite Valley, with a lake that ends near El Capitan and Bridalveil Fall. <br /><br />Photo 2 Caption Header: 10,000 years ago<br />Photo 2 Caption Text: A shallow lake was created by the moraine left behind when the glacier receded. <br /><br />To the west of the parking lot is a sign that stands over six feet high. The sign reads: Flood Water Level, 11:00pm., January 2, 1997, and has a double sided arrow extending from left to right. <br /><br />",

    "audioDescription": "The official trailhead for this walk begins after walking across the O'Shaughnessy Dam and through a dark tunnel. At the other side of the tunnel, a dirt trail continues around the perimeter of the reservoir. A large body of water is on the right side of the trail. The water is in a granite basin, with high granite cliff walls rising up around the reservoir. Four wayside exhibits line the dirt path near the trailhead. The first sign has two panels stacked on top of each other. The upper panel has a faint, sepia-toned photo of an elderly Native American woman holding a baby in a cradle basket. The text reads, for generations Central Me-Wuk, Southern Sierra Miwuk, and Mono Lake Paiute people made mountain places like this their homes, using the higher mountains for trade routes and summer encampment. We have lived on the land as hunters and gatherers, and traditional skills and beliefs were passed on. We still live here and continue to teach our children the ways of our ancestors. The lower panel is titled, Archeological Site Protection, and has a faint, sepia-toned background photo of three Native American children grouped together. A young girl in a plaid dress and hat is on the left. A young boy with a white, long-sleeved shirt, hat, and long bangs, is to the right of the young girl, and is slightly taller than she is. An older girl, in a white, long-sleeved blouse and long skirt, sits on the ground to the right of the two others, and smiles at the camera. Panel text reads, disturbing these resources is disrespectful to American Indian cultures and is a violation of law. Please participate as a guardian of these important resources. The second sign has four, small, square panels, all located below a large map. Map: The large, detailed map shows the northern portion of the park. Roads, trails, peaks, and lakes are labeled. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035.The top left panel is orange with white text and reads, Hetch Hetchy trailhead. You are at the gateway to the northern canyons of Yosemite's wilderness. Wapama Falls - 2.7 milesRancheria Falls - 6.1 milesLaurel Lake - 6.8 milesLake Vernon - 8.0 milesTo protect water quality, swimming and boating is not allowed in the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and in the stream within one mile of the Reservoir. Closure includes Wapama Falls and Rancheria Cascade. The top right panel is blue with white text and reads, wilderness regulations, the natural integrity of Yosemite's high country depends on you. Help protect the wilderness, and avoid a citation, by following these regulations.Camp at least four trail miles from all developed areas. Pets, firearms, and bicycles are prohibited in wilderness. Stay on the trails; shortcutting switchbacks kills vegetation and causes erosion. Maximum group size for cross-country travel is eight people.Avoid disturbing wildlife and other visitors by keeping quiet on the trail and in camp. Use a gas stove for cooking; wood fires are allowed only below 9,600 feet in existing fire rings using dead and downed wood. Leave campsites as you find them; do not build windbreaks, fire rings, hitch racks, chairs, drainage trenches, or other \"improvements.\"Pack out everything you carry in; do not burn trash. Wilderness permit required for all overnight use. A series of three white circles containing three different icons are outlined in red and have a red diagonal line slashing through the middle. The three icons are of a gun, a dog, and a person on a bicycle.The bottom left panel is yellow with black text and reads, Black Bears - the health and well-being of Yosemite's bears depends on you. Bears are intelligent, curious, adaptable, and hungry. Human food, however, is harmful to bears and other animals here. Keep wildlife wild by using these food storage methods.At the trailhead: Remove all food, ice chests, and scented items from you car. Store them in food storage lockers where available. Never feed bears or other wildlife. In the backcountry: Store food, garbage, and scented items in bearproof canisters, available at front country locations. Keep items stored whenever you are not eating. Remember, bears are active day and night. Scare away any bears you see by making loud noises and acting aggressively. Report all bear incidents.The bottom right panel is blue with white text and reads, water quality - clean, sparkling water is one of the joys of the high country. Wildlife, wilderness visitors, and people downstream all need clean water to stay healthy. Protect your water suppy by following these regulations and suggestions:Camp at least 100 feet (40 steps) from water.Deposit human waste in a six-inch-deep hole at least 100 feet from water; carry out toilet paper.Wash dishes and yourself at least 100 feet from water; even biodegradeable soap pollutes.Carry a large water container and limit your trips to collect water; eroded stream banks and lakeshores contribute to poor water quality.

    "audioDescription": "A dirt road leads into this covered bridge. Vertical wooden planks make up the height of this bridge, which extend up to an A-frame roof. There is a wooden divider stretching across the inside of the bridge, making a path for people to walk on, and a road for the stagecoach to use. An exhibit sign reads: The Covered Bridge. The deck and truss portion of this bridge across the South Fork of the Merced River was built around 1857 by settler Galen Clark, who established a tourist facility there. The area was then called Clark's Station. The road from Wawona to the Yosemite Valley opened in 1875 just after the Washburn brothers purchased Clark's holdings. The brothers, who were from Vermont, covered the bridge soon thereafter. Bridges were covered primarily to protect the large wood truss beams and flooring from the weather. It is much easier to re-shingle a roof than to replace the major supporting structures. Although the large beams were hand-hewn with ax and adze, the lumber to cover the bridge was cut locally at the Washburn's sawmill. Did the Washburn brothers cover the bridge exclusively for practical reasons? Maybe so. But a granddaughter claims the reason was nostalgia - they were homesick for a bit of New England.",

Below the YARTS sign is an area to insert current bus schedules. A separate green and white sign reads: Valley Shuttle, Valley Visitor Center, and has the number five, in white font, in a green circle. <br /><br />Two covered shelters made with wooden beams and a shingled roof, both house two wooden benches. An informational display containing a map is located between the two shelters. <br /><br />The display is made up of three small text panels that are lined up on top of a large map. The left panel is yellow with a green bar across the top. The text within the green bar reads Shuttle Bus Schedule, Shuttle Stop number five, Visitors Center. The text in the yellow box reads From 7am to 10 am, service every 30 minutes. From 10am to 7pm, service every 20 minutes. From 7pm to 10pm, service every 30 minutes. <br /><br />The middle panel is white with a purple bar across the top. The text within the blue bar reads Shuttle to El Capitan. The text in the white box reads The El Capitan shuttle serves the west end of Yosemite Valley from May through October. Visitors can discover four uncrowded picnic areas, sandy beaches, and great views of climbers on \"El Cap.\" You can hike back to Yosemite Village and Half Dome Village on the Valley Loop Trail, or climb above the Valley on the Four Mile Trail.<br /><br />Photo: A white shuttle bus with the words Yosemite Shuttle across the side, is on the road in front of El Capitan <br /><br />Caption: Valley shuttle drivers will be happy to help you with trip and bus transfer information.

The text in the white box reads what is now the Ansel Adams Gallery was first known as Best's Studio. It was owned by the Best family, who let a young Ansel Adams practice on the piano in their home. In 1928, Ansel Adams married Virginia Best here. Today, the gallery offers photography workshops and features Ansel Adams' work, along with other artisans. <br /><br />Photo: A black and white photo shows a building with a wooden, high-pitched porch roof with stone pillars, and a sign and that reads Bests Studio. <br /><br />Caption: The building has undergone renovation, but the Ansel Adams Gallery is still located in this 1920s structure. Photo, Yosemite Research Library.<br /><br />The map shows three different Yosemite Valley shuttle routes. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. <br /><br />A fence runs along the backside of the shelters, separating the paved bus boarding area with a patch of grass.

    "bodyText": "<p>Constructed before the establishment of the rustic design guidelines, the Yosemite Conservation Heritage Center is an example of Tudor Revival architecture, a style not seen anywhere else within the national park system. The lodge is a transitional structure of strong European roots combined with the revolutionary way that Bay Area environmental designers used building materials.</p> <p>The lodge was built by the Sierra Club in 1903 at the base of Glacier Point at a cost of approximately $5,000. As Camp Curry expanded, the lodge was rebuilt in its current location in 1919.</p> <p>Architect John White donated his time to design the lodge. The building displays distinctive features of the First Bay Tradition, including its steeply pitched roof, emulating Yosemite Valley’s steep granite walls, and its use of local materials, such as granite and timber. The building’s steep roof pitch, masonry walls, and prominent chimney are also distinguishing features of the Tudor Revival style. The interior has a highly unusual, exposed roof structure of hammer beams supporting scissors trusses. The central fixture of the main lodge room is its massive stone fireplace.</p> <p>During relocation and rebuilding, contractors removed the roof and rebuilt the rest of the lodge in its new location using John White’s drawings. Some elements such as windows appear to have been salvaged and reused in the new building. Rough‐cut granite was brought from Madera County for the reconstructed lodge walls.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "The paved parking area for Yosemite Creek and Ten Lakes Trailhead is on the west side of Tioga Road and has two green recycle bins, two brown trash bins, four brown food lockers, a facility holding two vault toilets, one wayside exhibit and one map. Trees and granite bedrock surround the area. A dirt lot is located across the street, which is also where the trailhead for Ten Lakes is located. The trailhead for Yosemite Creek is at the north end of the parking area, marked by a metal sign that reads Yosemite Creek Trail and has an arrow pointing forward.<br /><br />The wayside exhibit shows a faded, black and white, close-up, background photo of a full waterfall. Text on the left side of the exhibit panel reads, rocks, ice, and water - standing here near Yosemite Creek, one feels only a hint of the power that this busy but unassuming waterway will possess by the time it reaches the floor of Yosemite Valley.<br /><br />The rocky Yosemite Creek watershed, which slopes downhill to the rim of Yosemite Valley about eight miles away, encompasses some fifty square miles of Yosemite's high country. Carved by tributary glaciers about 20,000 years ago, the V-shaped Yosemite Creek drainage was enlarged by the heavy volume of water and `ice which rushed through as the glacier retreated. Today, as spring snow melts, an average of 2,400 gallons per second of icy runoff is funneled through this hanging valley before plunging over the vertical cliff 2,425 feet to Yosemite Valley below. <br /><br />Photo: A river with white water flows toward a precipice. Granite bedrock and trees are along the banks. A rock formation blanketed in snow is at the far end of the river. <br /><br />Caption: Yosemite Creek plunging over the top of Yosemite Falls.<br /><br />Text on the right side of the exhibit panel reads, Yosemite Creek Trail, for hiking and trail information, please visit a Visitor Center or Information Station. This strenuous 16-mile out-and-back trail drops about 2.6 miles through lodgepole pine stands before joining the trail from the Yosemite Creek Campground. The trial continues to parallel Yosemite Creek for another 3.3 miles below. Follow the signs to the overlook at Yosemite Point, a short distance to the east, for a glimpse of the breathtaking drop into Yosemite Valley and across the High Sierra. Use caution, wet rocks can be slippery. <br /><br />Map: A tall, rectangular map of the surrounding area, shows a horizontal, squiggly, grey line near the top of the map, crossing from left to right, and is labeled Tioga Road. Along the Tioga Road, about three-quarters of the way to the right, a red dot indicates, \"you are here.\" A dotted diagonal line extends downard and slightly to the left from the red dot, representing the Yosemite Creek Trail. Along the trail, Yosemite Creek Campground and the top of Yosemite Falls are labeled. At the bottom of the dotted line is Yosemite Valley. Upper Yosemite Fall and Lower Yosemite Fall are represented by a series of three blue lines stacked on top of one another, each line shorter than the one above it. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035. <br /><br />Photo: A black and white aerial photo shows a three tier waterfall coming over a large rock wall. The upper fall is the longest of the three, the middle cascade the shortest. The lower fall is half the height of the upper fall.<br /><br />Caption: V-shaped Yosemite Creek watershed and Yosemite Falls.<br /><br />A map labeled, The Tioga Road, is on a sign board inside a wooden frame. The map shows the entire park with emphasis only on the Tioga Road, which is a red, solid, squiggly line that crosses the map from left to right, midway down the map. Major areas, beginning from the left include Crane Flat, which has icons indicating restrooms, groceries, gas, campground, and two sequioa groves that are in the area. A bit to the right is Tamarack Flat Campground. A quarter of the way across the map is White Wolf, which has icons indicating a campground, dining, and hiking are in that area. About one-third of the way across the map is Yosemite Creek, which has a red dot and text that reads, \"you are here.\" This area is labeled with Hiking, restrooms, and picnic icons. Halfway across the map are Olmsted Point, which has no services, and Tenaya Lake, which has multiple hiking, picnic, and restroom icons in the area. About two-thirds of the way across the map is Tuolumne Meadows, which has icons indicating camping, dining, restrooms, groceries, a wilderness center, and hiking, which includes Cathedral Lakes and Lembert Dome. Near the right side of the map, past Tuolumne Meadows, Mono Pass, a hiking destination, and Tioga Pass, the east entrance and exit to the park, are found along Tioga Road. The road then continues down to the first town outside the park, Lee Vining. For information regarding park maps, call our park accessibility coordinator at (209) 379-1035.",

At its peak in late spring, 2,400 gallons per second can flow over the lip of the upper fall. Yosemite Falls usually runs dry by late summer.</p> <h2>Ice Cone</h2> <p>In winter, a cone of ice accumulates at the base of Upper Yosemite Fall. The height of the cone can reach as high as 322 feet, about as tall as a 25-story building, and is usually melted by mid-April.</p> <h2>Moonbow</h2> <p>As the full moon rises in April and May, the light is captured and refracted in the massive spray at the base of Lower Yosemite Fall, creating a phenomenon called a moonbow.</p> <h2>Frazil Ice</h2> <p>In early spring, frazil ice sometimes forms in waterfalls and creeks when waterfall mist becomes very cool. Ice crystals form and group into spongy masses which sometimes overflow the creek bed. In 1997 frazil ice was above the railing of the Lower Yosemite Fall bridge, almost completely burying it!</p> <h2>Seasonality</h2> <p>While you can visit Yosemite Falls year-round, there is often no water in Yosemite Fall by late summer. </p> <h2>Getting Here</h2> <p>Yosemite Falls flows over the north rim of Yosemite Valley. Access to the base of the waterfall is located on Northside Drive, near the Lower Yosemite Falls shuttle stop (Valley Shuttle #6), and across from the Yosemite Valley Lodge. The walk to the base of the waterfall is an easy 1 mile (1.6 km) hike which can be done as a loop.</p> <p>Access to the top of Yosemite Falls is via the Upper Yosemite Fall Trail, located west of Lower Yosemite Fall near the Camp 4 Campground. Accessing the top of Yosemite Falls is a strenuous 7.2 mile (11.6 km) round-trip hike with 2,700 feet (823 m) of elevation gain. This trailhead can be accessed most easily by parking in the Yosemite Falls Parking Area or by using the free shuttle (Valley Shuttle #7). </p> <h2>Rules & Regulations</h2> <ul> <li>Share the trail! Leashed pets and strollers are allowed.</li> <li>Bicycles are prohibited. Numerous bicycle racks are located at the two trailheads (east and west side of the Lower Yosemite Fall loop) for your convenience.</li> <li>Keep your food within arm's reach at all times and do not feed the wildlife.</li> </ul> <h2>Hazards & Warnings</h2> <p>Stay on the paved trail. Above the wooden footbridge that crosses Yosemite Creek, the rocks and boulders are slippery even when dry. Scrambling off-trail in this area frequently leads to serious injuries.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>An accessible trail to access the base of Yosemite Falls is available near the shuttle stop. Only the eastern portion of the loop is accessible.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Upon approaching the Lower Yosemite Fall, the paved trail opens up to a viewing area. The open space is lined with mosaic stonework on the ground and large boulders. A fallen log also rests at the waterfall end of the viewing area. In the spring, the mist from the waterfall pelts everyone standing by, drenching them in seconds. Dependent on the season, the river either quietly or thunderously flows under a wood bridge nearby. Large rocks and boulders line the riverbed. Vibrant green trees surround the area.",

The Yosemite History Center is a collection of historic buildings where outdoor interpretive signs tell the stories of people who moved here from around the world and shaped the park’s development.

Check the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/guide.htm\">Yosemite Guide</a> for details.</p> <p>Many of the buildings that make up the Yosemite History Center were moved to Wawona in the 1950s and '60s from various locations throughout the park. These buildings were moved to make way for more modern park facilities and to create an area to interpret Yosemite's history. The History Center commemorates the efforts of people, the events they experienced, and the issues they faced during the establishment of Yosemite as a national park.</p> <h2>Hours</h2> <p>Year-round</p> <p>The Yosemite History Center is always open and informational signs are found in front of each building.</p> <h2>Getting Here</h2> <p>Access the complex by parking in the Wawona Store and Pioneer Gift Shop parking lot, located on the Wawona Road (continuation of Highway 41), near the Wawona Hotel.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p>Paths within the complex have a dirt surface.

A flat, dirt path passes by a shed filled with 8 plus old stagecoaches. At the end of the shed is the intersection of an old stagecoach road. Taking the road to the right will lead you to the Gray Barn, and taking the road to the left will lead you through a covered bridge that sits over a stream. At the other side of the bridge is a small loop trail, lined with wooden pioneer-era buildings. There is a sign that instructs you to take the trail to the left, leading you to a clock-wise tour of the trail. In order of appearance, the trail takes you by Artist Cabin, Anderson Cabin, Homestead Cabin, Blacksmith Shop, Cavalry Office, Ranger Patrol Cabin, Degnan's Bakery, Wells Fargo Office, and the Powderhouse and Jail, before it loops back to the covered bridge.",

    "audioDescription": "The building that houses the Yosemite Museum is a two story facility. The first story is made of granite boulder stonework, while the second story is wood shingle siding that is painted dark brown. Multiple orange framed windows line the second story. Above the arched entranceway is a wooden sign that reads museum. The entrance has double wooden doors with glass panes containing a few flyers. To the right of the entrance is a large slab of a giant sequoia trunk, about 9 feet in diameter. A sign reads Big Tree, sequoiadendron giganteum. This nine foot section of a giant sequoia was cut 30 feet from the base of a tree that fell in the Mariposa Grove in 1919. Annual rings show the tree's to be 996 years old, but at the base of the tree, where the diameter was 14 feet, the age was found to be 1,100 years. One of the largest trees in the Mariposa Grove, the Grizzly Giant, has been estimated to be 1790 years old. These big trees should not be confused with the coast redwood, Sequoia sempervirens, which is utilized commercially. Both are sequoias, part of the redwood family of trees, but the giant sequoia Sequoia giganteum, is native only to the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. The coast redwood grows along the Pacific coast from the Monterey Peninsula to southwestern Oregon. The fossil record indicates that over forty species of the redwood family once existed in the Northern Hemisphere. Eighteen species survive to the present, three of which have the name sequoia. There are nine small green arrows tags pointing at rings in the tree, progressing from the oldest, inner ring to the outer, most recent ring. The first tag near the center of the sequoia trunk slab reads A.D. 323, the next tag to the right reads 1066 Battle of Hastings, the next tag reads 1215 Magna Carta, the next tag, which is about two-thirds of the way from the center, reads 1492 Landing of Columbus, the next tag reads 1620 Landing of Pilgrims, and the next tag reads 1776 Declaration of Independence. The next three tags skirt around the outter edge of the slab and they read 1860 Civil War, 1864 Lincoln signed Yosemite Grant, and 1890 Yosemite National Park. To the left of the entrance is an Ahwahneechee Umacha, a traditional dwelling for Yosemite Indians, made up of long cedar planks stacked in a conical shape.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Yosemite Museum, completed in 1926, was designed by architect Herbert Maier in the newly emerging National Park Service rustic style. The Yosemite Museum was the first building constructed as a museum in the national park system, and its educational initiatives served as a model for parks nationwide.</p> <p>It was constructed in the emerging village center, in which all buildings were to have a unified architectural theme. Maier described the relationship between the Museum and its natural surroundings by saying, “The elevation of the museum stresses the horizontal—that seemed the logic of the situation…to attempt altitudinal impressiveness here in a building would have meant entering into a competition with the cliffs.</p> <p>”Indigenous building material, such as native rocks, logs, and wood shingles, were utilized for all visible exterior parts. The architectural philosophy was that rustic style “gives the feeling of having been executed by pioneer craftsmen with limited hand tools. It thus achieves sympathy with natural surroundings and with the past.</p> <p>”The Museum differs from the others in that where the others have frame floors to the second stories (and ceilings to the first), the ground floor of the Museum is completely fireproof, separated from the frame second story by a thick concrete ceiling, a design factor resulting from its intended museum use with the purpose of preserving artifacts, specimens, and exhibits.</p>",

Many thought he was crazy to leave behind his landscape architecture work, and his father made sure Frederick knew his displeasure over the move. However, at the time no one could have known that this move would set the stage for the creation of parks from the natural domain.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{30}\" paraid=\"1014588677\">A year after his move to California, the state had secured a grant deeming Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove inalienable parkland. A commission was formed to oversee the creation of the public preserve, with Olmsted serving as Superintendent and Chairman.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{34}\" paraid=\"1912661631\">Another year would pass before Olmsted wrote his report on Yosemite Valley and Mariposa, stressing the uniqueness of the valley, not because of the towering cliffs, but because of the union of the entire landscape, and the experience of taking it all in, uninterrupted.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{38}\" paraid=\"1710684116\">Olmsted wrote his report for Yosemite and Mariposa with a distinct eye for the times; the Civil War was over and he was expanding upon Lincoln’s vision for a broader, more inclusive interpretation of democracy as he wrote the foundation for our national park system.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{42}\" paraid=\"242410202\">Like father, like son, Olmsted Jr. would join in on his father’s fight 50 years later when asked to refine his father’s work and address the need for a new bureau to manage scattered parks and monuments. This would start a 6-year correspondence, culminating in Jr.’s writing of the Organic Act, which would help solidify the creation of the NPS, keeping great natural wonders in the hands of the people.</p>",

However, the final fourteen-mile leg of the journey from El Portal to Yosemite Valley was still made by stage, and later by autos.</p> <p>Upon arrival at this terminal in Yosemite Valley, passengers could book a stay in a hotel and make transportation arrangements with travel agents, who lived in the building’s back rooms. Despite its rustic design, the office provided modern conveniences. Visitors could make telephone calls or send telegrams to anywhere in the world. By 1914, automobiles were common in Yosemite, and in that year, horse-drawn stage service was discontinued. However, annual visitation to the park in 1915 doubled to 31,000. Consequently, stage operation was renewed but only for one additional year. In 1916, the era of stage travel ended and another began. The National Park Service, a federal agency created to preserve and manage our country's national parks, was established.</p> <p>The reliance on transportation companies for park access diminished greatly when the All-Year Highway (now California Highway 140) opened in 1927, and personal cars soon became the dominant means of transportation in Yosemite.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Architect Eldridge T. Spencer designed three new buildings oriented around a central courtyard. Most buildings are connected by covered walkways. This comprehensive building and landscape plan includes the present-day guest registration area, cafeteria, restaurant, cocktail lounge, outdoor amphitheater, and gift shop. Completed in 1959 at a cost of $1.5 million, Yosemite Lodge, as it was then known, was the most expensive project the Yosemite Park and Curry Company had taken on up to that point.</p> <p>Spencer was inspired by John Muir’s words describing the Sierra Nevada mountains as a “range of light.” When designing the lodge complex, Spencer incorporated a sense of openness and lightness. The walkways and courtyard between buildings take the visitor through natural environments and views of Yosemite Falls. The large window walls create a sense of openness and allow natural light and scenery to reach visitors indoors. Steel framing and glass windows are unobtrusive and blend with the natural environment. The low horizontal massing of the buildings does not compete with the grand height of Yosemite Falls and nearby trees, allowing visitors to appreciate the sense of scale.</p> <p>Like other Mission 66 buildings in Yosemite Village, the lodge complex features mountain chalet motifs. For instance, inside the cocktail lounge, a large central fireplace features stylized images of skiers embossed in metal. Vaulted wood panel ceilings in several buildings impart both openness and warmth.</p>",

Along with the Museum and Park Administration Building, these three constructions are all two-story buildings with a stone lower story and overhanging frame second story. Since its construction, the Post Office now has composition shingles on the exterior of the second story in lieu of the original wood shingle finish.</p>",

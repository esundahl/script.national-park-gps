Was it lost from a large ship that came up the Columbia during the 19th century? Was a later ship using an old anchor? Or was this anchor simply being transported as salvage from elsewhere?<br /> <br /> It is a Rodgers small-palm anchor, patented in England in 1832. With small improvements, this type continued to be used into the 20th century as a stream anchor. The chain is wrought iron with studs, an improvement to chain links that was patented in 1813.<br /> <br /> This size of anchor would have been used on a ship of up to 1,000 tons. Although a significant amount of river traffic sailed up and down the Columbia River - including Hudson's Bay Company supply ships, British and American war ships, and steamers transporting goods and troops - few, if any, ships of this size ventured over the Columbia River Bar and this far upriver.<br /> <br /> Most ships that came to Fort Vancouver during the fur trade period were well below 500 tons. The USS <em>Massachusetts</em>, which brought the first U.S. Army troops to Vancouver, was 765 tons.<br /> <br /> This anchor's presence here remains a mystery. How do you think it might have ended up at Fort Vancouver?",

In 1937, three Soviet aviators flew an ANT-25 aircraft from Moscow, Russia, to Vancouver, Washington.<br /> <br /> On June 20, 1937, the world's attention turned to Pearson Field when a Russian ANT-25 aircraft landed after making the first non-stop flight over the North Pole.<br /> <br /> The red and gray, single-engined aircraft \"Stalin's Route\" carried over 2,000 gallons of fuel, and sported a 112 foot wingspan. It was crewed by three of the Soviet Union's top airmen: Valery Chkalov, pilot; Georgi Baidukov, co-pilot; and Alexander Belyakov, navigator.<br /> <br /> Taking off from Moscow on June 17, 1937, and bound for Oakland, California, the aircraft flew for almost 65 hours through sub-zero temperatures and thickening ice on its wings, before a sudden drop in oil pressure forced them to land at Pearson Field. <br /> <br /> The unexpected aviators breakfasted with Vancouver Barracks' commanding officer, General George C. Marshall, then faced throngs of journalists, politicians, and curious spectators. They were treated to a month-long tour of the United States that ended in Washington, D.C. at a reception with President Roosevelt.

It was originally built on the bluff overlooking today’s location of the reconstructed fort, approximately in the current location of the Washington State School for the Deaf. In 1829, that original fort was torn down and rebuilt on the plain where the reconstruction is now located. Fort Vancouver served as the administrative headquarters and supply depot for the Hudson’s Bay Company’s vast network of fur trading forts in its “Columbia Department.” This Columbia Department included the modern-day states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, parts of Montana, Northern California, British Columbia, and the southern parts of Alaska. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a72464ad-1430-46ca-9ab6-359908c08886}{98}\" paraid=\"186401100\">The people who lived at Fort Vancouver included the fort’s officers and their wives and families, including Chief Factor Dr. John McLoughlin and Chief Trader James Douglas. This “gentleman” class included about 30 people, who lived inside the fort. The population of the fort included a large working class, which could grow to hundreds of people living in the Village when fur brigades were in. These individuals worked at the fort as carpenters, coopers, blacksmiths, bakers, and more. They were also fur trappers and traders.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a72464ad-1430-46ca-9ab6-359908c08886}{112}\" paraid=\"886138470\">The people who lived at Fort Vancouver were part of a diverse community. Hudson’s Bay Company employees came from across the country and around the world. Over 25 American Indian tribes were represented in the population that lived here, on the ancestral homelands of the Cowlitz and Chinook peoples. Fort Vancouver’s employees were also French-Canadian, Irish, English, Scottish, and Métis. In the 1840s, Fort Vancouver was home to the largest population of Native Hawaiians outside of the Hawaiian Islands; these workers also came here to find economic opportunity, and while some returned to the islands, many made a new home in the Pacific Northwest.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a72464ad-1430-46ca-9ab6-359908c08886}{136}\" paraid=\"843760416\">Through the 1830s and 1840s, the fort’s power and influence in the Northwest grew. When American settlers began to cross the Oregon Trail in the 1840s, the fort became a resupply stop for newcomers to the region.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a72464ad-1430-46ca-9ab6-359908c08886}{144}\" paraid=\"311228232\">The decision to build the fort on the northern side of the Columbia River had been made in part because the fort’s leaders, including McLoughlin, hoped that the river would eventually become the boundary between United States and British Canada. However, the Oregon Treaty of 1846 set the boundary between the United States and Canada at the 49th parallel, and placed the fort inside US territory. In 1849, the US Army established Vancouver Barracks directly adjacent to the fort. The Army and the Hudson’s Bay Company coexisted, weathering some conflicts, through the 1850s. Then, in 1860, the Company abandoned the fort and moved their operations to British Columbia. The original fort was destroyed by fire in 1866.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a72464ad-1430-46ca-9ab6-359908c08886}{162}\" paraid=\"1405570792\">In 1947, the National Park Service, spurred by community interest in commemorating Fort Vancouver, sent archaeologist Louis Caywood to locate the site of the original fort. Caywood was successful, and subsequent archaeological excavations revealed the locations of other fort structures. Today’s reconstructed Fort Vancouver is located on the archaeological footprint of the fort that stood there from 1829-1866. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a72464ad-1430-46ca-9ab6-359908c08886}{178}\" paraid=\"1076199658\">The reconstruction of Fort Vancouver began in the 1970s. While not every building has been rebuilt, the reconstructed fort is a recreation of what the fort looked like in the year 1845.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{a72464ad-1430-46ca-9ab6-359908c08886}{178}\" paraid=\"1076199658\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/learn/historyculture/hbcfort1.htm\">Learn more about visiting the reconstructed Fort Vancouver here</a></h2>",
    "audioDescription": "Fort Vancouver is a reconstructed fur trade-era fort, enclosed inside a stockade of wooden posts. The stockade is in the shape of a large rectangle. In the northwest corner is a wooden tower called a Bastion. Outside the fort, leading to its gate on the north wall of the stockade, is an English-style garden. North of the garden is a gravel parking lot. A trail from the parking lot leads to the gate on the stockade's north wall. Inside the gate to the right is a Contact Station, where park rangers provide information and collect entrance fees. The interior of the fort includes numerous buildings that have been reconstructed, including the large white Chief Factor's House, blacksmith shop, bake house, carpenter shop, Indian Trade Shop, Counting House, Jail, and Fur Store. The buildings are connected by a paved pathway.",

    "bodyText": "In 1670, King Charles II granted a Royal Charter to “the Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson Bay” a corporation that would eventually come to be known as the Hudson’s Bay Company. The Hudson’s Bay Company, whose headquarters by the time of The Pig War was this building in London, shipped European trade goods and technology to North America, where they were sold to Native Americans for animal fur which was then resold in Europe and Asia, hence their corporate motto “Pro Pelle Cutem” which in latin means “A pelt for a skin”. Unlike the corporations we are familiar with today, the Hudson’s Bay Company fused governmental power, military capabilities, and diplomatic functions with its quest for profit. It operated throughout Canada and was especially powerful in the Pacific Northwest, where the Hudson’s Bay Company was the most potent non-native force in the region in the early days of European colonization.<br /> <br /> The Hudson’s Bay Company’s global trading business and the strategies that made it successful relied upon a diverse workforce. Acquiring fur required Native American participation and the company hired Native American employees and carefully stocked trade goods that catered to Native American consumer preferences. Company operatives often married high ranking Native American women and their alliances helped encourage trade and cooperation; children of these cross-cultural marriages often worked for the Hudson’s Bay Company, where they acted as cultural mediators who understood the needs of indigenous people and the company’s commercial empire. In the Pacific Northwest, the company found itself short on labor and hired Hawaiian men as laborers, farmers, seafarers, and fur trade adventurers.<br /> <br /> The Hudson’s Bay Company built a string of trading posts throughout the Pacific Northwest in the 1820s-1850s at a time when the United States and the British Empire both claimed the Oregon Country (the future states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Wyoming and Montana). These posts became centers for settlement, economic development, and imperial power at a time when few U.S. citizens inhabited the Oregon Country. It was only in the 1840s, as masses of U.S. emigrants used the Oregon Trail to settle in the Pacific Northwest that the Hudson’s Bay Company and British imperial power were contested. When the Oregon Treaty of 1846 gave the states of Washington and Oregon to the United States, the Hudson’s Bay Company was forced to wind down operations at its bases in Washington and Oregon, which included at one time parts of the future <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fova\">Fort Vancouver National Historic Site</a> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/whmi\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/lewi\">Lewis and Clark National Historical Park</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/nepe\">Nez Perce National Historical Park</a><br /> <br /> Still, the Hudson’s Bay Company remained powerful within British territory; one way that they demonstrated this power was by founding a massive operation on San Juan Island. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/belle-vue-sheep-farm.htm\">Belle Vue Sheep Farm</a>, established in 1853, grew into a massive agricultural complex with over 4,000 sheep and more than a dozen Hawaiian and native employees. It was a Hudson’s Bay Company pig that rooted through Lyman Cutlar’s potato patch on June 15, 1859, sparking the Pig War. During the joint occupation of San Juan Island, American Camp was established adjacent to Belle Vue Sheep Farm headquarters and the farm wound down operations on our island.<br /> <br /> Though the Hudson’s Bay Company is no longer on our island, it remains a major corporation. No longer in the fur trade, it is now one of Canada’s largest department stores. It’s unique contribution to our region’s history and to global history is crucial to understanding how San Juan Island developed.",

    "bodyText": "The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson’s Bay Company</a>'s (HBC) established their Honolulu agency offices in 1829. Hawaiians had been working in the Pacific Northwest since 1787 and over time became an increasingly pivotal part of the fur trading workforce. At this office, the HBC recruited Hawaiian workers, sold British goods and Pacific Northwest agricultural products, and resupplied its ships headed from Hawaii to China and American whaling ships which regularly stopped in Honolulu. By the mid 19<sup>th</sup> Century, the Honolulu Agency was a vital part of a global trading empire that encompassed London, North America, and Asia.<br /> <br /> Hawaiians’ importance to the HBC can be seen in the writings of Chief Factor John McLoughlin who in 1830 asked the Honolulu agency to “Sen[d] us as many of them [Hawaiians[ as possible.” These workers filled numerous vital positions for the HBC; many worked on its ships as sailors. Others, like the sixteen Hawaiians who landed on San Juan Island in 1853, were agricultural workers who grew crops and herded sheep. Still others served as construction workers whose labor helped establish fur trade outposts or as teamsters, carrying goods hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles to trade with Native Americans in the extensive network of fur trade forts that the HBC operated throughout the Pacific Northwest. It is estimated that by the mid-1800s, approximately 1/3 of the HBC’s Pacific Northwest labor force were Hawaiians.<br /> <br /> Hawaiians were hired on time-limited contracts that specified their pay and term of service. In 1844, a Honolulu newspaper claimed that “they are generally engaged for a period of three years and gain $10 per month.” Though little documentation exists, it is likely that many of these migrant workers sent wages home to their families in Hawaii. Many Hawaiians regularly renewed their labor contracts and worked for decades in the Pacific Northwest either with the HBC or as independent settlers who homesteaded after leaving HBC employment. Hawaiian migrants also worked at other National Park Service sites that were once HBC establishments, such as <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/lewi\">Lewis and Clark National Historical Park</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fova\">Fort Vancouver National Historical Site</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/whmi\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a>. On San Juan Island place names like Kanaka Bay and Friday Harbor (named after a Hawaiian man who settled there whose English name was Peter Friday) and Eastern Oregon place names like Kanaka Creek, Kanaka Bar, Kanaka Glen, and the Owyhee River demonstrate the longstanding impact of Hawaiians in the Pacific Northwest.",

    "bodyText": "This building served many purposes. It contained the fort's Indian Trade Shop, hospital and dispensary, and the residence of the fort's surgeon.<br /> <br /> Most Hudson's Bay Company employees and their families lived outside the stockade walls, but company officers, such as the post surgeon and his family, lived inside - in buildings such as this one. More than simply a family house, though, this building primarily served as the post surgeon's place of work. From 1840 to 1850, the occupant of this building would have been <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/forbesbarclay.htm\">Dr. Forbes Barclay</a> and his family.<br /> <br /> Many of the HBC's officers held responsibilities not captured in their job title. The role of post surgeon serves as one of the better examples. He prepared, packaged, and dispensed medicines for this fort and the other two dozen forts in the Columbia Department. He also operated both the hospital inside this building, and another hospital in the fort's employee Village. In addition to expected levels of sickness and accident, the post surgeon contended with large-scale seasonal outbreaks of \"fever and ague\" - likely malaria - that killed many American Indians and debilitated the fort's work force.<br /> <br /> The post surgeon also carried on many essential duties besides treating the sick and injured. From an adjacent room, he manged the Indian Trade Shop, taking in \"country made\" goods and furs from local American Indians and trading them for items imported by the Company. He issued provisions to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fovachieffactorshouse.htm\">Chief Factor's House</a> kitchen and distributed weekly rations to the fort's nearly two hundred employees. He rcorded weather phenomena and, when requested, obtained and sent scientific specimens of plants, animals, and minerals to HBC officers and interested scientists in Great Britain. <br /> <br /> The Indian Trade Shop and Hospital at Fort Vancouver National Historic Site is a modern reconstruction built on the archaeological footprint of the structure that stood here in the 1800s. Today, this building includes a reconstruction of the Indian Trade Shop on the west (right) side of the building. At the eastern (left) end of the building, the hospital and dispensary have been reconstructed, along with the residence of Dr. Forbes Barclay, his wife Maria, and their children.<br /> <br />  ",

In between is a large gray sign that reads, \"McLoughlin House Site, a unit of Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.\" The house on the left has a small sign over the front door that tells us this is the McLoughlin House, Georgian style, 1846. It is a two story, white-frame house with a hip roof, with all sides slanting down to the walls, covered with gray shingles and two chimney stacks, one at either end. The plain front has a dark door in the exact center flanked by two paned windows on either side. The second story has five paned windows. The side sidewalk leads to a flagstone covered porch area with two steps. In front of trimmed bushes along the left front is a large boulder with a metal plaque that reads, \"National Historic Site, McLoughlin Hose. In the city he founded in this house he built, lived Dr. John McLoughlin, 1846-57. He won enduring fame or his generous and humane aid to early American settlers in the Oregon country, as chief factor and superintendent of the Hudson's Bay Company in this territory, 1824-45. In 1850, Dr. McLoughlin presented this park to Oregon City. In 1851 he became a citizen of the United States. His house, which originally stood closer to the river, was removed to this location in 1909.\"<br /><br />The house on the right is much smaller. The roof slants down in front and extends to cover the low porch that runs across the front, supported by four white posts. The wood siding is painted a soft yellow with white trim surrounding the door and the two paned windows on either side. Neatly clipped hedge line the front walk and the small square lawn on either side of the walk. A small sign post in front reads, \"National Historic Site, Welcome. Barclay House, 1850.\" A metal plaque in a stone marker reads, \"Dr. Forbes Barclay, 1812-1873. Dr. Forbes Barclay left Scotland in 1839 for Fort Vancouver, Washington, where he became chief physician for Hudson's Bay Company. He moved to Oregon City in 1850 where he practiced medicine for many years. He was one of Oregon City's early mayors councilman for 9 years, coroner for 18 years, and superintendent of the first public school for 15 years.\"<br /><br />In between the two houses, at the back of the property, is a small grave plot surrounded by a wrought iron fence. The double grave is covered with green ivy. The gray granite headstone has two white marble arched stones embedded in it, the engraving much worn. The one on the left reads, Margaret McLoughlin and the one on the right reads Dr. John McLoughlin.",

He was known in Oregon City as the \"Doctor\" - a trained physician who once presided over British fur trade interests in a vast area stretching from California to Alaska. He made money for the Hudson's Bay Company, but also assisted exhausted, starving American emigrants arriving into the region via the Oregon Trail. All his actions were set against the international stage of American and British politics and determination of national boundaries.<br /> <br /> Forced into retirement, he and his family settled into this home by the Willamette Falls in Oregon City in 1846. McLoughlin built himself a new career promoting the economic prosperity of the Oregon Territory. He became an American citizen in 1851, and served as the mayor of Oregon City. He and his wife Marguerite were known for their hospitality and generous support of those in the community. McLoughlin loaned money to emigrants to help them establish commercial ventures. He owned sawmills, a gristmill, a granary, a general store, and a shipping concern. He also donated land for schools and churches.<br /> <br /> The McLoughlin House is also on the Oregon National Historic Trail, which is part of the National Trail System. This system of national scenic, historic, and recreational trails promote the enjoyment of outdoor recreation, and the appreciation, and preservation of historic resources.<br /> <br /> The graves of McLoughlin and his wife Marguerite are next to the house, as is the home of Dr. Forbes Barclay, a Hudson's Bay Company associate.<br /> <br /> Visitors the McLoughlin House Unit should start their visit at the neighboring <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/xx-barclay-house.htm\">Barclay House</a>.

Separated by thousands of miles from their home parishes, these men pleaded with the Bishop of Quebec to send them priests.<br /> <br /> The Reverend Francis Norbert Blanchet and the Reverend Modeste Demers arrived at Fort Vancouver in 1838 at the official request of Dr. John McLoughlin, and established the first Catholic mission in the Oregon Country. In 1844, the Hudson's Bay Company donated a tract of land northwest of the fort for the construction of a proper mission. By 1872, the St. James Mission was recorded as containing 28 separate structures, including a church, orphanage, laundry, bake house, hospital, and college for boys. <br /> <br /> The U.S. Army established Vancouver Barracks around the Mission claim, and legal wranglings on the ownership of the property were not resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court until 1895. The Mission was closed by the Army in 1887, when they forced the inhabitants to abandon the grounds. The church and most of the other buildings were destroyed by arson in 1888.",

An ambitious building scheme was begun that would enable the post to garrison a regiment of infantry and two batteries of artillery. The double artillery barracks was constructed during that period, erected on this site in 1904. <br /> <br /> The Colonial Revival style building housed two separate companies, a total capacity of 240 men. The latrines, storage rooms, and other functional spaces were located in the basement. The kitchen, mess halls, and day rooms were on the first floor. The second floor had large, dormitory style sleeping quarters for the soldiers, with smaller, semi-private rooms for the officers. At one point, the attic housed an indoor shooting range.",

While the oven in the Kitchen provided some bread for the gentlemen's table in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fovachieffactorshouse.htm\">Chief Factor's House</a>, three to four bakers labored long hours here in front of the Bake House's massive twin ovens, preparing bread and biscuit for hundreds of other company employees.<br /> <br /> After 1841, employees at Fort Vancouver received a daily ration of 1.5 pounds of biscuit when potatoes were unavailable, and it was often of the lowest quality - called sea biscuit or hardtack. The bakers would have baked it in ovens similar to those reconstructed in the Bake House at Fort Vancouver National Historic Site - but that would not have been their only responsibility. Sailors assigned to vessels engaged in the HBC's coastal trade needed a source of bread, as did the annual fur brigades and other travelers. Biscuit and bread from this bakery met these needs, and traveled overland and overseas as extensively as the fur trade engagés who consumed it.<br /> <br /> To more easily meet these demands, at least one of the bakers lived in the building's attic. The ovens needed to be stoked and tended around the clock to ensure consistent baking temperature. And, just as today, the bakers began work very early in the morning in order to give any leavened bread time to rise before baking.<br /> <br /> The Bake House was completed in the fall of 1844, replacing two earlier bake houses at other locations within the stockade. Historical research and archaeological investigation helped the National Park Service determine the original size and interior layout of this building.<br /> <br /> The Bake House you see at Fort Vancouver National Historic Site today is a reconstruction of the original, built on the archaeological footprint of the Bake House that stood there from 1844 until the 1860s.",

The first appears on maps from 1870. It was constructed on the Parade Ground south of the Grant House, slightly to the east of the current bandstand. By the mid-1880s it had been replaced by a fountain, and the second bandstand had been constructed on the extreme west end of the Parade Ground. It, in turn, was supplanted by a third bandstand built around 1906 on the east end of the Parade Ground, which stood until 1943. <br /> <br /> The current bandstand is a reconstruction built in the 1980s, meant to duplicate the post's first bandstand. Like its predecessors, it serves as a social center of Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, hosting speeches, ceremonies, weddings, commemorations, and - continuing the rich legacy of the site - military concerts.",

    "bodyText": "In the northwest corner of Fort Vancouver's protective palisade wall, a three-story tower called a bastion or blockhouse rose above the surrounding plain. From the top, Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) employees could keep watch over the Columbia River valley and its gently rolling hills. The bastion was a common feature of HBC posts throughout North America. They typically had open slits or windows through which guns and cannons could be aimed at attacking enemies.<br /> <br /> Fort Vancouver was a unique HBC post because it had no bastion for almost twenty years. It is possible that the fort had bastions in the early 1830s, but records from 1834 show that these were either torn down or had never existed. Unlike at some other HBC posts in the Pacific Northwest, local Indigenous peoples near Fort Vancouver were interested in trading with the HBC, and in finding economic benefits for their villages or tribes through these new arrivals. However, horrific epidemics in the 1830s, a consequence of the increased HBC presence in the area, had catastrophic effects on these local villages, greatly reducing their populations. Since the bastion was meant to be used for defense, the HBC managers at Fort Vancouver saw no reason to build one for many years.<br /> <br /> The decision to build a bastion at Fort Vancouver came in 1845 for two reasons. First, while the Native population declined in the area, the American settler population was growing. Though relations between HBC employees and recent American arrivals were mostly pleasant and sometimes even supportive, tensions bubbled to the surface in the early 1840s as the United States and Great Britain discussed territorial boundaries in the Oregon Country. Chief Factor Dr. John McLoughlin and the HBC feared an attack by patriotic (or desperate) Americans. The second reason for constructing the tower was more a matter of prestige. When the British warship HMS <em>Modeste</em> dropped anchor at Fort Vancouver in the summer of 1844, its sailors fired a ceremonial seven-gun salute to the HBC. To McLoughlin's embarrassment, Fort Vancouver had no way to return the gesture. Almost immediately, he issued orders to erect a bastion on site. Carpenters and laborers completed the tower in February of 1845. By March, HBC cannons roared in salute from the top of the bastion when the HBC ship <em>Vancouver</em> arrived.<br /> <br /> Though Fort Vancouver's bastion never saw any real military action it was still certainly an imposing structure. The tower, shaped like an octagon, was built into the northwest corner of the palisade. It stood three stories tall and was capped with a pointed roof. It was the tallest building at the fort. At the top level, eight three-pound iron guns pointed through small windows in each of the bastion's eight sides. When not in use, the windows were shuttered. The entrance on the ground level was probably on the bastion's southeast wall since that was the only side accessible from inside the fort. When the HBC left Fort Vancouver, the bastion fell into disrepair along with the rest of its buildings. Sometime after 1860, it burned to the ground. While it stood, however, the bastion was an important part of Fort Vancouver's image, and a key way that the HBC projected strength in a tangible, visible way.",

    "bodyText": "Blacksmiths at Fort Vancouver provided the tools and hardware used in everyday life. They made everything from axes and beaver traps to gardening hoes and fishing spears. The Blacksmith Shop at Fort Vancouver produced things mostly for Hudson's Bay Company operations but also made goods that were sold or traded to Indigenous peoples and American settlers throughout the Oregon Country. So great was the demand for these items that at one point, the fort employed five blacksmiths in two shops, with another shop just upriver at the sawmill.<br /> <br /> But when the HBC first arrived to the region in the winter of 1824-1825, the closest blacksmith shop was at Fort George, located on the Oregon Coast near present-day Astoria, Oregon. Builders needed iron nails and tools to construct the buildings of Fort Vancouver, which was then located on a bluff overlooking the Columbia River and the prairie where the fort would be relocated in 1829. The fort's first blacksmith, William Cannon, set up a primitive smithy - nothing more than a forge and an anvil under a tree. His set-up was located up the hill to the north of that first fort. When the fort was moved closer to the river four years later, the shop was relocated inside the palisade walls. The reconstruction you see today is based on the Blacksmith Shop's location and appearance in 1845-46.<br /> <br /> The smithing process took place every working day at Fort Vancouver. It required technical skill and years of expertise. First, the blacksmith built a fire in his forge, using coal or charcoal. He pumped a bellows attached to the forge to force in oxygen and stoke the flames to upwards of 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. Into the raging fire the blacksmith placed bars of wrought iron or steel shipped from Britain. Here the iron turned red-hot. The blacksmith could then bend and beat the bars into shape using a hammer and anvil. Most of the hardware used at Fort Vancouver was made this way by hand in the often sweltering, dirty Blacksmith Shop.",

A paved walkway leads to the western entrance. Inside, a gravel pathway leads through the middle of the building, curving slightly right. The pathway is bordered by a rope on either side. At the north and south ends of the interior of the building are two large blacksmith's forges. The room is full of blacksmith's tools and items made by the fort's volunteer blacksmiths.",

    "bodyText": "The Counting House at Fort Vancouver was the administrative center for all Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) operations in the Columbia Department. Known to most simply as \"the office,\" this was where official records of the Pacific Northwest fur trade were made and kept. A small but important building, the Counting House represented the HBC's business interests at Fort Vancouver. Here, clerks kept track of all the goods and monies that traded hands throughout the region, watching over a dizzying array of inventories, bills, exchanges, payments, journals, and correspondences. For every record, three copies were made - one for the Fort's keeping, one for officials at York Factory on Canada's Hudson's Bay, and one for officials in London. Each year, these records were bundled and sent via the York Factory Express to the main HBC office in Canada. The accounting done by Fort Vancouver's clerks helped upper management keep tabs on business from thousands of miles away.<br /> <br /> Being a clerk was a desirable position but incredibly hard work. Clerks often sat at their desks late into the evening, squinting at handwritten ledgers by candlelight, scribbling out long notes stating who did what and what went where. The men who filled these roles sometimes complained about being worked to the bone. Clerks almost always came from London and were highly educated. Still, they had to spend years as apprentices before achieving full employment. Clerks needed to prove they possessed proper math and handwriting abilities before they got the job. Though it was in the HBC's best interests to make sure that clerks were reliable and competent, a lack of personnel at Fort Vancouver sometimes meant that less-than-adequate individuals rose through the ranks. However, if clerks were willing to put up with the years of training and endless mind-numbing work, they were often rewarded with much better pay than most HBC employees received in the Oregon Country. Apprentices made between £20 and £50 per year, and full clerks could receive salaries as high as  £150, which in those days was quite a lot. Also, clerks were some of the only HBC employees at Fort Vancouver that were promoted to commissioned management positions, though promotions were usually a long time coming, if they came at all.<br /> <br /> The reconstructed Counting House you see today is based on the \"new office,\" built in 1845 to replace the aging \"old office\" from the 1820s. It is built on the archaeological footprint of the new office building. The new office was painted white to show just how important it was; paint was hard to come by on the frontier, and its use marked the building as prestigious, much like the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fovachieffactorshouse.htm\">Chief Factor's residence</a>. Above the front door hung the HBC's coat of arms, which prominently displayed the Company's motto: <em>Pro pelle cutum</em>, Latin for \"A skin for a skin.\" In an abstract way, the Counting House was where furs collected by trappers became wealth for all HBC employees - a literal skin for a figurative skin.",

    "bodyText": "At Fort Vancouver, employees stored animal skins in fur stores. Contrary to the modern meaning of the term \"store,\" nothing was sold out of these buildings. Instead, fur stores were more like warehouses where skins were processed and kept for shipment to market in London. By 1844, at the height of Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) operations in the Columbia River basin, Fort Vancouver had two fur stores, with additional room for storage at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fovaits.htm\">Indian Trade Shop</a>. Both buildings were big - two stories tall, nearly 100 feet long, with high hipped roofs. In fact, these were some of the largest buildings in the area at the time, and for good reason: in 1844, they needed to be able to hold over 60,000 furs!<br /> <br /> The job of storing furs involved more than just tossing them into the warehouse. Each skin had to be cleaned, dried, and packed in a tight bundle with other skins to ensure that no insects or moisture got into the precious cargo. The process of packing began at Fort Vancouver's secondary forts - Fort Walla Walla, Fort Boise, and Fort Hall, to name a few - located strategically up the Columbia River and its tributaries. As trappers trickled into these forts near the end of the winter trapping season, employees sorted through their bounty of furs, cleaned them of debris, and hung them out to dry. In the case of sturdier skins like beaver and bear, they would speed up this part by beating the furs like rugs. However, some skins, like marten and fox, were too delicate to be treated so roughly. After being cleaned and dried, they were grouped into packs of \"mixed skins,\" each containing an assortment of furs to prevent the possibility of losing all the more valuable skins at once if the pack were damaged or lost. The packer then folded and arranged the skins carefully before using a press to squeeze them into a bundle measuring less than two feet by two feet, and about one foot deep. These bundles usually weighed about 80 or 90 pounds and contained a stamp and slip of paper to indicate their contents and where they came from. To protect the fur bundles from the elements, they were wrapped in bearskin or deerskin and bound with cord made from buffalo or deer hides.<br /> <br /> In the spring, these packs were loaded onto boats and sent down the Columbia to Fort Vancouver. When they arrived, employees unpacked the bundles, checked them for damage, and repeated the process of cleaning and drying the skins, making sure to keep shipments separate from one another; this was how HBC officials in London kept tabs on productivity in each region of the Columbia Department.<br /> <br /> In Fort Vancouver's Fur Store, the skins were piled in heaps or hung from the rafters. The building itself had few windows so it stayed cool and dark inside. To prevent moisture from collecting, the HBC designed the stores to be well-ventilated. When the skins were ready for shipment, usually in late summer, they were bundled into larger packs weighing upwards of 200 pounds, loaded onto ships, and sent out on their long journey halfway across the globe to England.<br /> <br /> The fur stores were an important part of the HBC's success in North America. They were essential to keeping the Company's valuable goods in good condition during the Pacific Northwest's damp winters and hot summers. But when the Columbia Department's headquarters moved north to Fort Victoria in 1845, the Fur Stores at Fort Vancouver were the first buildings to fall by the wayside. By 1847, they were hardly used. Two years later, they were rented out to the United States military for storage, signaling not only the decline of HBC operations at Fort Vancouver but also the decline of the fur trade altogether.",

    "bodyText": "The Pacific Northwest may have been a remote place during the mid-19th century, but it was certainly not lawless. At Fort Vancouver, Chief Factor Dr. John McLoughlin detained rule-breakers and accused criminals in a small jail inside the fort's palisade walls. The building measured about twenty feet by twenty feet and was built out of rough timbers. It contained only one room with minimal furnishings and sat behind the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fovacounting.htm\">Counting House</a>. Conditions inside the jail were harsh by today's standards but relatively luxurious for the time. The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) required that prisoners be fed and given water - an uncommon practice, especially on the frontier. McLoughlin supplied detainees with a few hard wooden bunkbeds and benches, some water and slop buckets, and possibly a wash basin. The Jail was built without a fireplace, probably to reduce the risk that prisoners would burn down the building.<br /> <br /> Most of the people held at Fort Vancouver's jail committed offenses such as theft or assault. For example, one employee was imprisoned a night in February 1848 for \"drunkenness and rioting.\" Alcohol played a role in many of these types of incidents. On a spring evening in 1846, a group of American moonshiners brought homemade whiskey to the fort to sell to Company employees. When a group of employees drank too much and couldn't work the next day, they were thrown in jail. Insubordination (refusing to do one's job) was a common offense as well. Deserters from trapping voyages were sent to Fort Vancouver, where they awaited punishment. Prisoners typically stayed at the jail only for short periods of time. Usually, they would then receive a fine, but more serious offenders were flogged or deported back to Canada or England. <br /> <br /> The jail was not a permanent part of Fort Vancouver until sometime in the early 1840s. Prior to the building's construction, rule-breakers were simply placed in iron shackles for a period of time. It is unclear why McLoughlin chose to build the jail when he did. However, it likely resulted from his son's murder at Fort Stikine in 1842, and his desire to prosecute those responsible. Of course crime occurred at Fort Vancouver from the very beginning, but recorded instances increased markedly in the 1840s. With an influx of American settlers and heightened competition for resources, the Jail saw more detentions for claim-jumping and theft. It was one of the few buildings that continued to be used into the 1850s and 60s. However, new development in the area made Fort Vancouver's Jail obsolete by 1866. It was then dismantled or burned down.",

The Kitchen sat behind the Chief Factor's House and was connected to it via a passageway, probably to prevent fires from spreading. Inside, cooks roasted, boiled, toasted, and baked in a large open fireplace with an oven attached. Preparing food in this way was a method inherited from centuries of European culinary tradition. It is possible the cooks also used an iron stove, which was becoming a more common piece of technology on the North American frontier in the 1840s. In addition to the cooking facilities, the two-story building also housed servants upstairs and had a large pantry or larder known as a dépense where food was kept. Over the years, the Kitchen building grew and shrank; the reconstructed Kitchen you see today is based on how it looked in 1845, when it was at its largest.<br /> <br /> The quality of the food prepared by Fort Vancouver's cooks varied from year to year and cook to cook. In 1837, visitors raved about the fare. The \"bountiful table\" included fresh vegetables, melons, bread, butter, cheese, soup, roast duck, roast turkey, boiled salmon, boiled pork, puddings, pies, and much more. But just the next year, a guest remarked, \"We have seldom anything good to eat, and when we have, it is generally so badly cooked, as to be uneatable.\"<br /> <br /> Cooks came and went frequently; the job had a high turnover rate. New cooks often lacked experience. Records show that for long periods of time Fort Vancouver did not even employ a designated cook. It can only be assumed that common laborers took on the task, sometimes with less-than-satisfactory results. Cooks were paid slightly more than other positions - in 1846, one employee made £22 per year as a cook, up from £17 per year as a common laborer - but much more was demanded from them. In addition to preparing meals, cooks also worked as servants for the gentlemen they fed. They assisted in their daily routines: heating water for shaving and bathing, sweeping and tidying their rooms, and brushing the dirt off their shoes. It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that Fort Vancouver had such a hard time holding on to good cooks.",

    "bodyText": "The north end of this parking lot at the intersection of Hatheway Road and Fort Vancouver Way was once the location of Vancouver Barracks' Sutler's Store.<br /> <br /> Until the late 19th century, the U.S. Army awarded sales commissions to civilian traders, known as sutlers. Each post or regiment was authorized to appoint one. Described as \"a combination of saloon keeper and general store operator,\" the sutlers supplied troops with goods and food to supplement army rations.<br /> <br /> The first sutler at Vancouver Barracks was Elisha Camp, who came with the 4th Infantry in 1852. By all accounts, Camp ran a profitable enterprise selling diverse items such as coffee, flour, liquor, tobacco, crockery, wool socks, and toothbrushes. However, after less than a year in Vancouver, his store mysteriously \"exploded.\" Camp returned to the East Coast leaving behind at least one unhappy investor: a young Brevet Captain named Ulysses S. Grant. A successor soon rebuilt the store, and the sutler tradition continued until being replaced by Vancouver Barracks' post canteen, the first in the military.",

    "bodyText": "\"The men are busily employed in sinking the old well near the granary, and in digging another one in the opposite end of the fort, near the new Bake House.\" - Thomas Lowe, Hudson's Bay Company clerk, February 27, 1845.<br /> <br /> While the nearby Columbia River provided a reliable source of fresh water, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) excavated several wells within the stockade that provided water more conveniently to fort employees and guests. Historical accounts suggest that the employees preferred river water but found the taste of well water not \"unwholesome.\"<br /> <br /> The HBC constructed this well in 1845, and it is the only surviving structure of the HBC Fort Vancouver still visible above ground. Excavations by archaeologist Louis R. Caywood found that water-rounded boulders, some of them estimated to weigh 400 pounds, line the entire well shaft to below the water line, which is 30 feet below the ground surface.<br /> <br /> It is not known if there was a structure covering the well. A historic photograph of the fort suggests that there was a well sweep pole rising up from behind the fort's Bachelor's Quarters, to the south of the Chief Factor's house. This reconstructed well sweep is a typical design for the time period. Historic photos also suggest that there was another possible well, with a hydrant-like mechanism set on a wooden cover on the other side of the nearby Bachelor's Quarters building. The structures built over these wells are assumed to have been aspects of a fire protection system.",
    "audioDescription": "In the middle of a paved path area is a raised square wooden platform. On this platform is a metal grate through which you can look down into the remaining well shaft. A wooden bucket sits on the platform. On a grassy area nearby is the reconstructed well sweep - a large wooden pole attached to another wooden pole which could be used as a lever.",

Some seventy officers who attained the rank of general were stationed here, including Ulysses S. Grant, Philip H. Sheridan, George B. McClellan, George Pickett, George Crook, Oliver O. Howard, and Nelson Miles. Later, it served as a recruitment, mobilization and training facility for the Spanish-American War, the Philippine War, and other foreign engagements.<br />  </p> <p height=\"normal\">During World War I, Vancouver Barracks was the principal district for the U.S. Army Signal Corps' Spruce Production Division and the site of the world's largest lumber mill. In 1925, the Army established Pearson Field at the post, initiating a sustained role in aviation history. In the 1930s, the post became the district headquarters for the Ninth Corps of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and, under the command of General George C. Marshall, played an important role in the enrollment, training, and supply of the Pacific Northwest's network of CCC camps. During World War II, Vancouver Barracks served as a training center and staging area for the Portland Subport of Embarkation.</p> <p height=\"normal\">After World War II, the Army reduced its presence at Vancouver Barracks. In 1948, portions of barracks acreage transferred to the National Park Service for the creation of Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. By 1949, the post included the headquarters of the Sixth Army's Northern Military District and served as home of the 104th Division (Reserves).<br />  </p> <p height=\"normal\">Today, Vancouver Barracks remains one of the nation's most historic military posts, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Although the boundaries and surrounding scenery have changed significantly, the central core of the original Vancouver Barracks remains. Thanks, in part, to more than 160 years of Army presence and stewardship, this significant place in our nation's history is well prepared for transfer to the National Park Service, where it will be preserved in perpetuity for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of future generations.<br /> <br /> Learn more about visiting Vancouver Barracks <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/fova/learn/historyculture/vb.htm\">here</a>.</p>",

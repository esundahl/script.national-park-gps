    "bodyText": "Big Spring was one of Missouri's first state parks. It was a state park from 1924 until 1969 when the people of Missouri donated it, along with Alley and Round Spring State Parks to the National Park Service to become a part of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. A gift from Missouri to America.<br /> <br /> The Big Spring area contains the Big Spring of course, but also a campground, a picnic area, a dining lodge, trails and housekeeping cabins. The area is known as the CCC historic district as many of the structures were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps when it was a state park. <br /> <br /> The Big Spring is sometimes called America's biggest spring. In reality there are three contenders for that title: Big Spring, Idaho's Snake River Spring Complex and Florida's Silver Spring. Since the flow from springs varies with local rainfall, any of these three might be biggest on any given day depending on the weather in Missouri, Idaho and Florida! The truth is they are all about the same size.<br /> <br /> In any case, at an average daily flow of 286 million gallons of water, Big Spring is an awesome sight and a geologic wonder. Underground passages carry water from as far as 45 miles away to emerge at the spring. Studies have shown that the water is carrying a load of dissolved limestone equivalent to 70 tons a day! This dissolved rock gives the spring its color and is also carving out a huge conduit underground. Should the spring ever go dry, a huge cave will be the result.<br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "Toward the spring a large volume of blueish water is pouring out of the base of a grey rock bluff. White caps on top of the water exist due to the viscosity. A small cave sits above the spring at the end of the stone walkway. Green manicured grass is on the left and right of a stone trail leading from the parking lot to the right of the spring. Large canopy trees line the spring with green moss on the large boulders that surround the spring. A brown metal bench is to the left overlooking the spring pool.",

    "bodyText": "Contributing a staggering 90 million gallons of water daily to the Current River, Blue Spring ranks 6th largest in the state of Missouri. Once called the “Spring of the Summer Sky”, it displays a vivid deep blue color that is attributed to its depth and mineral content. The color changes hue based on storm run-off and amount of available light penetrating its surface. At 310 feet it is the deepest spring in the state.<br /> <br /> For perspective, the Statue of Liberty could be placed in the spring and only her torch would be visible above the surface. Early surveyors tried to measure the spring by tying an anvil to a rope and lowering it down into the spring’s depths. At a certain point, pressure caused the anvil to hover rather than sink further, so surveyors kept feeding vast amounts of rope and concluded the spring was bottomless. The 17-acre area around the spring is designated as a Missouri Natural Area for its outstanding biodiversity and aesthetic beauty.<br /> <br /> This natural area is managed by the Missouri Department of Conservation, while the Current River and surrounding area are administered by the National Park Service, as part of Ozark National Scenic Riverways.  ",

He frequently ground corn free for neighbors \"on starvation,\" i.e. those who could ill afford to leave him the customary toll of grain.</p> <p>Klepzig Mill is a type of building referred to in the vernacular as a \"sawmill house.\" It was a building type that tended to replace log construction after the arrival of sawmills in a locale. A sawmill house could be erected quickly and by only one or two people. Instead of stud-wall framing, vertical planks were nailed to a hand-hewn sill at the bottom and a sawn two-by-four plate at the top. The resulting wall panels, fabricated flat on the ground, were then raised into place. Battens might then be added to cover the seams. Foundations were often piers of uncut and un-monitored native stone.</p> <p>Klepzig Mill is not much to look at with its various accouterments and modifications-- cement spillway, scrap metal hinge from the hood of a Model \"A\" Ford truck, old corrugated iron roof. Still, it is in a spectacular setting, surrounded by the rhyolite rock of the \"shut in\" canyon made by Rocky Creek. It is a lasting testament to the hardships of every day life in the Ozarks in a time not so long ago.</p> <p>To reach Klepzig Mill take Highway H (east of Eminence and Winona) to Highway NN. You'll pass the sign for Rocky Falls, this is a pleasant stop also. Turn left on County Road #522. This can be muddy during the rainy season and is narrow, not recommended for large motorhomes or trailers. Klepzig Mill is less than a mile on the right. There is no sign or defined parking area, and it's easy to miss in summer vegetation, so watch carefully. It is also possible to hike to Klepzig Mill from Rocky Falls along the Ozark Trail, or park at the end of the pavement on NN and walk up the dirt road. (Don't block traffic!)</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A wooden structure, unpainted and weathered stands with a dull silver tin roof on top of a rock outcropping. A clear creek flows between large outcroppings of grey colored rocks. The stream is constricted so it is flowing pretty swift but not deep. A dirt path leads to the building from the main gravel road where you park. Another building not as big as the main building is around 200 ft back up the road. It is also weathered unpainted wood but has a never shiny tin roof.",

    "bodyText": "<p>A natural cascading waterfall is a rare sight in Missouri. Few places in the Ozarks provide a glimpse of earth’s turbulent past as well as Rocky Falls. The reddish-brown rock you see here is rhyolite porphyry. It formed as molten rock deep within the earth and flowed onto the surface about 1.5 billion years ago. At the time, no living thing existed to see the awesome flow of glowing hot lava slowly advancing over the barren landscape.</p> <p>Normally, a stream eroding softer dolomite, a type of limestone, would make a wider valley for itself. Since the rhyolite is harder, the stream tends to stay within whatever cracks that it finds, deepening them only a little by erosion. Thus a“shut in” is formed where the harder rock has “shut in” the stream. Farther downstream, past the constricting rhyolite, the stream valley widens once again. This allows the stream to expand into a pool.</p>",

However, the Ozark National Scenic Riverways allows many things not commonly allowed in other National Parks; for instance, hunting is allowed and so is the gathering of certain wild berries and nuts. <br /> <br /> The following is not a comprehensive list of park rules and regulations but a good quick reference. For a more complete list please see the </strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/ozar/learn/management/ozark-national-scenic-riverways-superintendent-s-compendium.htm\">Superintendent's Compendium.</a> <h4><strong>River Rules:</strong></h4> -Lashing of tubes or vessels together is prohibited.<br /> <br /> -Jumping or diving from trees or rope swings is prohibited.<br /> <br /> -Glass is prohibited in vessels prone to capsizing, i.e. kayaks, canoes, tubes and non motorized vessels.<br /> <br /> -One Personal Floatation Device must be on board per person on vessels less then 16ft in length. <br /> <br /> -Children under 7 years of age must wear a Personal Floatation Device at all times while in a vessel.  <h4><strong>Campground Rules:</strong></h4>  <span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">-For camping reservations call 877-444-6777 or visit recreation.gov</span> <p><br /> -Check in time 1 p.m., Check out time 12 p.m.<br /> <br /> <strong>Camping Occupancy:</strong><br /> <strong>Family Sites</strong> (6 people max + 2 tents+ 2 cars <strong>or</strong> 1 tent & 1 camper)<br /> <strong>Cluster Sites</strong> (7-25 people + 6 tents + 4 cars)<br /> <strong>Group Sites </strong>(7-45 people + unlimited tents- No RV's)<br /> <strong>Electric Sites</strong> (RV/Camper + 1 car + 1 tent + 6 people max)<br /> <br /> -Camping is allowed in designated camping areas only.<br /> <br /> -Floaters can opportunistically camp on any gravel bar as long as they are not within 1/2 mile of a designated campground. <br /> <br /> -Camping within 50ft of a river access, landing or mouth of a cave is prohibited.<br /> <br /> -Drive in or hike in campers must camp at designated camping areas within the park.<br /> <br /> -Be mindful of quiet hours 10 pm - 6 am and respect your neighboring camps.<br /> <br /> -<strong>Please do not bring firewood!</strong> Moving firewood around the country helps spread forest pests like the Emerald Ash Borer and Gypsy Moth. You can gather dead and down wood around the park or buy local firewood close to the campgrounds. Burn it where you buy it! Don't take excess firewood home with you either.<br /> <br /> -Hammocks are prohibited from developed campgrounds when lashing to a tree, self-standing hammocks are allowed. <br /> <br /> <strong>-Camping is limited to 14 consecutive days.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>-ATVS/UTVS/GOLF CARTS </strong>are prohibited from operating in the campground.</p> <h4><br /> <b>Archeological and Historical Artifact Removal:</b> </h4> -The riverways area has many sensitive archeological, cultural, and historical sites protected by the National Park Service. Removing archeological or historical objects from where they reside is prohibited by the Federal Archeological Resources Protection Act and the Antiquities Act. In order to better understand the history of the riverways, artifacts must be studied by researchers in their natural setting and context. If you see an artifact that you believe to be in danger of theft, please tell a ranger so the park’s archeologist can be notified. Please do not remove archeological or historical objects from the park. Digging or searching for these objects is specifically prohibited by Code of Federal Regulations.  <h4><br /> <strong>Caves and Caving: </strong></h4> -All Caves are CLOSED in Ozark- NSR to help stop the spread of White Nose Syndrome, except for Round Spring Cave, which is open daily Memorial Day-Labor Day for public tours. <h4><br /> <strong>Swimming and/or Wading in Springs:</strong></h4> -Park springs are delicate ecosystems.

    "bodyText": "<p>Over the years, Ozark springs have been used as campsites, power supplies for grist mills, tourist resorts and even hospitals.</p> <p>Hospitals? Yes, hospitals. Back in 1913, an Illinois doctor named C.H. Diehl bought Welch Spring for eight hundred dollars. Dr Diehl believed that the spring water had healing properties and that cool, pollen free air coming from the adjacent cave would be beneficial for people with asthma, emphysema, and tuberculosis, which together were called \"consumption\" at the time. He said that it worked for him, helping him with a chronic case of hayfever. To tap this clean air resource, Dr Diehl built a hospital over the mouth of the cave. Welch Spring, which flows from the cave, was dammed up so that water would close off the entrance. This was to force more air out through the cave opening into the hospital. In today's terms, it might be better called a \"health spa\" since there wasn't much in the way of formal medical treatment, just an invitation to breathe the fresh air of the cave.</p> <p>Dr Diehl was not blind to the scenic values of the region either. He hoped to run a thriving campground resort to supplement his medical fees with tourist dollars. In time his healing resort expanded to a few small cabins, a campground, a show cave and he even had an electric generator running off the spring. Visitors came from the local area and from as far off as Oklahoma and Illinois, but times were hard and travel to such remote places still difficult.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the hospital and resort were not a big success. Roads in the Ozarks were rough and unpaved, making it difficult to get into the Current River Country. Few tourists were willing to make the trip. The good doctor died in 1940, and his family did not have much interest in keeping up the resort afterwards, which soon fell into ruin.</p> <p>Was Dr Diehl just a man ahead of his time? In time, tourists did discover the Current River, over a million come to canoe, camp, hike and fish every year. As for his medical ideas, he wasn't out of step with his times. Many people at the time believed in the healing qualities of cave air and spring water. It was almost a cliché for people to take a vacation to \"take the waters\" at one spring centered resort or another. This was the heyday of the healing spas at Hot Springs, Arkansas among others. Years earlier a tuberculosis sanitarium had been built in Mammoth Cave, some three hundred feet underground. The hospital is a ruin today, but still stands next to the beautiful Welch Spring.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A natural grey stone path is leads to a turbulent pool of blue water gushing from a grey cliff overhang to your right. On top of the cliff is green trees and vegetation. To your left is Current River, clear, flowing back toward you. Across the spring pool is a two story structure made of natural brown rock. Where windows used to exist are in the brown rock on both levels.",

Since this area belonged to the War, Jefferson Davis. Davis agreed to allow a light to be placed with conditions that \" the light shall be placed upon the wharf and not within any of the fortifications; and the light keeper shall be subordinate to the military command of the post and public ground in all that relate to police and discipline. If the care of the light can be placed with the Ordnance Sergeant, it will prevent interference with his present charge of other public property.\" With this permission the Lighthouse Board appropriated $500 for a light. This first light was an 18.5-foot iron post, which was placed November 7,1857. </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{215}\" paraid=\"1587903521\">The 1857 light pole remained until the 1870's when growth of the wharf caused obstruction to the light pole. A small 16-foot tower was built closer to the water's edge to replace to light pole. This was considered the first \"real\" lighthouse and a sixth order illuminant lens was placed in the tower. </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{221}\" paraid=\"1996703945\">The current tower was built in 1889 as the Fog Bell Tower.  In 1901 the light was moved to the tower, due to the surrounding area overshadowing the “real” lighthouse.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{fab6dc90-e817-49a9-98df-5048faf46c82}{229}\" paraid=\"1672031331\">In 1954, the light was changed to unmanned automatic flashing red light. During the years that followed the wharf and all buildings associated with the lighthouse were removed. The light/fog bell tower is all that remains of a once active light station. Sometime during the late 1970's the fog bell mechanism broke, ending the bell ringing at Fort Washington. In 2020, the United States Coast Guard, removed the triangle red marker and light to the river, ending a more than a century of active duty. The tower remains standing in its original place.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The 32-foot tower is trapezoidal with the base being 16 feet and the top 4 feet. The wooden tower is painted white and is sitting on four grey brick pillars at the corners that are about 2 feet tall. There is a four-foot chain link fence around the lighthouse. The north and south sides of the light has a “ghost” image of the triangle marker that used to be on the tower and removed in October 2020. The west side of the lighthouse has two small windows on in the middle near the right edge and the other close to the top in the center, below a ridge that is part of the top of the lighthouse. The north side of the light has a small window on the left side of the light about midway up the tower. Above the ridge is a shelf that is attached to the tower that was for the light prior to its removal. There is a stack of wood under the tower, to add support to the structure until it can be repaired.",

    "bodyText": "American coastal defenses were modernized from the 1890s to 1910 with the developement of the Endicott System. Emphasis in military tactics shifted the masonry forticications to more effective weapons based on rifled steel guns, improved breech-loading systems, better propellants (gunpowder), and reinforced concrete gun emplacements.<br /> <br /> Here you will see the remains of Bettery Decatur, a reinforced concrete emplacement completed in 1891. It mounted two 10-inch dissapearing guns similar to the Fort Monroe rifled gun shown in the photographs below. The lower rooms of the battery were for shot, shell, and powder storage with cranes and hoists that moved the heavy ammunition up to the gun platforms.<br /> <br /> Ingenious disappearing carriages used recoil energy to lower the gun out of sight of the enemy for reloading and servicing. These 10-inch guns had a firing range of approximately seven miles.<br /> <br /> The guns were aimed and fired by means of complex range finding and fore control equipment centered in the Battery Commander's Station, visable to your left. This Depression Position Finder, mounted in the tower, located the target exactly.",

A British squadron slowly making its way up the Potomac expected resistance from the well-positioned fort. Alexandrians, fearing they were next after Washington's fall three days before, expected protection from the fort.<br /> <br /> Samuel Dyson, U.S. Army captain in command decided his 45-man garrison would be no match for the British. He ordered the fort destroyed and was later court martialed for his decision.<br /> <br /> Defenseless Alexandria negotiated surrender, and the British confiscated tobacco and other property. As the enemy withdrew down the Potomac with their prizes, angry Americans shot from shore and dispatched fire-ships with little effect.<br /> <br /> Welcome to Fort Washington's Waterside Trail<br /> <br /> Living where the land meets the water gives us everything we need: shelter in the woods, food to eat, and clean water to drink. Our climate promises a good life for the 15 million people and the more than 3,000 types of plants and animals that live in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Certain soils and plant roots soak up much of the 30-40 inches of rain we receive each year. Leaves also absorb water, and forests slow a hard rain’s fall to earth. Woodlands shade the streams, and their roots hold stream banks in place. Pine trees and hardwoods layered over flowering shrubs, berry bushes, and wildflowers provide food and shelter for birds, mammals, insects, and turtles- just to name a few. In the clean, cool water nearby, fishes and shellfish feast on aquatic plants, and become food for larger fish, birds- like the Bald Eagle -and people.<br /> <br /> When rivers flood, or when rain hits land without woodlands, fast running water takes everything in its path to the bay. Pollutants from our homes, yards, cars, and work also flow into the bay. To protect the water, plants, and animals that live here, ribbons of waterside (or riparian) buffers of forests line the rivers and streams. These waterside woodlands slow the erosion of soil and absorb extra nutrients, while also providing shelter and food for wildlife. Preserving even small sections of riparian habitat helps protect our largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay. <br /> <br /> As a river meets the ocean, a dynamic world of daily and seasonal changes in saltiness and temperature becomes the home to unique plants and animals. The rhythmic tidal changes work like an engine producing food, and decomposing matter. Winter storms tear wetland plants into food for fishes and all microscopic life. These tiny aquatic plants and single-cell animals grow in abundance when nutrients churn up from the bay floor and flow off the land. In the spring, many different types of ocean fishes swim up rivers to eat and lay eggs, and then return again to the salty ocean. In the warm waters of summer, crayfish and shellfish find food, and become food. Throughout the fall, millions of migratory birds come to the Atlantic Flyway to feed on the plants, nutrients, fishes, and shellfish. Throughout the year, each part of the ecosystem depends on another in a powerful dance of life. Walking on this trail, you will see some of the plants and Animals that make their home in waterside woodlands.",

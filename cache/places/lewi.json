    "audioDescription": "A rectangular sign sits on the edge of a grassy hill. Across the top of the sign is a green background with white text reading \"Bioswales: A River Friendly Filter.\" Below the sign is divided into four sections. In the top left section green text reads: \"Imagine building a parking lot for people visiting this park. Nearby is a salmon-bearing stream. You know that oil and other fluids will drip from cars and busses on to the lot. With an average rainfall of 70 inches a year, these pollutants will wash into the Lewis and Clark River. How would you build the lot to protect the fish and river?\" The box below in the bottom left reads: \"Finding a solution. Knowing that nature provides answers, you decide to create a series of low, marshy channels called bioswales. Bioswales, like wetlands, are filled with native plants that slow water run-off and build spongy soil to capture pollutants. By incorporating bioswales into your parking lot design, you have created two acres of wetland habitat, and the willows you planted now provide shade for juvenile coho salmon.\" beneath the text is a sketch picture of a coho salmon. The middle section of the sign has at the top a diagram of what a bioswale looks like, a dip in the land with plants growing on top labeled as native plants, below is a layer of dark rectangles labeled compost, and below that some thin lines labeled drain rocks. Below this diagram reads \"A typical bioswale consists of drainage channel with gently sloping sides filled with drain rock, compost and native vegetation. The bioswale is designed to maximize the time unclean water stays in the swale which aids in trapping pollutants and silt, keeping them from flowing into the river.\" In the bottom of the middle panel is a map of Netul Landing, labeling the parking lots to the left, the bus shelter to the right, and where the bioswales are in relation to the different roads and the Lewis and Clark river. A large \"1\" labels the first bioswale near Fort Clatsop road, a large \"2\" labels where the bioswale leads to, a Sediment pond, and a large \"3\" labels the outflow of the sediment pond. Below is the legend that describes each number label as follows: \"1. The polluted water flows into the bioswales where it is slowed down, filtered and absorbed into the ground.\" \"2. Excessive runoff then flows into the sediment pond, which further slows the water, allowing harmful sediments to drop to the bottom of the pond.\" \"3. During times of heavy rainfall, excess water fills the pond and then moves through the outflow, where it is filtered by gravel.\" The panel on the right side shows four photos, two are of plants with the first being Bulrush and the second of a blooming Nootka rose. The other two are of animals, the first of a frog on a leaf an the second of a butterfly on top of a flower. Text by the plant photos reads: \"Plants that do the work include common cattails, slough sedge, small-fruited bulrush, Oregon crabapple and Nootka rose.\" Text by the animal photos reads: \"This valuable habitat is now home to a wide range of wildlife, including Pacific chorus frogs, northern red-legged frogs, and tough skinned newts. Dragonflies and several species of butterfly visit the area.\"",

In the top left a cartoonized depiction of a candle, an open journal, and quill pen sit besides text to the left stating: What to do on a rainy stay. Amid the rainy winter weather, the Corps worked tirelessly, making crucial preparations for the return trip. Meanwhile, Captains Lewis and Clark drafted and redrafted their journals and maps, finally reaching a level of detail that would contribute to fields of studies for centuries to come. In the bottom left a photograph of two large pots, supported by wooden logs and stacked rocks above a fire, boil vigorously. Below it the title reads Salt. Three men were constantly at work making salt. Using five kettles, they boiled approximately 1,400 gallons of seawater to produce 3 bushels, 448 cups, for the preservation and flavoring of meat for the return trip. The bottom right square is divided into three sections. The top titled California Condor, Lewis wrote over two pages describing the \"beautifull Buzzard of the columbia.\" Measurements were taken from the beak to the toes to the wingspan. A photo of Lewis journals depicting a sketch of the California Condor is below. Below this is titled Moccasins. Moccasins often wore out after a couple of weeks. Sergeant Gass recorded 338 pairs were made at Fort Clatsop; roughly 10 pairs per explorer for the home trip. Below this are a pair of moccasins pencil sketched. To the right the bold title Maps is above the text: Clark's maps were later discovered to be nearly as accurate as any created today. Below is a photograph of Clark's maps of the mouth of the Columbia river's coastline. At the bottom seven small stylized pictures depict silhouetted figures. The first is a military captain on the front of a boat, the second waves crashing against rocks, the third an elk, the fourth a soldier infront of the walls of a log fort, the fifth an person sealing a box with a high-prow canoe in front of them, the sixth a quill pen in an ink well, and the seventh a person paddling inside a canoe.",

To the left of the writing are the pictures of two chinook baskets woven with vedar root and bark, the left basket is shaped like a storage pot, yellow-orange in hue with a black zig-zag pattern going through it. The basket on the right is large and open, with a repeating pattern of yellow-orange columns and black columns. On the top right of the sign is a photograph of William Clark's journal, showing his handwriting and its unfolded leather cover. Underneath are sketches of different plants made the expedition, one featuring Salal berry labelled with A's and B's to distinguish leaves from stem, and the other Oregon Grape. In the bottom left corner is a picture of the Oregon Grape flowering, and beside it a picture of the painting \"The Journal\" by Michael Haynes depicting an expedition member writing in their journal at night with the barge in the background.",

The top left section reads in bold red text: \"Great joy in camp we are in View of the Ocian, this great Pacific Octean which we have been So long anxious to See, and the roreing or noise made by the waves brakeing on the rockey Shores (as I Suppose) may be heard Disticly\" Captain Clark, November 7, 1805. To the right a paragraph in bold black text continues: In the COlumbia's mouth, the expedition's goal was still miles away. With thirty-one men, one woman, a child and a dog, the expedition arrived in the region on November 7, 1805. Able to see and hear the Pacific the Corps of Discovery would struggle against storms, steep slopes and canoe smashing logs for another 10 days before reaching the ocean. The map in the bottom left depicts the mouth of the Columbia river, Washington, and Oregon, with points one through five marked on it as well as a dot and text of where Fort Clatsop is located. To the right the five points are labeled. Point one: Dismal Nitch, November 10 to 14, 1805. The Expedition huddled on the shore trapped by storms and waves that turned logs as long as 200 feet. Point two: Station Camp, November 15 to 24, 1805. After finally making it around \"Point Disappointment\" the expedition made camp on a sandy beach in the mouth of the Columbia River. Point three: Clark's Exploration, November 19, 1805. Captain Clark carved the date and his name on a tree where he'd led a party exploring the coastline on the other side of the Columbia River. Point four: Crossing the Columbia River, November 26, 1805. The Columbia River's mouth was too dangerous to cross by canoe. The Expedition proceeded up the river to cross it by hopping a chain of islands. Point five: Salt Makers Camp, December 28, 1805 to February 13, 1806. Ocean water was boiled in large buckets to collect salt. Point six: Beached Whale. January 8, 1806. The Expedition bought from the Kilamix several gallons of oil and 300 pounds of blubber stripped from a whale whose skeleton Clark measured at being 105 feet in length. The picture that descends the right side of the sign depicts waves crashing into logs on a shoreline, twiggy tree silhouette hang over the rough scene of Dismal Nitch. At the bottom seven small stylized pictures depict silhouetted figures. The first is a military captain on the front of a boat, the second waves crashing against rocks, the third an elk, the fourth a soldier infront of the walls of a log fort, the fifth an person sealing a box with a high-prow canoe in front of them, the sixth a quill pen in an ink well, and the seventh a person paddling inside a canoe.",

The text below: The explorers' heavy and cumbersome dugout canoes were difficult to maneuver and were unstable in the wind, waves and rough water conditions of the mouth of the Columbia River. The explorers' often hugged the shores of the river due to the inability of their seamanship. Below the paragraph is a sketch of a dugout canoe, a log carved into a canoe shape.

    "audioDescription": "Across the top of this sign on a red background \"Fort Clatsop\" is written in stylized cursive. Below, the sign is split into two boxes. The left box is a print of a painting depicting Sacagawea, George Drouilliard, Lewis, and Clark standing outside the 50 foot wide, 15 foot tall, Fort Clatsop, with seven members of the Clatsop nation standing with them engaged in trading. Sacagawea holds a blue bead necklace out to one of the Clatsop nation members. On the right box is text and a diagram of the floorplans for Fort Clatsop. The text reads: \"Here, at the end of their westward journey, the 33 members of The Corps of Discovery spent four rainy months preparing for their return to St. Louis Missouri. The men built huts to protect themselves and their supplies. They named it 'Fort Clatsop' after the local Clatsop Indians. Nothing remains of the original fort. This 2006 replica is based on William Clark's journal descriptions and floor plan. Historians and archaeologists are fairly confident the original fort was located within yards of this site.\" The floorplan diagram of Fort Clatsop is a brown square divided into three rectangles on the left side and four on the right side with the middle being empty ground. The top left, left middle, and bottom left rectangles are all labelled the Enlisted Men's Quarters. The top of the diagram has a small opening labelled as the Gate to Spring, and below it a small box listed as the Sentry Box. At the bottom of the diagram a large opening is listed as the Main Gate. The top right rectangle is the Store Room, below is the Orderly Room, beneath is the Captains' Quarters, and the bottom right rectangle is the Charbonneau Family Quarters. Beneath the diagram is a final paragraph: \"Three sergeants and twenty-four men squeezed into three small enlisted men's quarters and the orderly room. Captains Lewis and Clark shared a room; as did interpreter Charbonneau, his Shoshone wife, Sacagawea, and their baby. Clark's slave, York, may have lived in the orderly room.",

    "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\">A notable landmark of the Pacific Northwest, Cape Disappointment was already named by the time Lewis and Clark reached the site in November 1805. Â The first known documentation of the site was in 1775 by Spanish explorer Bruno Heceta, who named it âBahia de La Asuncion,â or Bay of the Assumption. Â Then in 1788, British trader John Meares named it âCape Disappointmentâ when he mistakenly believed that the mouth of the Columbia River was only a bay.Â <br /> <br /> Meriwether Lewis laid eyes on the area in mid-November 1805 â he proceeded on by land while the rest of the Expedition sheltered at Dismal Nitch. Â He returned to camp on November 17 and Patrick Gass wrote in his journal, âThey had been round the bay, and seen where white people had been in the course of the summer; but they had all sailed away.â Â For this reason, Cape Disappointment had a different, unhappy meaning to the men of the Corps.Â <br /> <br /> Today, the Cape is a Washington State Park which pays tribute to the many different uses of the area, from military outpost during the Civil War and World War II, to iconic lighthouses. Hike through old-growth forest or around freshwater lakes, saltwater marshes and ocean tidelands. Gape at the breathtaking views. Launch your boat from Baker Bay. Benson Beach is a popular clam-digging destination, and fishers love to set up on the North Jetty to catch salmon and crab. The beaches at Cape Disappointment also lure kite-fliers, sand-castle builders and those who love to walk and explore. Â <br /> <br /> But be sure to visit the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center for numerous interactive displays. Standing high on the cliffs of the Cape, 200 feet above the pounding Pacific surf, the Center is filled with information, artwork, and film presentations about the Corps of Discovery. Â From April 1 to October 31, itâsr open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.<br /> <br /> Summer hours for the park are from 6:30 a.m. to dusk. A Washington State Park Discovery Pass is required; an automated pay station is on site. Â A separate fee is required for the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center. Â For more information, go to: http://parks.state.wa.us/486/Cape-Disappointment.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/486/Cape-Disappointment\">Cape Disappointment</a> is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> <br /> On November 14, 1805, while the expedition sheltered at Dismal Nitch, Lewis âconcluded to proceed on by land & find if possible the white people the Indians Say is below and examine if a Bay is Situated near the mouth of this river as laid down by Vancouver in which we expect, if there is white traders to find them.â On November 17, Lewis âreturned haveing travesed Haleys Bay to Cape Disapointment and the Sea Coast to the North for Some distance.â Gass remarked, âThey had been round the bay, and seen where white people had been in the course of the summer: but they had all sailed away.â The next day Clark and 11 others âwho wished to See more of the main Ocianâ made the trip to Cape Disappointment and the northern coastline, rejoining the main party at Station Camp on November 20.<br /> <br /> The cape was a notable maritime landmark of the Pacific Northwest, with the first known documentation in 1775 by Spanish explorer Bruno Heceta, who named it âBahia de La Asuncion.â British trader John Meares named it âCape Disappointmentâ in 1788, due to his mistaken belief that the mouth of the Columbia River was only a bay. The United States deemed Cape Disappointment strategically significant enough to base military fortifications there during the Civil War and World War II. Construction of a lighthouse was completÂ­ed in 1856. The decommissioned military fortification and lighthouse are now encompassed by the <a href=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/486/Cape-Disappointment\">Camp Disappointment State Park</a>, which includes a <a href=\"http://parks.state.wa.us/187/Cape-Disappointment\">Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center.</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>History</h3> Miserable and soaked to the skin, the Corps of Discovery had followed the shoreline of Grays Bay (Shallow Bay in the journals) for two days in an attempt to round modern day Point Ellice (Point Distress in the journals).Â At this point in their journey, they had run out of fresh food, and their clothes were quite literally rotting away. Getting around Point Ellice/Distress would have allowed them to meet up with one of the last trading ships of the season and refresh their supplies.<br /> <br /> What the Corps didnât realize, however, was that it was about to run into some of the journeyâs most treacherous moments. A fierce winter storm forced the Corps off the river on November 10, and pinned the group to a north shore cove consisting of little more than jagged rocks and steep hillside. Captain William Clark named the dreary spot âthat dismal little nitch.â For six stormy days, the group was trapped by fierce wind and high waves at the rocky shoreline. For only the second time in the expedition, Clark said he was concerned for the safety of the Corps.Â <br /> <br /> It would be five days later, on November 15, that a break in the weather finally allowed the men to move forward. Once the wind and river calmed, Clark ordered the canoes loaded as quickly as possible and the Corps was able to make it around Point Ellice/Distress. They landed on a sandy beach where they established Station Camp. They missed the trading ship, but eventually achieved their exploration goals.<br /> <br /> In the following years this site became a fish receiving station to support a cannery operation, and later a ferry landing and train station. Eventually in 1968 and 1969 the Washington Department of Highways demolished the ferry landing and constructed the Megler Rest Area in its place. The Megler Rest Area was renamed the Dismal Nitch Rest Area in 2005. <h3>Today</h3> Located on SR 401, ten miles south of Naselle, Washington, visitors will find interpretive wayside exhibits about the expedition, as well as a short trail that leads to the approximate location of Lewis and Clarkâs campsite. Great views of the Columbia River, birds, and the vibrant shipping lane are highlights of this site.<br /> <br /> Dismal Nitch<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"> is a </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"> on the </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> Â ",

Breathtaking scenery and hiking may be the main allure, but Ecola also provides opportunities for picnicking, tidepooling, surfing and wildlife observation.Â </p> <h3>History</h3> <p>Captain William Clark and 12 members of the Corps of Discovery traveled through what is now the park in 1806 in search of a beached whale near present-day Cannon Beach.Â Â Within the park you'll find a strand of shoreline now called Indian Beach, which was once home to several Tillamook villages. When passing through on January 8, 1806, William Clarkâs guide pointed out these village to the explorer.

    "bodyText": "<h3>History</h3> <p>Fort Clatsop was the winter encampment for the Corps of Discovery from December 1805 to March 1806. After finding a location that offered plenty of game and close proximity to the ocean, Clark sketched a preliminary site plan, and they began construction in early December. The fort was completedÂ by January 1stÂ and housed 32 men, oneÂ woman, a baby, and a dog. Joseph Whitehouse wrote that the officers named the fort \"after a nation of Indians who resided near us, called the Clatsop Nation.\" They spent the extremely rainy winter collecting supplies, making salt and leather, and preparing their maps and journals.Â <br /> <br /> After the expedition finally departed on March 23, 1806, Fort Clatsop gradually deteriorated. A reconstruction of the fort based on Clark's sketch was completed in 1955, but burned down in 2005. Today a second replica, completed in 2006, can be explored in the same location.</p> <h3>Today</h3> <p>Visitors can experience the newest replica of Fort Clatsop by walking through the rooms, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/trails.htm\">hiking the trails </a>around the area, chatting with costumed rangers, and participating in ranger-led programs during the peak seasons.<br /> <br /> The visitor center located at this site provides basic amenities and offersÂ a museum, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/learn/bookstore.htm\">bookstore</a>, and two films. Make sure to check in with a ranger at the visitor center prior to exploring the park to get a map, receive additionalÂ information, and pay any <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">park fees</a><br /> <br /> In the Summer time, between Memorial and Labor day, you can visit the Fort any time between 9 AM and 6 PM. In the off season the rest of the year the site is open from 9 AM to 5 PM.<br /> Â </p> Â  <p>Fort Clatsop is a<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Â </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a>Â on the<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Â </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a></p>",

They speak a Chinookan language and traded often with other people in villages up and down the river.

Rainwater flows from the roofâs gutter into a wooden trough supported at roof level by sections of tree trunks until it reaches the center of the illustrationâs rain garden. There, the water spills into a stream circling through the garden and flowing off the illustration to the left. Rain gardens purify water naturally. They are designed to hold rainwater for a short time and then slowly release it into the ground where plant roots, microbes, and soil remove pollutants from water before it flows into rivers and streams. The slow release also helps reduce runoff and replenish ground water. The native plants in the garden before you also provide habitats for tree frogs, squirrels, newts, and other animals living in the park. By directing clean water to forested wetlands, our rain garden helps conserve this precious resource for all. In places, the stream is edged with stones, and the ground is brown dirt mostly filled with vegetation in many shades of green. Some of the plants have blossoms or berries in pink, red, black, white, yellow, and pale purple. Against the overall illustration of the garden, sometimes highlighted in black-bordered circles, are some of the plants and animals that appear in the garden. The bottom quarter of the panel features 10 small black-bordered sections with additional watercolor illustrations of plants. Mammals include Douglas squirrel; Black tailed deer; Chickaree, also known as Douglas squirrel, and Vagrant shrew. Birds include Bald eagle, Winter wren, and Stellarâs jay. Reptiles & Amphibians include Rough skinned newt, Pacific tree frog, and Northwestern garter snake. Fish are represented by Chum salmon. Invertebrates include Variegated meadowhawk dragonfly, Common green darner dragonfly, Anise swallowtail butterfly, Wolf spider, Bumble bee, Carpenter bee, Carabid beetle. and Banana slug. Lichens, mosses, and fungi include Oyster mushroom, Orange peel fungus, Pixie cup lichen, Old manâs beard lichen, and Oregon state moss: kindbergia oregano. Create A Rain Garden! Installing a rain garden is fun. Ask your local Cooperative Extension Office for specifics about soil mix, garden size, and plants for your area. Oregon State University Extension Office assisted the park in creating this rain garden",

After being de-commissioned in 1947, this former military installation became a 618-acre Washington State Historical Park.<br /> <br /> Although often referred to as an early 20<sup>th</sup> century site, the history of the land upon which Fort Columbia sits goes back much further. Chinook Point, the setting of this historic fort, is within the accustomed territory of the Chinook Indian Nation and is designated as a National Historic Landmark for its historical significance over three centuries. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark passed through this area as well on January 9<sup>th</sup>, 1806. <h3>Today</h3> <br /> Fort Columbia Historical State Park features a self-guided interpretive walk that details the areaâs history, and visitors will find informational exhibits near the fortâs gun batteries. In addition to it's history, the area offers bird watching, miles of forested hiking trails, secluded beaches,Â wildlife viewing opportunities, and an interpretive center.Â Here, visitors will find exhibits focused on the history of Fort Columbia, including the areaâs early exploration, fur trade, and western settlement.Â A pass is required to enter the park.<br /> <br /> For more information on the park or to download a park brochure, visit their website at <a href=\"https://parks.state.wa.us/506/Fort-Columbia\">Fort Columbia Historical State Park</a>.",

    "bodyText": "In 1670, King Charles II granted a Royal Charter to âthe Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson Bayâ a corporation that would eventually come to be known as the Hudsonâs Bay Company. The Hudsonâs Bay Company, whose headquarters by the time of The Pig War was this building in London, shipped European trade goods and technology to North America, where they were sold to Native Americans for animal fur which was then resold in Europe and Asia, hence their corporate motto âPro Pelle Cutemâ which in latin means âA pelt for a skinâ. Unlike the corporations we are familiar with today, the Hudsonâs Bay Company fused governmental power, military capabilities, and diplomatic functions with its quest for profit. It operated throughout Canada and was especially powerful in the Pacific Northwest, where the Hudsonâs Bay Company was the most potent non-native force in the region in the early days of European colonization.<br /> <br /> The Hudsonâs Bay Companyâs global trading business and the strategies that made it successful relied upon a diverse workforce. Acquiring fur required Native American participation and the company hired Native American employees and carefully stocked trade goods that catered to Native American consumer preferences. Company operatives often married high ranking Native American women and their alliances helped encourage trade and cooperation; children of these cross-cultural marriages often worked for the Hudsonâs Bay Company, where they acted as cultural mediators who understood the needs of indigenous people and the companyâs commercial empire. In the Pacific Northwest, the company found itself short on labor and hired Hawaiian men as laborers, farmers, seafarers, and fur trade adventurers.<br /> <br /> The Hudsonâs Bay Company built a string of trading posts throughout the Pacific Northwest in the 1820s-1850s at a time when the United States and the British Empire both claimed the Oregon Country (the future states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Wyoming and Montana). These posts became centers for settlement, economic development, and imperial power at a time when few U.S. citizens inhabited the Oregon Country. It was only in the 1840s, as masses of U.S. emigrants used the Oregon Trail to settle in the Pacific Northwest that the Hudsonâs Bay Company and British imperial power were contested. When the Oregon Treaty of 1846 gave the states of Washington and Oregon to the United States, the Hudsonâs Bay Company was forced to wind down operations at its bases in Washington and Oregon, which included at one time parts of the future <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fova\">Fort Vancouver National Historic Site</a> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/whmi\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/lewi\">Lewis and Clark National Historical Park</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/nepe\">Nez Perce National Historical Park</a><br /> <br /> Still, the Hudsonâs Bay Company remained powerful within British territory; one way that they demonstrated this power was by founding a massive operation on San Juan Island. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/belle-vue-sheep-farm.htm\">Belle Vue Sheep Farm</a>, established in 1853, grew into a massive agricultural complex with over 4,000 sheep and more than a dozen Hawaiian and native employees. It was a Hudsonâs Bay Company pig that rooted through Lyman Cutlarâs potato patch on June 15, 1859, sparking the Pig War. During the joint occupation of San Juan Island, American Camp was established adjacent to Belle Vue Sheep Farm headquarters and the farm wound down operations on our island.<br /> <br /> Though the Hudsonâs Bay Company is no longer on our island, it remains a major corporation. No longer in the fur trade, it is now one of Canadaâs largest department stores. Itâs unique contribution to our regionâs history and to global history is crucial to understanding how San Juan Island developed.",

    "bodyText": "The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudsonâs Bay Company</a>'s (HBC) established their Honolulu agency offices in 1829. Hawaiians had been working in the Pacific Northwest since 1787 and over time became an increasingly pivotal part of the fur trading workforce. At this office, the HBC recruited Hawaiian workers, sold British goods and Pacific Northwest agricultural products, and resupplied its ships headed from Hawaii to China and American whaling ships which regularly stopped in Honolulu. By the mid 19<sup>th</sup> Century, the Honolulu Agency was a vital part of a global trading empire that encompassed London, North America, and Asia.<br /> <br /> Hawaiiansâ importance to the HBC can be seen in the writings of Chief Factor John McLoughlin who in 1830 asked the Honolulu agency to âSen[d] us as many of them [Hawaiians[ as possible.â These workers filled numerous vital positions for the HBC; many worked on its ships as sailors. Others, like the sixteen Hawaiians who landed on San Juan Island in 1853, were agricultural workers who grew crops and herded sheep. Still others served as construction workers whose labor helped establish fur trade outposts or as teamsters, carrying goods hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles to trade with Native Americans in the extensive network of fur trade forts that the HBC operated throughout the Pacific Northwest. It is estimated that by the mid-1800s, approximately 1/3 of the HBCâs Pacific Northwest labor force were Hawaiians.<br /> <br /> Hawaiians were hired on time-limited contracts that specified their pay and term of service. In 1844, a Honolulu newspaper claimed that âthey are generally engaged for a period of three years and gain $10 per month.â Though little documentation exists, it is likely that many of these migrant workers sent wages home to their families in Hawaii. Many Hawaiians regularly renewed their labor contracts and worked for decades in the Pacific Northwest either with the HBC or as independent settlers who homesteaded after leaving HBC employment. Hawaiian migrants also worked at other National Park Service sites that were once HBC establishments, such as <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/lewi\">Lewis and Clark National Historical Park</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fova\">Fort Vancouver National Historical Site</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/whmi\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a>. On San Juan Island place names like Kanaka Bay and Friday Harbor (named after a Hawaiian man who settled there whose English name was Peter Friday) and Eastern Oregon place names like Kanaka Creek, Kanaka Bar, Kanaka Glen, and the Owyhee River demonstrate the longstanding impact of Hawaiians in the Pacific Northwest.",

    "bodyText": "<h3>Middle Village History</h3> <p>Right along highway 101 on the north side of the Columbia River, east of Chinook, Washington, youâll find Middle Village, the site of a significant Chinook village. For thousands of years, the Chinook people have lived along the Columbia River and their home near the river's mouth was strategically located to provide abundant food, such as salmon and shellfish. In addition, the nearby forests were home to game animals and the grasslands and marshes provided ample materials for making shelter, clothing and trade and household goods. The river provided a way for Chinook traders to travel to the south shore and up and down the Columbia.</p> <p>They developed a sophisticated, rich culture and enjoyed great success as traders. The waterway near Middle Village became a virtual trade \"water highway.\" During the 10 years before Lewis and Clark arrived overland at the this spot almost 90 trade ships from Europe and New England are documented to have crossed the Columbia River Bar to trade with Native Americans. These ships brought metal tools, blankets, clothing, beads, liquor and weapons to trade for beaver and sea otter pelts. By the time the Corps reached the site, the Chinook's had moved to their winter village and this village was unoccupied.<br /> <br /> In 2005, archeologists found abundant physical evidence to support the importance of the site as a Chinook trade village. More than 10,000 artifacts were uncovered, including trade beads, plates, cups, musket balls, arrowheads, Indian fish net weights and ceremonial items. The European artifacts are from both before and after the Corps' visit in 1805, and attest to the vitality of the Chinook social and economic life at the site.</p> <h3>Station Camp History</h3> <p>The Corps spent just 10 days here, but used Middle Village as a departure point for an overland trek to their first view of the Pacific Ocean and an exploration of the area. Historians called the spot \"Station Camp\" because it wasÂ Clark's primary survey station to produce a detailed and accurate map of the mouth of the Columbia River and surrounding area. This was the most detailed and accurate map he made during the entire trip.</p> <p>OnÂ Nov. 24, 1805, the explorers desperately needed a winter campsite, one rich with game and near friendly tribes who would trade for supplies. To assist in deciding where the Corps should winter, the captains tookÂ <em>\"Solictations of every individual.\" </em>This includedÂ <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/york.htm\">York</a>, who was anÂ enslaved man,Â and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/sacagawea.htm\">Sacagawea</a>, aÂ Lemhi Shoshone womanÂ who was married toÂ Toussaint Charbonneau. The majority chose to cross to the south side of the Columbia River, near modern-day Astoria, Oregon, to build winter quarters, which soon would be known as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-clatsop-or.htm\">Fort Clatsop</a>.Â </p> <h3>Today</h3> <p>The Middle Village - Station Camp site focuses onÂ the ChinookÂ IndianÂ NationÂ history, as well as telling the story of early contact, the Corps',Â andÂ theÂ townÂ ofÂ McGowan. Middle Village - Station Camp was dedicated on August 18, 2012.<br /> <br /> The site is open during daylight hours. Check in at the visitor center at Fort Clatsop to pay any <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lewi/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">park fees</a> and get additional information.</p> <p><br /> Middle Village - Station Camp is a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/places.htm\">High Potential Historic Site</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a></p>",

Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{87}\" paraid=\"1198973493\">In 1806, there were four longhouses at NeCusâ, built mostly from cedar planks. Each was home to an extended familyâsome 100 people may have lived in the village.Â They caught fish, and when the tide was low, they gathered crabs, mussels, snails, and barnacles. Some men in the village hunted seals and sea lions. To walk down to the beach, they carved handholds in the rocky cliff.Â Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{143}\" paraid=\"1465818087\">White men and a Shoshone woman, members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, arrived at NeCusâ in January 1806 during a time of bounty and commotion: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/cannon-beach-oregon.htm\">a huge whale</a> had just washed ashore!Â Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{185}\" paraid=\"203910835\">The whale blessed them with enough food for themselves and to trade with their neighbors, Clatsop and Chinookan people. Nehalem people were hard at work boiling the whale for oil and cutting up the blubber, to prepare it to eat or sell.Â Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{ff467cca-a3c3-4df8-aa0d-f1c425566770}{213}\" paraid=\"348821851\">William Clark wanted to buy some of the whale blubber and oil, trading glass beads for it. He bought so much that some people might have wondered how he planned to carry it back. He did so with the help of others in his party, including Sacagawea. Maybe the people of NeCusâ Village were excited to have such a bustling town with so many visitorsâwhat an opportunity, what a big party! Maybe some children liked meeting all of the visitors from across the region. Older people may have been happy for an excuse to reunite with old friends. And maybe some people were just plain tired of smelling the rotting whale, even if they liked the taste of blubber.Â Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{2e553370-7fce-44b3-9d51-8197b92d1518}{12}\" paraid=\"154739475\">Whatever they felt, NeCusâ Village was the place to be that January.Â <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">âPivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.â</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>History</h3> Much of the Corps' stay on the North Coast was spent securing sustenance for the winter and provisions for the trip home.Â On December 28, 1805, the Lewis & Clark Expedition sent out a detachment of five men in search of a good place to make salt. The expedition, which had been wintering at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-clatsop-or.htm\">Fort Clatsop</a>, had run out and were in desperate need of more. Salt was important for meat preservation and thus for the crewâs survival on the trip back home. The rivers near the fort werenât salty enough, and so a better place had to be found. The men found an ideal spot on the Pacific Ocean approximately 15 miles from Fort Clatsop where they set up the salt processing camp.<br /> <br /> Making salt required a bit of planning and a lot of work. Sea water had to be collected and allowed to sit till the sand sank to the bottom. Then the men had to collect a large supply of firewood and build a stone furnace, on top of which they placed five kettles that had to boil 24 hours a day to produce the salt. Captain William Clark and few additional men joined the others at the salt works a little over a week later on January 9, arriving in the early afternoon. The group stayed at the salt works until February 20, when they left with 3.5 bushels (about 28 gallons) of âExcellent, fine, strong & whiteâ salt. <p>Â </p> <h3>Today</h3> Today, visitors can see the site believed to be the expeditionâs salt works. It was identified by a rock cairn and the testimony of Jenny Michel, born in 1816 to a Clatsop man who had pointed the place out to her when she was a child. According to her father, this was the place he had seen white men boiling water.<br /> <br /> The site is located on the Promenade. At the intersection of US Highway 101 and Avenue G, turn west to Beach Drive, then left to Lewis and Clark Way. Park where available without blocking private driveways. Walk west on Lewis and Clark Way to the Salt Cairn.<br /> <br /> <br /> Â ",
    "audioDescription": "Nestled between buildings on the Promenade, the salt works cairn sits inside a small stone courtyard surrounded by a brick and wrought iron fence. A plaque tells of the Lewis and Clark Expedition's time here at the site, and how Jenny Michel, born in 1816 and whose father remembered the white men, identified this site for the Oregon Historical Society in 1900, five years before her death.",

    "bodyText": "<p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{44}\" paraid=\"1181413004\">After reaching the Pacific Ocean, it was time to decide where to spend the winter. William Clark polled everyone on November 24, 1805, and tallied their votes in his journal.Â Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{72}\" paraid=\"401436884\">Clark recorded the vote of York, a Black man he enslaved. This was decades before Black men had the right to vote in the United States.Â Several years after the Lewis and Clark Expedition, York asked for his freedom. Clark denied his request. How meaningful was Yorkâs vote, if he still was not free?Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{108}\" paraid=\"1376804430\">Clark also asked Sacagaweaâs opinion on where to stay over the winter. Her vote was not tallied, but Clark made a note that she wanted to stay somewhere with lots of wapato, to make sure they had enough food for the winter.Â The group decision did not heed her concerns, but her point played out: they spent much of the winter trading with the Clatsop for <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/wapato.htm\">wapato</a> and other food. And their health suffered at times when they had only dried salmon or spoiled elk meat to eat.Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{166}\" paraid=\"1297852312\">Ultimately, Lewis and Clarkâs party decided to stay south of the Columbia River, where the Clatsop people lived and where there would be easy access to the ocean. The hunting would be good there, it was close to the ocean for salt-making, and they hoped the rain wouldnât be as bad.Â </p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{178}\" paraid=\"641365020\">Sacagawea voicing her opinion in 1805 gained more attention a century later. The womenâs suffrage movement used Sacagaweaâs input at Station Camp as a symbol of why women deserved the right to vote.Â That right came at the national level in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. However, barriers to suffrage still existed for people of color, including Indigenous women, until well into the twentieth century.</p> <p paraeid=\"{00e737c6-dcb6-4891-9fb9-f82c4adff94a}{218}\" paraid=\"1878192478\">Sacagawea and York gave their opinions to the White men leading the expeditionâan expedition that neither of them freely chose to join. But did their votes make a lasting difference for Black people, Indigenous people, or women?Â Â <br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of a series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">âPivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.â</a></p>",

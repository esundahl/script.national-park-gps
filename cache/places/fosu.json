While only foundations of the original barracks remain, the 1809 powder magazine still stands, enduring the American Civil War and several hurricanes. <br /> <br /> The magazine stored black powder to keep it safe, dry, and away from flame. The thick walls and solid brick traverse in front of the entrance helped protect the magazine in wartime. To protect the powder from fire, a lightning rod was erected and spark producing metals were kept out of the magazine. A traverse sits in front of the powder magazine. The traverse, a solid brick structure, protected the powder magazine from enemy artillery fire.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service has restored the magazine to its 1840 appearance. Visitors can walk inside the powder magazine and see replica powder barrels. ",

These new, breech-loading rifles each weighed 55 tons, had a range of 8.5 miles, and fired shells weighing 571 pounds. Rising above the parapet to fire, the rifle recoiled by moving back and down, \"disappearing\" behind the thick concrete walls to allow the crew to reload in safety. The rifle was raised and lowered by using a counterweight which rested in the deep center cavity of the gun mount. A well trained gun crew could fire the rifle once every 90 seconds. Battery Jasper's guns and carriages were scrapped in 1943. <br /> <br /> One gun emplacement on Battery Jasper is open to the public, showing the magazine, shell room, and gun deck above it. <br /> <br /> The powerhouse, the one-story brick building, on the north side of Battery Jasper is closed to the public. It housed two 25 kilowatt gas generators to supply power for Battery Jasper's lights, ammunition hoists, and other electrical needs.

Additionally, the intracoastal waterway provides homes to both shrimp and Atlantic blue crabs (of South Carolina she-crab soup fame!), they may also be caught if you are so inclined.  Fishing not your thing? There are several benches placed along the dock where you can sit and enjoy the natural beauty of Charleston and South Carolina. Watch a variety of birds, including great blue herons, white ibis, and roseate spoonbills searching for dinner in the marshy grasses. Overhead, you might catch a glimpse of a bald eagle or red-tailed hawk lazily circling the water. Relax and reflect on the history of Fort Moultrie and Charleston. ",

Additional structures included a mining casemate, magazine, cable tank storehouse, a mine wharf, and a tramway connecting all the structures. Most of the structures have been removed with the exception of the torpedo storehouse. <br /> <br /> Built in 1902, the torpedo storehouse was used to store equipment and empty mines. It stands as a reminder of Charleston Harbor's minefield. In 1918, the US Army Mine Planter Service was established and placed under the Coast Artillery Corps. Their mission was to install and maintain the minefields that were an integral part of coastal fortifications. Once the mines were placed, soldiers in mining casemates could electronically detonate them if enemy vessels approached. In Charleston Harbor, there were mining casemates located at Fort Moultrie and Fort Sumter.<br /> <br /> Today, the Fort Moultrie Torpedo Storehouse serves as the administrative headquarters for Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Historical Park and Charles Pinckney National Historic Site. It is open to the public by appointment. <br /> <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "William Moultrie was one of South Carolina's leading Patriots during the American Revolution. A man of power and substance, Moultrie was elected to the Commons House of Assembly. This would spark a political career that would last until 1794. Like many of his peers, Moultrie was a wealthy rice plantation owner, with about 200 slaves in his possession. By the 1775, relations with Britain had soured and Moultrie was elected to a Provincial Congress in South Carolina. By June of that year, he was made a colonel of the 2nd South Carolina regiment. <br /> <br /> Because there was no official flag for either the fledgling country or South Carolina, Moultrie designed his own regimental flag: a dark blue rectangle with a white crescent in the top left corner. By March of 1776, Moultrie assumed command of Fort Sullivan on Sullivan's Island. Work was underway to build a fort sufficient for 1000 men. This fort would be constructed of palmetto logs and sand, when the British arrived on June 28, 1776, it would still be incomplete. Moultrie would command his men in triumph against ten British warships. Several days later, in response to Moultrie's victory, the fortification on Sullivan's Island would officially be named Fort Moultrie. <br /> <br /> In 1780, now General Moultrie would be captured when the British returned to Charleston. After the war ended, Moultrie returned to politics, serving in the South Carolina House and Senate and as both lieutenant governor and governor. William Moultrie died in 1805 and was buried in the family cemetary. In 1977, archeaologists would discover Moultrie's resting place and in 1978, his remains would be moved to Sullivan's Island. Today you can visit General Moultrie's grave near the intracoastal waterway at Fort Moultrie. ",

    "bodyText": "Inside the walls of Fort Moultrie, visitors can explore a World War II era harbor defense structure. The joint Army-Navy installation was known as the Harbor Entrance Control Post - Harbor Defense Command Post (HECP-HDCP). Construction of the permanent concrete structure finished in March 1944, which replaced a temporary timber frame structure on the northwest bastion. <br /> <br /> The structure has three floors. On the ground floor, the offices housed the Duty Officers and Operations Room and the Message Center, while on the opposite side of the corridor were the HECP and Radio Rooms, Air Conditioning and CWS Room, and Heater Room. The second floor housed the Observation Post, and the Signal Tower was on the third floor. <br /> <br /> The missions of the structure were: to protect the harbor facilities and shipping from naval gunfire in event of enemy surface attack; to deny to enemy shipping access to the harbor; to support defense against an amphibious attack. ",
    "audioDescription": "A yellow camouflage colored concrete structure that houses 3 floors. The top floor is an open air signal tower with halyards for raising flags. The second floor is enclosed and has glass windows and served as an observation post. Outside and on the second floor, there is a searchlight. The ground floor, accessible from a flight of stairs from inside the fort or by ground level from the street outside of the fort, housed Army and Navy personnel.",

    "bodyText": "The forced exodus of West Africans to the New World often ended in Charleston, which served as the entry point for nearly half of the captive Africans shipped to North America. Although its main function was military defense, Sullivan's Island also had quarantine stations to protect the colony of South Carolina from deadly diseases. Between 1707 and 1799, four \"pest houses\" were constructed on Sullivan's Island, though never more than one existed at the same time. These \"pest houses\" were used to quarantine enslaved passengers who arrived to the New World carrying infectious diseases. Although the exact locations are unknown, all were built between Fort Moultrie and the western end of the island.<br /> <br /> Approximately, 2 million Africans died during the Middle Passage through various means. Harsh conditions, violent treatment and even the taking of their own lives all contributed to deaths of these enslaved captives. The Bench by the Road serves as a reminder for those Africans captured in the slave trade, whose lives were forever changed. The Bench by the Road can be found near the intercoastal waterway behind the Fort Moultrie Visitor Center. Take a moment to stop and reflect on the enslaved people who made the journey from Africa to Charleston and on those who lost their lives during this arduous journey.<br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The Bench by the Road is made of black steel slats perpendicular to the ground with two curvy metal slates running across the other slats. There is a small bronze plaque attached to the bench that reads: \"A Bench By The Road Placed by the Toni Morrison Society, Sullivan’s Island, South Carolina, July 26, 2008.” A second bronze plaque is centered on the ground in front of the bench and reads, “A Bench By The Road. There is no place your or I can go, to think about or not think about, to summon the presences of, or recollect the absences of slaves; nothing that reminds us of the ones who made the journey and of those who did not make it. There is no suitable memorial or plaque or wreath or wall or park or skyscraper lobby. There’s no 300-foot tower. There’s no small bench by the road. Toni Morrison 1989. The bench by the Road Project was launched by the Toni Morrison Society in honor of Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison. This first bench is placed in memory of the enslaved Africans who perished during the Middle Passage and those who arrived on Sullivan’s Island, a major point of entry for Africans who entered the U.S. during the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Nearly half of all African Americans have ancestors who passed through Sullivan’s Island, July 26, 2008 Toni Morrison Society, Inc.” ",

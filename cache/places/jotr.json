After abundant winter rains, this trail offers a vibrant springtime display of wildflowers. <br /> <br /> For more information on wildflowers, visit our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jotr/planyourvisit/blooms.htm\">Wildflower Viewing Page</a>. <br />  ",

The trail begins in a sandy wash then ascends a rocky mountainside to the mine. The hike features expansive views of the surrounding mountains and a chance to view mining artifacts used a century ago. Do not handle or remove any historic artifacts from the site. <br /> <br /> This trail is a great option if you are looking to get away from the crowds and enjoy more solitude. After abundant winter rains, this trail offers a vibrant springtime display of wildflowers. <br /> <br /> For more information on wildflowers, visit our <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/jotr/planyourvisit/blooms.htm\">Wildflower Viewing Page</a>. ",

    "audioDescription": "A small parking lot connected to Pinto Basin Road leads to the Turkey Flats area. There is an informational sign that provides details about the area next to the parking lot. The ground is a mix of compact and loose sand, with desert grasses, creosote bushes, and small desert shrubs. Turkey Flats is located in a basin between two mountain ranges to the East and West. The land slopes gradually towards a lower elevation in the southern direction and towards a higher elevation in the northern direction.",

Between the late 1800s and early 1900s, the valley was used by cattle rustlers looking to stay “hidden”. As you hike the trail, look for Cow Rock, a cow-shaped rock formation on a wall overlooking the valley. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9296a7fe-185c-4ce3-b578-0e633a2bc16b}{202}\" paraid=\"335400349\">The trail is considered easy but there are stairs and rock steps at the beginning and ending of the trail. This is a popular hike, and on busy days, the parking lot can fill up quickly. We recommend starting this hike by 9 am during busy weekends and holidays.

This leads to the fairly regular spacing of individual plants. Two Joshua trees growing near one another are likely the same individual, connected underground through networks of thin roots. Joshua trees store water in their trunks and branches, making them quite heavy during wet years and prone to tipping over or dropping branches. Take care not to climb on or attach ropes or hammocks to Joshua trees, despite their solid appearances they can be easily toppled.   </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Keys Ranch was built in 1910 and lived in by William and Frances Keys along with their children for over 60 years. Having first moved to the desert in search of gold, William Keys started this ranch as he built up a life for himself with mining and ranching. In 1917, Frances married and joined William at the ranch where they started a family and continued to build up the ranch. By not letting anything go to waste and figuring out how to reuse old parts they were able to build a prosperous ranch and mining operation in a seemingly hostile environment.<br /> <br /> Keys Ranch is only open to guided ranger led tours that require advance registration. Check the park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/jotr/planyourvisit/ranchtour.htm\">website</a> for additional information on visiting Keys Ranch..</p>",

The main building is a two story home while the other buildings are one story. There are the remains of fences, pipes, windmill, water tanks, vehicles, and other equipment scattered around the area. The area contains a mix of scattered Joshua trees, small trees, and shrubs.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Lost Horse Mine was one of the few successful mining operations of the more than 300 mines in what is now Joshua Tree National Park. The mining rights were originally purchased by Johnny Lang for $1,000. Realizing for safety that he needed more people in such a remote location, Lang brought in three partners before they were ultimately bought out in 1895 by J.D. Ryan, a wealthy rancher from Montana. From 1894 to 1931 the mine produced more than 10,000 ounces of gold and 16,000 ounces of silver (worth approximately $5 million today).<br /> <br /> According to legend, the day shift was producing significantly more than the night shift so Ryan hired a private investigator to figure out what was happening. Upon discovering that Lang was pocketing half the ore for himself, Ryan forced Lang to decide between selling out or going to jail. Ultimately Lang sold his share and moved his prospecting to a nearby canyon.<br /> <br /> In 1905, miners hit a fault and lost the vein of ore forever. Over the next couple of decades the mine changed hands several times and went through long periods of inactivity before ultimately becoming a part of Joshua Tree National Monument in 1936.<br /> <br /> Today, the Lost Horse Mine can be reached on the Lost Horse Mine Loop Trail as part of a four mile out and back hike with 550 feet of elevation or as part of a longer loop for those that want a longer hike. Fences have been placed around the mine for safety, do not try to cross the fence and enter the mine as the area is unstable. Historic structures may seem safe but can easily crumble under a person's weight. Do not be fooled by appearances! Lost Horse Mine is a unique place and an important part of Joshua Tree's history. Please protect this place and report graffiti and other vandalism to <a href=\"mailto:JOTR_Graffiti@nps.gov\">JOTR_Graffiti@nps.gov</a>.</p>",

The area has scattered remains of walls, debries, and two water tanks above the wooden structure. Shrubs and rocks are scattered throughout the area.

    "audioDescription": "The Cottonwood Visitor Center sits on a high desert plateau in the transition zone between the Mojave and Colorado deserts. To the northeast, Eagle Mountain stands lofty as a rugged backdrop. Weather can be extreme. Summers are blistering, with bright sunny weather and temperatures exceeding 100 degrees daily. Winters are cool to cold, with strong winds and sub-freezing nights. Snow is possible. The occasional rainstorm poses the threat of flash flooding. There is abundant flora and fauna nearby. Desert wilderness surrounds the visitor center. Around the building we find short desert plants. There are cacti and various flora with thorns and sharp points. Cat’s-claw acacia and many of the shrubs can be unforgiving if brushed up against. There are also plants native to the Mojave, such as yucca, juniper, and sage. In spring, red berries appear on the purple bush. Prince’s Plume are adorned with yellow flowers. The ironwood trees near the Bajada Nature Trail sprout pink and purple flowers. After a rain, the Ocotillo grow red flowers and green leaves. The Prince's Plume, ironwood trees, and Ocotillo are native to the Colorado desert. Gambel’s Quail call out throughout the day, often scurrying around the parking lot. Mule deer, coyotes, and even bighorn sheep frequent the nearby landscape. Throughout the day ravens and turkey vultures soar overheard. Black-tailed jackrabbits nervously hop along, as a red-tail hawk eyes it’s next prey from the sky. In the warmer months, rattlesnakes and desert tortoise roam the nearby sandy trails. There are three one-story buildings that comprise the visitor center facilities: The visitor center, a restroom, and a staff office. From the parking area, the visitor center is located to the left. The restroom is situated to the right of the visitor center and 30 feet across from the parking lot. The men’s restroom is located on the left side of this building, and the women’s restroom is located on the right side. There are picnic tables and bulletin boards between the restrooms and the office to the right. The visitor center also serves as a gift shop and fee-entrance station. The door is located on the south side of the building. As you enter, there is a brochure table 6 feet from the inside of the door. On the right side of the building you will see interpretive panels with information about the geology, history, and geography of Joshua Tree National Park. On the walls on the south and east side of the building are panels with quotes about the park. This side also has displays with merchandise sold by the Joshua Tree National Park Association. The front counter is 25 feet from the door where you can buy park passes and merchandise. A window on the west side of the building that has been modified to receive payments for entrance fees, directly to the left of the front counter. Plexiglass hangs around the front counter for the protection of staff and visitors. The building has standard lighting and when the blinds are up, the outside sun provides ample illumination. To the right of the front counter there are more displays for merchandise. On the east wall, there is a window with a majestic view of Eagle Mountain, Mastodon Peak, and the surrounding desert. South of this window there is a bookcase with various publications on Joshua Tree National Park. In the center of the visitor center there is a life-sized mold of a desert tortoise enclosed in glass. On the west side, to the left of the brochure table, there is a window. Next to this window there is a fold-out sign that says “Encuentra Tu Parque” (“Find your Park” in Spanish). There are more store displays as you make your way closer to the front counter. There is a small, slightly shaded courtyard in-between the visitor center and the offices. There are creosote bush and beavertail cactus in the middle. A small bench is located about 10 feet to the north of the offices. There is also a bulletin with park information, maps, and trail guides. All facilities are accessible through paved and level walkways. Outside of the visitor center, there are sidewalks between the parking lot and the buildings. The parking lot has 2 handicapped spaces, with accessible ramps and paved paths to the visitor center, restroom, and office. The office is restricted to park staff and those with authorization to enter. To the right of this building is a flagpole and a sign showing air quality and fire danger. There is also a sign that displays fees to enter the park. There is a short tenth of a mile dirt nature trail that is immediately east of the visitor center. The trail is a loop that starts a few feet from the paved path that leads to the main entrance. It ends on the east side of the parking lot. There are signs along the way identifying various plants and shrubs that can be found in the area. Park rangers here every day to answer questions and provide guidance into Joshua Tree National Park.",

    "audioDescription": "Joshua Tree Visitor Center is located outside the park in the village of Joshua Tree, population 8,000. It is five miles north of the West Entrance on Park Boulevard close to where Park Boulevard and Highway 62 intersect. From the intersection, heading south on Park Boulevard, the visitor center is on the right. The gravel parking lot, just south of the visitor center, can comfortably fit 40 cars. There is a curved cinder block wall that divides the parking lot from the visitor center. From the parking lot, there is a cement sidewalk leading a short distance through a modest cactus garden and ends at a small cement courtyard in front of the visitor center on the east side of the building. In the garden stands a flagpole and a rusted metal sculpture. The exterior of the single-story visitor center has walls that resemble corrugated metal. From the courtyard, another short cement sidewalk leads through a large wooden gate into an outdoor patio between the cinder block wall and the south side of the building. The patio is enclosed on its south end by the previously mentioned cinder block wall. Inside the patio, the ground is dirt and slopes down from the cinder block wall towards the double glass doors that lead into the visitor center. Two tables are on the patio near the doors where rangers can help visitors with information. Once entering the building, there is a one-room exhibit area with panels depicting geology, ecology, and history of Joshua Tree National Park. There is a life-sized replica of a Joshua tree accompanied with panels about the Joshua tree. There is a guitar and a U2 record album on display that represents the creative aspects of Joshua Tree National Park. There is a television that plays a 2-minute video about the park’s geology. The exhibit opens into the one-room bookstore. On display are souvenirs—stickers, patches, t-shirts, hats, stuffed animals, mugs, postcards, and books. On the side of the bookstore closest to the exhibit is a counter with three cash registers. Opposite the counter, on the north side, are two doors that open directly into the men’s and women’s bathrooms. Exit through the bookstore's double glass doors back to the courtyard on the east side of the visitor center. The northernmost section of the building, with a single glass door that opens out into the courtyard, is a cafe.",

Thick soils anchored by lush vegetation covered rolling hills and slopes and water flowed through year-round streams. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{161}\" paraid=\"1862982389\">Present Day: At the end of the Pleistocene, the climate dried out and warmed up. The vegetation that was adapted to a wetter climate died, leaving behind bare slopes that are more vulnerable to erosion. Valley floors filled with sediment, creating the flat plains you see today. These plains are preserved because there isn't enough running water to erode them away. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{177}\" paraid=\"243194751\"><strong>Changing Landscape </strong></p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{187}\" paraid=\"1917273038\">Look for the following features to see evidence of an ever-changing landscape.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{193}\" paraid=\"867655576\">Bajada: Find bajadas where alluvial fans merge to form a vast sediment slope at the mouth of canyons. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{203}\" paraid=\"234409128\">Pediment: These sloping bedrock surfaces covered by gravel can be seen along the edges of mountains.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f2d9541f-f11a-42d7-b16d-69014d3e4ac6}{209}\" paraid=\"469425288\">Dry Wash: Washes transport sediment downhill. The smallest, lightest particles are carried farthest. Desert washes fill with rushing water after rain and monsoons.

A fast-running stream moving down a steep canyon can carry more sand, rocks, and pebbles, but when the water reaches the flat plains, it flows more slowly and can't carry the larger rocks and sand anymore. (Picture how fine silt settles out of a still lake, whereas a rushing river can push along sand, pebbles, and even large rocks.) These sediments accumulate in a fan shape at the mouth of canyons or washes. </p> <p paraeid=\"{c8b25ca6-7d5c-4ee3-8812-23f7bbbe8b2c}{16}\" paraid=\"1705513765\">Bajada: A bajada is where many alluvial fans meet and converge.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c8b25ca6-7d5c-4ee3-8812-23f7bbbe8b2c}{20}\" paraid=\"1585616390\">Pediment: A relatively flat or slightly concave surface of bedrock.  </p>",

    "audioDescription": "Joshua Tree Visitor Center is located outside the park in the village of Joshua Tree, population 8,000. It is five miles north of the West Entrance on Park Boulevard close to where Park Boulevard and Highway 62 intersect. From the intersection, heading south on Park Boulevard, the visitor center is on the right. The gravel parking lot, just south of the visitor center, can comfortably fit 40 cars. There is a curved cinder block wall that divides the parking lot from the visitor center. From the parking lot, there is a cement sidewalk leading a short distance through a modest cactus garden and ends at a small cement courtyard in front of the visitor center on the east side of the building. In the garden stands a flagpole and a rusted metal sculpture. The exterior of the single-story visitor center has walls that resemble corrugated metal. From the courtyard, another short cement sidewalk leads through a large wooden gate into an outdoor patio between the cinder block wall and the south side of the building. The patio is enclosed on its south end by the previously mentioned cinder block wall. Inside the patio, the ground is dirt and slopes down from the cinder block wall towards the double glass doors that lead into the visitor center. Two tables are on the patio near the doors where rangers can help visitors with information. Once entering the building, there is a one-room exhibit area with panels depicting geology, ecology, and history of Joshua Tree National Park. There is a life-sized replica of a Joshua tree accompanied with panels about the Joshua tree. There is a guitar and a U2 record album on display that represents the creative aspects of Joshua Tree National Park. There is a television that plays a 2-minute video about the park’s geology. The exhibit opens into the one-room bookstore. On display are souvenirs—stickers, patches, t-shirts, hats, stuffed animals, mugs, postcards, and books. On the side of the bookstore closest to the exhibit is a counter with three cash registers. Opposite the counter, on the north side, are two doors that open directly into the men’s and women’s bathrooms. Exit through the bookstore's double glass doors back to the courtyard on the east side of the visitor center. The northernmost section of the building, with a single glass door that opens out into the courtyard, is a cafe.",

This area is often closed to climbing in the spring and summer to protect the park’s nesting raptors. Climbers should check climbing closures on the park website before climbing.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3795eb8f-666b-4741-8213-898f2cf0d5a9}{217}\" paraid=\"769056223\">Vegetation: Water is a valuable commodity in the desert. When rain lands on inselbergs, it runs off to areas at the base of the rock adding additional moisture to the soil. The inselberg also shields some of the soil at its base from the sun, especially on the north side. The addition of water and shade in the desert creates unique microclimates that allow certain plant species to thrive.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{3795eb8f-666b-4741-8213-898f2cf0d5a9}{225}\" paraid=\"382775278\"><strong>Glossary </strong></h2> <p paraeid=\"{3795eb8f-666b-4741-8213-898f2cf0d5a9}{229}\" paraid=\"444079876\">Inselberg: Isolated terrain that abruptly rises above the surrounding area.

The trail is located near the southern boundary of the park, south of the Cottonwood Visitor Center. It is much lower in elevation than most of the park and offers a unique showcase of plants highly adapted to extreme heat and little rain.<br /> <br /> Occasionally, after wet winters, this trail will offer vibrant displays of wildflowers in February and March. For more information on wildflowers, visit our <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/jotr/planyourvisit/blooms.htm\">Wildflower Viewing Page</a>. <br />  <br /> This trail offers little to no shade so make sure to bring proper sun protection. ",
    "audioDescription": "Bajada Nature Trail is located in a wide desert valley with mountains in the distance in every direction. On the east side of the road there is a paved loop parking lot with a paved sidewalk with a bulletin board with an interpretive display. Near the bulletin board a dirt and gravel trail heads off to the east. There are scattered small trees and shrubs throughout the area.",

    "bodyText": "The Willow Hole Trail is an out-and-back hike that ventures into the Wonderland of Rocks. It is 7 miles roundtrip and has 246 feet of elevation gain. The hike begins at the Boy Scout Trailhead and initially follows the same path as the Boy Scout Trail. After 1.2 miles, the trail splits off to the right (northeast) and heads 2.3 miles to Willow Hole. Look for cottonwood and willow trees in this area. Occasionally, Willow Hole will have a small pool of water during and after periods of rainfall. If you spot wildlife at the water souce please observe from a distance and do not approach. <br /> <br /> The first part of the trail to Willow Hole features expansive views of the desert and distant mountains. The second part of the trail follows washes into the Wonderland of Rocks, a labyrinth of cliffs, canyons, domes, and unique rock formations. During this section, pay close attention to following the trail signs and correct wash. <br /> <br /> Overnight camping is not allowed at Willow Hole or in the Wonderland of Rocks area as they are an important and sensitive wildlife and vegetation area. Backpacking is permitted on the west side of the Boy Scout Trail. ",
    "audioDescription": "The Willow Hole Trail begins at the Keys West Backpacking Board. This board is located in a wide valley along Park Boulevard. The parking area is a dirt parking lot with a pit toilet and trash cans. In the northwest corner is a trailhead with a backpacking board with info on backpacking and self registration. The area has scattered Joshua trees, small trees and shrubs. In the distance are rocky mountains.",

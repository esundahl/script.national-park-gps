    "bodyText": "The Blacksmith Shop is one of the few examples remaining on Cane River with exterior walls made of <i>bousillage</i> (boo-zee-aj), a mixture of mud, and Spanish moss or straw. If you look carefully, you can find finger mark indentations left by the people who smoothed the <em>bousillage</em> mixture into place. Built in the mid-1800s, it consists of architectural features that were evident during Colonial Louisiana. Such features include a post-in-sill wood frame, <em>bousillage</em> walls, and a wraparound porch roof; these types of roofs helped protect the walls and provided shade.<br /> <br /> On any plantation the blacksmith, as well as the carpenter, played essential roles as the plantation was being established. The blacksmith created hand-wrought nails, shod horses, and made tools and implements to be used on the plantation. Even well into the 20th century the blacksmith played an important role at Magnolia. As cotton prices declined, the Hertzog’s increased their cattle production. Brand marks are imprinted on the inside of the door, possibly to advertise the Blacksmith’s skill or maybe to test the accuracy of the brander or branding iron.<br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The Blacksmith Shop has exterior mud walls that are made of bousillage which consists of animal hair, mud, and Spanish moss. This type of architectural style was popular during the colonial period of Louisiana. The cypress beams are visible on the exterior of the wall and run vertical. It is almost a perfect square building measuring 47 feet by 44 feet. The roof is metal and is \"hipped\" with the lowest part of the roof extending out and ends with the bottom of the roof only around six feet above the ground. Having the roof this low protects the walls and even provides shade. The backside of the structure includes livestock pens; livestock that needed to be shoed were housed here. The door is open and under plexiglass are modern cattle brands that are branded into the door. During the 20th Century the Hertzog family increased cattle production as cotton prices fell. To the left of the structure is a fence and is the property line. To the right a portion of the pigeon house and live oaks are in view.",

    "bodyText": "The Gin Barn houses cotton ginning and pressing equipment.  One side of the Gin Barn contains an 1830s wood screw cotton press used to press cotton into bales for market. One of only six wood screw presses remaining in the United States, this rare artifact predates the days of steam ginning and pressing. Enslaved laborers hand-picked the cotton. The cotton was cleaned and placed into the top box. As the press rotated around the stationary wood screw, the cotton lint compressed and formed a bale. The power source for the Magnolia press is unknown. Other presses used draft animals, so it is likely the Magnolia press operated the same way. A cotton bale weighed almost 500 pounds and used approximately one acre of cotton.<br /> <br /> The other side of the Gin Barn contains steam gins and a double-box steam press, which dates to the late 1800s. In front of the Gin Barn the large circular brick cistern collected rainwater from the roof to power the steam engine. This mechanization allowed for more efficient cotton production. Laborers no longer had to painstakingly clean, or gin, the cotton because the ginning equipment did this. Working the machinery was dangerous. If workers were not careful, they could lose limbs or even their lives. One person would call the press by singing a song with a beat that matched the timing of the machinery. This beat helped workers to know when to avoid putting their hands and arms inside of the machinery to avoid injury.",
    "audioDescription": "The Cotton Gin Barn is a two-story, wood-framed, end-gabled building with a metal roof. The building is rectangular, measuring approximately 89 feet by 38 feet, plus almost 10-foot-wide porches that run down both sides of the structure. Inside, the first floor is divided into three spaces, with steam-powered ginning equipment at one end, the wood-screw cotton press at the other end, and what was probably a “lint room” in the center.",

    "bodyText": "The Magnolia Overseer's House has been used for various functions since it's construction. It was likely built as a hospital for enslaved people. Large plantations had hospitals to provide medical treatment for the enslaved people. A doctor made rounds to the area plantations to treat the ill. The enslaved laborers fell victim to a variety of illnesses because of their strenuous work schedule and environment in addition to poor diet.  <br /> <br /> After the Civil War it served as home for the Hertzog family, while Magnolia’s Main House was rebuilt after it was burned by US troops in 1864. From the late 1890s to the mid-1960s, the structure was used as the Overseer’s house. Overseers were usually white men who were paid an annual salary, provided with a house, and a domestic worker, they managed the day-to-day plantation operations. The overseer made sure the cotton was planted, chopped, picked, ginned, and pressed. He was also responsible for delegating labor to repair buildings, mend fences, and tend to the livestock. Overseers in the post-bellum period were often multi-racial.<br /> <br />  ",

A hip shaped roof sheathed in metal caps the structure, and three brick chimneys protrude from the metal roof. The house is nestled between four large live oak trees, three of which are visible in the foreground. The tree branches arch into the sky and create a backdrop of tree canopy behind the building.

    "bodyText": "A Pigeonnier, or pigeon house, was a common sight on a French-Creole plantation. Pigeonniers were status symbols because they served to emphasize the wealth and importance of the plantation owner. Young pigeons, called squab, were used as food. Two popular and delicious meals were pigeon pie and squab on toast. Nothing went to waste on a plantation, not even the pigeon droppings, which were collected and used as fertilizer for the gardens.<br /> <br /> Standing near the Pigeonnier, Magnolia Plantation’s Main House is visible on the other side of the fence, behind the trees on PRIVATE PROPERTY. The Main House is not part of the Cane River Creole National Historical Park because it is still privately owned by the descendants of the LeComte-Hertzog family. The LeComte family came to the Cane River area in the 1750s, but it wasn’t until 1835 that Ambrose LeComte II and his wife Julia Buard established Magnolia Plantation, which was later managed by Matthew Hertzog, the son-in-law of Ambrose LeComte II. The LeComte family originally grew tobacco and indigo but soon changed the cash crop to cotton. Magnolia Plantation became one of the largest and most successful French Creole cotton plantations with over 6000 acres of land. Because the LeComte-Hertzog family farmed here until the 1960s Magnolia Plantation is recognized as a Bicentennial Farm.<br /> <br /> The Main House you see here today was constructed during the 1890s, after retreating US soldiers burned the original house during the Red River Campaign in 1864. During the time it took the LeComte-Hertzog family to rebuild the Main House, they lived in the Slave Hospital/Overseer’s House.<br /> <br /> The Cook’s Cabin is located on PRIVATE PROPERTY behind the fence to the right of the Main House. This building served as the Cook’s house and the kitchen for the Main House.

The Store houses visitor restrooms, passport stamps, and informational brochures. Visitor restrooms are open daily even if the Store is not staffed.<br /> <br /> As you tour Magnolia Plantation, you will gain an understanding of life on a cotton plantation and come away with a new appreciation of the contributions of the diverse and skilled group of people who lived and worked on this land.",

    "bodyText": "Constructed in 1873, Magnolia’s Plantation Store was in operation for a century. This store served the plantation community, neighbors, and visitors of all ethnicities.The Plantation Store was a gathering place where friends and neighbors exchanged news and gossip. It was also an entertainment center. Local musicians would play music while men, women, and children danced and played dominos or shot craps on the porch and in the yard.<br /> <br /> Mostly empty now, this store was once stocked from floor to ceiling with merchandise. Items for sale included the some of the same things we use today, such as candles, kerosene, and small tools. Some foodstuffs for sale included wheat flower, condiments, such as sugar and salt, and canned goods. Agricultural items included seed, fertilizer, and insecticide.<br /> <br /> Prior to the 1930s, sharecroppers and tenant farmers were paid in plantation-specific paper scrip or brass tokens which could be redeemed only at that plantation store. Sharecroppers were dependent upon a good harvest to settle credit debt. If the harvest was poor, it was very easy to become buried under a mountain of debt. As the number of sharecroppers dwindled, so did the importance of the plantation stores. Magnolia’s Plantation Store closed in 1973.",
    "audioDescription": "From your vehicle you will walk north approximately 100-250 feet to the store. Pass through a pedestrian gate in the fence line to an accessible ramp that leads to the front porch of the store. The store has two wings on either side of the main part of the store. The right wing has a foyer with site maps and a door into the men's restroom. The left wing foyer is where you will find maps, brochures, a water fountain and water bottle filling station and the women's restroom. The main part of the store is only open when park staff is on site.",

    "bodyText": "Seventy cabins once housed the plantation’s 235 enslaved laborers. As many as twenty-four of the Magnolia Plantation Cabins were two-room brick structures with back-to-back fireplaces, accommodating a family or group in each of the two rooms. Converted to single family tenant housing after Emancipation, eight cabins of the Magnolia Plantation Quarters have survived. Many of the families who lived here were formerly enslaved, and their descendants, who continued to toil in the same fields where their ancestors labored.<br /> <br /> The terms tenant farmer and sharecropper are sometimes used interchangeably. A tenant farmer lives and farms on land owned by someone else. A sharecropper does not live on the land that is being farmed. To work the land, tenant farmers and sharecroppers gave a portion of the crop to the landowner. These workers shopped for goods at the plantation store on a credit system. When the crop came in, workers settled their debt with the landowner and the store. Whatever was left over was their net profit. If it was a bad growing season, or if boll weevils invaded the crop, workers might be in debt at the end of the year. It was difficult to get ahead under this system, so many workers migrated to large northern cites to find better jobs. Other workers were displaced by the modern tractor. The last family moved out of the Tenant Cabins around 1969.<br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "A brick cabin approximately 38 feet long and 17 feet wide and 17 feet in height. Two green doors situated at each end of the cabin would have been separate entrances for two families during slavery. A brick chimney separates the two sides of the cabin with the fire places being saddle bagged- one on each side. On parts of the brick exterior a white cement covering is visible. This is Portland cement added after the 1920's. The cabin has a tin roof which extends to cover the wooden front porch. The original tin roofs were added circa 1921 and replaced the original roofs made of wood shingles circa 1845. On the right side of the structure coming off the roof is a down spout leading to a cistern that collects water. The front porch has two red metal chairs circa 1960's look that are not original. Behind the cabin stands large pecan trees that form a tree line running north to south. Surrounding the cabin on all sides is green grass.",

    "bodyText": "The Bottle Garden in front of the Main House was originally laid out as a boxwood-lined parterre garden sometime between the late 1810s and the late 1820s. Parterre gardens, with their low plantings and geometric patterns, were designed to be seen from the gallery of the raised house and were common to French landscape design. After a blight killed the boxwood hedges, the Prud'homme family used bottles from the wine cellar below the house to line the planting beds. The family maintained this tradition until the National Park Service acquired the property, replacing broken bottles with new ones or older ones from the wine cellar.<br /> <br /> Today, the roughly rectangular Bottle Garden contains beds in geometric shapes: rectangles, diamonds, hearts, waves, circles, clovers, and stars, laid out with sense of symmetry. The bottle edging includes wine bottles from Taylor Wine Company, ale and stout beer bottles, salt-glazed stoneware bottles, Anheuser-Busch beer bottles, mineral water bottles, soda water bottles, and bitters bottles. The oldest bottles date to around 1790, while the newest bottles dates to the late 1990s. The Bottle Garden is one of the more unique features at Oakland.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The Bottle Garden measures approximately 80 feet by 35 feet and is enclosed by a wood, white picket fence that faces the oak allee and a woven wire fence to the north and south sides. Within it, a nandina hedge establishes the east edge of the garden, just inside the white picket fence. A soldier-course brick walkway leads from the picket fence to the raised porch of the main house, creating a primary axis. To either side of the brick walkway, geometric planting beds are arranged in a symmetrical fashion. Each bed is outlined with overturned glass bottles dating to the late 1790s to the late 1990s. Plantings within the Bottle Garden include camellia, crepe myrtle, iris, rose, nandina, and canna lilies.",

During the difficult times of the Great Depression, the Prud’hommes moved this building to its current location and turned it into a cabin for recreational fishermen. To meet the needs of the fishermen the Prud’hommes also had boats for rent and bait for sale. Plantation workers made extra cash cleaning and cooking fish. During the Great Depression, the price of cotton dipped below the cost of production, making the income generated by the fishing camp especially important.<br /> <br /> This building today, stands as an example of the ability to successfully adapt to and eventually overcome a difficult economic situation. In addition, the building is one of the best examples of <i>bousillage </i>on the plantation.",

Around the turn of the century, the structure was moved from its original location towards the northeast into an open field.

Due to their strenuous work schedule and environment, along with a poor diet, the enslaved fell victim to a variety of illnesses.<br /> <br /> After a succession of doctors, this building became home to various members of the Prud’homme family.

    "bodyText": "As Europeans began settling along the Gulf Coast and Mississippi Valley, they incorporated old world architectural styles to suit their new climate. Built by enslaved workers, the Main House at Oakland retains the pitched or sloping roof that is characteristic in French structures from Normandy to Quebec, but it also shows characteristics brought to North America from the West Indian Creoles including the elevated first floor, spacious porch, and multiple double doors. All these innovations helped cool the house during the humid summer months. One regional component of the main house and other structures along Cane River is <i>bousillage</i>. <i>Bousillage</i> is mud from the river mixed with Spanish moss or straw creating a brick like substance which is prevalent in the interior walls of the house.<br /> <br /> The 1821 house consisted of only four rooms on the main level and has seen several additions through the years. Below the house, the ground floor has a room for an enslaved nanny, who accessed the bedrooms on the upper floor through a staircase and trapdoor in floor. Also below the house are a wine cellar, several storage rooms, and \"museum\" that was used by the Prud'homme family in the mid-20th century to display various objects to visitors.<br /> <br /> Oakland’s Main House stands as an excellent example of French Creole architecture that utilizes old world and new world concepts mixed with regional techniques. The Main House is open to the public on weekends from 10 AM to 2 PM.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The present configuration of the house dates to the 1960s. When built in 1821 there were four rooms on the upper level, surrounded on all sides by a wide porch with two rooms on the lower level. At least three major additions and numerous smaller changes to the house occurred over the years. The white house sits at the end of a live oak allée. The upper level of the house is reached via brick staircases. The rooms on the lower level are enclosed by oar shaped wooden palings. The house was a classic 4-room example of a French Creole raised plantation house. The house which is raised a full story above grade on a high brick foundation features a broad hip roof above open galleries. Additions, including a kitchen wing and enclosure of portions of some of the galleries.",

    "bodyText": "The dining room was the social hub of the house. Prud’homme family meals were taken here, and guests were entertained in this room. Hanging from the ceiling over the dining table is a punkah, sometimes called a “shoo-fly”. The punkah was usually operated by an enslaved child and functioned as a fan to provide a breeze which also helped keep flies off the food. Mary Harris, interviewed in 1940 at age 86, recalled her experience as an enslaved child in Louisiana, “…Sure, I remember slavery times. I was a big girl, turned eleven. I used to pull the fan that hop off the flies while the white folks was eatin’. It wasn’t hard work, but my arms used to get tired, ‘specially at dinner when they set so long at the table…”<br /> <br /> The room also reflects the changing technology along Cane River. Two telephones can be seen in the room. The older wall phone dates to around 1900 and would have been one of the first telephones in the area. The newer, beige rotary phone on the small table is from the 1960s. The original gasoliers (gaslight chandeliers) were electrified in the late 1930s.",
    "audioDescription": "The dining room is 18’-9” x 26’-2.5” x 11’ high or about 491 square feet. The room has six door openings. On the east wall are folding doors to the parlor. The door to the parent’s room is on the south wall. Two sets of French doors lead to the gallery on the west (back). Three doors are located on the north wall (hallway). One of these doors was closed by the installation of display shelving after World War II. In the center of the ceiling is a punkha, a type of swinging fan that originated in India. The swinging frame is cast iron; the fan itself consists of a cypress wood frame covered with canvas painted with the Prud’homme family’s coat-of-arms.",

    "bodyText": "From 1821 until the end of the Civil War, many enslaved individuals worked in the house cooking and serving meals, cleaning, attending family members, and caring for the children. Venus, an enslaved cook, Martha Ann, an enslaved laundress, and others unidentified lived in cabins behind the house. The exception was the Prud’homme children’s enslaved nanny or nurse who lived in this room on the lower level of the house. The brick for the walls were handmade and kiln-fired, probably on the plantation.<br /> <br /> The floor was most likely dirt. The palings enclosing the ground-floor rooms likely would not have been here at the time, making an open porch/workspace around the central rooms like the gallery upstairs. In addition to a door that led outside, the Nanny’s Room had a staircase leading to a trap door which opened into the upstairs bedroom. At any hour of the day or night the enslaved nanny could be summoned to care for the Prud’homme children.<br /> <br /> In 1845 Celeste was an enslaved nurse on the plantation and may have lived in this room. After the Civil War, the family hired nannies to look after the children. These nannies, including Marie Wilson and Carrie Helaire, did not live in the Nanny’s Room. The trap door was covered over with new flooring in the 1950s.",
    "audioDescription": "The enslaved nanny’s room is formed by the brick foundation walls of the house. The floor area is 18’-2” x 12’-3” or around 256 square feet. In addition to the trap door (now closed) to the bedroom above, there is a single door on the west wall and two window openings on the west and south walls.",

    "bodyText": "Jean-Pierre Emanuel Prud’homme acquired this land in a Spanish land grant around 1785 and eight generations of his French Creole family lived in this house from 1821 until 1998. The main house conveyed success but was only a small part of a plantation. Far more important was the work done beyond the main house.<br /> <br /> The Prud'hommes were not the only family living on this land. Generations of the same families of laborers, enslaved and tenant, lived on these lands for over two hundred years. The plantation’s first cash crops were tobacco and indigo, followed by cotton in the early 1800s.<br /> <br /> According to the Prud'homme family, the house was built entirely of local materials. The enslaved carpenters framed out the raised Creole house in cypress wood, using few, if any, nails. Although most of the carpenters are unidentified, documents record both Dominique Toussaint and Solomon Wilson as enslaved carpenters on the plantation. The walls are <i>bousillage</i>, which is made from mud mixed with Spanish Moss, and straw. Later wooden siding was put over the <i>bousillage</i>.<br /> <br /> In 1821, the upper level of house consisted of only four rooms, the parlor, dining room, and two bedrooms surrounded by a wide wrap-around gallery (porch). The original two rooms at ground level were the enslaved nanny’s room and wine cellar. Like many wealthy Cane River plantation owners Emanuel built a town house in Natchitoches and may not have lived on the plantation all year, instead relying on the overseer to manage day-to-day operations.<br /> <br /> By the 1940s, the need for manual laborers decreased with the increasing numbers of tractors and other equipment. The plantation and the house appear as it would have looked in the 1960s, around the time that the few remaining tenant farmers left the plantation.",
    "audioDescription": "The open raised galleries (porches) no longer surround the entire house due to the addition of rooms made by enclosing parts of the original west and north galleries. The existing galleries are approximately 11’ deep and 11’ high. The ceilings are finished with tongue-and-grove groove boards, 4” to 8” wide. The floorboards are tongue-and-groove cypress boards, 4” to 6” wide. Brick stairs between brick buttresses presently rise from the ground to the galleries on the east (front), south, and west sides of the house.",

Smaller houses were typical in this area, as much of the day was spent on the galleries (porches) to catch cool breezes. It was common to have many children sleep in the same bed. As children got older, the boys would be moved into other rooms.<br /> <br /> There is a “trundle” bed underneath that is pulled out at night and then is pushed out of the way during the day to give more floor space for the children to play. The large bed, typical of the 1830-1840 period, is a display of the Prud’homme family’s wealth.<br /> <br /> Below the children's room was the room of the enslaved nanny. When she needed to care for the Prud’homme children, she came up a stairway through a trap door into this room. There is a photograph of a woman named Marie who was enslaved on the plantation– the caption says that she “grannied” seven of the family’s nine children. She may have been the widow of Solomon Wilson an enslaved carpenter.<br /> <br /> By the 1950s this was the bedroom of Vivian Prud’homme, the last child born in the house, and her aunt Lucie Prud’homme.",

The room has four doors, which lead to the gallery on the east (front), the parlor, parents’ room and closet on the west. In 1953 the closet was added, and new pine flooring was laid over the original cypress flooring. This new flooring covered the trap door which connected the bedroom to the enslaved nanny’s room. The fireplace, on the north wall, contains a 1950s gas space heater in the firebox.",

    "bodyText": "The parents' room displays the wealth of Emanuel Prud’homme. Investing in an enslaved labor force and cotton provided the means to build the four-room house completed in 1821; that same year Emanuel and his wife Catherine went to Paris to buy furniture. However, most of the larger pieces, such as the armoire, bed, and chest-of-drawers, were purchased in New Orleans. The bed is from the 1830s and was purchased from prominent furniture merchant Mallard of New Orleans. The armoires were used instead of closets.<br /> <br /> The Prud’homme family’s Catholic heritage is reflected throughout the room and includes a picture of St Therese of Lisieux, a <i>prie-dieu </i>(prayer bench), and holy water font. Catholicism was also part of the lives of the enslaved. The French <i>Code Noir</i> (Black code), that provided a framework on how to run the institution of slavery, mandated that enslaved people be baptized into the Catholic faith. It is from these baptismal records that we learn the names and ages of some of the children enslaved on the plantation, including Magdelena, age two months, daughter of Juanna; Marie Therese, age nine months, daughter of Marthe; and Anna, age one year, daughter of Maria Luisa.<br /> <br /> Catholicism is a hallmark of Creole culture. Historically, Creole referred to people born in Louisiana during the colonial period, who spoke French, Spanish, and /or creole languages, and practiced the Roman Catholic faith regardless of their ethnicity. Creole goes beyond racial boundaries. It connects people to their colonial roots, be they descendants of European colonists, enslaved or free Africans, or those of mixed heritage. Many define Creole through foodways, music, folklore, family traditions, architecture, the Catholic faith, and genealogy.",
    "audioDescription": "The parents’ room has undergone many changes since 1821. Today the room measures 18'-9” x 21'-3” x 11’ high or about 398 square feet. The room was enlarged around the 1830s when the entire back of the house was extended about 10’ to the west. The room has two sets of French doors, one on the south wall to the gallery, and one on the west wall that leads to a space that was converted into a dressing room after World War II. Two additional doors open to the children’s room (east) and dining room (north). In 1953 the room was reduced in size by the construction of a closet and bathroom at the eastern end of the room. Beside the doors and windows, lighting is limited to a pair of sconces that were part of the house’s gas lighting system before being electrified in the 1930s.",

    "bodyText": "The house is a time capsule of the Prud’homme family’s life on the plantation from the 1820s to the 1960s. The invention of the cotton gin in the early 1790s made growing cotton profitable, but it dramatically increased the use of enslaved labor to produce that wealth. In 1795 the enslaved population was 38, but in less than fifty years it had nearly quadrupled to 145 persons. By the Civil War, nearly 160 enslaved individuals labored at Oakland. African American labor sustained Oakland Plantation and contributed to the wealth of the Prud'homme family.<br /> <br /> The paintings and photographs you see around the parlor are many generations of the Prud'homme family and their relatives. The man in the portrait to the right of the double doors is the founder of the plantation, Emanuel Prud’homme. The man in the large portrait on the side wall is Ambrose LeComte II, founder of Magnolia Plantation. His youngest daughter Elise married Jacques Alphonse Prud'homme I, who later inherited Oakland. By 1860, Ambrose LeComte II enslaved more people (235 individuals) and produced more cotton than any other Natchitoches Parish plantation.<br /> <br /> Music was an essential part of education for the wealthy, and many of the Prud’homme women were accomplished musicians. However, there were many talented self-taught musicians on the plantation, including Dominique Toussaint. Born enslaved on Oakland, Toussaint was a skilled carpenter who likely was involved in building the house. In addition, he was an accomplished fiddler who played for dances.",
    "audioDescription": "The parlor is 18’-10” x 18’-9” x 11' high or about 345 square feet. The ceiling which is finished with tongue-and-groove boards, 5” to 6” wide. The parlor did not reach its current appearance until after the Civil War when the original French doors that open to the gallery on the east wall (front) were replaced with floor-to-ceiling windows. Doors from the parlor lead to the dining room (west), children’s room (south) and hallway (north). New flooring of tongue-and-groove cypress flooring was laid over the original cypress flooring in the 1940s. There is a fireplace on the south wall of the parlor. An elaborate kerosene chandelier, that has been electrified, hangs from the ceiling.",

    "bodyText": "The wine cellar is one of two rooms on the ground level that were part of the original 1821 house. The Prud’homme family imported casks of wine from France. Historical records show that in 1860 or 1861 Phanor Prud’homme and some of his relatives received twelve casks of claret from Bordeaux. Once bottled the wine would be stored in the wine cellar. The brick walls, built by enslaved masons, were painted red with mortar joints “penciled” in white, a popular treatment of brick until the 1900s, a technique meant to disguise irregularity of color, texture, coursing typical of handmade brick. The floor is paved with brick. The wooden racks along all four walls have holes to allow the bottles to be stored upside down. Storing wine this way prevented the corks from drying out. Bottles from the wine cellar would later be used to edge the flower beds in the formal garden in front of the house.",
    "audioDescription": "The wine cellar is formed by the brick foundation walls of the house. The floor is 18'-3” x 14’-6” or about 265 square feet. A wooden plank door on the west wall has a series of eleven holes, about 2” in diameter cut into the upper part of the door presumably for ventilation. The window openings on the west wall are closed by six iron bars. A series of racks are located on all four walls.",

    "bodyText": "The North Slave/Tenant Cabin is one of two that remains at Oakland and is a remnant of a larger community, which extended for a quarter-mile to the south along the river. These buildings were home to generations of workers at Oakland Plantation--first enslaved families and later tenant farming families. Many of those later families and individuals were formerly enslaved or descendants of enslaved people, who continued to toil in the fields where their ancestors had labored.<br /> <br /> Sharecropper and tenant farmer families lived in these quarters as late as the 1960s. The interior is historically furnished to the tenant farming era. Tenant farmers and sharecroppers did not own their own farms, and to work the land they had to turn over a share of the crop to the landowner. These people would shop for goods at the plantation store on a credit system. When the crop came in, they had to settle their debt with the landowner and the plantation store, and whatever was left over was their net profit. If it was a bad growing season, or if the boll weevil invaded the crop, the sharecroppers might be in debt at the end of the year. It was extremely difficult to get ahead under this labor system, so many farm workers from the south began migrating to large northern cities to find better jobs.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",

The original floor of the main room was dirt and later covered with wood. The original back porch has been enclosed to add two additional rooms.",

The first overseer to occupy this home was Seneca Pace. Pace kept a journal of his activities at Oakland. His journal provides readers with a record of the planting cycle and numerous other labor activities. One of Pace’s most frequent topics was the weather, which of course was one factor that could make or break a growing season.<br /> <br /> During the first half of the twentieth century this building was the home of the Metoyer family. Leo Metoyer lived here with his parents, wife, and three children. Leo was the yardman at Oakland. He tended to the animals and the yard in front of the main house.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "Welcome to Oakland Plantation, a part of the Cane River Creole National Historical Park. You are about to enter one of the most intact Creole Plantations in existence. Creole can mean different things to different people. Here in the Cane River area, Creoles are descended from Louisiana’s colonial settlers. This can be any combination of colonial French, Spanish, African, or Native American descent. The term Creole can also be used to label the contributions of the Creole Culture, including their language, food, and architecture.<br /> <br /> Oakland Plantation was a thriving agricultural community for nearly 200 years. The workforce was originally comprised of enslaved laborers. Following emancipation, sharecroppers and tenant farmers worked the fields. Along with the people who worked the fields, you also had doctors, blacksmiths, carpenters, laundresses, and store clerks. All these people played key roles in ensuring the success of the plantation. Founded by Jean Pierre Emanuel Prud’homme around 1785, Oakland would remain in the family for the next two centuries. During that time span the family would endure the Civil War, outbreaks of the boll weevil, and the great depression.<br /> <br /> As you tour the plantation today, you will gain an understanding of life on a cotton plantation and come away with a new appreciation for the contributions of the diverse group of people who lived and worked on this land.",
    "audioDescription": "Start your visit at the Welcome Pavilion located next to the parking area. The open-air Pavilion, which measures approximately 60 feet by 40 feet, contains picnic tables, exhibits, brochures, maps, water fountains, water bottle filling stations, and public restrooms. The Pavilion is where you will begin the walking tour of the plantation grounds.",

    "bodyText": "The store was constructed after the Civil War and quickly became a focal point of the community. In the words of historian Ann Malone, “the postbellum rural merchant was all things to his community…His store was the hub of the local universe. It was the marketplace, banking and credit source, recreational center, public forum, and news exchange.” Oakland’s store also served as a post office on and off during its existence, further enhancing its importance in the community.<br /> <br /> The plantation store could also prove to be a financial burden to the sharecroppers. Quite often sharecroppers could not get out from under the mountain of debt that they accumulated at the stores. Historian Carol Breedlove noted, “Perhaps the Prud’hommes could have done more, or been more generous [with the sharecroppers]. On the other hand, they could certainly, in their environment and historical period, have done less, been less supportive and more selfish.” As the numbers of sharecroppers dwindled, so did the importance of the plantation stores. The Prud’hommes closed their store for good in 1982.<br /> <br /> The Oakland Plantation Store is the park's main visitor contact station. Inside the store you will find historic exhibits, NPS passport stamps, Junior Ranger books, and a gift shop.",
    "audioDescription": "The store is a one-story, wood-framed structure, set on brick piers, measuring approximately 42 feet by 58 feet. The structure consists of the original end-gabled building (circa 1870) plus a series of additions that brought the building to its present form by the early twentieth century. Facing nearly due east the store is set less than 40 feet off the main road.",

The setting pen was used to house nesting chickens; the fattening pen was for chickens they planned to eat. The wash house was where laundry was done.<br /> <br /> Chickens were a common site on plantations. In historian, John Michael Vlach’s book <i>Back of the Big House </i>he cited the following advantages to raising chickens: “they provided both meat and eggs; they could be maintained on very small amounts of feed; and they could be killed on short notice, thus reducing the risk of spoilage.”<br /> <br /> Laundry was originally done by enslaved workers, and then by paid domestics. Louisiana lore contends that on laundry day, people would eat red beans and rice, since that meal required little attention giving folks time to concentrate on doing the laundry.",

These include the Wash House at the north end, then the Fattening Pen, Storage Shed/Corn Crib, and the Chicken Coop/Poultry House. The Setting Pen and larger Chicken Coop have gable-front roofs.

The groundwater in this region was unsuitable for drinking, so the people built cisterns to collect rainwater. Cisterns can be made from brick and buried underground, or they can be constructed from wood and placed above ground or in attics. The brick cistern adjacent to the corn crib was sixteen feet deep and held almost 5,000 gallons of water.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The Square Crib is a 39.8 feet x 38.7 feet x 8.1 feet high (to eaves) wood-frame outbuilding with a tall, gable-roof corn crib in the center surrounded by shed-roof additions on all sides. The center structure rests on stuccoed brick and wood piers. The crib represents the variety of outbuildings present on a nineteenth-century plantation. Plan and construction are also typical of French Colonial barn architecture.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Water-powered sawmills were usually built by entrepreneurs who owned forested land and a little money to invest into a family run business. The lumber cut was used for the building of homes, towns, and barns. Some of the lumber was exported to other countries. The old sawmills with their slow production of about 48 planks for a 12 hour day at best, are long gone. The mill pits and banks of the races stand in mute testimony to the long hours and hard work that once marked these sites.</p> <p>The exact date of construction and first operation of the vertical sawmill near today's Owens Creek Campground is unknown, but it is shown on an 1857 map with the same area indicated as deeded back to 1808, mentioning rights to water ways. The same 1857 map also shows 4 additional sawmills on Owens Creek and one on Big Hunting Creek near the present day Visitor Center.</p> <p>The sawmill near the present day Owens Creek Campground probably operated until after the late 1890's. A reconstruction of the mill was built by the Youth Conservation Corps on the site of the original sawmill. Construction of the campground eliminated the possibility of water power operations, but the gears and what would have been underwater works are all visible from an accessible boardwalk.</p> <p> </p>",

    "bodyText": "<h4>Hiking Conditions & Precautions</h4> <br /> Catoctin Mountain Park is a fun and exciting place to explore. Chimney Rock is one of the most popular hiking destinations with spectacular views of the valley below. However, please be advised that jumping across the rocks is extremely dangerous. <b>People are seriously injured at Chimney Rock on a frequent basis</b>. The size of the gaps between rocks is very deceptive, so please do not attempt to jump these hazard areas!<br /> <br /> Use caution while hiking. Many of the trails are rocky and uneven. Wear sturdy shoes or hiking boots and watch where you're going to avoid slips, falls, and possible strains and sprains. Dress for the weather. Wear layers of clothing in cold weather and carry water while hiking in all seasons. Pick up a park map at the visitor center before exploring the trails or download one from this website.<br /> <br /> Poison Ivy is a common plant in the park and many people suffer an itchy rash after contact. It has 3 shiny dark leaves and also can be a thick hairy vine.<br />   <h4>Wildlife</h4> <br /> Close encounters with wildlife should be avoided. The speed limit throughout the park is 30 mph. This speed will help you enjoy the scenery and watch wildlife and lessen the chance of a collision with the resident wildlife. Deer in particular often travel in groups so if you see one cross the road, slow down and look for another to soon follow behind. Black bears also inhabit the park, so if you happen to encounter one be sure to maintain a resepctful distance. Slowly back away in the direction you came if you see a bear walking on the trail. When camping be sure to secure your food items properly to avoid attracting wildlife.<br /> <br /> There are two venomous snakes found in the park: the copperhead and the timber rattlesnake. Please remember that all wildlife have a role in the ecosystem and are protected from harassment and harm. These snakes will only strike when threatened and/or provoked.<br /> <br /> Ticks are also found in the park. The small deer tick which can carry Lyme Disease, and the dog tick which can carry Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Long sleeve shirts, long pants, socks, and a hat offer good protection. Check your entire body after a visit to make sure you didn't take home any unwanted travelers! <h3>In case of emergency call Emergency Dispatch at:<br /> 1-866-677-6677 or dial 911</h3> <br /> Do not rely on cellular phones as not all types work in the park. Check your coverage to be sure you are covered!<br /> <br /> If you have any questions or concerns, please just ask a park ranger or call the visitor center at (301) 663-9388.",

    "bodyText": "Wolf Rock is a boulder field featuring a wolf-shaped boulder. The boulder field is part of the Weverton Formation which was deposited as sand 550 million years ago. After sediment layers covered the formation 250 million years ago, the formation would crystalize with the uplifting of the Appalachain Mountains and erosion revealed the quartzite present today. The whole field is the size of a football field, but parts are grown over and parts are inaccessible due to crevasses. Please use caution while exploring the Wolf Rock area. ",
    "audioDescription": "Boulders cover the landscape, one shaped vaguely like a wolf's profile. There are many uneven surfaces and deep crevasses, some of which have spindly trees growing out.",

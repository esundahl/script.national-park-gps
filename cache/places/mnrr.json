Here Patrick Gass was formally promoted to the rank of sergeant, filling the position formerly held by the late Sergeant Floyd. Clark identified Bow Creek as the general location of an abandoned Omaha village, writing, “above the mouth of this Creek a Chief of the Maha nataton displeased with the Conduct of Black bird the main Chief came to this place and built a Town which was called by his name Petite Arch (or Little Bow) this Town was at the foot of a Hill in a handsom Plain fronting the river and Contained about 100 huts & 200 men, the remains of this tribe Since the Death of Petite arch has joined the remaining part of the nation”. <br /> <br /> Circa 1720, the Omaha Tribe established a village near the mouth of Bow Creek known as “Bad Village”, apparently due to a schism that split the tribe. Bad Village was likely occupied until circa 1750, when the factions reunited at a village site near present-day Dakota City, Nebraska. Following the rise of Blackbird, Little Bow and his followers left the Omaha Big Village and resettled in the Bow Creek area circa 1780-1790. Accounts vary, but the Omaha factions reunited following the death of either Blackbird or Little Bow, some¬time prior to 1804. The exact location of the Little Bow Village is currently unknown, but there are numer¬ous archeological sites throughout the area, which is primarily used for agricultural cultivation.</p> <h4>Recreation </h4> <p>Bow Creek Recreation Area provides many opportunities for the public to experience a part of the Missouri National Recreational River. The 205-acre property includes a mix of wetlands, grasslands, riparian cottonwood forest, and mesic-bur oak forest. Rock and sediment exposures along the Missouri River reveal past geologic events. A mowed grass trail is planned for the property to loop through these environments. In the restored prairie, look for dragonflies and butterflies. In the cottonwood and oak forests, watch for wildlife sign including resident whitetail deer and turkey.</p> <h4>How To Get There</h4> <p>Bow Creek Recreation Area is located along Bow Creek and the Missouri River in Cedar County about 2 miles northeast of Wynot, Nebraska.

While the overall landscape has changed with time and while the area is not specifically cited in the Lewis and Clark journals, geologic and riverine scientific study suggests a high probability the island existed during the passage of their expedition in 1804 and 1806. Today the 800-acre property supports a wide variety of wildlife on its sandbars and within its dense forested areas of cottonwood and Eastern red-cedar. Chutes paralleling the island, free-flowing water, vegetation, and sandbars not only provide important wildlife habitat, but add to the aesthetic qualities of the Park’s 59-Mile District.<br /> <br /> Goat Island provides unique and unparalleled recreational opportunities, as well as a place to simply pause and reflect. Situated along the Missouri National Recreational River Water Trail, the island is one of only a few places in both Nebraska and South Dakota where <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mnrr/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm\">island camping</a>, hiking, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mnrr/planyourvisit/hunting.htm\">hunting</a>, and other pleasure activities are available on publicly owned land. As part of the National Park Service System, the island is ideally suited as a stopover point for boaters navigating the river. Similarly, Goat Island provides a natural setting to hike trails or set out on one’s own to explore and enjoy the riverine backdrop.<br /> <br /> <b>Primitive Camping </b><br /> Two designated tent camping only areas. The first (southern) campground area is in the process of being established. The second (northern) is targeted to be established in 2021. Primitive camping is allowed anywhere on the Island, with the exception of the established hunting season after Labor Day to January when camping is restricted to the two designated camping areas. Please email or call (605-665-0209) for a back country use permit issued by the Park's HQ Office.<b> </b><br /> <br /> The Goat Island Management Plan emphasizes the intent to retain the primitive character of the island in permanency. The overarching goal and management objectives outlined in the plan is to provide a quality recreational experience for visitors in the same spirit that historically contributed to the island’s popularity.<br /> Visit the <a href=\"https://parkplanning.nps.gov/document.cfm?parkID=151&projectID=71840&documentID=98316\">Goat Island Management Plan and Environmental Assessment FONSI</a> through the NPS Planning Environment and Public Comment (PEPC) website: <a href=\"https://parkplanning.nps.gov/projectHome.cfm?parkID=151&projectID=71840\">http://parkplanning.nps.gov/goatislandplan</a>.</p>",

This National Park Service property gets its name from the nearby town of Green Island, Nebraska which washed away during the flood of 1881. The town of Green Island was never rebuilt, but the name and story have persisted.<br /> <br /> WWII brought more activity to the Green Island area. German prisoners of war (POWs) were brought to Yankton from Camp Algona in Iowa to work on projects during the late spring/early summer of 1945. The POWs worked to protect the Meridian Bridge and surrounding farmland from erosion caused by the river’s pre-dam flow. Pilings were installed west of the Meridian Bridge to force water away from the bridge abutments. The remnants of these pilings can be seen today on the park’s land-based trail.<br /> <br /> During the last 10 years, Green Island has undergone quite a change. A backwater was restored as a mitigation measure during the construction of the Discovery Bridge. In 2008, the backwater was connected to the main river channel on the downstream end.

He wrote, “Those Bluffs appear to have been laterly on fire, and at this time is too hot for a man to bear his hand in the earth at any debth, gret appearance of Coal. An emence quantity of Cabalt or a Cristolised Substance which answers its discription is on the face of the Bluff.” Ordway further elaborated that the bluff “had a Sulpheras Smell”.<br /> <br /> Following Lewis and Clark, later fur traders and travelers frequently noticed dense smoke and fire in this region. In 1839, French explorer J. N. Nicollet attempted to prove that these phenomena were not of vol­canic origin. He theorized that the decomposition of beds of iron pyrites in contact with water resulted in a heat capable of igniting other combustible materials. Still, by the late 1800s the bluff was known as the Ionia Volcano. It was named after the nearby town of Ionia, established in 1856. In 1878, a flooded Missouri River undermined the bluffs and a large section of the “volcano” fell into the river. The same flood heavily damaged the town of Ionia, which was later completely abandoned. By 1900, there was scientific consensus that the eruptions were due to the heat caused by the oxidation of damp pyritiferous and carbonaceous shale exposed by erosion. The Ponca Tribe consider the bluff to be a sacred site. Located north of Newcas­tle, Nebraska, the Ionia Cemetery is across the road from a small overlook and the top of the Ionia Volcano remnants.<br /> <br /> Learn more at <a href=\"http://www.lewis-clark.org/article/3351 \">Discovering Lewis and Clark</a>",
    "audioDescription": "Geologic formation on a bluff that showcases exposed hillside. Having previous contact with the river, the site has erosion and the river has shifted nearly one mile away from the \"volcano\". The site does not have volcanic activity and the source of the heat resulted from a chemical reaction of the various minerals eroding the bluff. Overtime the Missouri River eroded and washed these minerals away and the base of the bluff is now gone, therefore there is no more seemingly volcanic activity.",

    "bodyText": "The historic structure most readily visible from Yankton's riverfront is the Meridian Bridge. It is notable as the first permanent river crossing in the Yankton vicinity and as one of the final links in the Meridian Highway, an early north-south route from Winnipeg, Canada, to Mexico City, Mexico. The vertical lift design was a typical period engineering solution to a typical problem of spanning a wide navigable river, and thus did not garner much attention in engineering circles in the 1920s. The region's population, however, considered it an outstanding bridge engineering accomplishment that greatly improved economic and social connections across the Nebraska and South Dakota border.<br /> <br /> The Meridian Bridge, officially dedicated on October 11, 1924, was from the first a symbol of local pride, in large part because it had been conceived and built under local leadership. It appeared on souvenir medals and postcards. For many years, Yankton held the local nickname of \"Bridge City.\" The community even considered December 1, 1952, a day of celebration when the wife of former bridge company executive Deloss Gurney paid the last toll and the bridge became officially debt free.<br /> <br /> On October 11, 2009, a new Discovery Bridge was opened to traffic. The Meridian Bridge was closed and soon underwent conversion to pedestrian/bike use. In November 2011 it opened for recreational use. Hiking, biking, running or walking across the bridge is a popular outdoor activity in the Yankton area.<br /> <br /> Yankton is the \"Mother City\" of Dakota, having been settled in 1858. The Meridian bridge was designed for vehicular and railroad crossings--the upper level for cars and the lower level for trains. However, railroad track was never laid and the trains never ran. Built entirely with private funds, the Yankton community officially dedicated the bridge on October 11, 1924. The bridge was the last segment of a highway stretching from the Canadian border to Mexico. This highway is today also known as the Pan American Highway and extends some 17,000 miles down to the southern tip of South America. <br /> <br /> Learn more about the bridge by visiting the Missouri National Recreational River <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mnrr/learn/historyculture/meridianbridge.htm\">Meridian Bridge</a> page. ",
    "audioDescription": "Double deck pedestrian walkway and bicycle path overlooking and above the Missouri River. The lane with the remaining lift mechanism is positioned above the lane below. The steel and concrete structure spans over 3,029 feet in length and 33 feet in width, making it the longest pedestrian bridge connecting two states, South Dakota and Nebraska. Various historic lift mechanisms line the top of the double deck bridge.",

Twice during the expedition, he got lost, and on many occasions he forgot important items—like his tomahawk—and had to retrace his steps to retrieve the property.</p> <p paraeid=\"{8afed2c6-751b-4729-b791-66ed15831f3d}{168}\" paraid=\"2059624470\">Shannon was born in Pennsylvania around 1785. In 1800, his family moved to Ohio to farm land that formerly belonged to Indigenous people and that the U.S. government was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lewis-in-steubenville.htm\">doling out</a> to White settlers. Shannon followed Meriwether Lewis to Kentucky to enlist in the Army and join the expedition. At eighteen, he became the youngest member of the expedition. </p> <p paraeid=\"{8afed2c6-751b-4729-b791-66ed15831f3d}{206}\" paraid=\"1297639477\">Shannon’s first misadventure started in the summer of 1804. On August 26, Shannon and George Drouillard set out to search for two horses that had strayed. The men separated to cover more territory. When Drouillard came back to camp the next day, Shannon had not returned. The captains sent search parties, but Shannon remained missing for sixteen days.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8afed2c6-751b-4729-b791-66ed15831f3d}{238}\" paraid=\"1443196545\">They finally encountered Shannon on September 11. He had apparently found the horses early on but misread some tracks and assumed the expedition had passed him. Shannon therefore proceeded upriver expecting to meet the party, but they were actually downstream of him.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9c78fe7b-97a9-44a1-84e3-07635260e5bb}{1}\" paraid=\"877271837\">When they found Shannon, he was sitting beside the river, “nearly Starved to Death” waiting for a boat to pass. He hadn’t eaten for twelve days, having run out of ammunition for his gun. He foraged some wild grapes and managed to kill a rabbit “by shooting a piece of hard Stick in place of a [musket] ball.”</p> <p paraeid=\"{9c78fe7b-97a9-44a1-84e3-07635260e5bb}{15}\" paraid=\"518279971\">Ponca and Omaha people who lived here knew how to feed themselves and how to find their way home based on thousands of years of ancestral knowledge. Shannon did not. There was food in these woods, there were trails to follow—he just was not from here and did not know where to find them.<br /> <br /> About this article: This article is part of series called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/learn/historyculture/pivotal-places-stories-from-the-lewis-and-clark-national-historic-trail.htm\">“Pivotal Places: Stories from the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.”</a></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt\">On August 25, 1804, Lewis, Clark, and several of their men walked nine miles to Spirit Mound from their camp on the south bank of the Missouri River. They were determined to see the mound that was so feared by the indigenous people of the area. In his journal Clark explained the legend of Spirit Mound:<br /> <br /> “. . . and by the different nations of Indians in this quarter is Suppose to be the residence of Deavels. That they are in human form with remarkable large heads, and about 18 inches high, that they are very watchful and are arm'd with Sharp arrows with which they Can Kill at a great distance; they are Said to kill all persons who are So hardy as to attempt to approach the hill; they state that tradition informs them that many Indians have Suffered by these little people.So much do the Maha [Omaha], Soues [Sioux], Ottoes [Otoes] and other neighboring nations believe this fable, that no Consideration is Sufficient to induce them to approach the hill. One evidence which the Inds give for believing this place to be the residence of some unusial Spirits is that they frequently discover a large assemblage of Birds about this mound . . .”<br /> <br /> The intense heat fatigued everyone, especially Lewis’s dog Seaman who was sent back to the river to rest. Finally, Lewis and Clark reached the top of Spirit Mound where they \"beheld a most beautiful landscape; Numerous herds of buffalo were seen feeding in various direction; the Plain to the North N.W. and N.E. extends without interruption as far as can be seen.\"<br /> <br /> Today, Spirit Mound is one of the few remaining physical features on the Upper Missouri River that is readily identifiable as a place Lewis and Clark visited and recorded.<br /> <br /> Spirit Mound is a High Potential Historic Site on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lecl/index.htm\">Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.</a><br /> <br /> On August 25, 1804, Lewis, Clark, and ten other men hiked about nine miles north of the Missouri River to visit Spirit Mound. According to Clark, the Omaha, Sioux, and Oto tribes traditionally believed that the hill was inhabited by devils “in human form with remarkable large heads and about 18 Inches high”. They were said to be “Very watchfull” and “arm’d with Sharp arrows with which they Can Kill at a great distance”. The men encountered no such inhabitants, but found a hill “Situated on an elivated plain in a leavel and ex­tensive prarie […] with a Steep assent to the hight of 65 or 70 feet, leaveing a leavel Plain on the top of 12 feet in width & 90 in length”. Clark observed that soil consistencies with the surrounding terrain indicated the “mound” was a natural landform. He wrote of the view, “from the top of this Mound we beheld a most butifull landscape; Numerous herds of buffalow were Seen feeding in various directions, the Plain to North N. W & N E extends without interuption as far as Can be Seen.”<br /> <br /> In 1868, European-Americans began to settle in the area. Over time, Spirit Mound was extensively degrad­ed by the impacts of livestock and crop production. By the early 1980s, the landscape was cluttered with over 20 buildings, a feedlot, agricultural fields, roads, fences, and about 1,500 non-native trees. The locally-formed Spirit Mound Trust worked with the Land and Water Conservation Fund to purchase the 320-acre site from private owners, and then donated it to the state of South Dakota for restoration and preservation. The Spirit Mound Historic Prairie was established as a state park in 2001, with a focus on prairie restora­tion. In 2004, the Spirit Mound Summit Trail was designated as a national recreation trail.</p> <p><br /> <strong>Diverse Meanings - Diverse Cultures</strong><br /> Spirit Mound has taken on a variety of cultural meanings that reflect the beliefs of the diverse peoples that make up the American population. It is an important point of contact between the American Indians and Euro-Americans. It exemplifies a sometimes uneasy fusion of these two major cultural traditions.</p> <p><strong>Native Meanings - The Mandan</strong><br /> For American Indians, Spirit Mound is both physical location and spiritual place, a place of contact between the natural and the supernatural world. The sacred Turtle Drums of the Mandan were created at Spirit Mound. At Spirit Mound, Lone Man saved the Mandans' ancestors from a great flood. The first shrine built to commemorate Lone Man's saving the Mandan was built at Spirit Mound.</p> <p><strong>Native Meanings - Yankton (Sioux)</strong><br /> For the Yankton (Sioux), Spirit Mound is associated with the <em>Can O'ti na</em>, Little Tree Dwellers/Little People. Long ago two tribes battled to a stalemate. They both sought help from the spirits at Spirit Mound. They tried to manipulate the spirits for their own purposes. Their manipulation failed, but it brought two types of spirits into this world. The larger Spirits moved west to become Sasquatch, but the <em>Can O'ti na</em> stayed in the area and can still be seen there today.</p> <p><strong>Native Meanings - Lakota (Sioux)</strong><br /> In Lakota (Sioux) tradition, Spirit Mound is also associated with the <em>Can O'ti la</em>. In the distant past, Iktomi (Trickster) persuaded the Raccoon people to try to change their nature. The <em>Can O'ti la</em> are descendants of two modified Raccoon children. As the <em>Can O'ti la</em> grew, they walked upright and used their paws like hands. They also became mischievous and played tricks on men. Men were led astray and sometimes died. Later in time at Spirit Mound, the Can O'ti la were transformed into spirit helpers of men. Spirit Mound is the origin point for the <em>Wo'piye Can O'ti la</em>, the Little Tree Dweller's Medicine Bundle. This medicine bundle is still in use today by the Lakota of the Dakotas and Nebraska.</p> <p>This coming together of the American Indians and Euro-American peoples had a downside. At Spirit Mound, the Winged One predicted that the <em>Can O'ti la</em> would be forced away from Spirit Mound when the true children (European-Americans) of the trickster <em>Iktomi</em> arrived. For some, Lewis & Clark's visit to Spirit Mound marks the beginning of the end of Lakota traditional lifeways.<br /> <br /> For more information, visit the <a href=\"http://www.spiritmound.com/\">Spirit Mound Trust</a> website. </p>",

The Can O’ti na sometimes behaved mischievously and played tricks on humans. They could also serve as spiritual helpers. Today, Lakota ceremonies still include the Little Tree Dweller’s Medicine Bundle.

Clark wrote, “Capt Lewis & my Self walked up, to the top which forms a Cone and is about 70 feet higher than the high lands around it, the Bass is about 300 foot in decending this Cupola, discovered a Village of Small animals that burrow in the grown (those animals are Called by the french Pitite Chien).” They managed to kill one prairie dog and capture a second, which joined the expedition and survived the winter at Fort Mandan. In the spring, it (along with other collected specimens) was sent downriver and transported to Washington, D.C., to be received by President Jefferson on October 4, 1805. Lewis and Clark are credited with the first scientific description of the prairie dog, or Cynomys ludovicianus. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the Tower has changed very little since it was first documented by Lewis and Clark. Located about a half-mile south of the Missouri River in Boyd County, Nebraska, the landform rises an ad-ditional 70 feet above a line of bluffs along the southern edge of the Missouri valley. The surrounding land-scape is characterized by open prairie and burr oak woodlands. In 2005, a 524-acre conservation easement was enacted to protect the Tower and the environs. Although the site is privately owned, it can be viewed from multiple vantage points along nearby roadways.",

    "bodyText": "The British Trading Post was established in 1690, and consisted of a five-sided stockade and two interior buildings. The longest wall paralleled the ancient trading path adjacent to it and had two openings, probably gates. The smallest ‘gate’ was five feet in length and possibly used for pedestrian traffic. The length of the second ‘gate’ suggests use for the pack horses loaded with incoming trading goods and outgoing deer skins.<br /> <br /> Most trading posts of this era had a building for trading, including merchandise storage and a warehouse for storing the deer skins prior to shipment. Excavations at the site revealed Indian construction techniques (wattle and daub) consistent with the practice of using Indian labor. The smaller building was approximately 11 x 11 feet and adjacent to the largest entrance. A second structure was in the southwestern area of the stockade and measured 15 x 25 feet.",

The Great Temple Mound is where the village chief would have lived, and was built in four separate stages with clay steps going up the northern slope. It’s estimated that 10 million baskets of dirt, weighing about 60 pounds each, were used to build the 55-feet-tall mound!

Today, the mound measures three feet high. The mound was likely built near the end of the Mississippian period since it was built outside of the village fortifications; hinting that the village expanded beyond the originial fortifications over time.<br /> <br /> The Southeast Mound is located at the end of the Southeast Mound trail and at one end of the Bartram Trail (either the beginning or end, depending on which way you start).",

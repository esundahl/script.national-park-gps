    "bodyText": "According to local legend, John Green built this building sometime around 1868. Green sold mining supplies and general stock. By 1884, the building was occupied by a confectionery as well as a dry goods store. In 1888, the south storefront was still occupied by a dry goods store, but the north storefront was occupied by a coffin showroom, probably owned by the Argall brothers, John and William. They operated a furniture and undertaking business here until at least 1900. The combination of furniture and undertaking was common in those years. Cabinet-making skills used for making fine furniture were equally applicable to the production of caskets. Soon after they opened their business here, the Argalls moved to the south storefront, and the north storefront was occupied by a fruit and confectionery store again for several years. By 1908, William Kehl had a saloon in the south storefront, and Athens Anegone had the fruit and confectionery store next door. Anegone also ran a cigar factory upstairs. In the 1950s and 60s this building was home to the very popular Franklin Fountain, and later the Town House Restaurant. It became home to Copper World when Tony and Joyce Bausano purchased the building in 1977.",
    "audioDescription": "The John Green block is located at 101 Fifth Street in downtown Calumet. Local legend states that John Green built the building around 1868. Originally Green sold mining supplies and general goods. This building has had many uses over its history including selling furniture and housing and undertaker. Now it servers as a giftshop named Copper World which sells all kinds of local goods. The building is two stories tall with a flat roof which is lower in the back of the building than the front. Green trim highlights the storefront windows on the first floor of the front of the building.",

    "bodyText": "The lot where the Kinsman block now stands was previously occupied by a wood-frame two-story duplex with a stable at the back. In 1898 the duplex was demolished, and W.C. Kinsman built the existing sandstone building. It was designed by architect Charles Maass and built by masonry contractor Paul Roehm and carpentry contractor Bajari & Ulseth. Initially, the north storefront housed Kinsman’s horse and carriage supply store, specializing in harnesses, saddles, whips, ropes, blankets, and bells. Kinsman was known as the pioneer harness dealer in the area, having started in business in 1872.<br /> By 1903, the building was home to The Economy Store, H. E. Lean and Sons, proprietors, which occupied both storefronts and carried general merchandise. The Esther Hotel occupied the upper floors. Harold E. Lean and Joseph A. Lean also lived upstairs for a time in the early 20th century. In the 1910s, Kinsman’s son Frank opened a hardware store in the south storefront with Charles C. Wagner. Wagner remained in business here until sometime after 1948.",
    "audioDescription": "The Kinsman Block is located at the corner of Sixth and Scott streets in downtown Calumet. The building was constructed in 1898 when W.C. Kinsman tore down the previous two-story duplex. The building stands three stories and is built from red and white Jacobsville sandstone. The front, southern face, of the building has two stores on the first story with a main entrance in the center. The upper two floors are laid out for dwellings. A circular tower extends off the southeast corner of the building and runs from the second story to above the third story. This building has a flat roof that is slightly higher in the southern portion than the northern.",

The second floor was occupied by the law office of Galbraith & McCormack, as well as the Calumet Township Clerk’s office. Ulseth lived on 8th Street in Red Jacket. He and his family are remembered for their support of the Norwegian Lutheran Church on 7th Street. Ulseth also served as the vice-president of the First National Bank of Calumet for a time. Ulseth owned and probably also built the building to the south of here, which was very similar to this building, and he also owned the buildings to the north of here.

    "bodyText": "Joseph Hermann learned the jeweler’s and watchmaker’s trade in Germany before he immigrated to Eagle River in 1863. He established his own business there in 1865 and moved it to Calumet Location (just east of here) in 1868. In 1870, he moved the business to this location, in a two-story wood-frame building, with a stone vault attached to the north side. Around 1890, it was replaced with a two-story brick building, which forms the oldest part of the building existing today. In about 1894, the second storefront with a second story was added to the building on the north side; a third story was added around 1905.<br /> From about 1894 until about 1910, the north storefront was occupied by Louis Sibilsky’s dry goods store, also an old Eagle River business. By 1916, Joseph Hermann had died, and the business was run by the Hermann Brothers Company, consisting of John and Lucas Hermann, and Paul Tritschler. In 1942, the jewelry business still occupied the south storefront, and The Calumet Hardware Company occupied the north. By 1957, the jewelry business had moved to 316 6th Street, and the hardware store had taken over both storefronts here.",
    "audioDescription": "The Hermann Block is located at 109-111 fifth street in downtown Calumet. This building was constructed by Joseph Hermann between 1890 and 1905. The block is made from red brick and stands three stories tall. The first story has tall display windows with two single entrances, one for each side of the building which is split in the middle. The second and third stories have large rectangular windows, 8 on each story, facing the road. Ornate semicircular copper decorations are located above the third story windows: two large ones in the center of each building half, and smaller ones flanking the large ones. The roof of the building is flat and a brick chimney can be seen protruding above it on the southern face of the building.",

    "bodyText": "Here stood the Holman Block and two other contributing structures to the Calumet National Historic Landmark District. They were destroyed by fire on May 21, 2021.<br /> <br /> These buildings contained apartments, commercial enterprises, and more than 100 years of memories. On the evening of May 21, 2021 and into the night, a disastrous fire of unknown causes destroyed this substantial portion of the block. Heroic efforts by community members ensured that residents made it safely out; twelve local units of volunteer firefighters led by Calumet’s own ensured that the fire spread no further.<br /> <br /> The Holman block was built around 1896, replacing a two-story wood frame building housing a watcher, photographer, and grocer. Holman and Williams were grocers. In 1900, they rented the other half of their store to Izzy Blumenthal, who sold dry goods and clothes. Later, the Holman Block shared space with a gallery for the flourishing medium of photography. ",
    "audioDescription": "The Holman Block is located at the corner of Fifth and Portland streets in downtown Calumet. The building was constructed in 1896 with a wood frame and brick exterior. Originally one building, it was split down the center around 1900 and held many businesses including a photo gallery, salon, hardware and general store, furrier and ladies clothing, and more. This three-story building now has off-white siding but has retained the red and green accents above the windows and top of the flat roof on the Fifth street side. A sign just off center of the roof detail reads “Holman Block Seffie’s 1896.” The first floor was used for shop space while the upper second and third stories were used for dwellings. There are two single door entrances on the first floor off Fifth street and one off Portland Street. A sign on the first floor of the Fifth street side reads “Calumet Laundromat.”",

In 1898 the proprietor, Louis Hennes, lived in Detroit and the store here was managed by Adolph Hennes who lived upstairs. By 1903, a saloon owned by John O’Neil moved into the south storefront here. By 1912, the Orensteins purchased the building and had their own shop in the north storefront selling furs. By 1930, Carpenters Closet occupied the north storefront selling women’s clothing and furnishings (accessories). Carpenters remained in business here until ca. 1990, eventually taking over the south storefront as well. In the intervening years, the south storefront was occupied by Millers Market, a Sears store, and other businesses. For a while in the early 20th-century, photographer William Nara’s studio was located in a commercial space at the back of the first floor with an entrance on Portland Street and there was a bowling alley in the basement.",

George Jacka worked at the Cliff Mine before coming to Red Jacket in 1868 and working as a timber contractor for C&H. In 1875, he established a grocery business and built the first commercial building on this site shortly thereafter. Between 1884 and 1888, that structure was remodeled into a two-story brick-veneered double-storefront building. Around 1890 Jacka added a livery stable to his business enterprises, located at the back of the lot. In 1904 the first Jacka Block burned in a fire thought to have been started to cover up a burglary. At that time the south storefront was occupied by jeweler J. J. Ellis, and the north storefront by druggist Charles Fichtel. Upstairs were offices of the Calumet and Arizona Mining Company, W. W. Ellis insurance agent, and Drs. Labarge and Watson. Jacka quickly rebuilt after the fire. The entire main floor of the new building was designed for and occupied by the Merchants and Miners Bank. Merchants and Miners and its successor institutions occupied this building until 2007.",
    "audioDescription": "The Jacka Block located at 200 Fifth street in downtown Calumet was first built by George Jacka just after 1875. Between 1884 and 1888 it had its first remodel to a two-story brick-veneered double storefront building. Between 1900 and 1908 the building changed from general retail space to a bank and was again remodeled between 1908 and 1917 to have a stone veneer on the north and west sides of the first floor. The Jacka Block stands today as a two-story building with stone façade on the first floor and red brick on the second floor. The west side of the first floor has large display windows and two entrances: one on the north end and one in the south corner. The second floor has rectangular two pane windows that are slightly recessed into the building with brick separations between sets of two.

    "bodyText": "Peter Ruppe Jr. opened the Calumet branch of Ruppe & Sons in 1869. The existing building was first constructed after the Red Jacket fire of 1870. It was originally only two stories tall. In 1899 a third story and a new store front were constructed to keep up with growing demand and competition from other stores, such as Vertin's Department Store on Oak Street. The Ruppe's success in the mercantile business allowed them to invest in banks and mining companies, and they were active in local government. In 1923 the Ruppe family sold the building to the JC Penny Company, which moved from a smaller location in Calumet. In 1980 JC Penny's moved to the new Copper Country Mall in Houghton, and closed both the store in Calumet, and a store in downtown Houghton. Though briefly occupied by a fitness center, the Ruppe building has been mostly vacant since.",

The first floor facing Fifth street has some remaining tall store-front windows, while most are boarded over with white painted boards. A double-door entrance is in the center of the building with a single door on the south end. The ornate facade on the second and third stories is made from brick and red terracotta. Three tall arch-topped windows sit at the center of the building with tall rectangular windows. Tall Romanesque columns sit between the arch-toped windows. Four circular windows sit even spaced above the five windows on that span between the second and third floors. An ornate cornice sits atop the building which has faded to a dark gray color.",

It was home to many businesses including C. J. Sorsen’s Suomalainen Apteeki (Finnish pharmacy), the Bee Hive Shoe Store, and the Calumet post office. The building to the north was occupied by a tailor and Victor Herman’s photography studio, for a time. Sometime around 1940, the J. J. Newberry 5 and 10 cent store moved into the building. They remodeled the main floor and removed the front staircase to the second floor. 214 5th Street was demolished, and the addition was built, further expanding the sales floor. Newberry’s was a classic dime store and included a lunch counter and soda fountain.",

    "bodyText": "This building was built by Vital Coppo in 1902. After working in the mines, Coppo established a boarding house here in 1874. A wood-frame building previously occupied this site. In 1875 he opened a saloon on the first floor of the house carrying wines, liquors, and cigars. After 25 years in business he was able to afford to build this larger, more substantial commercial building. The Coppo family lived upstairs and rented apartments as well. Over the years storefronts here were occupied by a saloon and pool hall. John Schenk, the proprietor, also lived upstairs. A merchant tailor John Rastello advertised that he had the finest domestic and imported woolens in stock. A nurse, Rebecca Douglass, also lived upstairs. Other businesses located here over the years include a plumber and pipe fitter, Battista Picchiottino, and the Houghton County Electric Light Company – as the local electric utility company was known. The Coppo Block was a given a new lease on life when it was acquired and rehabilitated by its current owners Jim and Stacey Flood, after a fire in the third floor in 1998.",
    "audioDescription": "The Coppo building stands at 215 to 217 Sixth street in downtown Calumet. Vital Coppo worked in the mines and established a boardinghouse on this site in 1874. A saloon was opened on the first floor of the house and by 1902 Coppo had enough money to build a much larger three-story red sandstone building which housed businesses like billiards, a salon, and tailor. Today the first floor of this building has large storefront windows. Three entrances are on the first floor; one in the center of the building and two evenly spaced on either side of it. The second story has rectangular windows while the third story has arch-topped windows with circular port-style windows spaced between the arches.",

That early building was built sometime between 1870 and 1884. In 1884 it was occupied by a saloon and by 1888 became a drug store and remained so for many years. By 1898, and perhaps before, it was known as the Eagle Drug Store, J. W. Clemo, proprietor. The Eagle Drug Store sold many postcards and copper souvenirs in the late 19th and early 20th century which are still popular among collectors today.<br /> Advertisements from the store include “Physicians Prescriptions and Family Recipes,” “Choice Candies Constantly in Stock,” “The Latest Drinks at Soda Fountain,” and “Pure Drugs & Fair Charges. If you figure close, give us a trial.” By 1917 the building was occupied by a jewelry store, the Warren Jewelry Company. In 1930 Frank Marzene’s photo studio resided there. Marzene moved down the street by 1940, and by about 1950 the old building was replaced by the existing building which was home to a barbershop.",

    "bodyText": "Known as the 'big store' in the Copper Country, the Vertin Brother's Department Store sold many necessities and novelties to satisfy a variety of customers from the sophisticated socialite to the common miner. This corner was previously occupied by the Provincial House, a small wood-frame hotel and saloon. In 1891 Slovenian immigrants John and Joseph Vertin built the lower two floors of the existing building. Business boomed, and in 1899, two additional stories were added to the building according to designs by architect Charles Maas. Later, another one-story addition was made to the south side of the building, on a site formerly occupied by a barbershop and three dwellings. The heating plant in the Vertin building at one time supplied steam heat to handful of other nearby buildings. The store eventually expanded across the alley into the Caesar Block next door, which housed the menswear department. However, in 1985, with mines closed and thousands of families gone, the store shut its doors after nearly 100 years of serving the community.",
    "audioDescription": "The building located at 216-220 Sixth street was built for the Vertin Brother’s Department Store. The original building was built around 1885 and had two stories made of red sandstone and had an orate cornice. Between 1899 and 1900 two additional stories made of red brick were added on top to expand the building and the ornate cornice moved to the new roofline. The first floor has large display windows and a set of three pairs of entrance doors on its north side. The second floor has rectangular windows with arched tops. Evidence of the original cornice can still be seen between the second and third floors. The third floor has large rectangular windows, and the fourth floor has arch topped windows like the second floor. The roof cornice covers the north and western faces of the building.",

Henry and Benjamin Blum also owned or operated saloons at 464 5th Street and 417 Pine Street.<br /> By 1912 the Blums had closed their saloon here and this storefront was occupied by a drugstore for many years thereafter. In 1930 it was known as the Metropolitan Pharmacy, a Rexall store. At that time offices upstairs were occupied by conservation officer Joseph J. Werschay, chiropractor Thomas M. Uksila, the Calumet Mutual Fire Insurance Company, and veterinary surgeon James O’Neil. 220 5th Street was then occupied by Herman Jewelers which was one of the oldest businesses in Calumet.",

It was built sometime around 1890, and it was occupied by a clothing store as early as 1893, and probably before. By 1898, it was occupied by Hosking and Company’s dry goods, clothing, and men’s furnishings (accessories) store. Annie M. Hosking was the proprietor of the store; her husband, William, managed the store as well as serving as postmaster of the Calumet post office. Sometime around 1906 the Hoskings sold the store, and it continued in business as the Red Front Store. By 1916, Ed Haas & Company had taken over the building for the Calumet branch of their Houghton store, which sold men's clothing. Vertin Brothers Department Store later bought out the Haas store and built a connecting addition across the alley between their buildings. When Vertin’s closed in 1985 nearly a hundred years of clothing sales in this building came to an end.",

The north part of this site now occupied by the two-story portion of the existing building was occupied by a shed and a stable. Sometime between 1893 and 1897, the existing two-story building was built. It was owned by Edward Ryan and used as a warehouse and heating plant for the Ryan store across the alley from this building on 5th Street. Steam was also sold to neighboring buildings for heat, and supplied through steam tunnels. In 1898, the house on this site was occupied by Eliza Bastian, the widow of Richard Bastian. She rented the blacksmith shop to various blacksmiths over the years. On May 17, 1917, the Ryan store was destroyed in a catastrophic fire. By July of that year, the two-story part of this building served as the Obenhoff Ice Cream Company’s factory. Sometime in the 1940s, the Bastian buildings were removed, and the one-tory wing was added to this building, with a remodeled front. Sometime between 1948 and 1957, Jilbert’s Dairy bought this building, and their operations were based here until they moved to Marquette in the 1970s.",

Ryan, was head of the Anaconda Copper Company in Butte, Montana, and was one of the wealthiest people in the United States in the early 20th century. The original wood-frame store building here was destroyed in the great fire of 1870, but Ryan soon rebuilt. In 1887, he erected a large brick store building here on the same site. Edward Ryan died in 1900, but while the store was managed by his estate, a third story was added to the building, sometime around 1905. In 1917, the store was destroyed in another catastrophic fire. It was never rebuilt. These lots sat vacant for many years, until the Michigan American Water Company was established in 1959, and the existing office building was erected here.",

    "bodyText": "The lots last used by the Keweenaw Home Nursing and Hospice building were formerly occupied by several historic buildings. By 1893, the lots were occupied by 5 houses, a stable, and a saloon. In 1897, there were 8 houses on these lots. By 1908, there were four houses on lot 8, the south lot, and a four-story apartment building with two commercial storefronts had been constructed on the front half of lot 7, the north lot. This impressive building was probably built by the Vertin family. In 1908, the storefronts on lot 7 were occupied by a grocery store, and a tailor.     <br /> By 1917, there were four storefronts; two were occupied by barbers, one by a tailor, and one by a print shop. By 1928, Lot 8 was occupied by a one-story garage known as Taxi Pete’s. The lots now used for parking were once home to other historic buildings as well, including Gately-Wiggins Company’s three-story department store, the Swedish ME Church and parsonage, and two other houses. Taxi Pete’s, the Vertin apartment building, and the Gately-Wiggins store were all destroyed in a catastrophic fire in 1972. The church and parsonage were later demolished.",
    "audioDescription": "The block at 311 Sixth street in downtown Calumet has a varied history. It was originally an area for housing but between 1917 and 1942 changed to feature a single-story garage. Today a single-story red brick building stands with flat roof. Three square windows can be seen directly next to each other on the north end of the eastern side.",

    "bodyText": "Charles Fromholz was born in 1844. He immigrated to the United States in 1871 and settled in Red Jacket where he worked as a barber. He also invested in real estate, including this property. This building was probably built after his death in 1901, by his estate. In 1884, this site was occupied by a wood-frame building with two storefronts. It was occupied by a variety of businesses, including a barber, a printshop, a dry goods and clothing store, a grocery store, a fruit store, a saloon, and a jewelry store. The existing building was built sometime between 1900 and 1908. In 1917, J C Penny opened a store here, before they moved to the Ruppe Department Store building in 1923. Then the McLogan & Pearce Music Company was here until it was purchased by the Weidelmann family in 1930, and moved to the Murphy Block. In the ‘30s and ‘40s, Harter Brothers Pool Room was located here. It is said that the mob boss of the Copper Country ran operations from a booth here, during the hey-day of the mafia in this area. By 1948 the bar here was known as The 315 Club. It became the UP Pub in 1978.",

Today it stands as a two-story concrete block building with brick façade on the front. The first floor has been painted blue and also has wood in the façade. Two large windows flank a single entrance door in the center. A small eve hangs the length of the building’s front and a sign above the door reads “BAR.” The second story has a red painted brick façade and a flat roof.",

This building was built sometime before 1884. In that year, it was occupied by a saloon called The Fashion owned by Martin G. Messner. The Fashion sold wine, liquor, and cigars – “everything after the latest fashion.” By 1903 William Jones was the proprietor of the saloon and had renamed it. The Ivy Saloon operated until at least 1916. By 1930 Albert Ford had purchased the business, changing the menu to soft drinks during the prohibition era. By 1948, prohibition was long over, and the name of the business had changed once again to Wheeler’s Tavern, as bars were known at the time. Wheeler’s was in business here until at least 1957.",

The saloon here was first known as Curto’s Place. Sometime between 1897 and 1900, the house was demolished, and the back part of the existing building was built in its place. The Shute family took over the business from the Curto family between 1916 and 1926. During prohibition, the bar officially sold “near-beer” and other soft-drinks, but according to family stories, also clandestinely sold alcoholic beverages in the basement. Workers in the soft drink parlor would tap on the radiator pipes to alert patrons in the basement when enforcement officials came in for an inspection. In 1989, the Shute family sold the building and the business; it is currently owned by John Vertin and Brad Wagner. The village of Calumet owns the elaborate backbar and stained-glass canopy.",

The first floor has large display windows with detailed yellow and red trim. Two doors are located on the front: one in the center of the building and one on the far south end. The second story has two rectangular two-pane windows evenly spaced apart. Numerous windows sit on both the first and second floors of the south face of the building.

Around 1904 Dusala Barsotti opened a confectionery here with Angelo Dell’Osso. By 1907, the Barsotti family had bought out Dell’Osso, and ran the business until about 1960.

Sometime between 1901 and 1903, 423 5th Street became a Singer sewing machine shop. In an era when many people still made their own clothes, a sewing machine was an important appliance in the home and required a significant financial investment. Then sometime between 1917 and 1930 it became a barber shop, managed by Percy Penberthy, who resided at 209 Tamarack Street in Laurium.",

The front of the building facing the road has tall display windows next to the single entrance door located on the northern end of this face. The second story has two rectangular windows evenly spaced apart. There is a decorative red and yellow cornice set just below the flat roofline.

    "bodyText": "In the 1880s this lot was vacant. Sometime between 1888 and 1893, a two-story house was erected here. In 1898, it was occupied by Joseph A., Louis L., Mary, Archibald, Alphonse, Alexander L., and Albert A. Munch. The Munch family lived here until at least 1905. Around 1906, the house was demolished, and the existing building was built. In 1907, it was occupied by a saloon owned by Eric Macki. In 1916 the saloon was owned by Samuel Michaels.<br /> By 1928 the building was used as a print shop and has been since. In 1930 the shop belonged to the Finnish Republican Printing Company, which published a Finnish semi-weekly called Valvoja (The Guardian); Edward Keish was president of the company, and Jacob Utti was secretary and treasurer. Today, it is a job shop called Copper Island Printing.",

Prior to that, he had worked as a miner at the Central Mine. When he came to Red Jacket, Dunstan sold sewing machines, books, picture frames, notions, and organs. By 1893, the earlier Dunstan building was occupied by a saloon. When the existing building was first built, the main floor was occupied by a store known as a bazaar, selling picture frames and other items. The second floor was occupied by one or two apartments. The third floor was occupied by a lodge hall used by the Cornish fraternal group, the Sons of St. George. By 1917, the main floor here was occupied by a dress factory, and apartments occupied both upper floors of the building. In the 1920s, Gorshe Brothers bicycle and motorcycle shop was located here. From sometime before 1930 until about 2001, the Dunstan Block was home to Mullen’s Dry Cleaners. Artis Books and Antiques moved here just a couple years later, around 2003.",

    "bodyText": "For most of its history, this corner of Oak and Sixth Streets has been occupied by some kind of hostelry and/or a saloon. In 1884, it was home to a boarding house called the Anglo American Hotel. By 1893, there was a saloon here. In 1898, the saloon was managed by Jacob Petersen. By 1903, it was known as the Michigan House.<br /> In 1905, the Bosch brewing company purchased the property, demolished the old wood-frame building, and erected the existing building as an outlet for its lagers and other brews. This building was designed by architect Charles Maas. The Bosch Brewing Company eventually became one of the largest employers in the Copper Country, second only to the Calumet & Hecla Mining Company. They operated many saloons throughout the area in addition to their brewery in Lake Linden, and a number of distribution facilities known as beer depots. The Michigan House is now home to another local brewery, the Red Jacket Brewing Company.",

The current three-story brick structure was built in 1903 and it now houses the Michigan House Café and Red Jacket Brewing Co. Brick on the first floor has been covered in yellow/green façade with red accents around the windows and entrances. There are two entrances on the first floor, one on the southeast corner and the other on the southwest corner. The second and third stories have yellow brick exterior with large rectangular windows featuring red trim.

    "audioDescription": "The Dryhouse is located Northeast of Red Jacket Road between the Colosseum and the Drill Shop. The building is constructed from poor-rock with wide light-grey mortar lines. Large, squared blocks of poor-rock were used in the corners. The building is one story tall with a shallow-pitched roof toped with silver-colored corrugated metal. The eastern side of the building has two entrances with light-grey brick arches over top. Four panel windows with similar arches sit above these doors, one of which is covered in rusty-blue corrugated metal. Small windows with arches and covered in the same metal flank the entrances. On the south side of the building numerous small window holes have been covered in rusting corrugated metal.",

The right side, that one closest to Depot Street still has the original poor-rock wall visible that also maintains the curve of the original structure. The Depot Street face has a small white metal garage door. Around the corner to the Mine street side has a single person door with a brick arch above it along with two old windows with brick arches above now covered with white siding. To the left of these windows is a large rectangular aluminum structure that propped above the ground. To the left of this is a dark-grey brick addition with a loading dock door and single person door. Finally, to the left of the addition is another portion of the original poor-rock building. This section has a single person entrance with a brick arch above it. This door sits above the ground surface and is accessed by metal stairs.

The Warehouse was designed by Calumet and Hecla’s architectural staff. It stands 2½ stories tall. This industrial building has an exterior of red brick masonry with a basalt rock foundation. Built alongside a railroad spur to facilitate deliveries, the interior of the warehouse features parallel rows of storage bays along a central passage. Inside, you would have found various items necessary for mining - from helmets and boots, to spare nuts and bolts.",
    "audioDescription": "A two-story, red brick warehouse building stands in the former C&H Industrial Core. The long building once had railroad tracks running along the west side. Tall windows on the first and second floors, run the length of the building and provided much needed natural light to this large industrial building. Two side entrances include a loading dock platform at the middle of the east side of the building with a small gabled entrance just to the north of the loading dock. A large gravel parking lot to the east of the building extends to Mine Street with trees and grass to the south of the parking lot. The pitched roof is a gray asphalt roof with a dormer at the center of the length of the building.",

The tracks have been removed, but the large doors allowing trains to pass through the building remain. The building is co-owned by Calumet Township and the school district.",

This long rectangular building extends perpendicular to Red Jacket Road. Its main entrance is just of the road and consists of two large wooden doors with a person door located just to the right of it. Paneled windows almost completely coat the building near the roofline around its entirety. The warehouse is made from green-colored corrugated metal. The foundation is dark-grey poor rock with evident light-grey grout lines. The building has a very shallow pitched roof with corrugated metal on top.",

    "bodyText": "The first school in the Calumet area was built in 1867 and was a one-room building. By 1875 the population had drastically expanded, so the Calumet and Hecla company built the original Washington School at a cost of $15,000. The support of C&H allowed the company influence over curriculum and activities. However, with constantly increasing population by 1915 the original school was not capable of supporting local students. The original building was moved, and additions were made to support this larger body of students. The latest additions to the school included the purchase of land behind the school and building of new elementary school which opened in 1998. Today these schools and their later additions continue to serve the Calumet-Laurium-Keweenaw School District.",
    "audioDescription": "The Calumet schools are located at the corner of Calumet and School streets on the Northwest side of Calumet St. The schools are built in a U shape with three buildings built at three different times connecting to each other. All three buildings are constructed from red brick. The building on the west as seen from Calumet St. is the oldest and darkest red in color. It is four stories tall with the first story partially underground. Two main entrances for this building are in the center of the U, or the east side of this building. The south side facing the road has a zigzagging metal fire escape leading to the top floor. White Greek-revival concrete runs as trim for the roof. The northern most building is the newest and runs parallel to Calumet St. Three large, paneled windows sit in the middle of this building with two entrances flanking them to the right and left. The eastern building has a gothic style of architecture that stands in contrast to the other buildings. One entrance is located on the face near the road and three are in the center of the U. Windows run around the building. A digital sign encased in brick and a flagpole are located in the very center of the U next to Calumet St.",

The three-story building is mostly built of red and white Jacobsville sandstone with some yellow brick on the front face's second and third stories. The front, west face of the building has two main entrances. The entrance on the north has an embellished sandstone arch and peaked roof. The southern and larger entrance has an arched covered roof that juts out from the building to the edge of the sidewalk at the street. The roof over this entrance is flat with red sandstone railings with three decorative caps on the side closest to the road. The second and third stories of the western face are ornately decorated with many rectangular and arch-roped windows along with a green false roofline above the second story. A clocktower extends to a fourth story in the western center of the building. A metal staircase leads to a man door on the second story of the southern face of the building. The theater was opened on March 20, 1900 and sat on the Broadway tour loop. Despite being converted to a movie theater at one point in its life, the building has been restored to a working theater once more. Shows and tours are offered year-round.",

    "audioDescription": "The Carnegie Museum is located at the corner of Huron Street and East Montezuma Avenue in downtown Houghton. The foundation of this one-story building is made from large red Jacobsville sandstone bricks. The main story is made from red brick with Greek revival pillars on either side of the main entrance which is in the center of the building. A false arch roof stands over the main entrance while the rest of the building has a flat roof. A large block of sandstone mounted over the entrance doors reads “public library.” Two large rectangular windows with red sandstone slabs on top flank the main entrance. Ornate dark red stone trim highlights the space between the top of the windows and the roofline. An iron fence runs along the edge of the path leading from the street to the main entrance. The Carnegie Museum building started its life as a public library in 1910. In 2006 the library moved, and the building was repurposed as a museum by the fall of that year. In 2012 the museum underwent an extensive renovation and preservation project to ensure its life for the future. The first-floor features exhibits on local history, while the basement is finished and used for events.",

On the second story there are six tall rectangular windows with arched tops. The roof is flat, but the eastern front has three different types of arches. The northern one is a smooth peak. The central and widest one is a stepped peak. The southern arch extends as part of a tower above the roofline and was used for drying fire hoses. The museum was built in 1898 and served as a fire hall until 1964. In 1974 the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and now servers as a museum.",

The building itself is made from round timbers at the base and wooden panels above it. Four windows, tow on each side of the entrance door located in the middle of the building, are framed with red shutters. The main door and the window trim are all white while the building is painted a deep brown. The Delaware mine operated for forty years but never made a profit for its investors. Despite its commercial failure, it is a prime example of what mines in the Keweenaw looked like during the 1800s. Visitors can explore the ruins still left above ground and venture below ground to view one of the shafts and the technology used to extract ore.",

The right, east side, building is a two-story building with a shallow pitched roof sloping west and east. Two garage doors form the front of the building with person entrances on the eastern face for both the first and second story.

The Italian Hall building was a two-story brick structure with space for commercial businesses on the ground floor and a large meeting hall with a stage on the second story. During a party here on Christmas Eve of 1913, a false cry of \"fire\" incited a panic that claimed the lives of over 70 people, many of those children. The building was demolished in 1984 amid concerns for public safety. A memorial park was created with the original stone archway repositioned in the center of the lot. Behind the building's reconstructed entrance arch, a granite monument lists the names of those lost. Interpretive panels tell the story of the disaster.<br /> <br /> A memorial service is hosted at the site each year on December 24th.</p>",

A brick pathway leads from the sidewalk through the arch to a 8 foot tall stone monument that has engraved in white letters, the name of each person who perished in the Italian Hall event.

The 1887 building was designed by Boston-based architects Shaw & Hunnewell. It was constructed of mosaic-like poor rock and field stone with brick trim. Mining operations were directed from here and the offices housed engineers, draftsman, and accountants. Miners or family members would wait inside the attached shed to collect their wages. Many in the community are more familiar with the building as the offices of Drs. Gilbert and Baron from the late seventies until the early 1990s. The National Park Service has occupied the building since 1993, serving as the headquarters for Keweenaw National Historical Park. An interior rehabilitation project was completed in 2008, while masons maintain the exterior.",

Located west of Highway 41 and north of Red Jacket Road, the two-story, L-shaped building is prominently located between the former C&H Industrial Core and managers homes that line either side of Highway 41 to the north. Directly across the paved drive to the west is a large three story home that was once the C&H Mine manager's summer house. Red brick adds a decorative detail on building corners, around windows, and three feet from the roof's edge. Tall windows with wooden panes delineate offices within the building and add to the buildings grandeur. Mowed grass surrounds the building between the sidewalk and the mosaic rock foundation. The L-shaped building has a small green, one story addition to the north that is made of metal wainscoting.",

    "audioDescription": "The Laurium Manor is located on Tamarack street between 3rd and 4th streets. This three-story mansion has white painted wooden siding. The front entrance has prominent red sandstone steps leading up from the sidewalk. Red sandstone blocks are also used as retaining walls in the yard and garden around the building. The front entrance is covered by a two-story gable roof with four ornate Romanesque pillars supporting it as it extends from the house. A porch sits on the second story of this entrance extension. Porches also wrap around the ground floor of the house and have covered roofs supported by smaller Romanesque columns like those in the front. A round set of windows on the front corner of the right side of the building harkens to Queen Anne style construction. The third floor has two dormer windows facing the road and a brick chimney rising from the back of the building. The manor was built by Thomas H and Cornelia Hoatson in 1908. Now the 13,000 square foot house serves as a bed and breakfast and also hosts tours so visitors can see the grand style some of Calumet’s residents used to live in.",

It is a single-story structure made from poor-rock with brick accents above the windows and doors. The first floor is raised above a partially submerged basement and the attic space has been finished. Mine captains, often skilled immigrants from distant mining regions, oversaw the daily mining operations underground. They frequently wore white for identification, marking their status compared to the dirty work of mining.",
    "audioDescription": "The Captain’s Office is in the V between Mine Street and the 6th Street Extension. This building is made from poor-rock. Large rocks have been cut for the corners of the building with smaller rocks used in the rest of the walls. Large light grey mortar lines can be seen between the rocks. The main entrance is in center of the front face of the building, raised off the ground and accessed by a set of metal stairs. A brick arch is located above the door and the line of a roof that once sat above the entrance can be seen in the wall. Two windows flank the entrance with brick arches above them. Two pane storm windows sit on the outside while the inside window is made of smaller panes. There is also a smaller window constructed in the same way above the door. Smaller windows are also located below the windows flanking the door at ground level. The sides of the buildings have two windows with brick arches and smaller ground-level windows as well. A square brick chimney can be seen coming out of the center of the roof.",

The original depot was a single-story wooden structure with a hipped roof. A one-and-one-half story entrance was built on the south side of the depot. Between 1908 and 1917 the depot was re-built to a three-section brick building with a hipped roof and a wooden awning running around its entire perimeter. The central section is two stories tall with an office located on the western side. Two sets of double doors are located on the eastern face of this section with two rectangular windows between them. Rectangular double-pane windows are on the eastern and western faces of the second story. The southern section is a single-story with rectangular windows ringing it and a door located on this section’s southern face. The northern section was used as a baggage room and had rectangular double-pane windows ringing it. A brick chimney can be found in the center of the roof located between the central and northern building sections.",

One of several mine shafts at the Quincy location, the #2 was the longest, extending over 9,000 feet along the angle and reaching an overall depth of 6,225 feet below the surface. Men mining on the 92nd level would have spent their entire 8-hour shift working more than a mile underground in 90-degree heat. Over time without use the shafthouse severely rusted, leading it to be resided in the mid-1980s - an early preservation effort by the Quincy Mine Hoist Association. ",
    "audioDescription": "The prominent #2 shaft-rockhouse building is over 140 feet tall and can be seen for miles on top of Quincy Hill. The building is approximately 30 feet east of U.S. Highway 41 and has a large gravel parking lot to the north of the building. Visitors to the site park in this lot and can walk into the building's interior with the entrance located on the north side of the building. To the east, a tall metal pulley stand remains and was used to support the large cables that traveled from the hoist house into the shaft-rockhouse near the top of the building. At the base of this pulley stand, is a small rock masonry building. To the south of the shaft-rockhouse, are some abandoned wooden rail cars and beyond, an open landscape with stone foundations of former buildings. The building's height and unique shape are directly linked to the underground below. When positioned in the parking to the north and looking at the building, the roof angles down to the ground at a 50 degree angle. This same angle extends underground and is the angle by which skip cars and man engine cars traveled into the ground",

    "bodyText": "The Quincy mine was owned and operated by the Quincy Mining Company from 1864 to 1945 and was known as “Old Reliable.” The moniker came from the company regularly paying dividends to investors from 1868 until 1920. Portions of over a dozen buildings stand for visitors to see and experience. On a two-hour tour, visitors take a guided walk through the hoist house, ride a cog-rail tram, and enter the mine to learn about mining life. Shorter, surface-only tours are also available.<br /> <br /> The Keweenaw Heritage Sites are official partners of Keweenaw National Historical Park, but are privately owned. Each site interprets and preserves an important aspect of the area's copper mining history and provides a unique visitor experience. Please contact individual sites for more information.",
    "audioDescription": "Quincy Mine is located just off US 41 north of Hancock. The welcome building and gift shop is a one-and-a-half story structure made from red and white Jacobsville sandstone that was the Supply Headquarters during the mine’s operation. The building now has a silver-colored corrugated metal roof. A wooden raised porch wraps around the western and southern sides of the building which sit adjacent to the parking lot. The entrances for the building have arched tops with brick accents. Visitors to the Quincy Mine which operated for 99 years as “old reliable” can explore numerous ruins, learn about the history of the mine, and take tours underground to see the shafts and some of the mining equipment used by the men who worked there.",

This impressive building is made from reinforced concrete with a brick veneer. Multiple windows allow natural light in. A series of tall metal pulley stands once stood between the hoist house and the shaft-rockhouse but today only two remain near the shaft-rockhouse. Just east of the hoist house is a long concrete trough, now overgrown with vegetation, used to cool and condense exhausted steam.",

    "bodyText": "The Quincy Mine supply office was built in 1893 at an expense of just over $9,000. The supply office housed an array of mining supplies, from mine lamps to drill steels. The building is a two-story structure with gabled roof and raised foundation. The foundation is made from poor rock while the building is made from red and white Jacobsville sandstone with polished pieces to highlight the corners of the structure and the edges of windows. Arched red brick detail can be seen above the windows and doors. In the early 1990s the building was refurbished into its current use: the Quincy Mine Gift Shop.",

The driveway entrance from Hwy. 41 to the Quincy Mine Hoist Association property leads to the former Quincy Mine Supply Office which is 50 feet from the Highway. The driveway turns to the right and becomes a large parking lot that extends around the supply office foundation and to the south. An accessible ramp leads visitors to a deck on the supply office building that offers views of the tall shaft-rockhouse to the south and the large hoist house to the east. The supply office building is constructed of brown and white sandstone that adds a decorative look to the building. Tall windows with wooden window panes bring light into the building and provide expansive views of the property.",

The shaft is now capped with a \"bat-friendly\" enclosure, one of two on the Quincy site.",
    "audioDescription": "A seemingly open landscape on the former Quincy Mining Company property reveals more than initially meets the eye. A former mine entrance is labeled Man Engine Shaft on A metal sign labeled Man Engine Shaft identifies the location of the former shaft entrance which is about 20 feet west of the sign. Today, grasses and flowers grow over mine rock rubble mounds on either side of the original entrance and a gravel path leads from the sign to the former entrance. The entrance is completely covered by a makeshift cage consisting of weathered brown steel bars and fencing attached to the bars. The flat cage top extends across the former entrance and then angles into the ground on the east side at an angle. The cage was constructed for viewing access into the former entrance while also allowing bats to leave the entrance as the former shaft serves as an important bat habitat. A small wood platform and fence allows for viewing into the cage and entrance. The man engine shaft entrance is within 20 feet of U.S. Highway 41 on the east side. Some poor rock is piled on the west side of the cage.",

The complex is large with a recreational snowmobile/walking trail bordering the fence to the north and the Portage Canal to the south. Hardened, melted slag from the smelting process sits in a pile a few acres in size between Highway 26 and the recreational trail. Part of a trellis remains and extends from the smelter to the slag pile. Another trellis leads from the eastern end of the site into the top part of a two-story building. Below the trellis is a long mound of gray stamp sand particles and a cluster of birch trees that have taken hold and are growing among rusted smelter carts.",

    "audioDescription": "Sitting on old rail train tracks, the black and orange C&H Russell Snowplow was used to clear tracks of snow for the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company. The snowplow is constructed primarily of wood and is composed of a 28 foot front truck attached to a 16 foot back truck. The back truck resembles a conventional boxcar with small window openings and built in storage compartments. The front truck is comprised of a pilot's house behind a large double curved wood plow resembling the prow of a ship. This large v-plow has a metal blade just above the tracks. Two large retractable steel plow extensions are located to either side of the pilot's house which extend out to cut snow banks back along the track. The snowplow was designed to be positioned in front of a steam locomotive and pushed from behind to clear drifted snow.",

The roof of this end of the building slopes steeply to a central point. A brick chimney can also be seen rising out of the south face of the roof. On the east face of this building a tall brick smokestack rises from an attached brick extension. This stack is fluted for support and is a rare construction style in the Keweenaw. The other portion of the building which is in the shape of a rectangle running parallel with Mine Street extends to the north of the first portion of the building. The northern portion is made from red sandstone and has numerous small arched windows along its faces. The tops of the windows are made from brick.

The former 1st Presbyterian Church is a single-story wood-frame building which is 24 feet to the eaves and has a 65-foot tower on the eastern face near the front entrance. The roof is a cross gabled style with green asphalt shingles. Large arched windows can be found around the building. A brick chimney can also be seen coming out of the roof near the eastern face. The former Christ Episcopal Church is a wooden single-story structure which is 16 feet to its eves and has a steeply sloped gabled roof. Tall rectangular windows with curved arch tops can be seen encircling the building. A large cross is present on the crest of the roof near the eastern face of the building. The former Carmel Evangelical Lutheran Church was built in 1894. It is a single story red Jacobsville sandstone building which was 20 feet to the eves and a 100-foot tower in the center of the western face. Tall rectangular windows with round arch tops circle the building with rectangular windows set below them looking into the basement level. The former YMCA building is a single-story building with an elevated foundation and hipped roof. Tall rectangular windows encircle the main floor with round arch tops on the western face. Smaller square windows can be seen near the ground on the basement level. Two single-story wooden additions were originally constructed the northern face of the building. They are now connected into one addition which serves as the main entrance. A brick chimney is found on the western end of the north face of the roof.",

    "bodyText": "Originally constructed to house a hockey rink in 1913, the Colosseum also had removeable wooden floors for roller-skating and housed dances and conventions. After serving a dual purpose for decades as the armory for Calumet’s National Guard, today the Colosseum is home to the Calumet Hockey Association and the Calumet Copper Kings. It is considered the oldest purpose-built hockey rink in the United States.<br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The Colosseum is located on the north side of Red Jacket Road, with the long axis of the building running northeast/southwest. The building is made from silver colored corrugated metal. It has a gently curved arch roof like a balloon frame construction. The main entrance juts out slightly from the center of the face on Red Jacket Road and has a similar construction shape as the rest of the building. Three paneled windows line the front of the building in two rows with red coloring on the top of each panel set. Two smaller closed off arches flanks the main entrance with red single person doors on the front. There is a large display sign at the entrance from the road to the parking lot at the front of the building that says “Calumet Colosseum.”",

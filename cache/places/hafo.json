This southern Idaho route was typically hot, dry, and dusty and exhausted travelers. Stopping at the Snake River made for a welcome respite. However, the volcanic geology found in this part of Idaho makes getting to the river difficult. Fortunately, the southern part of what is now Hagerman Fossil beds is made of sedimentary rocks, which not only preserved the monument's famous fossils, but also allowed emigrants on the Oregon Trail to access the river.<br /> <br /> For information about viewing the Oregon Trail and other features in the monument, stop by the park's visitor center in the town of Hagerman. There, get the latest information, see an introductory movie, view fossils up close, and obtain maps and information about what there is to see and do in the area.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> 17970 US Hwy 30, Hagerman Idaho</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hafo/index.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2>",
    "audioDescription": "Hagerman Fossil Beds- Oregon Trail Overlook. 201 words<br /><br />The paved pullout area here has some interpretive signage and a small restroom at one end. From the parking area, a wooden path leads to an overlook on the edge of the bluff above the river. Here the river makes a sharp bend away from us, faced by steep bluffs on this side and flat farmland on the other. Signs at the lookout discuss the ancient lakes in this area and the fossils found as the sides of the bluff have eroded.<br /><br />Across the road from the parking area are more signs with a view down into a long canyon parallel to the river where the wagons would have traveled. A gravel trail leads from here down to the canyon floor. The signs explain the hiking trail leading off to the left which leads up the canyon to the right and discuss the Native American tribes from this area.<br /><br />Farther up the road is the Oregon Trail Overlook where a gravel path leads to the head of the trail that comes up the canyon. Here there are expansive views of the barren and rugged landscape with glimpses of the river far to the left.",

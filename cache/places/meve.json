It was surrounded by a vibrant, active community. Because of the large kiva to room ratio, some scholars suggest Cliff Palace was an important gathering place, perhaps an administrative center with ceremonial use for many Ancestral Pueblo villages. The people who lived in the area were familiar with dozens of footpaths that led from village to village and to storage structures, farming areas, water sources, and public buildings, such as Cliff Palace.<br /> <br /> Recent studies reveal that Cliff Palace contained 150 rooms and 21 kivas and had a population of approximately 100 people. Out of the nearly 600 cliff dwellings concentrated within the boundaries of the park, 75% contain only 1-5 rooms each, and many are single room storage units.<br /> <br /> Cliff Palace can also be seen from the Sun Point View and Sun Temple stops along the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/mesatoploopdrive.htm\">Mesa Top Loop Road</a>, which is open all year.",

Approximately 250 yards across the canyon from Cliff Palace, a small alcove site can be seen. This site, Kokopelli House, is just below the canyon rim west of Sun Temple, a large mesa top site.",

This mesa top community includes Far View House, Pipe Shrine House, Coyote Village, Far View Reservoir (currently dry), Megalithic House, and Far View Tower. In ancient times, it was a place of modest homes interspersed with small farm fields. It was a place filled with people, vibrant life, and constant change. </p> <p>Beginning around 800 CE, Ancestral Pueblo people lived here for several centuries, farming the deep mesa-top soils, building their homes, and raising their families. This was not always a quiet woodland. On a summer day in 1050 this ancient community would have been filled with the smell of juniper smoke and the sounds of everyday life: conversations between people working together, barking dogs, laughing children, ravens calling overhead, and the wind rustling through the shiny corn leaves. In the mid-1100s, there may have been at least 35 occupied villages and surrounding farm and garden plots within a half-square-mile area, including those you can visit today. </p> <p>The archeological evidence at Far View reveal the presence of thriving mesa top communities long before the existence of the more famous cliff dwellings. But they also help disclose another, little known fact. Not everyone ultimately moved into and lived in the cliff dwellings. Some families clearly chose to remain on the mesa top, like those at Far View, well after many of their neighbors moved into cliff alcoves. <br /> <br /> <em>As you follow the woodland trail among the six sites, read the trailside signs to learn about Ancestral Pueblo life in the surrounding landscape between 800 to 1300 CE. Take a step back in time and imagine corn (maize), beans, and squash plants sprinkled along the landscape</em>.</p> <h4><strong>Trail Data</strong></h4> <ul> <li> 0.75 miles (1.2 km) loop (unpaved, level trail)</li> <li>Open 8:00 am to sunset</li> <li><em>Parking is limited to vehicles under 25 feet</em></li> </ul> <h4><br /> For Your Safety</h4> <ul> <li>Dehydration and altitude sickness are common problems at Mesa Verde.

Here you see one of the oldest permanent structures built on the mesa, where early Ancestral Pueblo settlers enjoyed many of the same comforts we enjoy in our homes today.<br /> <br /> Though nomadic people lived in the surrounding area for thousands of years, permanent farmsteads began to appear on the mesa around 550. Planting corn, beans, and squash, along with continuing to hunt and gather wild foods, gave them a more reliable and balanced food supply. The transition to farming allowed the Pueblo people to set<br /> down roots. This new lifestyle spurred traditions and innovations that would last for centuries. Resourceful and attuned to their environment, the Ancestral Pueblo people took advantage of the earth’s natural insulation by building pithouses—semi-subterranean homes. The atlatl and spear were replaced with a lighter and more accurate hunting tool: the bow and arrow. Light and portable basketry made way for durable pottery, better for storing and cooking food.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Named after the historic Knife Edge Road which was known for it's scenic value, this trail follows the old roadway and leads to a viewpoint that affords excellent views across Montezuma Valley.</p> <p>A traveler in 1892 once described a trail on this ridge as the Crinkly Edge Trail. In 1911, the trail became the Knife Edge Road, a new section of the main road into the park. Although scenic, the road was narrow and steep and precariously skirted the top of a steep bluff overlooking the Montezuma Valley. Unfortunately, the instability of the soil made it difficult to maintain. Two years later, the park built a bypass road through Morefield and Prater Canyons, and when the first automobile trip was made in 1914, vehicles used the bypass and the Knife Edge Road was soon closed.</p> <p>The scenic value of the Knife Edge Road prompted the park to reopen it again in 1924. Although it continued to challenge road crews for the next 30 years, it remained in use until 1957 when the Morefield-Prater tunnel was completed. Today, you can still enjoy the views via the Knife Edge Trail.</p> <h4><b>Trail Description</b></h4> <p>The 2.0-mile (3.2 km) roundtrip trail is a fairly level trail and follows a portion of the park’s historic entrance road leading to breathtaking views of the Montezuma Valley. Located on the northwestern edge of the mesa, this trail is beautiful in the golden light right before sunset. Sleeping Ute Mountain is near the horizon to the west. Totten Reservoir and Summit Lake, seen further in the distance, shine in the glow of fading light.</p> <p><i>Please respect these places by leaving archeological sites, artifacts, plants, and animals undisturbed for all those who follow you.</i><i></i></p> <h4><b>Be Prepared</b></h4> <ul> <li> <p>Easy</p> </li> <li> <p>Pets and bicycles are not allowed on the trail</p> </li> <li> <p>Trails are day-use only</p> </li> </ul> <h4><b>For Your Safety</b></h4> <ul> <li> <p>Dehydration and altitude sickness are common problems at Mesa Verde. Drink water and rest often.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoid hiking during the hottest part of the day. Parts of the trail are exposed and will be particularly hot in summer.</p> </li> <li> <p>While hiking, remain on the trail to avoid walking along unstable cliff edges and fragile soil. Off-trail walking easily destroys the delicate cryptobiotic soil crusts that take decades to form and are essential to soil stability and plant growth in the deserts of the Southwest. Even the smallest impacts have big effects!</p> </li> <li> <p>Please respect wildlife by observing them from a distance.</p> </li> </ul> <h4><b>Trail Data</b></h4> <ul> <li> <p>2.0 miles (3.2 km) roundtrip</p> </li> <li> <p>62 feet (18.9 m) elevation change</p> </li> <li> <p>Allow about one hour to complete</p> </li> </ul>",

The 2-mile round trip trail was a section of road built in 1911 and precariously skirted the top of a steep bluff overlooking the Montezuma Valley hundreds of feet below. In 1957 the National Park Service eliminated this dangerous narrow road by building a tunnel that is still used today for vehicle traffic. Gambel Oak, Pinyon Pine, Sagebrush, rabbitbrush, and a variety of wildflowers dominate the landscape.

Later occupants built a second village on the same site with single-stone-wide sandstone masonry.<br /> <br /> A third village, built around 1075, represents a major innovation with its use of double-stone, rubble-core masonry—two outer walls with soil and rock fill between them. This sturdy construction allowed for the building of large multi-story room blocks and towers. This village features three circular towers, which may have been used as signaling stations, astronomical observatories, watchtowers, or ceremonial structures. The kiva was a vital part of all three villages, gradually evolving into what archeologists refer to as the Mesa Verde style kiva.<br /> <br /> As villages continued to increase in size and population, farming became increasingly important, requiring agricultural advancements. Farmers built check-dams—stone terraces built in natural drainages, which created more productive farmland and prevented water runoff and soil erosion.",

Can you identify the resources that make this a good place to live?<br /> <br /> You are standing at 7,000 feet (2,130 m). This might seem like a high place to farm. However, the southward slope of this plateau provides more sunlight and warmth, lengthening the growing season. The prevailing southwesterly wind also deposits rich sediment. Mesa Verde receives an average of 18 inches (46 cm) of precipitation annually, split between winter snow and late-summer thunderstorms. This pattern allows for farming without irrigation. <br /> <br /> The porous sandstone caprock soaks up some of the seasonal moisture. The water percolates through the rock before seeping out, forming springs below the canyon rim. These seep springs provide an important water source to plants, animals, and people alike. Over time, water-laden rock dissolves carving the alcoves you see across canyon.<br /> <br /> The mesa is home to more than 1,000 species of plants and animals. These species provided food, tools, clothing, and medicine. Today, the landscape provides a dramatic backdrop, but for the Ancestral Pueblo people, the land supplied everything.<br /> <br /> What natural resources make your home a good place to live?",

At the overlook, watch for birds like the turkey vulture, white-throated swift, American kestrel, violet-green swallow, and common raven.<br /> <br /> This is the only view of Balcony House without taking a ranger-guided tour. <h4>Be Prepared</h4> <ul> <li>Easy to Moderate</li> <li>Although considered an easy trail, parts of the trail are exposed and will be hot in the summer.</li> </ul> <h4>For Your Safety</h4> <ul> <li>Dehydration and altitude sickness are common problems at Mesa Verde. Drink water and rest often.</li> <li>Avoid hiking during the hottest part of the day.</li> <li>While hiking, remain on the trail and avoid walking along unstable cliff edges. Off-trail walking easily destroys the delicate cryptobiotic soil crusts that take decades to form and are essential to soil stability and plant growth in the deserts of the Southwest. Even the smallest impacts have big effects!</li> <li>Pets and bicycles are not allowed on the trail.</li> <li>Please respect wildlife by observing them from a distance.</li> <li>Trails are day-use only.</li> </ul> <h4><strong>Trail Data</strong></h4> <ul> <li>1.2 miles (2 km) roundtrip</li> <li>67 ft (20 m) elevation change</li> <li>Allow about 40 minutes to complete</li> </ul>",
    "audioDescription": "This easy, 1.2-mile out and back trail passes through an old-growth pinyon-juniper woodland. The trail remains flat with uneven stone steps over dry wash crossings and down to access viewpoints. The trail leads to three overlooks offering dramatic views of the park’s largest canyon and Balcony House, a medium sized two-story cliff dwelling with 38 rooms and two kivas. A viewing scope is available at one overlook to get a closer view of Balcony House.",

By the late 1270s, up to 19 households (60 to 80 people) lived here.<br /> <br /> Tucked into the cliff above are ten storage rooms for storing surplus corn, beans, squash and wild plants.

Shaded by a few juniper trees and with two handrails along the way, the trail descends approximately 75 feet via several switchbacks to a large uneven sandstone outcropping. From there, Spruce Tree House, the third largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde, is viewable across a deep canyon filled with mature Gambel Oak and Douglas Fir trees. The latter, which were incorrectly called Douglas Spruce in the late 1800s, are what gave the dwelling its name. Spruce Tree House, with its beautiful two and three-story stone masonry walls, towers and open kivas, lies protected under the desert varnish-streaked sandstone archway of the alcove, making it the most well-preserved cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde. Approximately 95% of its original structure and plasters remain intact after 800+ years.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Walk around the walls of this large structure and notice how it differs from others you have seen. Sun Temple was likely a communal building that played an important role in the Cliff Palace community. While this D-shaped structure resembles other Pueblo sites such as Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon, it is the only building of its kind in the Pueblo world.<br /> <br /> The skillfully crafted four-foot-thick walls indicate that extensive effort went into Sun Temple's construction. Archeologists excavated 24 rooms of various shapes and sizes as well as three circular structures inside the main complex. An additional circular structure stands detached to the southeast. No roof beams or household goods were found.<br /> <br /> Some experts suggest that the walls of Sun Temple may have been used by observers in Cliff Palace as a marker for astronomical events like the winter solstice sunset. Perhaps the builders intentionally left sun temple unroofed, as an observatory for such events, or perhaps it was never finished. Many questions remain.</p>",

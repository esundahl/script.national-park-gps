    "bodyText": "<p><b>Mitchell Jamieson</b> (1915-1976) was an American painter known for his illustrations and watercolors and as a WWII combat artist. One of his most famous and enduring works of art is his 6 foot by 12 foot mural \"An Incident in Contemporary American Life\" (1943). Jamieson, who was 25 years old at the time, was selected by a panel of artists in 1940 to create a mural commemorating opera singer Marian Anderson's<b> </b>(1897-1993) famous performance in front of the Lincoln Memorial. The mural was intended to be displayed in the Department of the Interior building in downtown Washington, DC. Jamieson was paid for his work through the Marian Anderson Fund Committee, a collection of private contributions received from all over the United States. <br /> <br /> The event commemorated in Jamieson's mural took place in 1939 when the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), an all-white organization of descendants of Revolutionary War soldiers, denied African American opera singer Marian Anderson<b> </b>the use of its concert hall, Constitution Hall.<br /> <br /> At the time, Constitution Hall was the only venue in Washington, D.C. large enough to accommodate Anderson’s sizeable audience. Anderson's manager, Sol Hurok, attempted to book her for a performance in the hall, however the DAR refused to schedule Anderson on any of the dates Hurok requested, even though the same dates were open to white performers. In the early days of the venue, African-American audiences had been allowed to use a small section of the balcony to see black artists perform. That changed after a black artist refused to sing in the segregated auditorium. After that, DAR began to operate Constitution Hall under a whites-only performance contract.<br /> <br /> As a result of the overt racial discrimination against Anderson, First Lady <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hofr/learn/historyculture/anna-eleanor-roosevelt.htm\">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> resigned from the DAR, resulting in a media frenzy. Roosevelt wrote about her decision in her popular weekly column, \"My Day.\" Other newspapers began to write editorials supporting Anderson, putting pressure on the DAR. However, the organization refused to change their position. In lieu of a performance at Constitution Hall, Mrs. Roosevelt and Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, along with National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) Executive Secretary Walter White organized an open-air concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1939.<br /> <br /> Standing in front of an integrated crowd of over 75,000 people, Anderson's first song was the patriotic ballad, “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee” accompanied only by a piano. The entire concert lasted 25 minutes and was broadcast by radio to millions of people across the United States.<br /> <br /> The mural is still on display at the Stewart Lee Udall Department of Interior Building in Washington, DC and can be seen by scheduling a tour with the Department of the Interior Museum. For more information click on the \"Managed By\" link on the right side of the web page.<br /> <br /> The mural was added to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> in February 2018.<br /> <br /> <em>The African American Civil Rights Network (AACRN) recognizes the civil rights movement in the United States and the sacrifices made by those who fought against discrimination and segregation. Created by the African American Civil Rights Act of 2017, and coordinated by the National Park Service, the Network tells the stories of the people, places, and events of the U.S. civil rights movement through a collection of public and private elements.</em></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Lincoln Memorial honors the 16th president of the United States, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/lincoln-memorial-statue-of-lincoln.htm\">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Presiding through the Civil War, Lincoln not only saved the Union, preserving its government, boundaries, and ideals, he reinvigorated the nation's founding principle - that all men are created equal. The memorial opened in 1922, and is not only a national landmark, it is a source of contemplation and inspiration for millions of visitors each year. <br /> <br /> The memorial is built in the style of the Greek Parthenon, a rectangular structure with tall, white columns towering above those walking among them. The columns represent the states in the United States during Lincoln's presidency, and correspond to state names listed above. Symbolizing the strength of the union of the states, the motif of a bundle of rods appears throughout the building: below Lincoln's arms, in the mural above the Gettysburg Address, in the margins of the Second Inaugural Address, on the walls flanking the stairs, and in the columns of the building itself. The memorial makes little doubt of Lincoln's importance as the \"Savior of the Union.\"<br /> <br /> Until the late 1800s, the current land under the Lincoln Memorial did not exist; it was in the Potomac River. When the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deepened the river, they deposited the dredged silt along the banks, expanding the land to its current configuration. Almost immediately, the memorial's backers proposed the reclaimed land as the site for a memorial to Lincoln, but this nearly mile-wide swath of dredged, stinking mud formed an unappealing aesthetic. Its attractiveness improved after landscaping and engineering transformed the land's appearance by the early 1900s.<br /> <br /> The decision to place the memorial at its current location came in 1913, and construction started the following year. Henry Bacon designed the building, Daniel French sculpted the statue, and Jules Guerin painted the two murals. Working together, they created an iconic symbol of our nation and our ideals.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(436 words)The Lincoln Memorial is located on the western end of the National Mall in Washington, DC, east of the Potomac River and west of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. From the intersection of Lincoln Memorial Circle, NW and Henry Bacon Drive, proceed three hundred sixty-five feet south through an open plaza area to the base of the Lincoln Memorial steps.The memorial resembles a classic Greek temple, roughly 67 yards wide, 44 yards deep, and 26 yards tall. Among bas reliefs of wreaths and garlands, the names of the states in the union at the time of Lincoln's death are inscribed above the colonnade, and the names of the states in the union at the time of the memorial's dedication are inscribed above them. The years that the dates entered the union are inscribed in Roman numerals below their names.<br />Travel west up granite steps past twelve forty-four-foot-tall columns that line the front of the memorial. The Memorial's interior is divided into three chambers by two rows of four columns, each fifty feet tall.<br />Set along the back, west interior wall is the sixty foot-wide, seventy-four foot-deep, and sixty-foot-high white marble Lincoln statue. He faces east, looking across the Reflecting Pool and out at the Washington Monument. On the south interior wall, to the right of where Lincoln is seated, is inscribed the Gettysburg Address, and on the north wall, Lincoln's second inaugural speech. Inscribed on the wall behind the statue is:<br />IN THIS TEMPLE<br />AS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE<br />FOR WHOM HE SAVED THE UNION<br />THE MEMORY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN<br />IS ENSHRINED FOREVER.<br />The bearded Lincoln wears a long coat and vest. His hands rest on the arms of the chair on which he sits. Fasces are etched along the front faces of the chair arms.<br />The sides and back of the memorial feature a twenty-foot wide platform among the columns of the structure, providing views of tree-lined Lincoln Memorial Circle to the north and south, and Arlington Memorial Bridge to the west as it carries over the Potomac River.<br />Set on the highest platform of the memorial steps is an inscription commemorating Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. The inscription faces away from the memorial directing the reader to look out over the steps and plaza below, the tree-lined Reflecting Pool and the Washington Monument all in a straight line to the east.<br />A small bookshop area is in the northeast corner of the interior chamber. Restrooms and a Lincoln exhibit space are located at the left side of the memorial at the bottom of the steps.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br /> But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work, which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us. That from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.

    "bodyText": "<p>Inscribed into the north side of the Lincoln Memorial chamber is President Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, delivered in 1865. In the speech, Lincoln explores the causes and meanings of the American Civil War, which was nearing its end. Above the insciption is a mural by painter Jules Guerin depicting the concept of unity. In the mural, the Angel of Truth joins the hands of two figures representing the north and south. Her protective wings cradle figures representing the arts of Painting, Philosophy, Music, Architecture, Chemistry, Literature, and Sculpture.<br /> <br /> Fellow-Countrymen, at this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.<br /> On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war--seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.<br /> One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh. If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said \"the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\"<br /> With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.</p>",

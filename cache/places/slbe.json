    "bodyText": "<p>This structure was constructed by the North Manitou Island crew in 1877. The structure is an open, one-story boat house with a clipped gable roof featuring decorative brackets and barge boards. The building was later renovated by the Manitou Island Association, which removed the boat door and added a new door and new windows, including a large picture window in place of the former boat door. The MIA also removed a lookout tower, which originally had surmounted the roof of the building.</p> <h3>Life-Saving Equipment</h3> <p>Surfmen had a variety of life-saving equipment at their disposal. According to regulation, if one method of rescue failed surfmen were required to attempt all other available forms of rescue. Weekly drills ensured that all surfmen became proficient at using life-saving equipment. Their hard work paid off-the USLSS had an overall 99% success rate.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boats</strong><br /> Generally, the USLSS used two types of rescue boats-the lifeboat and the surfboat. The lifeboat was an English invention adopted by the USLSS. Lifeboats were self-bailing and self-righting. They could be sailed or rowed. Lifeboats were long and heavy; some measured as long as 40 feet and weighed up to 4,000 pounds! Other advantages of this boat included its stability, sturdiness, and ability to handle heavy seas. However, the weight also made the boat almost impossible to haul down the beach; instead, it had to be launched from the boathouse directly into a sheltered harbor. Later models of lifeboats were lighter and even motorized. With the addition of a motor, surfmen could travel to wrecks farther away and get there faster and with much less energy than rowing required.<br /> Surfmen also used surfboats, an American invention. Surfboats were smaller, lighter, and faster than their English counterparts. These boats sat on a carriage that surfman could haul down beaches and over dunes in order to get as close to a wreck as possible before launching directly into rough surf. The Keeper steered and the surfmen rowed. Surfboats could also carry more shipwreck victims than lifeboats, anywhere from 10-15 victims. One disadvantage was that the first surfboats were not self-righting, only self-bailing. Like the lifeboat, later models were also motorized.<br /> <br /> Eventually, most USLSS stations had both a lifeboat and a surfboat. Surprisingly, in many instances boats were not the surfmen's preferred method of rescue. Instead, surfmen and station Keepers often preferred to use breeches buoys and lifecars to rescue shipwreck victims. These methods of rescue both relied on one of the only guns designed to save lives-the Lyle gun.<br /> <br /> <strong>Lyle Gun</strong><br /> The USLSS recruited Lt. David Lyle, an Army Ordnance officer, to design a gun that would aid in shipwreck rescues. Lyle invented small, bronze cannon that sat on a wooden carriage. Depending on size, the cannon and carriage together weighed about 160 pounds. The Lyle gun and other rescue equipment were stored on a cart that the surfmen could pull down the beach, close to the wreck. Surfmen tied a line to an eye bolt screwed onto the end of a cast iron projectile and then loaded it into the cannon. A charge of black powder, up to 8 ounces, shot the projectile and line 250 to almost 700 yards. The goal was to shoot the line over a wreck so that it could be used to haul a series of other lines from the beach. Shipwreck victims attached the heaviest of these lines, the hawser, to the mast (or the sturdiest part of the wreck) while surfmen back on the beach propped up the line with a crotch. Next, surfmen could attach a breeches buoy or a lifecar to the line and haul it out to the wreck.<br /> <br /> <strong>Breeches Buoy</strong><br /> Once the surfmen set up the hawser line, they could attach a breeches buoy and send it out to the wreck. This was also referred to as the beach apparatus. The breeches buoy itself was a life preserver with a pair of canvas breeches, or shorts, sewn onto the bottom. One by one, shipwreck victims would climb into the breeches buoy and the surfmen on the shore would haul on the line, pulling them over the waves and back to shore. This was the preferred method of rescue because the surfmen stayed on the beach and because the breeches buoy was lighter and easier to haul over the beach than the heavier lifecar.<br /> <br /> <strong>Life car</strong><br /> Several designs of lifecars existed as early as the 1840s. The United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) commonly used Joseph Francis' 1847 lifecar. This iron-covered lifeboat included a deck hatch in the top used by shipwreck victims to climb inside to safety. There was room for four passengers inside this iron life-saving device. Early models were so small that passengers had to lie on top of each other in order to fit; later models were taller so that passengers could sit upright. Once the hatch was closed, the lifecar was water-tight. Two rings on top of the car allowed the heavy hawser line to pass through and surfmen could haul the lifecar to and from the shore. Small holes at the top of the lifecar let air inside. However, it would have been a dark, bumpy, uncomfortable ride.<br /> <br /> Like the breeches buoy, the lifecar had some advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage was that instead of only being able to save one victim at a time, the lifecar had room for 4 or 5 passengers. Passengers were also protected from weather, debris, and waves. However, the weight of the lifecar was a major issue. This 550 pound vessel had to be loaded into the already heavy beach cart and hauled through the sand. Surfmen were totally exhausted by the time they reached the site of the wreck, and they still had to fire the Lyle gun, ready the lifecar, and then haul on the line that pulled it out to the wreck and back.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "clad with vertical white-painted batten siding and sheltered with a cedar- shingle gable roof. The roof is supported on its 2 outer edges by white-painted brackets tucked beneath the eaves. Also supported by 2 brackets is a shallow ceiling overhang that extends outward just below the gable end facing the water. This gable is faced with the same tile as the roof. Situated on this same end of the building and extending across the structure's entire width is a 3-tiered wooden platform measuring about 8 feet deep and 2 ½ feet high. Take care as you climb the 3 steps up from the surrounding grass to reach the top of the platform as there are no railings. The door to the building, which is sheltered by its own flat roof overhang, is located on the left side of this platform. To the right of the door is a wide rectangular picture window. You may encounter a wooden bench and footrest placed on the platform in front of the window. Located about 75 feet southeast of the nearby boathouse is a flat-topped capstan measuring approximately 3 feet tall. The capstan, which resembles an egg cup perched atop a rounded base, is a vertical-axled rotating machine developed for use on sailing ships to apply force to ropes, cables, and hawsers.",

The three interconnected loops allow you to choose the hiking experience you want ranging from a shorter, easier hike leading to great views to a solid workout up and down the rolling hills and through the forest. They are also the only trails in the Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore where horseback riding is allowed.<br /> <br /> <b>Pets are NOT allowed on this trail from December 1 to March 31.</b><br /> <br /> The best cross-country skiing in the Lakeshore, Alligator Hill's trail system offers skiers three loops rated easy, intermediate, and advanced and feature plenty of long downhill runs and equally long climbs.<br /> <br /> The Forest Haven trailhead parking lot is also the Alligator Hill trailhead of the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail.</p> <h3>Why is it called Alligator Hill?</h3> <p>The hill picks up its name from a long ridge and bluff at its southeast corner that resembles the silhouette of an alligator's snout, best seen from the top of the Dune Climb. Alligator Hill is the result of glacial activity when two lobes of ice that gouged out Big Glen Lake and Little Glen Lake dumped their load of sand and rock between them. An ancient Lake Michigan, that was much higher than today's Great Lake, went on to erode bluffs and cut terraces and notches on the flank of the hill, including the alligator's snout.<br /> The trails that wind up and down Alligator Hill are wide, well-marked paths that are used by Nordic skiers, day hikers and equestrians. Mountain bikes are not allowed on the trails.</p> <h3>Golf on Alligator Hill?</h3> <p>The Alligator Hill trail system sits on what was once Day Forest Estates. Area pioneer D. H. Day owned all of this land and planned to subdivide much of the areaÂ into a real estate development, complete withÂ its own golf club.Â But Day's death and the Great Depression foiled those plans and the development never happened. The golf club closed in 1942, but you can still see the outlines of fairways today from aerial and satellite photos. The development's roads, driveways, and fairways now form the backbone of the Alligator Hill trail system.</p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year? Want to explore the landscape of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, exercise, and have fun all at the same time? Join the Trail Trekker Challenge! Earn a prize and bragging rights by successfully completing each of the 13 mainland trails in the National Lakeshore. Hiking is a great way to get daily physical exercise and promote health while also discovering the beauty of the area. What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <hr /> <h3>Hike Safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</strong><br /> Avoid ticks by walking in the center of trails and avoiding contact with vegetation.<br /> Use a repellent (on skin or clothing) and wear close-toed shoes, long sleeves, long pants, and socks.<br /> Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to easily spot ticks.<br /> Check your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, fallen logs, or stone walls.<br /> <br /> <strong>After being outdoors</strong><br /> Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, and remove any ticks you find.<br /> Check your clothing for ticks. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat for at least an hour.<br /> Shower soon after being outdoors; it may reduce your risk of being bitten.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check these parts of your body and your child's body for ticks:</strong><br /> Under the arm, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, in and around hair, between the legs, around the waist.<br /> <br /> <strong>If you are bitten by a tick</strong><br /> Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it.

Earn a prize and bragging rights by successfully completing each of the 13 mainland trails in the National Lakeshore. Hiking is a great way to get daily physical exercise and promote health while also discovering the beauty of the area. What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <hr /> <h3>Hike Safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</strong><br /> Avoid ticks by walking in the center of trails and avoiding contact with vegetation.<br /> Use a repellent (on skin or clothing) and wear close-toed shoes, long sleeves, long pants, and socks.<br /> Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to easily spot ticks.<br /> Check your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, fallen logs, or stone walls.<br /> <br /> <strong>After being outdoors</strong><br /> Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, and remove any ticks you find.<br /> Check your clothing for ticks. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat for at least an hour.<br /> Shower soon after being outdoors; it may reduce your risk of being bitten.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check these parts of your body and your child's body for ticks:</strong><br /> Under the arm, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, in and around hair, between the legs, around the waist.<br /> <br /> <strong>If you are bitten by a tick</strong><br /> Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it. Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible, and then slowly, but firmly, pull it straight out. Immediately wash the bite area and your hands with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic to the bite wound.<br /> Watch for signs of illness.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Leading to the large upper observation deck holding the tug Aloha is a long wooden ramp that slopes slightly upward, with a bend to the right a few feet before it meets the deck. Both sides of the ramp and all sides of the deck are lined with an approximately 3-foot-tall wooden railing fitted below with a wire mesh grid. In addition to displaying the tug, the observation deck holds 2 wayside panels, 2 pairs of binoculars supported atop metal poles, and 3 wooden benches. The benches are situated about 4 feet in front of, and parallel to, the deck railing immediately to your left as you step off the ramp. Take care to avoid these benches as you approach the waysides and binoculars, which are placed alongside this same railing. This is the side of the observation deck that most closely faces the beach fronting Sleeping Bear Bay. As you move along the railing, the first wayside panel you will encounter is entitled \"Safe passage.\" Featured on the panel's right half is a color nautical chart showing Manitou Passage, the Michigan mainland, and South Manitou and North Manitou Islands. Text appearing under the title on the panel's left half reads: A chart of navigable waters shows the information sailors need to travel safely. How deep is the water? Shallow water is noted with contour lines drawn around the shorelines. Small numbers tell, in feet, the depth of the water. Where is the water the shallowest? the deepest?Where are the dangers? Symbols show the type of navigational aids sailors need to find safe travel through the passage. A left-tilting purple and black exclamation point means a red light on a platform. A red light at night warns sailors to steer clear of danger. Can you find this symbol marking the North Manitou Shoal Light? How many other symbols like this can you find?The black outline of a circle with a red arrow shape jutting off to the right is the symbol for a red flashing buoy. These buoys are paired with green flashing buoys to tell sailors where the safe channel is. Can you find one on the chart? The dotted outline of a football-shaped oval with a row of 3 crosses inside marks shipwrecks. How many shipwrecks do you see on the chart? Six plus one marked \"wreck.\"Scattered on the map are about a half dozen symbols representing the red lights on platforms and red flashing buoys. Standing to the right of the \"Safe passage\" wayside is a second wayside panel entitled \"A perilous highway.\" Filling the top half of the panel is a black-and-white photo of a long wooden steamer ship with a 2-level deckhouse with a pilot house as its 2nd level. The steamer's bow is tipped slightly upward, out of the water, and its stern appears to be buckled. Text below the wayside's title tells us:The Manitou Passage served as a trail for the Anishinaabek who hunted, fished, and traded in this region. It was from the water that they named the forested mound of sand atop the dunes \"The Sleeping Bear\" and used it as a landmark for navigation. This 30-mile-long stretch of water between the Manitou Islands and the mainland served as part of the Great Lakes \"highway\" for travel and commerce. The Passage today is still a shortcut for vessels on this inland sea and boasts several protected harbors. Yet, danger lies in the treacherous shoals and rocks hidden beneath the waves upon which hundreds of boats have wrecked or foundered.Look out across the water. Can you spot two different types of lighthouses? When it is clear, you can see the tall, white tower of the South Manitou Island Lighthouse and the shorter North Manitou Shoal Light known as \"the Crib\". Today, the light on South Manitou is not an official aid to navigation, but the Crib still is. Look for vessels as small as kayaks and as huge as freighters maneuvering the Passage.A caption accompanying the photo of the steamer provides additional information:In October of 1917, the steamer Rising Sun grounded on the rocks off Pyramid Point-the high headland to the east. The passengers and crew survived. Remnants of the wreck can still be seen in shallow waters.Appearing in the panel's lower right corner are 2 smaller images placed one beside the other. The image on the left depicts a color postcard of the lighthouse containing the North Manitou Island Shoal Light. The white structure supporting the 3-story steel tower topped with the light caps consists of a 2-story steel building supported below by a larger square concrete crib. A caption reads: In the middle of the Passage the North Manitou Shoal Light flashes its warning light and sounds its fog signal. Can you hear it today? The small black-and-white photo to the right shows a tapered cylindrical lighthouse with a lantern room and cupola at its top. The lighthouse stands beside a brick building with the date 1858 etched into its facade. A caption reads: A lighthouse has marked South Manitou Island since 1840.Standing approximately 8 feet to the right of the \"A perilous highway\" wayside are the metal poles holding the",

While moored at Frankfort, the vessel split a seam and sank to the bottom of the harbor. Emergency NPS funds raised the boat and transported it by truck to Glen Haven.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Aloha is a small fishing tug measuring about 12 feet wide and 40 feet long from stern to bow. The tug, which is slightly longer than the average school bus, is perched atop a wooden platform on the upper observation deck located near the Glen Haven parking area. As displayed, the boat's weather deck is located about 3 feet above the observation deck. The vertical metal sheeting covering the Aloha is painted white. The stern is rounded in shape and fitted with a large rectangular window with a sliding shutter. The tug's flat 2-level roof-lower over the bow and taller over the vessel's higher rear cabin-is lined with a low metal grab railing, about 6 inches high. Standing on the observation deck just in front of the stern is a wayside panel entitled \"The good tug Aloha.\" Pictured on this wayside is a drawing of a long fishing net stretching vertically above the pale brown sand at the bottom of a deep blue lake. A wide band of paler blue sky fills the panel above the lake's surface. The net holds several fish drawn in white. Two dozen small black dots running along the base of the net represent weights. Appearing along the top of the net are 2 dozen small white dashes labeled \"floats.\" Floating on the water's surface above the net's two top corners are two red buoys topped with red flags. Also appearing on the water's surface above the center of the net are 2 small red circles which are not labeled. Text below the wayside's title explains: The Aloha, part of the boat collection housed in the nearby Cannery, was built for fishing on the Great Lakes. She spent her days navigating deep waters of Lake Michigan gillnetting chubs-small, oily native fish especially prized as smoked fish. Gill nets hang like curtains in the water between floating buoys along their top and anchored lines at their bottom. Chubs swim into the small openings in the net and get caught, often by their gills. Larger fish can't enter the openings and simply swim around the net. The Aloha's crew worked in the enclosed cabin. One used a motorized net lifter to pull up the long gangs of nets (hopefully filled with fish!) through the small hatch near the front on the starboard side. Another removed fish from nets pulled along the sorting table. They then reset the nets through the sliding hatch on the portside stern. As the boat returned to harbor, crews often cleaned and packed the fish on ice in boxes. Back at the dock, they would unload the 100-pound fish boxes before their work was done. See other working and recreational boats from the Great Lakes in the Cannery boat museum. Superimposed one above the other in the wayside's upper right quadrant are two small images. The image at the top is a page printed with Aloha's measurements and other specifications. The tug's weight is noted as 26 gross tons, and materials are listed as \"wood hull with galvanized steel sheeting.\" Additional text tells us that the Fish Tug Aloha was built in 1937 by Sturgeon Bay Boat Works in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. The image appearing below is a black-and-white photo depicting the Aloha docked in the lake. A caption accompanying the photo below d tells us: The Aloha was launched in 1937 and had five different owners during her 50 years of service. She worked out of the Lake Michigan ports of Ellison Bay, Washington Island, Algoma, and Milwaukee, and from Port Wing on Lake Superior. The observation deck holding the Aloha is surrounded by a wooden railing fitted below with a wire mesh grid. This barrier has a total height of approximately 3 feet. Standing a few inches from the railing running alongside the beach at Sleeping Bear Bay is an approximately 5-foot-tall metal pole supporting a pair of binoculars aimed out over the water. A separate metal arm protruding from the left side of the pole at about half its height holds a second pair of binoculars positioned just above the deck railing. As you approach the binoculars from the center of the deck, take care to avoid 2 wooden benches placed side by side, but with a 3-foot-wide space between them, about 4 feet in front of, and parallel with, the deck railing.",

    "audioDescription": "A long wooden ramp that slopes slightly upward leads to the lower observation deck that fronts the sandy beach running alongside Sleeping Bear Bay. Both sides of the ramp and all sides of the deck are edged with an approximately 3-foot-tall wooden railing fitted below with a wire mesh grid. From your position at the top of the ramp, the length of the deck stretches left and right. Located approximately 15 feet directly in front of you are 3 steps flanked by handrails, that descend to the beach.Stretching left and right in front of you approximately 10 feet from the bottom of the beach steps is a line of wooden pillars-each about 3 feet tall-connected by 2 lengths of wire ropes. Directly across from the steps is an opening in this cable fencing and a walkway that provides access to the shoreline. Standing in front of the deck railing about a foot to the right of the top of the beach ramp is the first of 2 wayside panels found on this lower observation deck. This panel, entitled \"Wind, water, and sand,\" features a large background photo showing a panoramic view of Sleeping Bear Bay. Filling the entire length of the photo's bottom half is a thick expanse of tall green dune grass growing in front of the pale blue water. Text below the panel's title reads: Constant wave action, exposure to wind and sun, and violent storms make beaches a challenging place for plants and animals to live. At the same time, their dynamic nature makes them a prime feeding area for birds and fish. Shorebirds, some with long legs and bills, feed on insects along the water's edge.

Stop, watch, listen, and feel. How do the wind, water, and sand challenge you?Superimposed over the background photo in the panel's lower left and right corners respectively are two smaller color photos. The photo on the left offers a close-up view of 2 large seabirds standing on the beach. The birds are white with black feather caps and long orange beaks; the bird on the right holds its beak open wide and its gray-tipped wings aloft. A caption below this photo reads:Caspian Terns nest on beaches and fish in open water.The second photo shows a sparse clump of tall green dune grass anchored in the sloping face of a pale brown sand dune. Mixed among this vegetation are tall blades of marram grass, their thin blades topped with brown pencil-shaped spikes. The second wayside panel, located against the railing on the deck's left side as you face in from the ramp, is entitled \"Watch your step! Endangered species underfoot.\" The background photo on this panel is similar to that on the previous wayside but includes a plant with small pink flowers-the invasive spotted knapweed- growing among the dune grass. Superimposed over the background photo, and arranged from left to right along the panel's bottom edge, are 3 additional color photos. The photo on the left shows 3 small gray, white, and black birds with dark eyes-one adult and 2 chicks-nestled on rocky sand. The middle photo offers a closer view of a single dark-eyed bird sporting a white belly and throat, gray plumage on its back, wings, and cap, a thin black band circling its neck, and a small black patch on its forehead. Text appearing below the panel's main title is broken down into 2 sections. The first section, entitled \"Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus),\" reads:Stand quietly, listen, and scan the cobbled beach. Do you hear high-pitched peeps?

Aral was abandoned when the forest that once surrounded it was cut down. Today the forest reclaims the land, and only a few traces of the town remain.</p> <h3>Aral- murder in the back woods</h3> <p>The beach is a wonderful place to enjoy the sun, wind, and waves and get away from it all, but once this area was a busy lumber town with mills, stores, homes, and even a murder!<br /> <br /> Dr. Arthur O'Leary first noticed the area's potential for lumbering white pines and bought land from Robert Bancroft (the first to move his family to the area). The mill, operating by 1882, consisted of the mill building, living quarters, and a horse barn. A 90-foot long dock stretching out into Lake Michigan was piled high with lumber waiting to be loaded on steamships. Having no real experience in running a mill, O'Leary hired Charles T. Wright from Wisconsin to run the mill.<br /> <br /> Charles Wright was well known in the area. Described as 6'2\", 200 pounds and handsome, he was 31 years old when he started the mill. Wright grew up in the west and believed that the gun was the law, so he always carried one. According to local lore, \"He could put five bullets through your hat before you know what was going on.\" Wright was friendly, a good manager, and respected in town, but he would also become quick-tempered and a two-fisted fighter. These last two qualities would prove to get him in trouble.<br /> <br /> Involved in a tax dispute in 1889, Wright protested and did not pay his taxes, leading to a confrontation with Sheriff Deputy Neil Marshall and local physician Dr. Frank Thurber. Marshall and Wright struggled over a rifle. Marshall let go and backed up; Wright shot and killed him with one shot. Dr. Thurber fought over the rifle; Wright let go and pulled out a revolver, placed it at Thurber's head and fired, and then quickly shot him again in the chest. Wright spent 17 years in prison on a life charge.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are standing in front of a wayside panel entitled \"Aral: 1880 to 1911, A Town That Vanished.\" Text below the wayside's title tells us:<br />This area was once a bustling town of stores and homes. A steam-powered sawmill, located just upstream from the mouth of Otter Creek, was the hub of activity. Sailing ships and steam barges moored at the dock in Lake Michigan. They were loaded with lumber for shipment to the growing cities around the Great Lakes and across the prairies. Aral was abandoned when the forest that once surrounded it was cut down. Today the forest reclaims the land, and only a few traces of the town remain.<br />Featured on this panel are 3 historical black-and-white photos accompanied by captions. The first photo, which appears below the wayside's main text in the panel's lower left corner, depicts a number of buildings lining a street and dotting the nearby landscape. A caption reads:<br />The Robert Bancroft farm was on the north side of the main street. In addition to the mill and horse barns, Aral had several boarding houses, two stores, a bakery and a fish market. Across the creek was another cluster of boarding houses and cabins called Frenchtown.<br />To the right of this image, in the panel's lower right corner, is a second photo showing a large wooden building flanked by piles of logs. Additional logs lie in a shallow body of water pictured in the photo's foreground. A caption tells us:<br />Logs hauled to the mill were rolled into Otter Creek to wash off mud and sand that would dull the saw blades. A conveyer belt lifted the logs up to the cutting area on the second floor. The first floor housed the boilers and steam engine, plus the belts and pulleys that transferred power to the various machines.<br />The 3rd photo, located in the panel's upper right corner, shows a group of men, women, and children standing on a beach. Rising behind them are forested hills running alongside the shoreline. The caption reads:<br />Townsfolk gather on the beach for a community picnic. A few acres of forest on the north side of the main street were set aside as a picnic grounds for the village.<br /><br />Located atop an approximately 5-inch-high wooden platform situated a few feet to the right of the wayside panel are 2 trash receptacles and, to their right, a single recycling receptacle. All 3 metal receptacles, which slant forward toward the front of the platform, have square lids that open upward. Handles are located on the lids' bottom edges, or the edges closest to you as you stand in front of the platform.<br />Also located near the Aral wayside is a vertical wayside featuring a large map of Esch Beach. Standing to the left of, and a few feet behind, this map wayside is a small building holding a single vault toilet. Affixed to the building's one door, which is located beyond a small concrete stoop in front of the structure, is a sign indicating that this is a unisex toilet facility. You must take one shallow step up from the stoop to enter. The door opens outward from left to right.<br />Please take care as you approach the toilet building as it stands atop a slight incline. The cement stoop is flush with the bare ground on its front edge only, and there are no railings. <br />",

Along with the Hutzlers and Haases, they contributed toward making the island a thriving agricultural community. August Beck came to the island as a teenager with his family. At age 19, he married the Haas' 16-year-old daughter. This farm became their home. He, his brothers, and his father worked several farms on the island, but August, the youngest of the Beck brothers, ultimately became one of the island's most professional and progressive farmers.<br /> <br /> Beck brought pedigreed breeding stock to the island to improve the quality of the island's pig production. As a result of his experiences at the Union Stock Yards in Chicago, August Beck was reputed to have been the islands de facto expert when it came to buying and selling livestock. Beck was the first to get a grain cutter and binder and was instrumental in cooperative efforts with other island farmers, such as the acquisition of a jointly-owned and shared threshing machine.<br /> <br /> An energetic man, Beck did take time to socialize with neighbors, playing checkers and talking during winter evenings about politics and about how the farmers could feed the world.<br /> <br /> <b>Threshing</b><br /> Most of the island's farmers grew grains that required threshing to separate the grain from the stalk and husk; the corn, rye and oats was mostly animal feed. Threshing activities required cooperation; a threshing machine was expensive but necessary. Between 1910 and 1940, one large threshing machine was share by the island farmers. During the winter months, at threshing time, the machine would be hauled from one farm to another - it took eight men to operate it. Seventy-five bushels of rye and 150 bushels of oats could be threshed in a day. The machine was then moved to the next farm until all the threshing was done.<br /> <br /> Threshing time was also a social occasion. The women would prepare the meal while the men worked in the fields. The men would come in and wash up for dinner and then sit down a big meal of bread, meat, potatoes, pies, and other desserts before heading back to the fields to work until evening.</p> <h3>Threshing</h3> <p>Most of the island's farmers grew grains that required threshing to separate the grain from the stalk and husk; the corn, rye and oats mostly animal feed.

    "audioDescription": "The August Beck Farm is one of 3 surviving farmsteads on South Manitou Island. Both the August Beck farm and the George Conrad, or G. C., Hutzler Farm are located along an approximately 2-mile-long hiking loop situated in the center of the island. The total hiking distance from the village and around the loop and back is about 6 miles. The George Johann, or G. J., Hutzler Farm is located north of the island's cemetery along another section of trail. Buildings at the Beck Farm include a white clapboard farmhouse and two additional buildings clad in rough-faced shingles. All that remains of the Beck barn is its tall foundation. A small wooden sign bolted to a short pole standing alongside the farmhouse reads: \"A. Beck. Circa 1860.\" Take care as you explore the grassy yard surrounding the buildings as you may encounter uneven ground. There are also some fruit trees located nearby. The 2-story farmhouse has 2 intersecting main building sections and a one-story wing that extends from the back of the house, all covered with black-shingled gable roofs. On the front of the house, tucked between the 2 main sections, is a small porch with a sloping hip roof supported by 2 thin columns. Two steps without railings lead up to the porch, which is also without railings and elevated about 2 feet above the ground at its highest point. There is also a cellar hatchway located a few feet beyond the porch on the house's left side. Filling the gables above the structure's 2nd-story windows is decorative millwork consisting of several horizontal rows of flat scallop-shaped shingles. The windows themselves, which are trimmed in dark-painted wood, are covered with white shutters. All of the shutters have small circular openings-either one or 2 per shutter-located in the center of the shutter's top half, bottom half, or both halves. A handful of shutters also are fitted, either near the bottom edge or near the top, with slightly larger square openings. These square openings appear to be covered with glass, whereas the circular openings appear to be filled in from the inside. The largest of the 2 shingle-sided buildings is a 2-story structure with a tall stone foundation, a side-facing gable roof, and 3 glass windows situated just under the long roofline that faces you. Two rough-hewn wood timbers, slanting outward from top to bottom, flank the entrance door, which is located on the right end of this facade. This building served as the farm's granary. The building's rear side is built into a grassy hill dotted with rocks. To the left of the structure is a stone wall acting as a retaining wall below the hill; to the right of the entrance is a large pointy-topped stone jutting out from the grass. Located to the right of the granary is the Beck Barn foundation, measuring about 40 feet wide by 30 feet long and 6 or more feet high. This foundation reveals that the barn was built using the stovewood construction technique, consisting of short logs, or cordwood, set in mortar. Lining the front and sides of the foundation are several window and door openings crowned with horizontal lengths of lumber spanning the structure's entire width and depth. Note that the lower section of the foundation is constructed of fieldstone.",

Join the 3.5 mile Bass Lake Loop of the Platte Plains trail at the parking lot. You may also wish to add an optional, more strenuous .8-mile spur to Lake Michigan.</p> <h3>Paddle safe</h3> <p>Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.<br /> <br /> <strong>Clean Your Boats</strong><br /> Please clean, drain, and dry your boat after you leave any body of water, especially Lake Michigan, to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species.

    "audioDescription": "A wooden dock and wheelchair-accessible boat ramp provide access to Bass Lake, a calm body of water surrounded by a maple-beech and pine forest. This lake, which lies directly south of Otter Lake, offers opportunities for canoeing, kayaking, fishing, and swimming. The dock and boat ramp are located at the end of Trail's End Road, where the water is edged with tall grasses and other low vegetation. With the exception of an approximately 3-foot-wide section on its front edge, the Bass Lake Dock is lined with a wooden barrier, or curb, measuring about 6 inches high, as well as several wooden pilings, or pillars, about 2 Â½ feet high, that flank the dock's sides. Bolted to the dock in the center of the open section is an approximately 3-foot-high metal handrail, similar to those used in swimming pools. About 6 feet behind you as you stand at the handrail at the front of the dock is a long wooden bench that faces the water. The path approaching the dock is gravel. Standing atop a wooden pole to the left of the dock's entrance is a white sign with red lettering that reads: \"Caution. Hazardous Conditions.\" Additional pillars separate the gravel path from the boat ramp, which slopes downward toward the lake alongside the dock's right side as you face the water. The ramp's concrete surface is partially covered with gravel and overgrown with grass as it nears the water. You must carry your canoe or kayak from the lake's large parking area, where you will also find a vault toilet. Motorized boats are not allowed on the lake. In addition to the water activities available at Bass Lake, the surrounding forest offers hiking on the Platte Plains trail system.",

The approximately 8-foot-long entrance walkway and a longer walkway that runs lengthwise in front of the shop are flat and level with the ground. The transition into the building is also flat, without steps. There are no railings. Positioned in the grassy yard to the left of the building and behind a waist-high rope barrier are several pieces of large equipment, including broken farm machinery and a massive metal cylinder set atop wood blocks. This is identified as a ship's boiler.",

    "audioDescription": "Built as a homestead cabin by the Cooper family in the late 1800s, the Boekeloo Lodge is located on the south side of the Lakeshore at the end of Boekeloo Road, about 8.5 miles south of Esch Road on M-22. This one-story log structure with a red gable roof looks out onto a large pond that once served as a cranberry bog, dug out by Miles Boekeloo in the late 1940s. The name \"Boekelodge\" appears in large raised red letters on the structure's wooden-plank front gable. Located to the left of the lodge's entrance door, which is situated on the facade's right side, are 3 double-hung windows placed side by side. The wooden trim surrounding the windows and the mullions surrounding each window's 12 panes are painted red. The cabin's outer door, which is constructed of what appears to be light-colored natural wood, has 15 glass panes. Extending across the entire width of the lodge's facade is a wooden deck measuring about 25 feet wide, 20 feet deep, and 8 inches high. This deck, which holds a wooden picnic table with attached benches placed lengthwise, or parallel to the building, is slightly lower on the end closest to the building. Near this lower end and on the right side of the deck as you face in from the front of the building, is a wooden walkway, placed nearly flush with the ground. There are no railings on either the walkway or the deck. As you step onto the deck, you may encounter a mat in front of the entrance. The picnic table stands directly to your left. Although the lodge is not open to the public, visitors are invited to walk around the building, which is flanked by forest on all but its front side. Situated about 10 feet in front of the deck's outer edge is a low pile of split logs and dark earth that serves as a retaining wall between the sandy ground surrounding the property and the grassy area edging the pond. Only a few trees dot the grass in front of the lodge, yet the pond's opposite bank is lined with a wall of old trees.",

They emigrated from Germany and arrived in New York state, where Mrs. Burfiend remained while her husband continued on to North Manitou Island. The family originally lived in a log cabin marked by a lilac clump remaining in a field next to Port Oneida Road.<br /> <br /> Magdalena grew up in Port Oneida, married a Port Oneida neighbor, and became the matriarch of many Port Oneidans to follow.<br /> <br /> The Carsten Burfiend farm is on both sides of the Port Oneida Road. The house, garage, and other out-buildings are on the west side of the road on the bluff overlooking Lake Michigan. The foundation of the barn, silo, and milkhouse as well as the corn crib, machine shed, and old machinery are on the east side of the road.<br /> <br /> The Burfiend's garden was located where an apple tree, lilacs, vinca, grapevines, hops, rhubarb, roses, and spirea still grow.<br /> <br /> The original Port Oneida Road ran along the bluff on the other side of the houses. That is why the houses face the Lake Michigan bluff and have their backs toward the road. The road was moved in 1923 after being washed out by storms and because picnickers often lunched in farmers' front lawns.<br /> <br /> Carsten, Elizabeth, and several of their children are buried on the farm.<br /> <br /> In 1891, the Peter Burfiends moved to the farm. Peter Burfiend was known within the community for his ax work: he could hew to a line. He could do it with both the broad ax and the adze, and he often did ax work in trade with neighbors.<br /> <br /> Burfiend was a hard worker. His grandson recalls, \"The only time my grandfather ever set down or took a rest was if it would rain-he would crawl in the hay mow and go to sleep. Other than that, if he couldn't do anything else, he'd grab a hoe & go out in the cornfield and start hoeing weeds.\"<br /> On Sundays, however, Peter shaved, put his suit on, got his cane, and walked to church. After church he smoked his weekly cigar, often sitting on a bench looking over the lake and passing ships, until evening chore time.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "north of M-22. Situated to the west of the road are several structures, including a 2-story white clapboard farmhouse, a one-story garage, and, positioned in the grass several yards behind and to the right of the house, a small outbuilding, presumably an outhouse. The farmhouse faces the bluff overlooking Lake Michigan, and visitors are offered a glimpse of the lake through the trees standing just beyond the house's front lawn. The Port Oneida Road runs behind these buildings. Located on the east side of the road is the foundation of the farm's original barn, silo, and milk house, as well as the corn crib, machine shed, and several pieces of abandoned farm machinery. As viewed from the front, the farmhouse has a black-shingled gable roof and a square wood-floored porch with its own gable roof supported by 3 square pillars on its front edge. The porch is elevated about a foot or more above the grassy ground surrounding the house, but there are no steps. A brick chimney rises alongside a smaller side-facing gable located further back on the roof, near the middle of the building. There are 4 windows on the facade: one rectangular multi-paned window located to the left of the entrance door, which is on the porch's right side, 2 other windows located in the second story above the porch roof, and a smaller square window with a single pane centered at the top of the gable just below the roofline. White-painted wood boards cover a double window located to the left of the porch on the first floor. The garage is located slightly behind and to the right of the house with one long side facing toward us. The farmhouse dates to around 1930.",

Stop and spend some time walking through the Heritage Center's exhibits to learn more about Port Oneida and life on the farm. The Olsen farm is also the headquarters for Preserve Historic Sleeping Bear, a nonprofit partner of the National Lakeshore that helps preserve the historic structures and offers heritage tours and programs. <a href=\"http://www.phsb.org\">www.phsb.org</a>.<br /> <br /> Charles and Hattie [Brammer] Olsen bought this land in 1915 from Frederick Dechow, who had first purchased it in 1857. The Olsen's farmhouse was built around 1918 by Paul Popa and is the newest in the Port Oneida Historical District and the most modern. The house had the first indoor plumbing; water was pumped by hand into a tank in the attic to provide the pressure for the system. A dairy farm, the Charles Olsen farm was the first to achieve Grade A dairy status in Port Oneida.<br /> <br /> The silo on the farm is a unique construction with steel rods that support the wood staves and a concrete foundation.<br /> <br /> Filling the silo, like buzzing wood and thrashing grain, was a job that required a crew. There were four silos in Port Oneida, and the silo-filling bee moved from farm to farm. Four or five men would be in the field cutting corn and loading two to three wagons. Any kids around would cut corn. They would cut a bundle all the corn they could hold in their hand with a corn hoe and then tie it and take it to the wagon. Later they got a corn binder, which cut the stalks and tied them into bundles. The women would be busy cooking. Doors would be set out on saw-horses to hold the feast the farm women provided for the workers.<br /> <br /> Windbreaks were very important for keeping the soil in the fields. The farmers never cut down trees in a windbreak. The Olsen Farm is protected from northwestern winds by a steep ridge that slopes up from behind the farmyard to the north. A Norway spruce windbreak defines the western boundary of the farmyard, and rows of sugar maples line both sides of the highway in front of the house.<br /> <br /> A black locust grove remains on the side of the ridge, northeast of the house. The hard wood of black locust was prized for fence posts.<br /> Hattie's mother once lived in the grandmother's house which was located behind the primary residence. Ornamental plantings mark its site.</p> <h3> </h3>",
    "audioDescription": "A short dirt driveway leads into the Charles and Hattie Olsen Farm, which is located on the M-22 Leelanau Scenic Heritage Route. This is the newest farm in Port Oneida with 2 buildings dating to 1918: a modified bungalow-style farmhouse and a large 2-story barn. These buildings are situated to the right and left of the driveway respectively. The farmhouse contains a history center offering several exhibits providing information about the Port Oneida area. The 2-story farmhouse is clad with white clapboard, and there is a single brick chimney jutting from the center of its black-shingled gable roof. Extending across the entire width of the structure's facade is an open concrete porch, its low-pitched shed roof supported by a white-painted beam and 4 block pillars, tapered at the top. The beam's curved bottom edge forms 5 arches: 3 separating the 4 pillars on the front of the porch, and 2 between each of the end pillars and the house facade itself. Positioned on the porch roof between the 2 central pillars framing the entrance is a gable pediment featuring on its face a red and white sunburst design. This design is repeated on both gable ends on the house's 2 sides and also on the sides of a dormer with shed roof that juts out from the main gable roof above the porch. There are 2 such sunburst designs on each gable end, framing a small diamond-shaped window located just below the gable's peak. There are 2 wide concrete steps in front of the porch at its center, flanked by a line of low manicured shrubs on either side. Take care as you take one additional step up to reach the porch itself, as you may encounter 2 potted plants, one each placed in the opening formed by the 2 central pillars. There are no railings on the front steps nor on the porch. Standing on the porch's left edge and reaching to the roof is a tall open-grid trellis. The porch's right side is open, overlooking a small garden and a white picket fence extending away from the building. You may encounter 2 benches, one each placed below the 2 windows flanking the entrance door, which will be located straight in front of you as you step onto the porch. There may also be a thin mat placed in front of the door. There is a wide wooden ramp without railings located on the back of the house. As you near the top of the ramp, a wooden entrance door will be on your right. Mounted to the building to the left of the door is a cast iron bell with an attached rope dangling to about 3 Â½ feet above the ramp. Grab the ball at the end of the rope to ring the bell, and someone will open the door for you. Otherwise, this door remains locked. Section 2 (161 words)The farmhouse interior boasts hardwood floors and dark wooden trim around the windows and doors. Here you will find a series of displays, maps, and videos offering an in-depth look at the Olsen family and others in the Port Oneida community, as well as information about the 366 historic structures and landscape features found in this area. Also included is information about the Port Oneida residents who rescued passengers and crew of the Rising Sun, which wrecked on the shore here in October, 1917. As you step inside the farmhouse, a small information desk with guestbook will be located immediately to your right. An arbor with arched top in the middle of the picket fence allows access to a single picnic table with benches located in the back yard. As you approach the table, take care to avoid a large propane tank and a wooden clothesline standing near the table. The farmhouse is open in the summer months through Labor Day. Section 3 (176 words) The three-bay barn is the only remaining gambrel-roofed barn-and also one of the largest barns-in the Port Oneida Rural Historic District. Its exterior is constructed of red-painted vertical wooden planks, and both its sloping gambrel roof and a shed roof sheltering a one-story section on the end closest to the driveway are constructed of gray metal sheeting. A silo located on the barn's back end is made of wood staves and is supported by steel rods which band the silo at every few feet up the silo's height. This barn is partially built into a hill on its right side.<br />Take care as you walk around the barn as there is a stone retaining wall extending out from the barn's right side. This wall is topped with a narrow walkway leading upward to a door on that same side of the building. It is not suggested that you climb this walkway as there are no railings on its front side, which is situated at least 4 feet above the ground at its highest point.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Want to really experience the dune plateau? The 1.5-mile Cottonwood Trail is a great place to get out of your car, loop through the perched dunes, and see the sublime scenery up close. The Cottonwood trail loops over unique dune landscapes and offers spectacular views over golden sand dunes of the azure sky, aquamarine Glen Lake, white D. H. Day barn, ultramarine blue Lake Michigan, and distant verdant green of the Manitou Islands.<br /> <br /> <b>Leashed pets allowed on trail.</b><br /> <br /> The trail winds through the Sleeping Bear Plateau, a 4 square-mile highland that raises more than 400 feet above Lake Michigan and is covered with a veneer of perched dunes. Much of trail, particularly the first half, is through loose sand and hilly. Both can be tiring, but overall it is an easy hike that is good for small children. It will give you a close look at the beauty and diversity of the these shifting hills of open sand: cottonwood trees shading the path; native vegetation such as bearbeary and buffaloberry tendrils hugging the sand and stabilizing the rolling dunes; blowouts-areas of wind erosion where it looks like the wind has scooped the sand away; partially buried living trees. Colorful wildflowers dot the trail, and tracks in the sand reveal the elusive wildlife of the dunes.<br /> <br /> <b>Protect your park</b><br /> Please stay on designated trails. This will help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Avoid disturbing plants and animals: threatened and endangered species occur in the park.</p> <h3>Cottonwood self-guiding hiking trail</h3> <p>Welcome to the Cottonwood Trail-an interpretive trail with nine posts that tell the story about life on the dunes, describes the plant life and geology of the area, and explains why the mounds of advancing sand in this ever-changing land are so special and so fragile.Â Allow about an hour to walk this 1.5-mile loop. Portions of the trail go through loose sand and are strenuous.<br /> At stop #7 you will find a bench where you can relax and enjoy the view of Glen Lake.<br /> <br /> The dunes are an ever-changing landscape. If we could view a time-lapse movie of the dunes, we would see them growing and advancing across the land; we would see plants taking root and holding the sand in place; and we would see wind eroding the dunes, leaving behind irregular, broken surfaces. As you walk along the Cottonwood Trail, you will have a chance to see all of this, captured for a moment in time. Enjoy!<br /> <br /> <strong>#1 Watch out for poison ivy along the beginning of the trail</strong><br /> You can develop a rash from touching the plant or even from touching your shoes, pants, or pets after walking through a patch of poison ivy. All parts of the plant contain an oil, urushiol, which causes the rash.<br /> <br /> <strong>#2 The blowout</strong><br /> Notice the bowl-shaped dune ahead and to the right of the trail. It is called a blowout. Prevailing southwesterly winds ate at the dune, eroding it after time, and forming the blowout.<br /> <br /> Originally this area was a sand hill, or dune. Gradually, grasses grew on the dune and held the sand in place. Winds blew on the dune from the same direction, blowing away sand on one side of the dune. Notice that the cover of grass remains on the part of the dune protected from the wind.<br /> <br /> <strong>#3 The old road</strong><br /> This section of the trail travels over part of an abandoned loop of the old Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive. You can see the gravel from the old road. As you walk along you will discover why the route was changed. Several feet of sand has buried the old road's surface in some places.<br /> <br /> The clay and gravel surface of the old road is quite different from the pure sand of the dunes and brought in roadside wildflowers. These wildflowers include white sweet clover, spotted knapweed, and Queen Anne's lace. These not native American plants originated in Europe. Alien plants frequently take over disturbed locations like roadsides and old farm fields. The different soil along the road helped give the alien plants an advantage over the natives.<br /> <br /> <strong>#4 Dune restoration study area</strong><br /> The dunes are a fragile environment. Hikers can quickly damage the plant life, leaving paths that take years to revegetate. This is why we ask you to remain on designated trails in the dunes.<br /> <br /> The Dune Restoration Study Area was set up in 1984 to study various methods of restoring native plants to damaged dunes. Among the methods tried were planting of beachgrass, adding fertilizer, and setting up a snow fence to trap sand.<br /> <br /> <strong>#5 Sand</strong><br /> Pick up a handful of sand and study it closely. Notice that all the grains are just about the same size. They are small enough to blow about in the wind, but heavy enough to come to rest quickly when the wind stops blowing.<br /> <br /> The grains of sand are not all the same color because several different minerals are present. Quartz is the most common and appears either clear or rusty from a coating of iron oxide. Quartz is very hard and resistant to breaking down chemically or physically. Other colors in the sand represent different minerals present in minor amounts. The grains of sand come from the breakdown of larger rocks.<br /> <br /> Dune sand is typically well-rounded and shows a frosted surface from contact with other sand grains.<br /> <br /> <strong>#6 Grasses and flowers of the dunes</strong><br /> Quite a variety of grasses and wildflowers live on the sand dunes.<br /> <br /> <em>Beach grass</em> (marram) is one of the first plants to grow on a newly-formed dune. Its roots form a dense network that helps to hold the sand in place. When sand piles around its stalks, beach grass can grow rapidly to avoid being buried.<br /> <br /> <em>Sand reed</em> is another important sand binder. The feathery seed heads are quite different from the tight clusters of seeds in beach grass.<br /> <br /> <em>Little bluestem</em> grows on stabilized dunes. It is a bunchgrass, forming distinct clumps rather than a continuous cover. It is not as well suited to preventing erosion as is beach grass.<br /> <br /> <em>Wormwood</em> belongs to the same group of plants as western sagebrush. The flowers, blooming from July through October, are pollinated by the wind. They are not showy because there is no need to attract insects for pollination. Perhaps you will see a small brownish plant growing at the base of the wormwood. This is broomrape, a Michigan protected wildflower. Lacking chlorophyll for manufacturing its food, the broomrape lives as a parasite on the wormwood.<br /> <br /> <em>Beach pea </em>blooms in July and August. The bright pink flowers resemble the garden sweet pea. Like other members of the legume family, the beach pea is a nitrogen fixer, improving the soil for other plants.<br /> <br /> <strong>#7 View from the benches</strong><br /> From here you can survey the dunes, Glen Lake, and the surrounding countryside. The Dune Climb below, where thousands of people climb each year, lies along the western edge of the dunes. The sand advances there at a rate of about 4 feet per year.<br /> <br /> If you stop at the Dune Climb later, look for the exhibit on sand movement. In 1985 a horizontal beam was placed at the edge of the dunes so you can see just how far the sand has advanced. It is located just north of the main climbing area at the start of the Duneside Trail and has had to be moved as the sand encroached on the beam.<br /> <br /> Actually, the rate of movement of these dunes in minor compared to some desert dunes. The wind off Lake Michigan loses strength over distance and cannot move sand further than a mile from the shore.<br /> <br /> <strong>#8 An active dune</strong><br /> The cottonwood trees on this dune tell a story of change. Some of the trees are being buried in sand, while others have had their roots exposed. You can follow some of the runners along the surface of the dune to places where new trees (clones) have sprouted.<br /> <br /> Feel a leaf of a cottonwood. Would you describe it as waxy or plastic-like? This type of leaf is common to many different plants in dry locations. The leaf surface helps prevent water loss. Actually, the dunes are not a desert. They receive around 30 inches of rainfall in a year. However, the dunes are somewhat drier than the neighboring forests because of strong sunlight, wind, and the lack of a moisture-holding humus (decayed plant matter) layer. Water drains away quickly though sand. Therefore, dune plants have some of the same adaptations as desert plants that receive little water.<br /> <br /> <strong>#9 Shrubs of the dunes</strong><br /> As you walk along this section of trail, look for some of the typical shrubs of stabilized dunes. Try to spot a paper birch, a small tree with white bark.<br /> <br /> Why is the plant community here so different from what you saw earlier? This location is more sheltered from the wind, and the underlying glacial deposits which provide more moisture and nutrients than pure sand are closer to the surface.<br /> <br /> <em>Common juniper </em>is an evergreen shrub that occurs in two forms: an upright form 3-5 feet tall, and a low form that covers the ground.<br /> <br /> <em>Bearberry</em> forms a low ground cover. It is a broad-leaved evergreen with tiny pink flowers in the spring and red berries in late summer and fall.<br /> <br /> <em>Buffaloberry</em> stands 3-5 feet high and has small clusters of orange berries. The shrub contributes nitrogen to the soil through bacteria that live on its roots.<br /> <br /> <em>Sand cherry</em> is a small shrub with white flowers in the spring and blackish cherries in late summer. A black fungus sometimes grows on the twigs.<br /> <br /> We hope you have enjoyed your walk on the Cottonwood Trail. There are several other trails in the National Lakeshore, and we hope you take time to explore them as well.</p> <h3>Hike safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.</p> <ul> <li>Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.</li> <li>Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.</li> <li>Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.</li> <li>Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.</li> </ul> <p>And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> <br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.</p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year?

    "audioDescription": "Cottonwood Trail is an approximately 1½-mile loop that takes visitors through the perched sand dunes above the Dune Climb. The trail provides access to a variety of cottonwood trees, dune grasses, shrubs, and wildflowers as well as views of Glen Lake and D.H. Day farm. Also of interest is a bowl-shaped dune located to the right of the trail. This dune is called a blowout, formed by erosion from southwesterly winds. Although much of the trail winds through loose sand, the approach at the trailhead is paved, and the trail's first several feet are covered with a walkway of wide wooden planks. Both the paved area and the walkway are level with the ground flanking them on either side, and there are no railings. Affixed to the top of the first of several wooden poles standing several feet apart to the right of the trail is a small sign with the drawing of a bicycle intersected with a diagonal red line. Text below the drawing reads: \"No Bicycles.\" Please be advised that much of this trail is hilly and there is no shade. It is recommended that you wear sturdy shoes, a hat, and carry drinking water and sunscreen. There is a bench along the way where you may sit and survey the dunes, Glen Lake and the surrounding countryside. As you walk the trail, take care to avoid poison ivy, which is a common dune plant found along this and other trails at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Collecting plant life is not permitted, and all pets must be kept on a leash",

    "audioDescription": "A wide tiered ramp provides boat access to Crystal River, which flows from Glen Lake to Lake Michigan at the north end of the park. The 2 dirt steps making up the ramp section closest to the water each measure about 4 Â½ feet deep and are edged with logs at both the top and bottom. Crystal River offers visitors an opportunity to canoe, kayak, or paddle in calm water. You may bring your own boat, raft, or tube, or you can rent canoes and kayaks in Glen Arbor. Note that low water levels in the Crystal River can make canoeing difficult at times. Bolted to a wooden pole standing near the river is a sign entitled \"Crystal River: yours to protect.\" Drawn on the sign's bottom half and extending across the entire width of the sign are 3 wavy bands of color beginning with a dark blue band on top, a light blue band in the middle, and a yellowish-green band on the bottom. These bands are labeled from top to bottom as \"high,\" \"medium,\" and \"low.\" Affixed to the sign to the left of these labels is a red arrow that points to the label indicating the water level at the time of your visit. Text on this sign explains: Over 135 animal species call Crystal River home. Many are tiny creatures that cling to the river bottom or thrive among aquatic plants. As water levels drop, their habitat...and their lives...are at risk. Destroyed habitat poses a serious threat to the fishery, as well as everyone's enjoyment of the river. Please help preserve aquatic habitat by checking the red arrow for current water level. High. Canoes and kayaks float peacefully over aquatic life. These water levels provide the most fun for people and the least risk for aquatic organisms. Medium. Use caution: avoid shallow areas so boats, paddles, and feet do not contact the river bottom. Keep boats as light as possible to prevent bottom disturbance. When in doubt, use a second boat.",

    "bodyText": "<p>D.H. Day built this simple two-story frame house in Glen Haven in 1890 as a birthday present for his wife Eva, but she preferred the convenience of living above the general store she ran while raising a family, so Day employees and other family members lived in the house. According to Day's granddaughter, Pat (Day) Bennet, her father Bill Day had a garden straight back from the house by the apple tree.<br /> <br /> The attached garage was originally the village paint shop, then the Glen Haven post office. It was moved here in 1941 when the house was remodeled.<br /> <br /> The blue spruce on the knoll between the store and Day House was planted there in 1989 by Day's daughter, Marion (Day) Warnes. She planted it to commemorate the one hundredth year anniversary of her parent's marriage. Before the spruce, a cut tree was placed on the knoll (same location) and decorated with Christmas lights each year for about forty years.</p> <h3>Local Native Americans</h3> <p>There were two Indian families who used to work for D.H.Day; the Westmans and the Jacksons. According to resident Newt Sheridan, John Westman was a well-liked man, a real hard worker.<br /> <br /> Elizabeth Westman. John's daughter talks about growing up in the area:<br /> \"I was born in Glen Haven, the youngest of seven children and a member of the Ottawa tribe. We lived in a long building built by Mr. Day. The building was a short way from Sleeping Bear Inn. There was a slaughter house nearby, and we got some meat from there. We used to cook in a three-legged iron kettle with no top on it. We put hog's heads in there and made head cheese. We caught fish and had many fish frys. We saved the grease and fried doughnuts in it. We did all our cooking outside. We were share-croppers too, so we had enough food. We were given brown stamps for shoes and green stamps for vegetables.<br /> Mother taught me how to make baskets. We used the black ash for weaving when we could get it. We sold our baskets down by the pier and at the Tanawatha Resort. When the noon dinner bell rang there, all the people came-some days, Mother made fifty dollars. She also took orders for more baskets. We were busy in the spring gathering maple syrup and making sugar candy. We sold that too.\"<br /> <br /> There were about thirty Indians living in our area. They were all related. The name of the other family was Jackson.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "The rustic D.H. Day Campground lies in a wooded area on M-109 about 5 miles north from the point where M-109 intersects with M-22. This facility offers 88 private camp sites as well as easy access to a Lake Michigan beach from the campground's north end. Vault toilets and water spigots are available throughout the campground. Fires are allowed in the metal fire rings provided at each site. Campers must stop at the campground office before selecting a campsite. This office, which is located near the campground entrance, is contained within a small one-story structure with a gable roof and a small front porch. You may access the porch in one of 2 ways: either by stepping up a short wooden walkway and 2 steps located on the porch's left end or by using a longer wooden ramp that runs perpendicular to the front of the porch. The top of the short wooden walkway is positioned about 4 inches above the surrounding ground. There are no railings alongside this walkway, but the 2 steps leading from this walkway up to the porch are flanked on the left by a wooden handrail and on the right by a square porch pillar. Standing about 3 feet to the right of this walkway is a flagpole flying a United States flag. The longer wooden ramp, which slopes slightly upward to meet the porch just to the right of the porch pillar abutting the shorter walkway, is flanked on both sides by wooden balusters topped with flat hand railings. The porch's front and right side are also edged with a similar wooden barrier. The entrances to the short wooden walkway and the wooden ramp are each marked with a wide band of bright yellow paint. D.H. Day Campground is open from the first Friday in April through the last Sunday in November each year. During the summer season, nightly ranger-led evening programs are held in the on-site amphitheater. Program information and other notices are posted on a sheltered structure located alongside the campground's parking lot. Campsites are available on a first-come-first-served basis only Reservations are not accepted. Camping fees vary.",

    "audioDescription": "Located just north of the D.H. Day Campground is the D. H. Day Log Cabin, a one-story log structure constructed in 1923. This historic cabin stands alongside the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail and can be accessed from both the campground and the parking area at Glen Haven to the west. The cabin features an open porch and a side-facing gable roof covered with dark shingles. Jutting up from the roof's center is a log cupola, also with a dark-shingled gable roof. Rising above the building roof on its right end is a large stone chimney. Visible below the porch is the building's low stone foundation.<br /> There are two 12-paned glass windows on the front of the cabin, one each flanking a central double entrance door. There is also a 6-paned glass window on the cupola's front side, tucked directly below its roofline. A stone walkway leads to the front of the cabin, where there are 2 wide stone steps positioned below the wooden porch, which extends across the full width of the building's facade. You must take one tall step up from the top-most step to reach the porch floor, which is situated about 2 feet above the surrounding grass. The overhanging porch roof is supported by 4 square wooden pillars, 2 each flanking the stone steps and 2 others standing at the porch's left and right ends. There are no railings or other barriers positioned alongside the stone walkway, the steps, or surrounding the porch. Take care as you walk along the stone walkway as although its top surface is flush with the surrounding grass, it is uneven in spots and you may encounter thick tufts of grass growing up between some of the stones. Note that the cabin's porch can also be accessed by an upward sloping wooden ramp located on the left end of the building. This ramp is flanked by wooden railings on both sides. Once on the porch, you may encounter a wooden bench placed below one or both of the 2 windows flanking the entrance. Situated on the porch directly in front of the entrance door is an upward-sloping wooden threshold, about one foot deep. The right-side double door will likely be propped open when the cabin is open for visitors. Features found inside the one-room cabin include a tall stone fireplace surround with a flat stone hearth, a display case holding various artifacts, and any number of wooden benches, tables, cabinets, or metal folding chairs. Lastly, standing near the approach to the cabin is a green sign labeled \"Michigan Registered Historic Site.\" Text in yellow lettering reads: Early State Parks. By the end of World War I, with the rapid growth of the recreation industry in Michigan, a need for a state-wide parks system had arisen. In 1919 the State Park Commission was established. D. H.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Dechow Farm has some of the best soil in Port Oneida which explains why it was one of the most productive farms. Frederick and Fredericka Dechow purchased the farm and built a log cabin in 1857. Sons John and Charles built the barn around 1890.<br /> <br /> Grandson Fred built the new house around 1910: a showplace of modern style. A few years later, he was able to buy the neighboring farm just to the east of his original farm and add it to his land. The house and other buildings were removed, but the barn remains in the field to the east of the main Dechow buildings.<br /> <br /> The Dechows raised apples and maintained a small herd of dairy cows. They sold milk, cream, and eggs to local resorts. According to a local resident, they had extensive orchards located between the house and pasture barn.<br /> <br /> In a community where everybody's connected to somebody else, everybody takes care of everybody else. The Dechows often employed neighbor children. Laura Basch's first job was at the Dechow farm. She earned one dollar a week-big wages at the time-doing general housework, cooking, \"anything that Mrs. Dechow wanted me to.\"<br /> <br /> They also helped the neighborhood children by pulling teeth for the children. With no dentist nearby to fill cavities, folks would take their children down to Frank Dechow who would use his pair of forceps to pull unhappy teeth.<br /> <br /> A row of sugar maple trees leads to a sugar shack built about 1944. The Dechows made about 20 gallons of syrup a year. During the war, when sugar was rationed, maple syrup was used to sweeten almost everything.<br /> <br /> A hay loader in the field east of the farm reminds us of the worker bees during haying season. The hay loader gathered the loose hay from the field (before balers). Two men were up on the wagon to move the hay around and place it so that the load would stay balanced and packed in, and then it would go into the barn. A hay fork was used to put the hay away in the loft. They'd stick the fork a couple of feet into the hay, so that when the team of horses pulled the rope it would wind the hay up to the top of the barn. As the team continued pulling, the pulley would run down a track until it was over the hay mow. Another rope was then pulled to release the load. Workers then had to spread it in the mow, because it would only land in a big pile right down the middle of the mow, and it had to spread out to the edges.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A paved driveway leads to the Dechow Farm, located south of M-22 where it intersects with Port Oneida Road. This farm boasts a number of original buildings, including a farmhouse, a large barn with a silo and milk house, a granary building with a slat-sided corncrib, and other small buildings that once served as chicken coops. The farmhouse, which dates to about 1910, stands alone to the left of the driveway. It is a white clapboard structure with four tapered pillars supporting the roof sheltering the building's elevated front porch. The house is flanked by 2 large maple trees; extending to the left of the house is a vast grassy field. This farmhouse is a private residence and therefore not open to visitors. Turn your attention to the buildings standing in the field to the right of the driveway. The farm's large 2-story barn, which dates to around 1890, is constructed of dark gray wooden planks, and its gable roof consists of pale gray metal sheeting. The barn is situated with one long side facing you. Standing on the barn's left end as you face from the driveway is a tall concrete stave silo. Fitted into this side of the building's weathered exterior is a single 4-pane window located to the left of a small entrance door. You will encounter a slight incline as you approach the door and a wide stone step directly in front of it. Inside the barn you will find a row of rusty upright metal frames fitted with tubular bars that arch from midway up the frames down to the building's concrete floor. Also attached to the frames a few inches above the floor are small bowl-like receptacles, or drinking cups. These are the stanchions which held the cows in place while they were fed and milked. Cut into the floor and running alongside the stanchions is a narrow water trough. At least 2 mangers, or metal boxes once used to hold hay or grain, are also displayed here. Take care as you explore the barn's interior as there may be tripping hazards. The farm's small white milk house is attached to the back right corner of the barn. Located to the left of and perpendicular to the barn is the large granary building, a white clapboard structure with a 2-story main section with gable roof and, on the building's right side, a low open storage area and corncrib sheltered by a shed roof. The storage area, which is situated between a set of 3 stairs leading to the granary's wooden entrance door and the weathered gray wood-slat corncrib, may hold a variety of vintage farm equipment during the time of your visit. You may encounter other farm equipment from various eras scattered about the fields.",

    "audioDescription": "A concrete sidewalk leads to the one-story Dune Center bookstore, a white wood structure with a wide gable porch roof supported by 4 square brown pillars. The center's single entrance door-painted white with a fixed window located on its top half-is located approximately 4 feet directly in front of you as you step from sidewalk to porch. The porch, also concrete, spans nearly the entire length of the building's facade. Although the approach to the center's entrance is flat and without steps, take care to avoid the 2 porch roof pillars that flank the sidewalk where it meets the porch. Note that the entrance door opens outward from left to right. There are 5 windows on the front of the center, one single double-hung window located directly to the left of the entrance door and two pairs of double-hung windows, one pair each located on each end of the facade. Affixed to the triangular gable wall above the entrance is a rectangular white sign with the words \"The Dune Center\" painted in black, red, and dark-green uppercase letters. The tops of the red letters forming the word \"Dune\" appear to undulate upward and then downward, mimicking the shape of an actual sand dune. Also affixed to the facade are 3 smaller signs, one located to the right of the door and two located to the left of the single double-hung window. The sign on the right reads \"Eastern National, Servicing America's National Parks,\" and the signs on the left include the arrowhead-shaped sign representing the National Park Service emblem and, below it, a sign that reads \"Restrooms Next Door\" with a black arrow pointing to the left. There is a silver metal ashtray hanging on the facade to the right of the entrance door. The tray's cylindrical base is located approximately 3 feet above the porch floor. The Dune Center is open seasonally from late spring through Labor Day.",

This open dune forms the eastern edge of the Sleeping Bear Plateau, a 4 square-mile field of perched dunes that extends to Lake Michigan to the west and Sleeping Bear Point to the north.<br /> <br /> The Dune Climb is different than almost all other dunes along the Lake Michigan shore. Most dunes are created when the wind takes sand from Lake Michigan beaches and piles it up. But the sand at the Dune Climb has never been in Lake Michigan or on a Lake Michigan beach, and the wind has actually piled it DOWN. The sand at the Dune Climb came from dunes higher up on the Sleeping Bear Plateau.<br />  </p> <p>The Dune Climb is an active dune that moves. An exhibit at the base of the dune at the north end of the Dune Climb features a measuring stick that, with the help of a little arithmetic, will calculate how much the Dune Climb moves toward the parking area each year. This is not just a little sand blowing across the ground but the full wall of sand moving ahead.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Dune Climb is 110 feet high, or roughly the equivalent height of an 11-story building. From the adjacent parking area, you must step through a large grassy area before reaching the base of the dune, which may be climbed on foot. This dune, which resembles a wide, flat-topped volcano rising out of the surrounding landscape, is largely without vegetation. Before you reach the Dune Climb, note that there is a single drinking fountain located inside a square concrete area to your right. At the base of the dune on its far left end is a small roofed sign with a small box holding pamphlets affixed to the sign's support pole. Once you reach the top of the dune, you may turn around to face a wide view of Glen Lake, which is visible beyond the trees lining the site's parking area. Also atop the dune is a hilly 3.5-mile hiking trail that travels through the high dunes plateau to Lake Michigan. Walking this trail can prove strenuous for inexperienced hikers and may be a 3- to 4-hour trip. As there is no shade on the Dune Climb or along the Dunes Hiking Trail, it is suggested that hikers bring water, sunscreen, a hat, and reliable shoes. This site's wayside panel, entitled \"Sand and Ice,\" is mounted inside a wooden frame on 2 legs, approximately 7 feet tall by 4 feet wide. Featured on the panel's top half is a large aerial photo of the Dune Climb, the dune plateau, and the nearby parking lot. Text below the photo tells us: Without departed glaciers, the dunes would not be here. Melting continental ice left this ridge of sand and gravel. Steady winds off Lake Michigan have plucked at the sand grains, propelling them inland, depositing a veneer of dunes on top of the glacial ridge. Even now the dune is adrift, as part of the slope advances toward Glen Lake. Pick out a nearby tree or shrub; return in a few years and it may be buried. Beyond this wall of sand is a windswept plateau covered with small stones, an occasional ice-abandoned boulder, a few tufts of vegetation, and sculpted dunes. On this side are good views of Glen Lake. But it is an hour's hike to the steep bluffs 400 feet above Lake Michigan.",

Often it turns out that there was simply a misunderstanding as to when the group would meet up. Agree on a plan before splitting up, and be realistic about the time it will take for a hike. Remember, it may take 2-4 hours depending on the weather and your physical condition.<br /> <br /> <strong>Which way do I go?</strong> Out on the dunes there are few clues as to which way you need to go. The best plan is to follow one of the marked hiking trails and carry a map. The hiking trails in the dunes are marked with posts with blue tops. That will also minimize the human impact on this fragile ecosystem. If you are determined to explore off-trail, be sure to bring a compass and keep track of your directions.<br /> <br /> Be aware that cell coverage here, as in many locations within the National Lakeshore is unreliable and that cell phone batteries drain much more quickly in poor coverage areas. You may or may not be able to contact others in your party or phone for help.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watch those slopes. </strong>Steep dune slopes occasionally collapse- a dangerous situation if you are there! This is especially hazardous during winter and early spring seasons. Another reason to avoid them is to help dune grass roots remain intact and do their job of holding the sand in place.<br /> <br /> <strong>Resist the ridges.</strong>We tend to be drawn to walking along the narrow ridge tops among the dunes. However, this is another part of the dunes which is highly vulnerable to erosion. It's best to hike on the broad open plains where possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Keep it under control.</strong> Often folks begin running down the dunes, and soon find their legs can't keep up with the rest of them! Resulting tumbles can cause injuries. While careful, controlled running at the Dune Climb is relatively safe, other slopes have hidden rocks and other hazards which can cause serious injuries.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't be shoeless.</strong> Even if you don't want to wear shoes at the start, throw a pair into a backpack. The sand can be very hot and abrasive and underground shoots of dune grass can stab into your feet.<br /> <br /> Go wet & wild. The dunes are a bit like a desert environment, and you will need to stay hydrated. Bring a bottle of water.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't be a ghost-buster.</strong> Everyone enjoys the \"ghost forests\" (trees that long-ago became buried by moving dunes, then reappeared after the dunes moved). Please leave them because they are the most photographed ghosts around.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watch the wind.</strong> The wind-blown sand can be irritating to eyes and skin. On the other hand, it can make for great kite flying.</p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year?

This hike is challenging. If you have trouble scaling the Dune Climb at the beginning, think twice before continuing on, as you will have to climb five more dunes of various heights. The hike up and down over sand dunes offers multiple views of Glen Lake and Lake Michigan, and the sparse dune ecology.<br /> <br /> The Dunes Trail goes straight up a huge dune right away. For most families, stopping here and letting the kids play on the huge dune might be the way to go. The kids can play for hours on this formation tumbling down the hill over and over again. Many people get sucked in and want to hike to the lake, but be warned: <strong>Lake Michigan is not just over that next dune</strong>. The trail's hilly, sandy terrain can be very difficult to traverse, and a round trip may take several hours if the temperatures are unfriendly. This trail has worn out the most experienced hikers. Pack water and wear appropriate footwear. Be prepared for hot sand and no escape from the sun.<br /> <br /> The rolling dunes are beautiful and vary in cover from open sand or patches of beach grass and wildflowers to a lone cottonwood here and there.

Stopping to take in the gorgeous views of the northeastern shore of Lake Michigan from the dunes is an excellent excuse for a break.<br /> <br /> The hike is a workout for many people, but the isolated beach along Lake Michigan and its refreshing surf is a great place to recuperate before heading back along the same route. </p> <h3>Hike the Dunes Trail Safely</h3> <p>If you are going to hike in the Dunes, there are a few things you should do to make your trip more enjoyable.<br /> <br /> <strong>What's the plan?</strong> Rangers are called upon to conduct many searches each summer because folks back at the Dune Climb are concerned about companions who have been out on the dunes longer than expected. Often it turns out that there was simply a misunderstanding as to when the group would meet up. Agree on a plan before splitting up, and be realistic about the time it will take for a hike. Remember, it may take 2-4 hours depending on the weather and your physical condition.<br /> <br /> <strong>Which way do I go?</strong> Out on the dunes there are few clues as to which way you need to go. The best plan is to follow one of the marked hiking trails and carry a map. The hiking trails in the dunes are marked with posts with blue tops. That will also minimize the human impact on this fragile ecosystem. If you are determined to explore off-trail, be sure to bring a compass and keep track of your directions.<br /> <br /> Be aware that cell coverage here, as in many locations within the National Lakeshore is unreliable and that cell phone batteries drain much more quickly in poor coverage areas. You may or may not be able to contact others in your party or phone for help.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watch those slopes. </strong>Steep dune slopes occasionally collapse- a dangerous situation if you are there! This is especially hazardous during winter and early spring seasons. Another reason to avoid them is to help dune grass roots remain intact and do their job of holding the sand in place.<br /> <br /> <strong>Resist the ridges.</strong>We tend to be drawn to walking along the narrow ridge tops among the dunes. However, this is another part of the dunes which is highly vulnerable to erosion. It's best to hike on the broad open plains where possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Keep it under control.</strong> Often folks begin running down the dunes, and soon find their legs can't keep up with the rest of them! Resulting tumbles can cause injuries. While careful, controlled running at the Dune Climb is relatively safe, other slopes have hidden rocks and other hazards which can cause serious injuries.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't be shoeless.</strong> Even if you don't want to wear shoes at the start, throw a pair into a backpack. The sand can be very hot and abrasive and underground shoots of dune grass can stab into your feet.<br /> <br /> Go wet & wild. The dunes are a bit like a desert environment, and you will need to stay hydrated. Bring a bottle of water.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't be a ghost-buster.</strong> Everyone enjoys the \"ghost forests\" (trees that long-ago became buried by moving dunes, then reappeared after the dunes moved). Please leave them because they are the most photographed ghosts around.<br /> <br /> <strong>Watch the wind.</strong> The wind-blown sand can be irritating to eyes and skin. On the other hand, it can make for great kite flying.</p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year?

Neighbor Laura Basch remembers the dances that Mrs. Eckhert would have at the house. \"And that was where I learned to dance. And I can remember us all-we'd sit on the stairway. They had this big house and this stairway there. But we'd roll up the rug and we'd have square dances and fox trots and waltzes. And then she'd always have something for us to eat. And they'd either play the Victrola-that was where we got most of our music-but sometimes the Anderson brothers would come over there and play the organ, Henry would, and Ernie would play the fiddle. And that was the way we danced there.\"<br /> <br /> Catherine Eckerdt was one of the women in the community who served as midwives or community nurses. She nursed many people back from pneumonia using mustard plaster poultices. If someone was having a baby, they would come and get her. And then she would help with the birth. Mrs. Eckerdt would always have a room in the house for neighbors or passersby who needed care or feeding, but she never had any sort of formal medical training. According to a granddaughter, \"some people are more adept to doing things . . . That was more her calling, you know? . . . She had different herbs and stuff . . . and she would doctor them.\" And if they got really bad, she'd have them stay in the house and care for them.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A short dirt driveway leads into Eckhert Farm, a small agricultural settlement dating to the mid-1800s. There are several structures located here, including a 2-story house and, situated behind the house, a handful of smaller outbuildings. All buildings at the farm must be approached through the surrounding grass. Take care as you walk through this site as you may encounter some uneven ground underfoot. The main farmhouse, which consists of 2 wings sitting atop a low stone and brick foundation, is clad with yellow-painted wood clapboard. As you face the building's facade, the 2-story wing on the right has 4 rectangular windows trimmed in white wood, 2 windows on the first floor and 2 others positioned just below the house's gray metal gable roof. The second wing, which extends to the left of the first wing, is fronted by a flat wooden porch. The sloping roof shading the porch is supported by 3 square wooden pillars, painted white. There is a single red brick chimney jutting out of the low-pitched gable roof located above the porch roof. Three concrete steps lead up to the rightmost end of the porch, which is directly to the left of the first wing. There are no railings alongside these steps nor along the porch itself, which is situated about 1 Â½ feet above the ground. Standing directly to your left as you step onto the porch is the first of the 3 wooden pillars. The single entrance door-closed to visitors-is located directly in front of you. Directly to the left of this door is a wide picture window offering a view into the building. Take care as you walk around the farmhouse as there is a tall bush located in front of the right-side wing and a long sloping cellar hatchway jutting out just above the foundation as you step around the left end of the porch. The other buildings at Eckhert Farm include several small weathered gray wood structures-presumably barns and equipment sheds. One one-story building is painted green with 2 low chimneys, one each jutting out from either end of the structure's green gable roof. These outbuildings are located either a few yards behind the house or among tall trees standing to the right of the driveway as you enter the property.",

Handicapped parking is available.</p> <h3>Paddle safe</h3> <p>Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.<br /> <br /> <strong>Clean Your Boats</strong><br /> Please clean, drain, and dry your boat after you leave any body of water, especially Lake Michigan, to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. This is especially important for our inland lakes.<br /> <br /> For more information on aquatic invasive species and their impacts to lakes, streams, and how we recreate please visit the following websites:<br /> www.protectyourwaters.net<br /> www.nps.gov/slbe/naturescience/nonnativespecies.htm</p> <h3>Paddle the Platte</h3> <p><strong>Paddle the Platte</strong><br /> Cooling off with a relaxing float on a tube or raft down the Platte River on a hot summer day is one of the most popular recreational activities in the Lakeshore to beat the heat of summer. The river is shallow and clear, and while it moves along at a good pace, there are no rapids to contend with. You will see a multitude of different wildflowers and birds on your trip, so pay careful attention to the shoreline.<br /> <br /> Your float may end where the Platte empties into the Lake Michigan and forms a delightful sandy spit full of frolicking children and beachgoers wading across the river. Outstanding views of Platte Bay and massive Empire Bluffs and Sleeping Bear Dunes in the distance reward those who drift all the way to Lake Michigan. It's a wonderful place to take a quick dip if it's a hot day.<br /> You can either bring your own tube, raft, air mattress, etc. or you can rent them from local outfitters. If you need to rent during the height of the summer season, you will want to plan ahead and get reservations.<br /> <br /> <strong>From the Platte River Picnic Area water access</strong>, you can float a <strong>one-hour loop </strong>to just above Loon Lake and then carry your tube for a 10-minute walk back to your car.<br /> <br /> If you want the full paddling experience, a <strong>2-and a half-hour plus float </strong>will take you all the way from the picnic area water access to Lake Michigan. Put in along the ramp and drift down the pristine river, through Loon Lake (you'll have to paddle across the lake), past the fish weir and El Dorado, through beautiful sand dunes, all the way to the mouth of the Platte River. You will need to shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.<br /> <br /> You can also put in at the <strong>fish weir </strong>just below Loon Lake for a <strong>2-hour float</strong> to the mouth of the Platte. In this case, you will have to carry your tube about 1/4 mile from the road to the river along a gravel road to the fish weir and shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.<br /> <br /> Offering a nice, easy, <strong>1-mile float </strong>to Lake Michigan, a parking lot, and toilet, <strong>El Dorado</strong> is another popular put-in for tubers. You will have to shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.<br /> <br /> During the height of summer, the river is busy. And from late June through August, it can be like 'bumper boats' with all the kayaks, canoes, and tubes going down the lazy river. Pick a warm day in early summer or September, and you'll have it pretty much to yourself. Fall floats on the river can be quite scenic and a great time to see a lot of fish!</p> <h3>Platte River Fishing Weir</h3> <p>Floating down the gentle flowing Platte you will pass through the State of Michigan's fish weir: an obstruction in the river with gates that can be raised and lowered to stop the migrating salmon from going up stream in the fall. The weir is in operation from the middle of August until October. When the salmon are running, the DNR uses the weir to harvest the fish, and their eggs are used at their hatcheries. During these months, you must portage around the weir. The best times to see returning adult salmon in the Platte River are from mid September to late October at the lower weir.<br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The El Dorado Landing, which is located near the Platte River Campground, allows park visitors access to the last stretch of the Platte River. Here you will find an approximately 15-foot wide boat ramp and a trapezoidal-shaped wooden observation deck measuring about 15 feet wide and 10 feet deep at its central, or deepest, point. A paved walkway originating at the nearby parking area leads directly to the deck. This walkway is flanked by 2 metal picnic tables with attached benches. The table to the right of the walkway is placed on the grass; the table to the walkway's left is placed on a concrete patio and is therefore wheelchair-accessible. There are 3 trash and recycling receptacles located to the left of the walkway as well, a few feet before you reach the concrete patio holding the picnic table. The paved walkway, which also extends left and right in front of the deck's back edge, is flat and there are no railings. The boat ramp, which is located a few yards to the left of the observation deck, is constructed of an open concrete grid that allows grass to grow around the small square sections making up its surface. Extending from the left end of the paved walkway in front of the deck's back edge is a concrete grid walkway that leads to the boat ramp. Take care as you step toward the front of the deck and along the concrete grid walkway to its left as there are no railings, only a wooden curb measuring about 6 inches high lining their outer edges-or the edges closest to the water.",

The 1.5-mile round-trip trail climbs through a beech-maple forest rife with wildflowers to a high, coastal bluff featuring the iconic double-dune view that's the subject of paintings, posters, and postcards. Boardwalks and an observation deck atop this lofty perch look out over Lake Michigan and a large chunk of the national lakeshore. A few hill climbs (with some stairs built into the trails) on the way up to the bluff make this a moderate hike: one well worth it!<br /> <br /> As a hike, Empire Bluff is an excellent and popular choice for families and can be done by most people in under an hour. Pack a lunch and enjoy it with looking out at a view with few rivals. Benches line the trail and there are several spots at the top to kick back and soak it all in.<br /> <br /> And the sunsets! Bring a flashlight and arrive at near dusk on a clear evening for a sunset second to none. Just a short time after those spectacular sunsets are over, the stars come out in a brilliance and profusion that you can rarely find on Lake Michigan. The pure darkness here makes this a favorite destination for viewing meteor showers. But come early, this place will be full of families out to enjoy the show.<br /> <br /> And bring your camera with you.</p> <h4>Take the Self-Guided Tour. Look for posts with numbers.</h4> <p><br /> <strong>Stop 1:</strong><br /> The hilly terrain and scattered boulders are evidence of glaciation.<br /> <br /> Only about 11,800 years ago, the last glacier melted from this area. As Glaciers move across the land, they pick up rock and soil, and as they melt, they deposit the debris irregularly to form hills and valleys. Glacially transported boulders located far from their point of origin are known as erractics, literally \"travelers.\" The bedrock in this area is made up of sedimentary rocks such as limestone and shale, but is buried under several hundred feet of glacial deposits.<br /> <br /> The boulder is a glacial erratic. It must have come from a distant place, perhaps Michigan's Upper Peninsula or Canada.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stop 2:</strong><br /> The glacial soils around Sleeping Bear are quite sandy and not very fertile for farming. However, certain crops, including hay, can be grown here successfully. From post #2, you can see a metal sculpture. Oh, but wait, that's actually a piece of rusted farm equipment from the time of the Great Depression.<br /> <br /> This McCormick Deering No. 7 mowing machine was manufactured between 1929 and 1940. The horse drawn mower cuts a swath about five feet wide. The enclosed gearbox, a significant improvement over earlier models, allowed for efficient gear lubrication, prevented hay from getting tangled in the gears, and provided safer operations for man and animal.<br /> With the development of modern farm equipment, many such pieces of old machinery were abandoned in the fields. A number of old farms are scattered throughout the park and help to preserve the flavor of another era.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stop 3:</strong><br /> Stop and look around at post #3. This section of trail shows one of the most important types of Northern Hardwood forest in Michigan, the Beech-Maple forest. This forest consists of primarily sugar maple, red maple, and beech. Though, in disturbed areas where sunlight shines below the tree canopy, more sun-loving species, such as paper birch and quaking aspen are often found. White pine is commonly intermixed with the beech maple and depending on sunshine, soil, climate, and time, white pine forest may displace some of the beech-maple.<br /> <br /> Over the years the natural process of plant decay has improved the fertility of the sandy glacial soils. Still they can hardly be called rich. In the summer the trees cast a dense shade. Plants of this forest must be able to tolerate low light levels. Many of the forest wildflowers such as the trillium, bloodroot, and Dutchman's breeches bloom in the early spring before the leaves appear on the trees. Young trees deprived of sunlight grow very slowly. If a nearby tree falls, allowing sunlight to reach the young trees, they show a rapid spurt of growth. Before long the gap in the leafy canopy is closed and dense shade prevails again.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stop 4:</strong><br /> While the sandy tree-covered dunes of this region are not rich farmland, the temperature, drainage, growing season, and available soil nutrients in these somewhat humus-enriched \"gray dunes\" work well for many species of trees. In particular, the Grand Traverse region, known as the Cherry Capital, is well suited to growing various kinds of fruit trees. In about 1910, the Empire Lumber Company planted extensive orchards on the logged-over lands.<br /> <br /> An orchard extended all the way from the Village of Empire (you may be able to catch a glimpse of it to the north, through the trees) up the hill to this tree-studded meadow. The apple and plum trees growing here today do not seem to be from these old orchards, but may have sprung up from fruit discarded in the area.<br /> <br /> Lake Michigan plays an important role in moderating the local climate. After the long cold winter, the icy waters keep air temperatures cool in the spring. This helps to prevent fruit trees from blooming too early when a killing frost might still occur. Orchards on sloping ground benefit from natural air drainage. Heavy, cold air seeks low ground, while slopes and uplands stay slightly warmer. Thus, the hilly glacial terrain makes ideal orchard country.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stop 5:</strong><br /> Near the post marked 5 and actually many locations along the trail, you can see various decomposing logs and fallen trees. Bacteria, lichen, fungus, moss, and seedlings take advantage of the nutrients, moisture, and sunlight made available to them by these fallen trees. Large trunks and limbs of which are often referred to as nurse logs. Why do you think that is?<br /> <br /> These rotting logs are an important part of the life cycle of the forest. Their decomposition frees nutrients, which would otherwise not be available.<br /> <br /> Bacteria and insects are among the first organisms to make use of the dead wood. They break it down for use by other life forms. Fungi and mosses also break down dead wood and use its nutrients. As decomposition advances, more complex plants such as flowers and tree seedlings get their nutrients, moisture, and shelter from the rotten wood. Advanced decomposition also adds nutrients and organic matter to the soil, which benefits other organisms.<br /> <br /> <strong>Stop 6:</strong><br /> About .5 miles from the Empire Bluffs trailhead is a bench marking the South Bar Lake overlook. From here, you can take in the stunning view towards the north from which you can see South Bar Lake and the sweep of Lake Michigan's Platte Bay all the way to the Sleeping Bear Dune.<br /> <br /> A bar lake is formed when winds and currents build a sandbar across a bay, isolating that bay from the larger lake. Declining lake levels can, and in this case did, greatly accelerate this process. As vegetation takes hold, the exposed sandbar traps more sediments and decaying vegetation starts to build up soil, further heightening and stabilizing the barrier between parent and daughter lake.<br /> <br /> To the north of South Bar Lake is the equally imaginatively named North Bar Lake, a popular spot for wading and swimming.<br /> <br /> <strong>End</strong><br /> Here you go . . . the breathtaking part, you are perched about 400 ft. above Lake Michigan on a perched dune (a dune made of several feet of sand on top of hundreds of feet of glacial moraine, geological debris, in this case from the last Ice Age). From here, weather permitting, you can see the following:<br /> <br /> <b>Point Betsie</b> in Benzie County on Lake Michigan about 10 miles to the southwest<br /> <br /> <b>South Manitou Island</b> about 14 miles to the northwest, and about 7 miles offshore. Among its points of interest are an 1871 lighthouse, historic farms, perched sand dunes, and a grove of large, old white cedar trees<br /> <br /> <b>The southern portion of the Sleeping Bear Dune plateau</b> about 6 miles to the north<br /> <br /> <b>A lot of Lake Michigan</b> : your line of sight horizon on Lake Michigan is about 25 miles in any unobstructed direction. If the scenic outlook were six times as high you could see Wisconsin, about 60 miles straight west across the Lake, but from where you stand the curve of the planet blocks that view.<br /> <br /> <b>And you can see most of what's in between those points</b>, including the sweep of Platte Bay, Platte River Point, the Empire embayment to the north, and the beautiful South Bar Lake, once part of Lake Michigan, now separated by a sandbar beach.<br /> Lobes of ice once occupied Platte Bay to the south and the Empire Embayment to the north. Glacial meltwaters deposited the sandy layered sediments of the Empire Bluff. South Bar Lake, just north of the Village of Empire, was once a part of Lake Michigan. Longshore currents deposited the sand bar that now separates the two lakes.<br /> <br /> Beyond the Empire Embayment, the Sleeping Bear Dune itself-or the mother bear-which gives its name to the entire dunes complex, the National Lakeshore, and the other features in the area, appears as a small hill on the top of the high, sandy bluff. Historically, the dune was a landmark for travelers on Lake Michigan. Its location and dark vegetation drew attention to it. Now erosion has destroyed much of the dune.<br /> <br /> The entire National Lakeshore includes about 105 square miles and was authorized by Congress in 1970 to preserve the outstanding natural features of this area: glacial phenomena, sand dunes, beaches, and forests<br /> <br /> Directly ahead you see a section of boardwalk that extends for 500 feet south along the shoulder of the Empire Bluff. This boardwalk has been installed to prevent erosion and gullying of the fragile bluff face. Please do not descend the bluff for your own safety and to protect the natural setting.</p> <p> </p> <h4>Invasive plants</h4> <p>Invasive plant species are a significant threat to both native plants and wildlife.<br /> Spotted Knapweed, purple loosestrife, autumn olive and other invasive plants displace native species and often have few or no predators, that is, they are not eaten by native insects, birds, or animals.<br /> <br /> Take a few seconds here and remember to brush off our shoes, to stay on the trails, and to check clothes for seeds, burrs, and other \"hitch-hikers\" to slow the spread of invasives.</p> <h4>Hike Safely</h4> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.</p> <p>Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.</p> <p> </p> <h4><strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong></h4> <p>Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.</p> <hr /> <h4><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/slbe/learn/nature/ticks.htm\">Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</a></h4>",
    "audioDescription": "Standing in the grass just beyond the end of a wooden walkway leading to the 1.5 mile-long Empire Bluff Trail is a wayside panel with a wood-framed boot brush mounted atop a metal slat connecting the wayside's 2 metal legs. Situated flush on the ground in front of the brush is a small rectangular metal grid. The panel, entitled \"Stop Invasive Hitchhikers!\", features a large photo of a row of people wearing hiking boots standing on a wooden walkway or bridge overlooking a stream. Only the hikers' lower legs and footwear are shown in the photo. Text below the panel's title reads: Use this boot brush before and after your hike to remove dirt and invasive seeds. Seeds of invasive plants hitchhike on your shoes' lugs and laces, allowing invasive plants to spread quickly and crowd out native plants. It takes time and costs money to remove the invaders. Stopping the unintentional spread of seeds is the best way to protect the native landscape. Located to the right of the text is a small circular photo of a pinkish-purple plant identified as \"spotted knapweed.\" A caption below the photo tells us: The hitchhiking seeds could be spotted knapweed. This invader crowds out native plants and produces toxins, preventing other plants from growing nearby. Always clean seeds from shoes and gear before and after visiting any area. Please note that there are no railings on the wooden walkway, which is elevated about 5 inches from the ground on its left side only as you face the wayside panel. The entrance to the dirt and gravel surface of the Empire Bluff Trail is located directly to your right as you stand at the panel; the trail runs perpendicular to the wooden walkway. Standing to the right of the trail is a wood-framed structure that holds informational signs and a map of the trail. Trail map brochures are also available here. Located in the grass a few yards to the right of the trailhead is a small building with a gable roof that holds a single vault toilet. The door is located on the front of the building and opens outward from left to right. You must take one tall step up into the building.",

Now erosion has destroyed much of the dune.<br /> <br /> The entire National Lakeshore includes about 105 square miles and was authorized by Congress in 1970 to preserve the outstanding natural features of this area: glacial phenomena, sand dunes, beaches, and forests<br /> <br /> Directly ahead you see a section of boardwalk that extends for 500 feet south along the shoulder of the Empire Bluff. This boardwalk has been installed to prevent erosion and gullying of the fragile bluff face. Please do not descend the bluff for your own safety and to protect the natural setting.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A wooden walkway leads to the Empire Bluff Scenic Overlook, which offers a panoramic view of Lake Michigan, the Sleeping Bear Dune, and several other features of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, including Platte Bay, the Village of Empire, and South Bar Lake. Also located about 7 miles offshore is South Manitou Island. This scenic overlook, which is located about 400 feet above Lake Michigan, is the sixth numbered stop along the Empire Bluff Trail. Although much of the upward-sloping walkway leading to and from the overlook is without railings, along the section encompassing the overlook itself there is an approximately 3-foot-high and 30-foot-long safety railing on the walkway's outer edge only. This overlook section is situated above the steepest part of the bluff descending down to the lake. The bluff alongside the overlook includes sections of bare sand, low vegetation, and both deciduous and evergreen trees. Attached to the railing is a small sign entitled \"Fragile Dune Grasses.\" Text on this sign reads: Help us preserve this fragile landscape. Please do not hike beyond this sign. Please use designated hiking trails. Dune grass binds the sand (and) helps stabilize the dunes. Standing on a short wooden pole planted in the steep dune rising above the trail is another smaller sign marked simply \"launch area.\" This is a parasail launch area. There are 3 benches located alongside the walkway, which forms a wide loop in front of the overlook. One bench is situated to the left, or outer, edge of the walkway several feet above the overlook, and the other 2 benches are located side by side directly behind you as you stand facing the lake near the top section of the overlook.",

The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> <br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> <br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br />  </p> <h4>Beach fires</h4> <p>Roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over glowing coals while watching the sun go down over the lake is a perfect ending to a fun day at the beach. Beach fire are allowed on our mainland Lake Michigan beaches between the water's edge and where the dunes begin, and away from any vegetation. Make sure you use firewood from park approved vendors to help us protect our forests from pest and disease. And be sure to extinguish all beach fires with water. DO NOT bury fires-hidden embers could burn unsuspecting bare feet!</p> <h4>Take care around plover nesting areas</h4> <p>Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the piping plover, a threatened species that breeds here in the spring. Piping plovers find the cobbled beaches of Sleeping Bear Dunes an ideal place to find mates, nest, and raise their young. To protect the plovers and their nests, some parts of the beach may be temporarily closed to visitors and pets. Please help us protect these special birds by keeping dogs on a leash and obeying all beach closure signs.<br /> <br /> <strong>Step around the Pitcher's thistle</strong><br /> Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcher) blooms only once when the plant is seven years old. This native thistle grows only on the shorelines or sand dunes of the Great Lakes and is common in the Lakeshore. It is a threatened species: it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.<br /> <br /> Walking through foredunes on your way to the beach may trample and kill these plants before they can reproduce. So please watch out for the Pitcher's thistle: stay on the wooden walkways and established trails.<br /> <br /> <strong>Paddle safe</strong><br /> Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.<br /> <br /> <b>Look! A Petoskey stone! </b><br /> Watchful beachcombers can find a rainbow of pebbles dotting the shore, but uncovering a Petoskey stone is finding beach treasure. Petoskeys have an interesting shape and the intricate hexagonal patterns of the fossil colonial coral. Tossed by the waves, a Petoskey is rounded and smooth. Their attractive gray to brown color make Petoskeys stand apart from all other local rocks, and they are a favorite of rock hounds. Admire these natural beauties all you like, but please don't take them from the beach: it is illegal under federal law to remove stones from the National Lakeshore. Leave what you see for others to discover!</p> <h3>Uncover More</h3> <p>Find out about the town of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/slbe/learn/historyculture/aral.htm\">Aral</a>, that used to exist where you parked your car.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A sandy path between low, grass-covered dunes leads to Esch Beach, a narrow stretch of sand located at the mouth of Otter Creek. This beach is located at the end of Esch Road, about 3 miles south of Empire on M-22. Parking is available along the road, and there are bathroom facilities nearby. Esch Beach offers visitors opportunities to swim or wade in the shallow creek bed or to view the wildflowers and other local fauna lining the banks. As you approach the water's edge, you may encounter a wide band of small stones underfoot. Affixed to a pole standing in the grass to the right of the entrance is a green sign with white lettering that reads: \"Benzie County. Boat Landing. Do Not Block.\" Other smaller signs located in the grass to the left of the path indicate that off-road vehicles, camping, and pets are not allowed.",

The family loved the lake and liked being away from city responsibilities. They left Chicago for the summer just after the children were out of school at the beginning of June and did not go back until the second week of September. Each summer the family enjoyed an annual dune climb: they motored by boat to the end of Little Glen at the base of the dunes, got lunch from a friendly woman at the base of the dunes, walked up the less-steep forested pathway, and walked across to Lake Michigan. After lunch, the big sport was to roll the large boulders, left from the ice age, down the steep face and enjoy watching the little specks splash into the water. Then they would climb down and back up the the steep bank to Lake Michigan before heading home.<br /> <br /> An ardent gardener and naturalist, Mary landscaped and kept the cabin grounds and a large garden across the road. She loved working in her garden. She and her daughter Margot grew tomatoes, cucumbers and beans. She would pickle the cucumbers and freeze the beans.<br /> <br /> After Mary's death in 1977, the Faust family used the cabin as a greatly treasured seasonal home. Their desire to see it protected and open to the public eventually led to their selling it to the National Park Service.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Faust Cabin, which was built by George and Mary Faust in 1929, is a wide 1 ½-story log structure with a side-facing gable roof and a stone foundation. The cabin's tall chimney, which extends from the ground to above the roof on the building's right side, is also constructed of gray stone. The cabin is perched on a hill next to Inspiration Point, overlooking Glen Lake. Positioned on the gable roof above the entrance is a wide shed-roofed dormer with 3 pairs of small windows positioned along its front. A smaller shed roof supported by rough-hewn log rafters and a slender log bracket on its left end only shelters the cabin's entrance vestibule, which juts out about 2 ½ feet from the structure's facade. This smaller roof also shelters a second, narrower door situated to the left of the vestibule. All of the windows in the cabin have 4 panes-a row of 3 small rectangular panes placed above one large pane-and are trimmed in light-colored wood. This window type is reminiscent of the Craftsman style of architecture. The wide front door on the front of the entrance vestibule is boarded up, and access to the building is not available at this time. Take care as you walk around the overgrown yard in the front of the cabin as you may encounter tripping hazards including an old picnic table with attached benches and a large tree located in front of the facade's left side. Positioned to the left of a dirt path flanked by tall vegetation, and facing the lake, is a bench constructed of large stones. The bench, which has high arms and a high back, is tucked between several tall tree trunks. In front of the bench is a low concrete step, measuring a few inches high. From this location, visitors are offered panoramic views of Glen Lake and Alligator Hill. Take care as you approach the bench as the dirt path in front of the bench continues to decline toward the lake.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Descendants of the Howard Foote family--one of the original members of the Cottage Row summer colony--own the only cottage that is currently maintained and occupied.<br /> <br /> Howard Foote built his second Cottage Row house on this lot in 1901. Following the death of his wife, ownership of the property passed to Foote's children. The house was destroyed by fire in 1935. In its place, Foote's daughter, Shirley Foote Alford, erected a small house purchased as a kit from Sears & Roebuck. As a mail-order house, the Alford cottage represents a practical solution to the dilemma of constructing a building in a remote setting that during the late 1930s, lacked both modem materials and a skilled labor force.<br /> <br /> The house and lot currently are owned and maintained by Alford's grandchildren. The Alford cottage is a small, one-story side-gabled structure with a full-width front verandah. One of the cabins built by the MIA during the 1930s to house migrant orchard workers is located behind the Alford cottage. A cluster of fruit trees is located at the rear of the lot, behind the cabin.<br /> <br /> According to island lore, Mrs. Logan Degan allegedly brought several Lombardy popular trees from France to her island property. The offspring of these trees apparently were planted elsewhere in the village area, where they continue to be prominent features of the landscape. Growing conditions were ideal and many old trees remain.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex. It was the island's only speculative resort enterprise, the first of several efforts to turn the island into an exclusive retreat. The individually owned cottages were supported by a communal kitchen and dining facility. This resort setup was common during the nineteenth century and represents a broad trend in recreation on the Great Lakes region.<br /> <br /> The buildings face eastward to take advantage of off-shore breezes, as well as superb views of the Manitou Passage and the Michigan mainland. From this prime vantage point, the summer residents could monitor activities of the life-saving service station, as well as steamship traffic through the passage. The configuration of the Cottage Row parcels and accompanying deed restrictions ensured that each property owner would have an unobstructed view of the beach and the Manitou Passage. A board walk, shaded by sugar maple and Norway maple trees, once extended along this area.<br /> <br /> The Cottage Row colony provided seasonal employment for year-round island residents. Wives and children of North Manitou farmers and U. S. Life-Saving Service crewmen residents took jobs cooking, cleaning, and doing other domestic chores for Cottage Row residents, in the communal dining room, and at hotel operated by Katie Shepard. For the island's year-round residents, the colony represented a significant source of supplemental cash income. Although some of the cottage owners maintained small gardens, the hotel and summer visitors also provided a much-needed local market for fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, and dairy products.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard opened her home as a hotel and offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.<br /> <br /> Getting to and from the island and their cottages wasn't always easy as Mrs. Shirley Foote Alford (whose family built one of the first cottages in 1894) explained:<br /> \"When people were planning to leave the island, their trunks were loaded on the farm wagon which would go to the top of the hill running down to the dock. There the wagon would wait until the steamer came in close and blew her whistle. If it was three whistles, wagon and people hurried down to the dock to see the boat land. If four whistles were sounded (urgent-danger and distress signal). We all went down as fast as possible to the Life Saving Station where passengers, trunks, baby carriages, ice boxes, etc. were taken out to the steamer in the Life-Saving Service surfboat, rowed by the crew, each man with an oar and the captain steering with a long oar in the stern.\"</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Howard Foote Cottage is a small one-story structure with a gray-shingled hip roof over its main section and an intersecting gable roof over its enclosed front porch. This cottage, which was built in the mid-to-late 1890s, is clad in clapboard siding, once painted white but now largely turned gray with age. A window located just to the right of the porch, which extends only part way across the building's facade, is covered with a wooden board. The tall foundation supporting the porch is constructed of round, uniformly sized river rocks. The porch itself is enclosed on 3 sides with windows, a knee wall, and a screen door located on the porch's right end. Situated below the door are 4 steps edged on their left side with river rocks but no railings. The door's threshold appears to be several inches above the top step. Decorating both the wide triangular gable above the porch and the foundation of the main structure are scallop-shaped wooden shingles, also painted white. A single red brick chimney juts out from the main section's hip roof.",

The steel-hulled Liberian freighter was bound for Holland via the St. Lawrence Seaway loaded with 940-tons of general cargo.<br /> <br /> The 24-year-old captain, Eduardo Trivizas, and a multi-national crew of 13 men sailed the ship. Captain Trivizas had five years of sailing experience and was a graduate of the Greek Navy School. The Francisco Morazan was his first command. The Captain's wife and traveling companion, Anistasia, age 29 and pregnant with their second child was also aboard.<br /> <br /> By the next day, a 40-MPH wind blew out of the northwest, and the Morazan's decks were awash. After the ship passed the Point Betsie Light, blinded by fog and heavy snow, she ran aground about 300 feet off the southwest shore of South Manitou Island. The ship was in contact with two Coast Guardsmen at the North Manitou Island Lighthouse and with a state forester stationed on South Manitou Island who flashed light signals to the stranded ship. Rescue vessels arrived the next morning along with two helicopters and an amphibian airplane from the Traverse City Coast Guard Station.<br /> <br /> The lake was wild all day, but the ship did not seem to be in immediate danger, but the Captain was worried that some of the big waves might lift the ship off the shoal and carry it into deeper water. He arranged to have his wife lifted from the ship by helicopter on Friday, December 2. By Sunday, Dec 4, the crew abandoned ship and was taken by the ice-breaker Mackinaw to Traverse City.<br /> <br /> The owners of the Francisco Morazan could never be found and nothing was done about removing the ship. It is now home to cormorants and gulls.<br /> <br /> Fierce weather stymied efforts to salvage the cargo. Only about 5 tons of canned chicken and hides were recovered before the wreck, buffeted by heavy seas, began to break up.<br /> <br /> Over the years, cargo was salvaged by islanders for their own use: locals spoke highly of the Blue Star brand canned chicken and the boys especially enjoyed the balsa wood model aircraft kits.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A 2 ½-mile hike west from the dock along South Manitou Island's southern shore takes you to a bluff overlooking the shipwreck of the Francisco Morazan, a 247-foot-long cargo freighter that was lost in a snowstorm here on November 29, 1960. The Morazan, which ran aground rocks about 300 feet off the island's south coast, is known as the largest and most exposed shipwreck of the more than 50 known wrecks that have occurred in the waters surrounding the Manitou Islands. The Morazan's massive hull-broken but with its tall stack still intact-sits in shallow water. On the bluff you will find a small wooden platform with a wooden railing running along its front edge and a wayside panel providing additional information about the ship. What remains of the Morazan is now home to gulls and double-crested cormorants, which you may see perched atop the ship's tall steel lifeboat davit arms, 2 each located on both the port and starboard sides.",

Rosen Rye increased rye yields threefold, but it needed to grow in isolation, lest it mingle and cross-pollinate, as it would on the mainland. South Manitou Island became the perfect place for cultivation.<br /> <br /> The Rosen Rye seed grown by the Hutzlers won blue ribbons at the Chicago Hay & Grain Show for a few successive years. Father and son would spend the winter sitting at the table in the kitchen with a knife and pick out the best seeds of the Rosen Rye they had grown during the summer. Some of the best seeds were planted in rows and cultivated like corn and other crops. All the farmers on the island participated in the planting and raising of the Rosen Rye.<br /> <br /> The Hutzlers and other island farmers also worked with Michigan State on the development of the Michelite Bean, which also became a national standard.<br /> <br /> The Hutlzers were very hard workers, and their house was always neat and clean-even the barn and machinery. George did most of the calling at square dances that were held on the island during the winter on Saturday nights.

    "audioDescription": "surviving farmsteads on South Manitou Island. Both the G. C. Hutzler Farm and the August Beck Farm are located along an approximately 2-mile-long hiking loop situated in the center of the island. The total hiking distance from the village and around the loop and back is about 6 miles. The George Johann, or G. J., Hutzler Farm is located north of the island's cemetery along another section of trail. Buildings at the G. C. Hutzler Farm include a farmhouse, a low barn, several gable-roofed wooden sheds, a chicken coop, and a granary surrounded by old fields. Also found here is a picnic table with attached benches placed alongside one of the property's many shade trees. Take care to avoid this and other potential tripping hazards as you explore the grassy yard surrounding the buildings. The farmhouse is a 1 ½-story wood frame structure with a gable roof and white clapboard siding standing on a concrete and stone foundation. There is no porch, just a single step leading up to the entrance. A small one-story gable-roofed addition extends from the building's right side, offset a few yards beyond the main facade. All of the building's windows are covered with white wooden shutters; a door opening on the front of the addition is also covered with wood. A small wooden sign bolted to a short pole standing alongside the farmhouse reads: \"G. C. Hutzler. Circa 1860.\" The 1½-story barn is clad with vertical board siding and has a gable roof constructed of wooden shingles. There are 2 large door openings on the side facing into the yard. These doors will likely be left open during your visit. The granary is a 1½-story wood frame structure with a small one-story shed attached to its rear. It has a wooden foundation and is covered by a gable roof with wooden shingles. A corn crib is located on one side. The chicken coop, which consists of two connected structures, is also clad in vertical board siding.",

    "audioDescription": "The George Johann Hutzler Farm, also known as the G. J. Hutzler Farm, is one of 3 surviving farmsteads on South Manitou Island. This farm is located on the hiking trail leading to South Manitou Island's north shore, about one mile north of the island's cemetery. George Johann Hutzler was the half-brother of George Conrad, or G. C., Hutzler. The 2 primary buildings found here are a white clapboard farmhouse with a gambrel roof and a large wooden pig barn with a gable roof. Both of these structures stand in a grassy clearing surrounded by woods. On the periphery of the clearing along the tree line, you may also encounter a small outhouse or shed and a pile of wooden boards remaining from another outbuilding, now collapsed. Take care as you explore the grassy yard surrounding the house and barn as you may encounter uneven ground. Lining the front and sides of the 2-story farmhouse are several multi-paned double-hung windows including 2 windows flanking the building's glass-pane entrance door. The door's threshold is situated at least 1 Â½ feet above the ground, but there are no steps. A small wooden sign bolted to a short pole standing in front of the farmhouse reads: \"C. J. Hutzler. Circa 1856.\" The large 2-story frame barn is the oldest remaining portion of the Hutzler homestead. Its walls are constructed from weathered vertical wooden planks sitting atop a foundation consisting of several wooden timbers measuring as much as 16 inches square. These timbers are stacked lengthwise with their rough-hewn exposed ends alternating to form a checkerboard-like pattern in the foundation's corners. The structure's gable roof is covered with wooden shingles. There are no windows in the barn, but the interior is partitioned into three sections, each with its own entrance.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Glen Haven Beach is a pebbly beach on the edge of Sleeping Bear Bay. This popular beach offers a little bit of everything. Not only the perfect destination for a family getaway, some fun in the sun with friends, or a day to yourself, it is also a fantastic spot to take a break-from biking along the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail, touring the historic Glen Haven village, or hiking through the low-lying dunes along the shore. The beach is a good site for walking, wading, or swimming.</p> <p>Keep your head down while wading in the cool, clear water and you may spy basalts, granites, cherts, limestones, and fossilized corals-some of the many different types of rocks and stones in the Great Lakes.</p> <p>Glen Haven beach is a great place to launch your kayaks or canoe. But remember, Lake Michigan's history is filled with many major shipwrecks over the decades. Look out for high waves and icy waters and storms that can arise quickly on the Great Lakes.</p> <h4>Pets</h4> <p>When accessing the beach from the Glen Haven Picnic Area, pets are allowed both left and right when facing the water.<br /> Pets are permitted right (west) on the beach until the boardwalk entrance to the Maritime Museum Complex (A series of white buildings on the left (south). Pet owners must turn around here as pets are not permitted on the Maritime Musuem Complex grounds or further west on the beach.</p> <h4>What are those posts sticking out of the water?</h4> <p>Do you see any pilings? If the water level is low, you may see peeking out of the water remnants of a large dock that was here when Glen Haven was bustling.</p> <p>In 1865, eight years after he founded the port settlement of Sleeping Bearville (which he soon renamed Glen Haven) CC McCarty built a dock about 150 feet into Lake Michigan. Around the turn of the 20th century, you would have seen up to 70 vessels anchored in Sleeping Bear Bay off or at the docks during the shipping season.</p> <h4>Look out for a dunesmobile!!?</h4> <p>For over 40 years the Dunesmobiles rode over the breathtaking landscape, including this beach. One minute a beachgoer might be lazing in the sun, wading in the water, building a sandcastle, or sifting through beach stones, but the next they are jumping out of the way of a convertible zigzagging along the shoreline, splashing in the shallows, filled with screaming passengers. The speeding convertibles were out; beach time was over.</p> <h4>Look! A Petoskey stone!</h4> <p>Watchful beachcombers can find a rainbow of pebbles dotting the shore, but uncovering a Petoskey stone is finding beach treasure. Petoskeys have an interesting shape and the intricate hexagonal patterns of the fossil colonial coral. Tossed by the waves, a Petoskey is rounded and smooth. Their attractive gray to brown color make Petoskeys stand apart from all other local rocks, and they are a favorite of rock hounds. Admire these natural beauties all you like, but please don't take them from the beach: it is illegal under federal law to remove stones from the National Lakeshore. Leave what you see for others to discover!</p> <h3>Enjoy the beach safely</h3> <h4>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</h4> <p>Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> <br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> <br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.</p> <h4>Beach fires</h4> <p>Roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over glowing coals while watching the sun go down over the lake is a perfect ending to a fun day at the beach. Beach fire are allowed on our mainland Lake Michigan beaches between the water's edge and where the dunes begin, and away from any vegetation. Make sure you use firewood from park approved vendors to help us protect our forests from pest and disease. And be sure to extinguish all beach fires with water. DO NOT bury fires-hidden embers could burn unsuspecting bare feet!</p> <h4>Take care around plover nesting area</h4> <p>Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the piping plover, a threatened species that breeds here in the spring. Piping plovers find the cobbled beaches of Sleeping Bear Dunes an ideal place to find mates, nest, and raise their young. To protect the plovers and their nests, some parts of the beach may be temporarily closed to visitors and pets. Please help us protect these special birds by keeping dogs on a leash and obeying all beach closure signs.</p> <h4>Step around the Pitcher's thistle</h4> <p>Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcher) blooms only once when the plant is seven years old. This native thistle grows only on the shorelines or sand dunes of the Great Lakes and is common in the Lakeshore. It is a threatened species: it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.<br /> <br /> Walking through foredunes on your way to the beach may trample and kill these plants before they can reproduce. So please watch out for the Pitcher's thistle: stay on the wooden walkways and established trails.</p> <h4>Swim safe</h4> <p>The Lakeshore's pristine beaches are ideal for swimming, but forceful waves and rip currents can turn a fun visit into a frightening one. Use caution when swimming alone and take special precautions with children: keep a close watch on all children, stay within arm's reach, and be sure they are wearing a life jacket.</p> <h4>Be alert for rip currents</h4> <p>Although they are not common in the Lakeshore, rip currents are dangerous and can occur at any beach with breaking waves.<br /> Lake Michigan conditions can change quickly. Know what to expect before you go in the water. Monitor the weather and check out the swim risk level for the beach you plan to visit. Read more in Safety.</p> <h4>Paddle safe</h4> <p>Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Glen Haven Beach, which is on Sleeping Bear Bay, runs alongside the 2-level deck holding the tug Aloha. Visitors may access this beach in one of two ways. Either park in the parking lot to the right of the nearby Cannery Boat Museum, walk up a ramp to the Aloha deck, and then walk down the stairs to the sand below, or park in the handicapped parking to the left of the museum and follow the ramp that leads to the beach from there. From Glen Haven beach, visitors are offered views of Sleeping Bear Point to the west, the Manitou Islands to the north, and Glen Arbor and Pyramid Point to the east. Also located here are the pilings remaining from the old Glen Haven dock. Visitors to Glen Haven Beach are invited to swim, paddle board, or simply walk along the water's edge. The sand here may be littered with shells and small rocks. If you approach the beach from the Aloha deck, note that running alongside the lower deck several feet up the beach from the water is a line of wooden pillars-each about 3 feet tall-connected by 2 lengths of wire ropes. An opening between the 2 pillars directly in line with the deck stairs provides access to the beach.",

The Glen Haven Canning Company processed cherries, raspberries, and peaches and shipped the finished canned goods to Great Lake cities.<br /> <br /> Attempting to diversify the town's interest further, Day and the residents of Glen Haven promoted the area's natural beauty. Day worked to draw visitors to the area, helping to build M-109 and M-209, the highway from Empire to Glen Haven, and donating land for Michigan's first state park, which is now the D. H. Day Campground. Day's vision also included building the Glen Lake area into the most exclusive resort in the United States. However, the Great Depression and his death in 1928 put an end to that plan.<br /> <br /> The Cannery Boat Museum currently displays a variety of older boats ranging in size and technology from the Anishinaabek dug-out canoe to U.S. Coast Guard TRS motorized surfboat.<br /> <br /> A wayside in front of the cannery entitled, \"Fruit to go,\" tells the story of the cannery's fruit packing history.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A paved driveway leads to the Cannery Boat Museum, a long red-painted metal building located at the dock in Glen Haven. This structure originally housed the Glen Haven Canning Company, as indicated by that name painted in large white letters just below the building's low-sloping shed roof. Below the painted letters is a horizontal row of several multi-paned windows trimmed with white wood and, hung between the windows from a track that runs across the windows, wide sliding wooden doors, also painted red. A concrete sidewalk running alongside the building leads to a wide opening providing access to the various exhibits displayed inside the museum. A short concrete ramp located in front of this entrance slopes upward slightly. In addition to the historic Great Lakes vessels displayed inside the museum, other exhibits include a large bronze navigation bell once mounted on a buoy, a 4-sided glass lighthouse beacon that was at one time installed atop the North Manitou Shoals Lighthouse, numerous tools and other gear used for boat maintenance, ice harvesting, and fishing, and a wooden fishing sled discovered on the shore of North Manitou Island in the late 1920s. As a nod to the cannery operation that was once housed in this building, there is also a rectangular wooden glass-topped box filled with red artificial cherries. A small sign tells us that each wooden box, or lug, could hold about 22 pounds of fruit. The Cannery Boat Museum is open from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Volunteers provide short interpretive talks and are available to answer your questions.",

Around the turn of the 20th century, up to 70 vessels could be found anchored in Sleeping Bear Bay or at the docks during the shipping season. Original dock pilings can often be spied peeking out above Lake Michigan's waves.<br /> <br /> During the period between 1910 and 1931, the dock held the crowds gathered on Saturdays and Sundays waiting for arriving resort guests or for fathers and husbands visiting their summer resident families for the weekend. These men would leave Chicago Friday night, explained a tourist publication, \"and get here the next morning; first stop. They're with their families until Sunday night when the boat takes â€˜em back again, ready for the job. Great for 'em!\"<br /> <br /> According to summer visitor Gladys Dillon Young, \"All the people would meet and sit for hours on the front porch waiting for boats to come in. Boats never seemed to come when they were due. People always went down on Sundays to watch. That was the highlight of the week.\"<br /> <br /> Lake Michigan weather did not always make for smooth sailing. One summer family, the Drummonds, recalled sending a family member off on a foggy day. They waited for the ship to come in from the fog to dock:<br /> <br /> \"So dense a fog covers the water that we can only see a few hundred feet. We hear the boat's whistle far out. The bell on the pier clangs in answer. Again and again they signal to each other, but the wind prevents the sound from the bell reaching the boat. But at last she hears it and discovers herself a mile or so past the dock. All eyes strain to pierce the fog. By sound, we have located the position of the boat and at last a darker blur appears in the fog which slowly looms darker and larger-a faint glimmer penetrates the mist and like a phantom ship with all her lights alit she glides in and makes a beautiful landing.<br /> <br /> \"We bid Joseph goodbye 'til next Sunday and watch the boat fade into the fog-lights, music, and all swallowed up a few hundred yards away.\"<br /> <br /> Standing in the sand near Glen Haven dock is a wayside panel entitled \"Arriving...Glen Haven!\" illustrating ship travel to the dock.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Standing in the sand at the northeast corner of the Cannery along the path to the beach is a wayside panel entitled \"Arriving...Glen Haven!\" Featured on this wayside is a large black-and-white photo showing 2 children sitting on a beach as they face a long wooden dock holding both a flatbed railcar and a long one-story building. Pictured on the panel's left side, and to the left of the dock, is a large steamship, its bow facing toward land. Text below the wayside's title reads: The stubby wooden pilings you can see leading out from the shore mark the site of the once 650-foot-long Glen Haven dock. Sleeping Bear Bay provided deep water that allowed large boats to come near shore, but a dock was needed to safely load and unload passengers and cargo. Imagine how the dock's wooden deck drummed with activity when a boat was in. High stacks of cordwood and lumber brought to the dock by railroad cars waited to be loaded on steamers traveling Lake Michigan. Travelers arrived and departed. Mail was exchanged and tools, machinery, and household goods were trundled off to the D. H. Day store or kept in the warehouse on the dock. Superimposed over this photo in the panel's upper right corner are 2 black-and-white snapshots. The photo on top shows a panoramic view of the dock stretching into vast Lake Michigan. The photo on the bottom depicts a small group of men, women, and children standing on the wide dock's wooden plank surface. Captions accompanying these small photos read: Jutting out precariously in Lake Michigan's big surfs and winter ice packs, the Glen Haven dock required constant maintenance and upkeep. Crowds gathered to watch the steamers dock and to welcome back family or greet resorters. Lastly, pictured along the panel's lower right side is the Northern Michigan Transportation Company's summer schedule, featuring a color drawing of a large steamer ship with a black hull plying through choppy green water. A caption located alongside the schedule asks: \"According to the schedule on the right, how long did it take to get from Glen Haven to Leland by steamer?\" Times listed in the schedule's 5th column show the S.S. Missouri leaving Glen Haven at 8:30 AM and arriving in Leland at 10:15 AM on Wednesday. Times listed in the 12th, or last, column show the S.S. Manistee sailing the same route from 12:30 to 2:30 PM on Friday.",

Public restrooms and vending machines are available nearby during the summer.<br />  </p> <h4>Glen Haven General Store History</h4> <p><br /> There was only one place in the late 19th century and 20th century that provided the necessities for life-meat, produce, fabrics, communication and tools: the General Store. It was the hub of D.H. Day's company. The lumbermen and dock workers were paid in company \"scrip\" so they could only shop at this store. At different times in its history, the store served as a post office, ticket and freight office for steamers, telegraph station, lumber salesroom, real estate office, and U.S. weather station. It was the nerve center in the hustle and bustle of the town. D.H. Day's own wife refused to live in the large home he built her and insisted instead on living above the store.<br /> <br /> Behind the store were an icehouse, granary, slaughterhouse, and croquet lawn.<br /> <br /> What could you buy at the store? Flour, coffee, sugar, canned milk, prepared foods, cleaners, candy; local milk, butter, eggs, fruit, and vegetables; cloth, clothes, shoes, hats, gloves, and bedding; tools, building materials, household items, toys, and farm implements; smoking, chewing, and pipe tobacco; patent medicine for humans and animals; gasoline, oil, tires, inner tubes, pumps, and spark plugs; post cards, booklets, picnic baskets, camping gear, fishing poles, nets; and Native American baskets, birch bark and quill work.<br /> <br /> Gasoline was purchased from the gasoline pump in front of the store. Gas was pumped into the glass cylinder atop the pump, which was marked in gallons like an oversized beaker and then drained via a release valve through a hose into the car or truck's tank.<br /> <br /> The General Store currently sells snacks and souvenirs and offers a small exhibit about D. H. Day.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Glen Haven Historic Village general store is a yellow clapboard structure with a gable roof sheltering its main 2-story wing, and a sloping shed roof covering a small one-story addition jutting out from the store's left side. A shallow black-and-white striped awning runs across the main facade, just above a glass-pane entrance door flanked by 2 large 12-pane windows. A sign affixed to the building above the awning reads: \"Glen Haven, Michigan.\" A flat concrete porch extends left and right in front of the building. You may approach the porch either from a concrete sidewalk located to the right of the store-where there are no steps-or by taking one shallow step up from the parking area in front of the building onto the curb and then another step up onto the porch. There are no railings surrounding the porch, but the curb and the porch edge itself are outlined in yellow paint. The door will be about 5 feet in front of you as you step onto the porch from the front of the building and about 8 feet on your right if you approach from the sidewalk. Climbing the corner of the building where the sidewalk meets the porch is a thick mass of vines resembling a wide pillar reaching to the roofline. Standing on the porch's left front corner is a red and gray metal gasoline pump dating to the early 20th century. The pump is cylindrical in shape and stands about 10 feet tall with a white crown with red markings on top. Take care when approaching the gas pump as the drop off from the porch on its left end is slightly higher than that in front of the building. You may also encounter a white-painted wooden hitching post, about 3½ feet tall, standing on the curb in front of the store's entrance and one or two wooden benches placed on the porch in front of one or both storefront windows. As you enter the building, a long wood-topped counter will be on your left, extending away from you toward the back of the building. Visitors may purchase typical general store merchandise and items related to the history of the Glen Haven area, including kitchenware, pre-packaged foods, toys, maritime-related items and books. There is also a small exhibit and museum area. The Leelanau Ranger Station is located upstairs. The general store is open from Memorial Day through Labor Day. During June, the store is closed Mondays through Thursdays. Restrooms are located next to the store.",

    "audioDescription": "You are standing in front of a wayside with 3 vertical panels. The first panel, entitled \"Decades before his time,\" features a large black-and-white photo of 3 men standing beside an early-20th-century automobile parked on a roadway running alongside a grassy field. Two of the men-the one positioned in the middle of the photo and the man standing on the photo's right side-wear 3-piece suits. Nailed to the trunk of a tall leafy tree standing between these 2 men is a sign that reads \"West Michigan Pike.\" Text below the wayside's title tells us:David Henry Day came to Glen Haven in the mid-1800s as agent for the Northern Transportation Company. A decade later, he had purchased the company, the town, and 5,000 acres of adjacent timberland. D.H. Day was a visionary; an entrepreneur. He studied and learned; he developed innovative practices and technologies; he recognized political and market trends; he saw potential and possibilities decades before others. Many of D. H. Day's influences are still visible today. He instituted a variety of sustainable forestry and logging practices still in use today. Day was one of the first people to plant fruit trees in the area. Northern Michigan continues to produce a wide variety of fruit including cherries, apples, peaches, apricots, pears, and now grapes. He donated land to the State of Michigan to create its first state park and campground-what we now know as D. H. Day Campground.Superimposed over the large background photo at the top of the panel are two additional images. The image on the left depicts a mostly yellow and black pamphlet showing a map route leading east from Chicago around the lower tip of Lake Michigan near the bottom of the map, then north along the lake's eastern coastline through several towns and cities, finally ending at Mackinaw at the top of the map. A title on the pamphlet reads: \"West Michigan Pike, Northern Link of the Dixie Highway.\" A caption accompanying this image reads:To promote automobile tourism as a future industry for Glen Haven and the region, Day always properly graded the roads. He personally financed the construction of M-109, which today is called the D. H. Day Highway, and was on the board of the West Michigan Pike.A smaller black-and-white photo located to the right of and slightly overlapping the pamphlet image shows 2 dirt roads merging into one as it leads between 2 stone pillars flanking a wide entrance to the open landscape beyond. A small sign affixed to a pole standing at the fork in the road reads: \"Campers Welcome.\" This photo's caption explains:The extensive network of Michigan State Parks was begun under Day's leadership. The tourism industry, based on the beautiful natural resources of Northern Michigan, continues to be a main source of economic vitality for the region.The wayside's second panel, entitled \"Welcome to Glen Haven!\", features a black-and-white map drawing of the land area between Glen Lake, appearing in green along the top of the panel, and Lake Michigan, also green, located at the bottom of the panel. Text below the wayside's title reads:Back when this area was first getting settled, there were no trains, and roads were just sandy ruts. If you had visited then, you would have come by boat-the main mode of transportation. Along the route, little villages, like Glen Haven provided essential services for passing vessels and travelers: a long dock out to deep water for loading and unloading vessels, wood cut and dried for fuel, a blacksmith shop for repairs, a general store for buying a hat to replace the one that blew off in the last storm, and a boarding house for lodging folks waiting to resume their journey. Today, many of those towns have disappeared, others have grown into big cities with no trace of the old village, but this frontier port still stands because resident and ambitious businessman David Henry, or D. H., Day's vision and innovative enterprises wouldn't let it die.Superimposed over this larger map in the panel's lower left corner is a smaller map showing the roads and buildings of Glen Haven Historic Village. This map insert is a magnified version of Glen Haven as it appears on the larger map near the panel's lower right corner. On this map, Glen Haven village is situated above Glen Haven dock, which extends into Lake Michigan.The third panel is a color map of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Most of the panel's left side and its entire top half is colored blue to indicate Lake Michigan and Manitou Passage. Pictured in green in the middle of the lake to the west and north of the passage are South Manitou Island and North Manitou Island, respectively. A notation tells us that the elevation of Lake Michigan is 580 feet, or 177 meters. A key in the panel's top right quadrant indicates the location of various features including wilderness areas, picnic areas, campgrounds, beach access areas, ranger stations, and 13 hiking and/or skiing trails.

The first panel, entitled \"Lumber piled high,\" features a large black-and-white photo of a half-dozen mustached men standing among stacks of logs piled on the ground in a snow-covered forest. A few of the men hold axes, while one man in the foreground stands beside a pair of oxen joined by a wooden yoke that is in turn chained to a single log lying in the snow. Text below the title tells us: When D. H. Day invested his life savings and more to purchase the sawmill on Glen Lake, he wasn't content to do business as usual. He modernized. He improved.

Rejecting the practice of clear-cutting, Day left young trees behind to grow and seed, thus introducing the practice of reforestation to northern Michigan. Superimposed over the background photo at the top of this panel are 2 smaller black-and-white snapshots. The photo on the left shows several neat stacks of long, flat hardwood boards flanking a locomotive engine. The tops of the stacks reach higher than the locomotive, and several men stand atop a car attached behind the engine. A caption accompanying this photo tells us: The Glen Lake sawmill could process 2,000 board feet of hardwood and 30,000 board feet of hemlock a day from the surrounding forest. The second photo depicts the exterior of the Glen Lake sawmill. One tall chimney pipe juts from the building's sloping roof, and a row of 14 wooden barrels stand perched atop the roof's peak. Men and horses stand in front of the building. Two captions read: Day paid his lumberjacks 15 cents an hour and dock hands 35 cents an hour. Why are there barrels on the mill's roof? Early fire suppression. The clue is the ladder on the cedar-shingled roof.<br /><br />The wayside's second panel, entitled \"Welcome to Glen Haven!\", features a black-and-white map drawing of the land area between Glen Lake, appearing in green along the top of the panel, and Lake Michigan, also green, located at the bottom of the panel.

Near the beginning of the trail, there is a short section of low coastal dunes, where there is access to the beach. Then the trail turns away from Lake Michigan and becomes wooded for the remainder of its length. A portion of the trail passes through a swamp, and a small bridge assists in crossing a couple of wet spots.<br /> <br /> <strong>Pets are NOT allowed on this trail from December 1 to March 31.</strong><br /> <br /> The trail lies between Little Traverse Lake and Lake Michigan. This entire strip of land was underwater at the end of the Ice Age and has emerged gradually during post-glacial times. Along this trail, you can see the different plant communities that have developed in zones parallel to the shoreline. Starting from the beach and traveling inland, you pass through an active dune zone, a shrub zone, a pine-oak forest, and the beginnings of a beech-maple forest. Just a few thousand years ago, the forested zones were barren beaches. Plants, through their growth and decay, have built up a topsoil on top of old dunes</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Situated near the head of the 2.8-mile long Good Harbor Trail loop is a picnic area offering 3 metal picnic tables with attached benches. The sandy ground of the clearing encompassing the Good Harbor Bay Picnic Area is dotted with low vegetation and a handful of trees. The picnic area lies several yards from the water's edge. Located nearby is a small building with a gable roof holding a single vault toilet. The door to the toilet is located on the front of the building and opens outward from left to right. You will encounter a small concrete patio, perhaps two inches high, in front of the door. Standing to the right of the toilet building is a dual trash and recycling receptacle with 2 lids placed side by side on its sloping top surface. Take care as you approach the receptacle as it is supported atop 3 long feet that jut out toward you. Finally, a sign affixed to a pole standing near the tables includes a silhouette of a person holding a sitting dog's leash. A diagonal red line is drawn through this image, which is also accompanied by the text \"No Pets.\"",

Going north from Glen Arbor, turn left onto CR-651.<br /> <br /> Parking is available in the lot and along the roadside. The beach is 125 feet from the parking area providing carry-in access for your kayaks and paddle boards.</p> <h3>Village of Good Harbor</h3> <p>You may have noticed a few pilings near the shore. These relics are the only evidence of the historic village of Good Harbor. The village was started in the mid-1870s when a man named Vine built a small sawmill and dock. After 1900, the supply of timber gradually decreased and in 1905 the mill and about 1,000,000 feet of lumber in the yard burned. The mill wasn't rebuilt and most of the villagers moved away. The post office closed in 1907. In 1924, John Peters bought most of the remaining buildings including the barn, hotel, stores, a dwelling, and the blacksmith shop for $475. He and his sons tore the buildings down and sold the lumber.</p> <h3>Is this a shipwreck?</h3> <p>Many boats and ships have been lost in the sometimes treacherous waters of the Manitou Passage-the water trail between the mainland and Manitou Islands. The same natural forces of wind and waves that caused most of the wrecks can quickly uncover a wreck site that has been buried in the sand for over a hundred years. The site may remain visible for weeks or only a few days.<br /> Did you find a shipwreck? Read more about identifying a shipwreck in the Beach FAQs section of the app.</p> <h3>Enjoy the Beach Safely</h3> <p>**Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!**<br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Beach fires</strong><br /> Roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over glowing coals while watching the sun go down over the lake is a perfect ending to a fun day at the beach. Beach fire are allowed on our mainland Lake Michigan beaches between the water's edge and where the dunes begin, and away from any vegetation. Make sure you use firewood from park approved vendors to help us protect our forests from pest and disease. And be sure to extinguish all beach fires with water. DO NOT bury fires-hidden embers could burn unsuspecting bare feet!<br /> <br /> <strong>Take care around plover nesting area</strong><br /> Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the piping plover, a threatened species that breeds here in the spring. Piping plovers find the cobbled beaches of Sleeping Bear Dunes an ideal place to find mates, nest, and raise their young. To protect the plovers and their nests, some parts of the beach may be temporarily closed to visitors and pets. Please help us protect these special birds by keeping dogs on a leash and obeying all beach closure signs.<br /> <br /> <strong>Step around the Pitcher's thistle</strong><br /> Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcher) blooms only once when the plant is seven years old. This native thistle grows only on the shorelines or sand dunes of the Great Lakes and is common in the Lakeshore. It is a threatened species: it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.<br /> <br /> Walking through foredunes on your way to the beach may trample and kill these plants before they can reproduce. So please watch out for the Pitcher's thistle: stay on the wooden walkways and established trails.<br /> <br /> <strong>Swim safe</strong><br /> The Lakeshore's pristine beaches are ideal for swimming, but forceful waves and rip currents can turn a fun visit into a frightening one. Use caution when swimming alone and take special precautions with children: keep a close watch on all children, stay within arm's reach, and be sure they are wearing a life jacket.<br /> <br /> <strong>Be alert for rip currents</strong><br /> Although they are not common in the Lakeshore, rip currents are dangerous and can occur at any beach with breaking waves.<br /> Lake Michigan conditions can change quickly. Know what to expect before you go in the water. Monitor the weather and check out the swim risk level for the beach you plan to visit. Read more in Safety.<br /> <br /> <strong>Paddle safe</strong><br /> Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.</p>",

The beach/dune system extends eastward from the Point Pyramid headland to Carp River Point, just south of Leland.<br /> Good Harbor Bay is the remnant of a once greater embayment that extended south into the area that is now Little Traverse and Lime Lakes. With time and as lake levels fell, a series of spits and beach/dune ridges formed, separating these lakes and forming a distinct topography of low ridges and swales, although difficult to recognize under the forest cover.<br /> The sands making up today's dunes and beaches have been recycled many times-perhaps having come from Canada as glacial sediment, carried by melt waters from those glaciers, and those deposits eroded by ancestral lakes, carried by waters and wind in bars, beaches, and dunes, over and over. <strong> From William J. Neal & Gregory C. Wilson, Department of Geology, Grand Valley State University</strong></p> <h3>Look! A Petoskey stone!</h3> <p>Watchful beachcombers can find a rainbow of pebbles dotting the shore, but uncovering a Petoskey stone is finding beach treasure. Petoskeys have an interesting shape and the intricate hexagonal patterns of the fossil colonial coral. Tossed by the waves, a Petoskey is rounded and smooth. Their attractive gray to brown color make Petoskeys stand apart from all other local rocks, and they are a favorite of rock hounds. Admire these natural beauties all you like, but please don't take them from the beach:** it is illegal under federal law to remove stones from the National Lakeshore. Leave what you see for others to discover!**</p> <h3>North Unity</h3> <p>If you walk along the beach to the mouth of Shalda Creek, you'll be standing where, in the late 1800s, the community of North Unity stood.<br /> <br /> North Unity was settled in 1855 by a group of Bohemians from present-day Czech Republic and Germany, by way of Chicago. An account of the early settlement written by one of the settlers, Joseph Krubner and published in Chicago Bohemian newspaper reveals the hardships of pioneer life.<br /> <br /> According to Krubner, the Bohemians were looking for paradise. They hoped to find it in Chicago, but winter, few stores, and no jobs required they look further. So, they hired a sailboat and sailed 270 miles up the Michigan coast still looking for paradise. They landed in Good Harbor where they found a group of people who were already living there, so they traveled ten or so miles and settled near Pyramid Point. \"Here, at the Lake Michigan near Pyramid Bay, in deep forests never touched by human hands, began a new city, North Unity, Krubner wrote.<br /> <br /> The immigrants built a wooden 150-foot by 20-foot barracks partitioned into sections to provide temporary housing for the families to house them through winter. In spring they would select a farm site and build more permanent cabins. Some families built their own temporary shelters near the barracks, \"everybody had his own idea,\" wrote Krubner. \"Some houses were all covered with hemlock branches, leaving small openings for windows. They looked more like bear huts instead of homes for humans. Some places they built the log house so low it was difficult for tall man to stand up in one.\"<br /> <br /> The temporary shelters were cold and damp in the harsh northern Michigan, and their first winter was hard and cold. Lake Michigan lake froze and snow began to pile up, cutting off the little settlement. There wasn't enough food. There wasn't anything they could buy except a little corn from the Indians. Some had brought provisions with them from Chicago and shared the little flour and meat they had. No cows meant no milk. Living near the beach buffeted by winter winds, the Bohemians must of questioned whether they had indeed found paradise.<br /> <br /> Hungry and desperate, a small group of men took a sled and traveled across the lake to the island in hopes of buying some potatoes. The islands were settled long before the mainland, and the wooding industry-felling trees for cordwood which was sold to passing steamers for fuel-left cleared areas that islanders planted with potatoes and other crops. Several North Unity men took a sled and walked across the frozen lake to North Manitou Island. They bought a few bushels of potatoes and started back home. The return trip proved more difficult as the ice began cracking and breaking under their feet as the neared the shore.<br /> <br /> The potatoes lasted through the rest of winter, according to Krubner. \"For a while hungry wolves were chased away from our doors. But with approaching spring, when the snow melted and the lake still frozen, no boats were able to reach us, potatoes and whatever we had was gone, hunger began to strike again.\" The Bohemians were saved again, this time by the annual spring migration of the now extinct carrier pigeon--large swarms of pigeons would descend on Northern Michigan, literally darkening the skies. This particicular spring, the pigeons provided ample food for the starving settlers. \"Everyone who had a gun, and was able to use it, was shooting them,\" wrote Krubner. Soon after, the small lakes began to thaw and the Bohemians added fish to their menu.<br /> <br /> As the weather warmed, individual families began to build their own houses, and start gardens, growing potatoes, cabbage, beans, and corns, as well as wheat. Cattle were brought in from Chigcago two years later to provide milk. The small community prospered as more people arrived building a sawmill and schoolhouse. In 1859, a two-story general mercantile and post office opened; dances were held on the second floor. One of the early Czech pioneers, John Shalda, built a gristmill at the outlet of Shalda Creek.<br /> <br /> Fires were common during the 19th century, especially in the spring. And in 1871, North Unity was destroyed by fire. Fires and the insufficient area for supporting the growing community led many familie to move inland to what is know now as \"Shalda Corners\" (M-22 and County Road 669), where they rebuilt their homes, post office, stores, school, and church</p> <h3>Enjoy the Beach safely</h3> <p>**Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!**<br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub.

Use caution when swimming alone and take special precautions with children: keep a close watch on all children, stay within arm's reach, and be sure they are wearing a life jacket.<br /> <br /> <strong>Be alert for rip currents</strong><br /> Although they are not common in the Lakeshore, rip currents are dangerous and can occur at any beach with breaking waves.<br /> Lake Michigan conditions can change quickly. Know what to expect before you go in the water. Monitor the weather and check out the swim risk level for the beach you plan to visit. Read more in Safety.<br /> <br /> <strong>Paddle safe</strong><br /> Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Located in the northern part of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is Good Harbor Bay, home to a long, wide, and slightly downward-sloping beach offering views of North and South Manitou Islands. A short sandy path flanked by tall dune grass leads from a paved parking area to this section of the Good Harbor Bay Beach, which can be reached from County Road 669, otherwise known as Bohemian Road. Flanking the path's entrance is a red and white stop sign on the right and a yellow and black sign that reads \"County Road Ends at Water\" on the left. Take care as you step onto the beach as the sand may be dotted with small rocks, twigs, and larger pieces of driftwood. Three signs affixed to poles standing on or near the beach indicate that off-road vehicles, snowmobiles, and pets are not allowed in this area. Extending from another portion of the paved parking area is a concrete walkway leading to a small building with a gable roof that holds a single vault toilet. The door is on the front of the building and opens outward from left to right. You must take one small step up to enter the building. Situated to the left of the walkway's entrance is a cylindrical drinking fountain topped with 2 basins and bubblers, one higher than the other, and, about 3 feet to the left of the fountain, a separate and lower cylinder with a water spigot on its side. This lower cylinder is a foot wash station. Standing to the right of the walkway's entrance is a dual trash and recycling receptacle and a tall wood-framed sign featuring a color map of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.",

    "audioDescription": "Across the road from the South Manitou Island Visitor Center is the Haas-Jenks Cottage, a one-story structure clad with wide dark green shingles. A single red brick chimney juts out of the building's sloping hip roof, and the door and double-hung windows lining the building's facade and sides are trimmed in white-painted wood. A wooden ramp flanked by railings on both sides slopes upward toward the entrance, which is located on the facade's left side. A small sign hung inside to the left of the door reads: Welcome to the Haas-Jenks Cottage. Harrison S. Haas and his wife Ruth built this small two-bedroom, wood frame house around 1917. It was originally thought to be a \"kit\" house, like some other village houses, ordered from a catalog with lumber and other fittings shipped by boat from Chicago. However, most recently it is believed that it was copied from a kit house in the village by the thrifty Mr. Haas. An island native, Harrison Haas served with the United States Life Saving Service and the U.S. Coast Guard from August 1915 to December 1945. South Manitou Island was just one of his many duty assignments. After the Harrison Haas family left the island, the house passed through several different owners, many of them associated with the U.S.C.G. In the mid-1950s, Jack and Polly Jenks purchased it for use as their family's summer cottage and enjoyed many happy times there. After Jack passed away, his children held ownership until it was finally acquired by Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in 2001.",

The farm's barn is owned by the Park Service, but the farmhouse is privately owned and therefore not open to visitors. The barn is a long wood structure with two roofs--a gable roof covering the building's highest section, which houses 3 large bays, and a sloping shed roof covering a smaller bay that serves as an equipment shed. The shed roof juts out just below one of the main barn's triangular end gables. The weathered gray wooden planks covering the exterior walls of both barn and attached shed are arranged vertically. There are large double wooden doors located on each of the barn's 2 long sides. If these doors are open at the time of your visit, you will be offered a view of the barn's wood threshing floor and an early machine that automated the threshing process. Positioned overhead is a track with a hayfork used for grasping large bites of loose hay from a wagon and then moving the hay to other parts of the barn. The shed has 2 wide open doorways, one each in the front and back. Standing on the shed's sandy floor is a dilapidated tractor positioned with its radiator grill facing toward you. The front of the rusty vehicle is resting on 3 wood blocks, as it is missing the front wheel. A single rope slung across the doorway acts as a barrier to entry. Although the approach to the shed is through grass and mostly flat, take care to avoid a tight grouping of 4 boulders and some smaller rocks placed under, and just in front of, the barrier rope.",

    "bodyText": "<p>This large, one-and-a-half-story, shingle-style house was constructed in 1895 or 1896 for Mrs. William Shepard and her daughter Katherine, who was popularly known on the island as \"Miss Katie.\" The house was allegedly designed in the style of the Shepards' residence in New Orleans.<br /> <br /> A detached kitchen and dining room was located behind the house. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard converted her cottage into a summer hotel. The Beeches, as it was called offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion and became a popular gathering place.<br /> <br /> One island native who worked for Miss Katie in her youth recalled busy summer days, when the dining room was filled to overflowing with guests waiting on the long-screened porch for a second seating. Ms. Shepard continued to operate the hotel and dining room until poor health forced her to discontinue the business sometime in the early 1930s.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex. It was the island's only speculative resort enterprise, the first of several efforts to turn the island into an exclusive retreat. The individually owned cottages were supported by a communal kitchen and dining facility. This resort setup was common during the nineteenth century and represents a broad trend in recreation on the Great Lakes region.<br /> <br /> The buildings face eastward to take advantage of off-shore breezes, as well as superb views of the Manitou Passage and the Michigan mainland. From this prime vantage point, the summer residents could monitor activities of the life-saving service station, as well as steamship traffic through the passage. The configuration of the Cottage Row parcels and accompanying deed restrictions ensured that each property owner would have an unobstructed view of the beach and the Manitou Passage. A board walk, shaded by sugar maple and Norway maple trees, once extended along this area.<br /> <br /> The Cottage Row colony provided seasonal employment for year-round island residents. Wives and children of North Manitou farmers and U. S. Life-Saving Service crewmen residents took jobs cooking, cleaning, and doing other domestic chores for Cottage Row residents, in the communal dining room, and at hotel operated by Katie Shepard. For the island's year-round residents, the colony represented a significant source of supplemental cash income. Although some of the cottage owners maintained small gardens, the hotel and summer visitors also provided a much-needed local market for fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, and dairy products.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard opened her home as a hotel and offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.<br /> <br /> Getting to and from the island and their cottages wasn't always easy as Mrs. Shirley Foote Alford (whose family built one of the first cottages in 1894) explained:<br /> <br /> \"When people were planning to leave the island, their trunks were loaded on the farm wagon which would go to the top of the hill running down to the dock. There the wagon would wait until the steamer came in close and blew her whistle. If it was three whistles, wagon and people hurried down to the dock to see the boat land. If four whistles were sounded (urgent-danger and distress signal). We all went down as fast as possible to the Life Saving Station where passengers, trunks, baby carriages, ice boxes, etc. were taken out to the steamer in the Life-Saving Service surfboat, rowed by the crew, each man with an oar and the captain steering with a long oar in the stern.\"</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A narrow concrete walkway leads to the Katie Shepard Hotel, a 1½-story white-painted shingle-style house built around 1895. This building features a tall foundation constructed of round, uniformly sized river rocks, a winged gable roof, and an elevated front porch with a knee wall that wraps around to the building's left side. The porch roof is supported by about a dozen square white-painted wooden pillars. The 6 steps leading up to the building's entrance are located on the porch's right end. The walkway will take you to these steps. Located just left of the walkway as you near the bottom step is a stone pillar topped with the building's right-most wooden porch pillar. As you pass the stone pillar on your left, you must turn left 90 degrees to proceed up the steps. There is a wooden hand railing attached to the building to the right of the steps, but there is no railing on the steps' left side. Take care as you near the porch, as the drop from the top step to the ground is about 4 feet. The building's entrance door is located immediately to your right as you step onto the porch. The knee wall that begins on your left is about 3 feet high. The building's first story is clad in thin white clapboard and has several windows covered with wooden shutters. You may encounter a handful of white-painted wooden chairs with high backs placed to the left of the door and in front of the windows on the porch.<br />The half-story gable above the porch is faced with several rows of white-painted shingles with crenulated, or notched, edges. Located in the gable's center are 2 double-hung windows placed side by side.",

The facade's 9 windows-5 on a shed dormer that is nearly as wide as the main roof and 2 each flanking the central entrance door on the first level-are trimmed in white wood, as is the door. Much of the paint on the trim, and on the siding covering the building's main level in particular, has peeled off or is worn. A narrow brick chimney juts out of the roof near its right end. Two wide concrete steps lead up from the walkway to a deep stoop situated in front of the entrance door. Two square white-painted pillars, the rightmost one marked in black with the house number 4007, flank the entrance, which includes a weathered screen door. There are no railings on either the steps or stoop. Attached to the right end of the building is a one-story addition with a hip roof. This addition is lined with windows on 3 sides, also trimmed in white wood. This building is not open to the public, but you are invited to walk around the property.

After his death in 1884, his son, James, inherited the property and in 1889, deeded 40 acres to George and Louisa Burfiend Lawr. Louisa was the daughter of Port Oneida pioneer Carsten Burfiend. They purchased the adjacent 80 acres and built this farm in the 1890s.<br /> <br /> George Lawr was the son of a Scotsman and his mother was from New York. George came to the U.S. from Canada in 1871. He and his wife farmed here until 1945.<br /> <br /> Neighbors remember Lousia as someone that loved everybody. She was known for offering large cream cookies with big raisins anytime someone entered her door. George Lawr was a skilled carpenter.<br /> <br /> During winters, some of the Port Oneida men, including George, would live at home and go work in the woods each day. George and his brother Howard had good teams of horses, and they would partner up teaming. According to George Burfiend, Lawr's nephew, they usually had two teamsters because \"they had to have help getting up the hills, and maybe help down the hills too-dad and Uncle George would have two sleighs, and one would get loaded during the day while they were pulling the other one to Cedar or Maple City or wherever, and then they'd bring that one back and drop it off, and then the next morning they'd hook onto the one that had been loaded the day before and take it over; and then they'd have one there being loaded.\"</p> <h3>Cutting Ice</h3> <p>For many years, the residents of Port Oneida cut all the ice they needed from frozen lakes. Shell Lake was one of the main places they harvested ice as well as Mud Lake near the Lawr place. They'd cut ice off the lakes and haul it up to what they called an icehouse, and then they would pack it all in there in one big bunch with sawdust, and then cover it all with sawdust.

    "audioDescription": "The Lawr Farm is located near the intersection of Wheeler Road and M-22. This farm includes a 2-story farmhouse with an enclosed front porch lined with windows, a large barn constructed of both wood and fieldstone, a smaller red-painted garage with a corrugated metal roof, and a gray-shingled chicken coop. Also standing alongside a wooden rail fence is a large arbor fashioned from tree branches. The farmhouse is clad in white clapboard, and its 3 gable roofs are covered with black shingles. One of these roofs shelters a small dormer located above a shed roof covering the enclosed porch, which is located on the facade's left side. Extending from the structure's right end is a second shed roof that covers a small one-story addition. On the front of this addition is a multi-paned glass door flanked by 2 fixed pane windows, both the same height as the door.<br />The building's main entrance door is located on the far right end of the enclosed porch. Extending only a few feet into the grass in front of the door is a rectangular concrete area resembling a small patio. A single black metal light post stands in the grass just to the right of the door. Take care as you approach through the grass as you may encounter uneven ground as well as various shrubs planted close to the house. A tall flagpole stands in front of the porch's front left corner. The barn has 2 intersecting metal gables roofs-one covering the structure's 2-story main section, and a lower roof sheltering a long building section that extends lengthwise from the main section's right side. The main barn, which is windowless on its front side, is constructed of vertical gray wooden planks. Jutting up from the peak of the main barn's roof is a 4-gable cupola with lattice sides. Adorning each of the wooden gables above the side lattices is a cutout of a small 5-pointed star. The secondary section's exterior walls are constructed primarily of field stones in various shades of gray, brown, and white. This fieldstone section extends from the ground to about two-thirds of the way up the walls' height. The wall's top third, which reaches from the fieldstone section to the roofline, is constructed of vertical wooden planks, many aged to a dark brown color. A wooden door, and 2 small wood-framed windows flanking the door, are fitted into the fieldstone wall section with their top edges directly touching the wood above.",

    "audioDescription": "A low wooden dock and an adjacent boat ramp jut into Loon Lake, a large but tranquil inland lake located along the Platte River just south of where M-22 crosses the river. A concrete pathway leads to the slightly upward-sloping dock, which becomes wider on its left side only as the dock ends over the water. All sides of the dock and this small rectangular observation deck at its outer end are edged by wooden timbers measuring about 6 inches high, with the exception of a small area on the deck's left side, which has been left open. There are no other railings or barriers positioned alongside the dock. The boat ramp, which slopes downward into the water to the right of the dock as you approach from the concrete walkway is constructed of an open concrete grid that allows grass to grow around the small square sections making up its surface. The upper end of this boat ramp can be accessed in one of 2 ways, either from a concrete path located to the right of the ramp or from the concrete walkway leading directly to the dock. To access the boat ramp from the walkway leading to the dock, you must step over a concrete curb positioned about 4 inches above the walkway. Here at Loon Lake visitors are invited to have a picnic or to enjoy fishing from either the boat ramp or their boat. Picnic tables are situated in the grassy area under the trees located between the shoreline and the vault toilet provided here.",

    "audioDescription": "North and South Manitou Islands can be accessed by private boat or by a passenger ferry service run by Manitou Island Transit. This ferry service operates from the Fishtown Dock located at Leland Harbor, about 27 miles north of Empire on M-22. The Manitou Island Transit building located in front of the dock is a one-story wooden plank structure with a green-shingled gable and shed roof. The building's wide doorway is located on the left side of the building facade, where there is a wooden ramp without railings that slopes slightly upward into the building. Standing to the right of the building is a large sign featuring a blue-painted gull flying in front of a red sun. Blue and gray lettering on this sign reads: \"Manitou Island Transit. Serving North and South Manitou Islands. Shoreline Cruises.\" As you step onto the entrance ramp, you may encounter a large round plant container positioned to the right side of the ramp's front edge. Just inside the door you may also encounter racks and shelves holding clothing or other sale merchandise. About 4 feet in front of you as you step into the building is a wooden counter where you can purchase tickets for the ferry. Tickets can also be purchased online for all times other than the seasons falling before Memorial Day or after Labor Day. To obtain tickets during that time, or if you are reserving space for a kayak or canoe, call Manitou Island Transit at 231-256-9061. Lying on the pebble-strewn ground a few feet in front of the large Manitou Island Transit sign, and a few feet to the right of the building's entrance ramp's front edge, is a massive metal anchor attached to a long metal chain. The rusty anchor's 2 arms curve upward from the anchor's pointed crown toward the anchor's straight shank. The shank, which measures about 5 feet long, pierces a piece of weathered wood, perhaps the anchor's stock, that is propped atop a small pile of wood blocks. The Leland Harbor dock located behind the Manitou Island Transit building features several slender piers where any number of boats may be moored. The pier directly in back of the building slopes downward slightly as it stretches over the water and has wooden safety railings flanking its first few feet only. Other piers here are edged with the tops of support pillars only. As you leave the pebbly ground behind the building and approach the water and the closest pier, you will encounter a wide concrete section underfoot. The only barrier at this section's outer edge appears to be a low concrete bumper or curb located to the right of the pier entrance. Stretching from this concrete section's left side at the water's edge, and running parallel to the water, is a narrower concrete walkway leading to additional piers.Also of interest at Leland Harbor is a long jetty, or breakwater, constructed of rocks located several yards off shore. Depending on the time of day, gray and white gulls and other seabirds may be perched atop the jetty.Standing near the Manitou Island Transit building at the north end of the parking lot is a sign entitled \"Avian Botulism at Sleeping Bear Dunes.\" This sign features on its bottom half a color illustration depicting an underwater view of Lake Michigan and the various aquatic creatures found 10 to 40 meters below the water's surface. Also pictured here is a large black and white loon nabbing a small brown fish that swims just above the lake bottom, as well as other birds and a lone coyote standing on shore. Text appearing under a subtitle \"Hard Work at Play\" tells us:Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is a National Park Service site. Part of its mission is to protect and preserve the nearby beach playgrounds for you and future generations to enjoy.But something foul has been washing up on these special beaches since 2000. Avian botulism outbreaks have killed more than 100,000 water birds in the Great Lakes, and over 7,000 of those birds were found on the nearby 65 miles of shoreline protected by the National Lakeshore. The causes of these avian botulism outbreaks are bigger than the Lakeshore boundaries, which means the solutions will be too.That's why hard work is at play here at Leland Harbor, where the National Park Service, U.S. Geological Survey, UW-Milwaukee, and other partners and volunteer groups base their research efforts.What we've learned so far: Invasive species (like bullies lacking healthy rules or manners) cheat and out-compete native Great Lakes species for survival, taking over food webs and causing algal overgrowth where conditions are right. Together with climate change impacts like warming water temperatures and lowering lake levels, these deviations appear linked to avian botulism outbreaks. More hard work and research is needed to discover how they are linked.Below this text are 7 numbered text blocks, with each number referring to a labeled creature or section on the illustration. The text blocks, and an explanation appearing above them, include lettering in both bl",

    "bodyText": "<p>The USLSS built the boat house in 1901. A wooden ramp with metal rails leads from the front of the boathouse down to a slip at the water's edge. Surfmen pushed the surfboat on its metal carriage down the ramp and into the harbor. From there, they could row or sail to ships in distress.<br /> <br /> The boathouse contains two of the open surf rowing boats used for open water rescues. It also holds the carriage and the small cannon-Lyle Gun-used to launch a projectile with attached line to a ship within 400 yards for a breeches buoy rescue. In addition, it holds many of the accessories (breeches buoys, megaphones, rope gathering and coiling equipment, etc.) used by the lifesaving team for their practices and work.<br /> <br /> The main qualification for a surfman was the ability to row an open boat in a storm. The surfmen were ranked by skill, the best man being #1, while the least experienced would be #6, #7 or #8, depending on the size of the crew.<br /> <br /> A wayside entitled, <strong>Equipped for Rescue</strong> ,\" features three black-and-white photos of uniformed surfmen performing ship rescues.</p> <h3>Life-saving equipment</h3> <p>Surfmen had a variety of life-saving equipment at their disposal. According to regulation, if one method of rescue failed surfmen were required to attempt all other available forms of rescue. Weekly drills ensured that all surfmen became proficient at using life-saving equipment. Their hard work paid off-the USLSS had an overall 99% success rate.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boats</strong><br /> Generally, the USLSS used two types of rescue boats-the lifeboat and the surfboat. The lifeboat was an English invention adopted by the USLSS. Lifeboats were self-bailing and self-righting. They could be sailed or rowed. Lifeboats were long and heavy; some measured as long as 40 feet and weighed up to 4,000 pounds! Other advantages of this boat included its stability, sturdiness, and ability to handle heavy seas. However, the weight also made the boat almost impossible to haul down the beach; instead, it had to be launched from the boathouse directly into a sheltered harbor. Later models of lifeboats were lighter and even motorized. With the addition of a motor, surfmen could travel to wrecks farther away and get there faster and with much less energy than rowing required.<br /> <br /> Surfmen also used surfboats, an American invention. Surfboats were smaller, lighter, and faster than their English counterparts. These boats sat on a carriage that surfman could haul down beaches and over dunes in order to get as close to a wreck as possible before launching directly into rough surf. The Keeper steered and the surfmen rowed. Surfboats could also carry more shipwreck victims than lifeboats, anywhere from 10-15 victims. One disadvantage was that the first surfboats were not self-righting, only self-bailing. Like the lifeboat, later models were also motorized.<br /> <br /> Eventually, most USLSS stations had both a lifeboat and a surfboat. Surprisingly, in many instances boats were not the surfmen's preferred method of rescue. Instead, surfmen and station Keepers often preferred to use breeches buoys and lifecars to rescue shipwreck victims. These methods of rescue both relied on one of the only guns designed to save lives-the Lyle gun.<br /> <br /> <strong>Lyle Gun</strong><br /> The USLSS recruited Lt. David Lyle, an Army Ordnance officer, to design a gun that would aid in shipwreck rescues. Lyle invented small, bronze cannon that sat on a wooden carriage. Depending on size, the cannon and carriage together weighed about 160 pounds. The Lyle gun and other rescue equipment were stored on a cart that the surfmen could pull down the beach, close to the wreck. Surfmen tied a line to an eye bolt screwed onto the end of a cast iron projectile and then loaded it into the cannon. A charge of black powder, up to 8 ounces, shot the projectile and line 250 to almost 700 yards. The goal was to shoot the line over a wreck so that it could be used to haul a series of other lines from the beach. Shipwreck victims attached the heaviest of these lines, the hawser, to the mast (or the sturdiest part of the wreck) while surfmen back on the beach propped up the line with a crotch. Next, surfmen could attach a breeches buoy or a lifecar to the line and haul it out to the wreck.<br /> <br /> <strong>Breeches Buoy</strong><br /> Once the surfmen set up the hawser line, they could attach a breeches buoy and send it out to the wreck. This was also referred to as the beach apparatus. The breeches buoy itself was a life preserver with a pair of canvas breeches, or shorts, sewn onto the bottom. One by one, shipwreck victims would climb into the breeches buoy and the surfmen on the shore would haul on the line, pulling them over the waves and back to shore. This was the preferred method of rescue because the surfmen stayed on the beach and because the breeches buoy was lighter and easier to haul over the beach than the heavier lifecar.<br /> <br /> <strong>Life car</strong><br /> Several designs of lifecars existed as early as the 1840s. The United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) commonly used Joseph Francis' 1847 lifecar. This iron-covered lifeboat included a deck hatch in the top used by shipwreck victims to climb inside to safety. There was room for four passengers inside this iron life-saving device. Early models were so small that passengers had to lie on top of each other in order to fit; later models were taller so that passengers could sit upright. Once the hatch was closed, the lifecar was water-tight. Two rings on top of the car allowed the heavy hawser line to pass through and surfmen could haul the lifecar to and from the shore. Small holes at the top of the lifecar let air inside. However, it would have been a dark, bumpy, uncomfortable ride.<br /> <br /> Like the breeches buoy, the lifecar had some advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage was that instead of only being able to save one victim at a time, the lifecar had room for 4 or 5 passengers. Passengers were also protected from weather, debris, and waves. However, the weight of the lifecar was a major issue. This 550 pound vessel had to be loaded into the already heavy beach cart and hauled through the sand. Surfmen were totally exhausted by the time they reached the site of the wreck, and they still had to fire the Lyle gun, ready the lifecar, and then haul on the line that pulled it out to the wreck and back.</p> <h3>Shipwreck!</h3> <p>During the heyday of shipping on the Great Lakes, the Manitou Passage served as a busy highway. Faster and safer than sailing around North and South Manitou Islands, this passage acted as a shortcut and also provided access to the deep harbor at South Manitou. Thick fog and bad storms led many ships to seek refuge in South Manitou's harbor. Lighthouses on South Manitou, North Manitou, fog signals, a lightship, and a shoal light helped guide mariners through the passage. However, the passage was also dangerous because of shallow shoals where ships could run aground. The surfmen of the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) and later the United States Coast Guard (USCG) responded to hundreds of ships in distress. Read more about some of these incidents below.<br /> <br /> <strong>Walter L. Frost</strong><br /> On November 4, 1903 a night thick with fog, the steamer Walter L. Frost sounded distress signals when it ran aground on the southwest end of South Manitou Island. The island's USLSS crew launched their surfboat and made their way to the wreck where they attempted to free the boat by removing some of her cargo. When that failed, two tug boats attempted to tow her out, which also failed. Finally, worsening weather made freeing the steamer too dangerous and the 21 member crew abandoned her and took refuge at the Life-Saving station. The steamer and most of her cargo of corn and general merchandise were a total loss.<br /> <br /> <strong>Congress</strong><br /> On October 4, 1907, the surfmen at the USLSS station on South Manitou Island received a telephone call from the island post office stating that a steamer loaded with lumber was on fire. The Keeper and his crew launched a surfboat and rowed out to the Congress. They were able to tow the steamer away from the dock and save some of the cargo, but were not able to put out the fire. The steamer continued to burn and sank later that night.<br /> <br /> <strong>Three Brothers</strong><br /> The steamer Three Brothers was bound from Boyne City, MI to Chicago, IL with a load of lumber when it began taking on water during a storm. On the night of September 27, 1911 the captain ran her aground off of South Manitou Island. All thirteen aboard were saved and spent thirteen days at the South Manitou Island station. Most of the lumber aboard was salvaged, but the damage to the steamer was too expensive to repair, so she was abandoned. Eventually, shifting sand covered the Three Brothers and she became buried shortly after being abandoned. Then in 1996, the sand over the wreck washed away and exposed her for the first time in nearly 85 years! Today, the wreck is a popular dive site and is protected by the Manitou Passage Underwater Preserve.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fransisco Morazan</strong><br /> On November 29, 1960, the Liberian freighter Fransisco Morazan ran aground at the south end of South Manitou Island during a blinding snowstorm. The freighter was bound from Chicago to the St. Lawrence Seaway in order to reach Holland. The crew remained aboard the stranded ship until December 4th, when they finally abandoned her and were taken to Traverse City by the USCG. The captain never returned and today the wreck sits in about 15 feet of water.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Located near the Maritime Museum is the life-saving station's boathouse, a one-story structure with a red-shingled hip roof with a cupola, its roof also red, standing atop its peak. The building, whose exterior is constructed of vertical white-painted wooden planks, houses several displays highlighting the life-saving equipment used during the early 1900s. The concrete sidewalk leading to the boathouse is edged on its left side with a series of wooden pillars, about 3 feet high, connected by 2 lines of rope. This barrier separates the sidewalk from a small grassy hill sloping downward to the left. The sidewalk's right-side edge is level with the ground running alongside it. As you approach the building, 2 large wooden doors, which will likely be propped open during your visit, flank a large bay door offering entry into the boathouse. Exhibits in the boathouse include 2 long wooden lifeboats, a breeches buoy rescue carriage complete with 2 spools holding thick yellow rope, and-suspended from 3 ropes above one end of the carriage-an actual breeches buoy. Attached below the buoy's black float, which resembles a tubular truck tire, is an approximately 2 Â½-foot-long canvas sack with 2 leg holes at the bottom. Displayed atop 2 wooden stools is a flat rectangular frame with 4 dozen wooden pins, each measuring approximately one foot long, arranged vertically around the frame's periphery. Wound around the pins in an overlaid zig-zag pattern is a long length of white rope. This is part of a faking box, its coiled rope used for life-saving. Also found in the boathouse is a display detailing the shipwrecks of Lake Michigan as well as various lanterns, pulleys, and other artifacts. This site's wayside panel, entitled \"Equipped for Rescue,\" features 3 black-and-white photos of uniformed crewmen performing various ship rescue missions. Text below the wayside's title tells us: If a ship ran aground, the crew could wheel out the beach cart, fire a line to the ship with the Lyle gun, and use the breeches buoy to haul sailors to safety. Most wrecks in the area occurred when lumber ships strayed into shallow water. The boathouse presently contains a fully-equipped beach cart as well as lifeboats and lifeboat wagon. The first photo, located directly to the right of the wayside title at the panel's top edge, shows a single horse pulling a long wagon holding a wooden lifeboat. A man wearing a rain slicker and hat and holding the horse's reins stands in the boat's bow. Several additional men, also wearing hats and slickers, trudge alongside the wagon. A caption reads: If a ship foundered far around the point, the station kept a wagon to haul lifeboats to the closest beach, and save miles of rowing. The next photo, located in the panel's upper right corner, shows several crewmen in dark billed hats and white uniforms holding their oars aloft as they sit in 2 rows in a long wooden lifeboat. Standing in the boat and facing the men is another man wearing a dark cap and uniform. The lifeboat, with the name \"Sleeping Bear Point\" painted on its side, sits atop a wheeled platform placed on a wooden railway track. The caption explains: For open-water rescues, the crew could launch the 23-foot surfboat down the marine railway toward the lake. Sand build-up has stretched the distance between boathouse and water. The large 3rd photo, which fills the panel's bottom two-thirds, shows 7 crewmen holding up 2 tall wooden poles, the \"V\" created by their crisscrossing top ends supporting a long rope running horizontally a few feet atop the men's heads. This rope extends from one of 2 large spools placed atop a wheeled carriage parked along the shoreline a few yards to the men's left. Suspended from a pulley attached to the rope suspended to the right of the men is a life-saving ring fitted with a canvas sling resembling a pair of short trousers. The caption reads: Setting up the breeches buoy.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The National Lakeshore's Maritime Museum is housed in the Sleeping Bear Point U.S. Life-Saving Service Station which helped protect sailors and passengers moving through the Manitou Passage on Lake Michigan.<br /> <br /> Visit the Maritime Museum to learn about the history of the U.S. Life-Saving Service, U.S. Coast Guard, and Great Lakes shipping. Walk through the boathouse next to the museum and see the life-saving equipment used during the early 1900's.<br /> The museum's collection includes artifacts from ships and boats, books, plans, photographs, and navigation instruments.<br /> <br /> Exhibits illustrate the U.S. Life-Saving Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, and Great Lakes shipping history. A room on the second floor is outfitted as a Steamer Wheelhouse with a panoramic view of the Manitou Passage shipping channel.<br /> <br /> A wayside entitled, \"Coast Guard Station 1902 to 1942,\" tells about moving the station to its present place.</p> <h3>U.S. Life-Saving Service</h3> <p>Congress established the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) in 1871 in an effort to reduce the number of lives lost on the oceans and the Great Lakes due to shipwrecks. The surfmen of the USLSS became known as \"storm warriors\" and \"storm fighters.\" Their unofficial motto was, \"you have to go out, but you don't have to come back.\" USLSS crews braved perilous conditions to save shipwreck victims from certain doom.<br /> <br /> The narrow Manitou Passage, which runs between the islands and the mainland, is one of the most dangerous on the Great Lakes. Ships have to make several turns here because of the shoals surrounding the islands. At night, surfmen patrolled the beaches, looking and listening for any signs of a ship in distress.<br /> <br /> The crew were also responsible for maintaining the station; this included keeping it clean. Every morning they cleaned the lamps and lanterns and trimmed and filled them. They swept the hallways; filled wood boxes; swept sidewalks; cleaned cuspidors and ash trays; dusted the stairway; and made their beds neat and smooth. On Saturdays, or scrub day, all station floors were scrubbed, windows washed, and brass polished.<br /> <br /> Surfmen also kept the buildings and equipment gleaming. Maintenance of buildings usually meant repainting the buildings and cutting and splitting wood (enough wood for the two kitchen ranges and two wood burners in the station). But when needed, expanded to renovation tasks like putting on new roofs, laying new flooring, building new outhouses, and even laying new sod (and watering that sod).<br /> <br /> The main duty of the Service was the protection of life and property on the water. But local citizens often looked to the crew when they needed help. An annual report from 1895 lists some of these \"Miscellaneous Services\": surfmen rigging the rope on the flagstaff of the county building, extinguishing 21 fires in homes or buildings, catching a runaway horse, repairing a wagon owned by two ladies who were kept out of the rain at the station while the surfmen worked on their buggy, finding a child lost in the woods, helping sick people get home. And once, helping a farmer get his horse out of a well.</p> <h3>Living in the Station House</h3> <p>Typical U. S. Life-Saving Service Stations were rectangular framed houses, split in two by a hallway in the middle. One side housed the crew of surfmen: kitchen, dining room, and lounging area, and above that half of the house, the crew's sleeping room. The other half of the house was the keeper's quarters: kitchen, dining area, and a living room, and two second bedrooms. The keeper and his wife slept in one of the bedrooms and the children in the other room.<br /> <br /> The crew spent most of their time in the on the first floor as the sleeping quarters upstairs wasn't heated. They read, played cards, listened to music, cooked meals, and told stories.<br /> <br /> Upstairs in the sleeping quarters, each surfman had an iron bed and a closet with a number over the door to identify who it belonged to. The closet shelves held spare sheets and blankets, a swimming suit, and each man's regulation clothing. The men also kept a case of wooden matches in small wooden boxes, a jack knife, and towels, all folded neatly. Their dress coat which hung on the door. Each man also had a book of regulations.<br /> <br /> There was no washstand upstairs. Washing took place either in the kitchen or out in the laundry room. The station had a shallow water well. A pump by kitchen was the only inside plumbing. They had no electricity, only oil or gas lights. One keeper bought a little metal bathtub and installed it so it drained, but they still had to fill the tub with bucketsful of water heated on the wood stove.<br /> <br /> Many of the surfmen had their own, small houses nearby. This allowed them to be with their families. The surfmen had one day off every 8 days, otherwise they were on duty 24 hours a day. Regulations required the men to sleep at the station except for their day off. But some keepers were more lenient allowing men to stay in their cottages near the station, where they could be called quickly to come in an emergency and let people spend a little more time at home.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A concrete sidewalk leads to the 2-story Maritime Museum, a white clapboard structure with a red-shingled roof and an elevated front porch. Located in front of a small triangular gable with 2 small windows positioned above the porch roof is a white sign with black lettering that reads: \"U.S. Coast Guard. Sleeping Bear Point Station.\" Please note that the sidewalk that runs alongside the building's facade has 2 shallow ramps, one each sloping slightly upward on either side of a flat sidewalk section located at the base of the 7 steps leading up to the porch. These ramps and the flat sidewalk section are edged in yellow paint. The museum's single entrance door is located off the porch, a few feet straight in front of you from the top of the steps. There are wooden railings on both sides of the steps, attached at porch level to 2 of the 4 wooden pillars supporting the porch roof. More railings surround the porch itself, where you may also encounter one or 2 benches flanking the entrance door. The porch does not extend across the full width of the building but across its central section only. There are 5 tall but narrow rectangular windows on the facade-2 to the left of the porch, 2 on the porch to the right of the entrance door, and one on the far right end of the building. The Maritime Museum contains several educational exhibits detailing the U.S. Life-Saving Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Great Lakes shipping history, including information about and artifacts from shipwrecks. The second floor holds a number of cots, representative of those used by crew. Also on the second floor is a room outfitted as a Steamer Wheelhouse, offering a panoramic view of the Manitou Passage shipping channel. The Maritime Museum is open from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day. This site's wayside panel, entitled \"Coast Guard Station 1902 to 1942,\" features a large black-and-white photo of a cluster of white buildings surrounded by encroaching sand dunes, a drawing of the station's original 2-level floor plan, and a map drawing of the land area adjacent to Sleeping Bear Point. Text below the wayside's title tells us: Migrating sand dunes were threatening to bury the station at Sleeping Bear Point, its original location. In 1931 horses were used to relocate the buildings 1½ miles to this site near Glen Haven Village. Crew's quarters were Spartan. The Life-Saving Service was like a military organization-regulations, duties, and sometimes even architecture were standard from station to station around the Great Lakes. Though modified during construction, the design of the dwelling was based on a prototype station at Marquette, Michigan. In 1915 the U. S. Life-Saving Service and Revenue Cutter Service merged to form the U. S. Coast Guard. The station floor plan, located on the panel's right side, indicates that the first floor housed the kitchen, mess room, keeper's room, and crew's quarters. The second floor includes a large room with 7 closets-additional crew's quarters-as well as 2 rooms labeled simply as \"chambers.\" The area map, pictured above and slightly to the left of the floor plans, includes a \"you are here\" notation indicating your location at the Sleeping Bear Point Coast Guard Station dated 1931 to 1942. This station is situated approximately halfway between Glen Haven to the southeast and the earlier Life Saving Station-dated 1901 to1930-located at Sleeping Bear Point to the northwest. Lastly, a caption accompanying the black-and-white photo reads:Dunes threaten the station at Sleeping Bear Point.",

The vernacular Queen Anne house has an irregular floor plan, two stories, a gable roof with several one story cross-gables, and clapboard siding with cornerboards. The use of fieldstones in the foundation of the house porch and pillars was a common practice in Port Oneida.<br /> <br /> The Baschs raised corn, beans, potatoes, and approximately 50 head of beef cattle on their 110 acre farm. Potatoes, the cash crop, were sold at Cedar, and surplus corn and wheat were marketed at Crystal River. The Baschs raised dairy cattle for their own use. At one time, they had about 300-400 turkeys.<br /> They stopped farming around 1969.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A dirt road leads through the fields and woods to the Martin Basch Farm, a farmstead that dates to the mid-1880s. Although the farm's original barn is no longer standing, other buildings remain, and many of these structures have been restored. These include a 2-story farmhouse, a slat-sided corn crib, an open-sided machine shop, and other outbuildings-including a blacksmith shop-constructed of vertical wooden planks.<br />The farmhouse is clad in white clapboard and has 2 intersecting gable roofs covered with black shingles. Four wide concrete steps lead up to a small front porch, which is flanked on each side by an approximately 3-foot-high fieldstone pillar. A low fieldstone wall extends across the front of the house to the right of the right-side porch pillar only. It is not suggested that you step onto the porch as its floor may be uneven and/or overgrown with vegetation.<br />The farmhouse's front door and each of its many rectangular windows are topped with gable pediments featuring decorative wooden millwork. This millwork consists of one flat circular medallion positioned in each pediment's center and 2 smaller circular medallions located on each lower corner. Each of these medallions are carved with a simple flower petal design.<br />Each of the 6 rectangular windows on the building's facade is covered with a single white-painted wood shutter inset with a small rectangular plexiglass panel situated vertically on the shutter's bottom half. These panels allow visitors to view the inside of the building. Located on the top half of two of these shutters are narrow rectangular openings, also positioned vertically and fitted with thin wood louvers. <br />The house's circular gable windows are surrounded by decorative millwork as well, also circular, and with a crenulated, or notched outer edge.<br />Two tall concrete steps lead up to the door of the farm's corn crib, a long, narrow structure constructed of widely-spaced wood slats and sheltered by a wood gable roof. The corn crib, whose 2 side walls slant outward from foundation to roofline, stands elevated above the ground atop several concrete blocks. A small group of trees stands immediately to the left of the structure.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The cottage known as Monte Carlo was constructed between the time the summer people left in 1893 and returned in 1894. The Monte Carlo is the third dog-trot bungalow cottage on North Manitou Island-a house plan that is exceedingly rare in the northern Great Lakes region. It predates the other Cottage Row houses.<br /> <br /> The Monte Carlo cottage shared this parcel with a house moved from the USSLS complex and remodeled to serve as a communal dining facility for Cottage Row property owners. William Angell purchased the property and stayed there during his visits to the island. The dining hall/hotel, which could house 20-25 guests at a time, was converted into a lodge for guests of the Manitou Island Association (and for hunters), but was destroyed by fire in 1953.<br /> <br /> North of the cottage, the site of the former MIA lodge is marked by a slight earthen depression and a single spirea shrub growing near the walkway.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex. It was the island's only speculative resort enterprise, the first of several efforts to turn the island into an exclusive retreat. The individually owned cottages were supported by a communal kitchen and dining facility. This resort setup was common during the nineteenth century and represents a broad trend in recreation on the Great Lakes region.<br /> <br /> The buildings face eastward to take advantage of off-shore breezes, as well as superb views of the Manitou Passage and the Michigan mainland. From this prime vantage point, the summer residents could monitor activities of the life-saving service station, as well as steamship traffic through the passage. The configuration of the Cottage Row parcels and accompanying deed restrictions ensured that each property owner would have an unobstructed view of the beach and the Manitou Passage. A board walk, shaded by sugar maple and Norway maple trees, once extended along this area.<br /> <br /> The Cottage Row colony provided seasonal employment for year-round island residents. Wives and children of North Manitou farmers and U. S. Life-Saving Service crewmen residents took jobs cooking, cleaning, and doing other domestic chores for Cottage Row residents, in the communal dining room, and at hotel operated by Katie Shepard. For the island's year-round residents, the colony represented a significant source of supplemental cash income. Although some of the cottage owners maintained small gardens, the hotel and summer visitors also provided a much-needed local market for fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, and dairy products.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard opened her home as a hotel and offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.<br /> <br /> Getting to and from the island and their cottages wasn't always easy as Mrs. Shirley Foote Alford (whose family built one of the first cottages in 1894) explained:<br /> \"When people were planning to leave the island, their trunks were loaded on the farm wagon which would go to the top of the hill running down to the dock. There the wagon would wait until the steamer came in close and blew her whistle. If it was three whistles, wagon and people hurried down to the dock to see the boat land. If four whistles were sounded (urgent-danger and distress signal). We all went down as fast as possible to the Life Saving Station where passengers, trunks, baby carriages, ice boxes, etc. were taken out to the steamer in the Life-Saving Service surfboat, rowed by the crew, each man with an oar and the captain steering with a long oar in the stern.\"</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Monte Carlo Cottage is the first of several small houses built in a row atop the bluff overlooking the North Manitou Island Life-Saving Station. Constructed in 1893 by George and Carrie Blossom, the cottage is situated at the north end of what is known as Cottage Row and will be the first building you encounter as you walk down the old boardwalk. This one-story white clapboard structure has a stone foundation, a gray-shingled hip roof, and a wide porch edged on all 3 sides by an approximately 3½-foot-high solid wooden plank knee wall. Fitted into the knee wall in the facade's center is a full screen door offering access to the porch. The porch roof is supported by nearly 2 dozen balusters extending from the top of the knee wall. Several of these balusters, including the 4-one pair each-flanking the door are turned and rounded; the remaining balusters are plain and square. Situated on the hip roof a few feet above the entrance is a triangular pediment, its face decorated with a sunburst design. You must walk through the grassy yard in front of the cottage to reach the 4 concrete steps leading up to the screen door opening onto the porch. There are no railings alongside the steps, which are flanked on both sides by wide bushes that are nearly as tall as the porch roof. The porch itself-which measures about 10 feet deep-has a weathered wooden plank floor and ceiling. There are 4 windows lining the facade-2 large windows with 12 panes on their top halves only flanking the main entrance door and 2 smaller windows, one situated on each end of the porch. The Monte Carlo Cottage, which was designed by a young Frank Lloyd Wright, is known as a \"dog-trot\" style house, with rooms arranged on each side of a covered breezeway with doors opening into the central passage.",

The buildings illustrate the beginnings of the volunteer era and continue through the expansion of the Life-Saving Service into the Coast Guard era.<br /> <br /> Members of the USLSS were responsible for rescuing victims aboard ships in distress using a variety of equipment. The USLSS eventually became the main employer of North Manitou Island residents. Crews on the Great Lakes were usually composed of a Keeper and six to eight surfmen. The crew had a number of duties including twenty-four-hour beach patrol, beach apparatus drill, boat drill, signal drill, and practice at \"restoring the apparently drowned.\"<br /> <br /> For nearly eighty years, the presence of the U.S. Life Saving Service station made North Manitou Village the primary social and economic hub of the island. The U.S. Life Saving Service, and Cottage Row's summer residents, infused the relatively isolated North Manitou Island economy with cash and linked the Island with the larger regional economy. The station represented an important source of employment for residents, and a small, local market for agriculturists. Young men from several island farm families took jobs with the U.S. Coast Guard. Many year-round residents, especially women and children, earned cash wages by performing domestic chores such as washing, sewing, cleaning, and canning. The station crew provided the island with fire protection, first-aid, and police services, and also served as a vital communication link with the mainland and the outside world, and as a center of island social life.<br /> <br /> Today, park employees live and work in the station house during the summer months.</p> <h3>Living in the Station House</h3> <p>Typical U. S. Life-Saving Service Stations were rectangular framed houses, split in two by a hallway in the middle. One side housed the crew of surfmen: kitchen, dining room, and lounging area, and above that half of the house, the crew's sleeping room. The other half of the house was the keeper's quarters: kitchen, dining area, and a living room, and two second bedrooms. The keeper and his wife slept in one of the bedrooms and the children in the other room.<br /> <br /> The crew spent most of their time in the on the first floor as the sleeping quarters upstairs wasn't heated. They read, played cards, listened to music, cooked meals, and told stories.<br /> <br /> Upstairs in the sleeping quarters, each surfman had an iron bed and a closet with a number over the door to identify who it belonged to. The closet shelves held spare sheets and blankets, a swimming suit, and each man's regulation clothing. The men also kept a case of wooden matches in small wooden boxes, a jack knife, and towels, all folded neatly. Their dress coat which hung on the door. Each man also had a book of regulations.<br /> <br /> There was no washstand upstairs. Washing took place either in the kitchen or out in the laundry room. The station had a shallow water well. A pump by kitchen was the only inside plumbing. They had no electricity, only oil or gas lights. One keeper bought a little metal bathtub and installed it so it drained, but they still had to fill the tub with bucketsful of water heated on the wood stove.<br /> <br /> Many of the surfmen had their own, small houses nearby. This allowed them to be with their families. The surfmen had one day off every 8 days, otherwise they were on duty 24 hours a day. Regulations required the men to sleep at the station except for their day off. But some keepers were more lenient allowing men to stay in their cottages near the station, where they could be called quickly to come in an emergency and let people spend a little more time at home.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The U.S. Life-Saving Service Dwelling on North Manitou Island is a 2-story white clapboard structure with a black-shingled gable roof, a gabled front dormer, and an elevated front porch. Filling the space between the ground and the porch are several lattice panels, painted white. The 5 steps leading up to the porch and the building's main entrance are located on the building's right side. The sloping porch roof is supported on its front edge by 5 square white-painted pillars. Flanking both sides of the steps and the porch itself are a series of thin square balusters topped with railings, about 3 feet high. The structure's windows-both on the porch and on the sides of the dwelling- contain 16 panes each. There is also one large 16-paned window centered on the front dormer's gable directly above the porch roof. This dormer gable is faced with white-painted shingles. This U.S. Life-Saving Service Dwelling served as crew quarters in the late 1880s, with the captain's quarters located on the first floor. The building has since been adapted by the National Park Service to house park staff.",

    "audioDescription": "The Village Campground is the only campground on North Manitou Island. Located about two-tenths of a mile north from the Village Dock, this small campground contains 8 designated campsites, 2 community fire rings, and one outhouse. Each individual campsite is limited to 4 people and 2 tents. Standing alongside the trail leading to the campground is a wooden post supporting a small wooden sign with the words \"Village Campground\" and, below it, \"West Side via Pole Bridge\" carved into its face. An arrow carved to the left of \"Village Campground\" indicates the campground's location to the left, and an upward facing arrow indicates that the bridge is located straight ahead. The Village Campground consists of several small clearings surrounded by trees. The locations of the individual campsites in these clearings are indicated by wooden posts measuring about 3 feet tall with white triangles painted near their tops. Take care as you step around the campsites as you may encounter some fallen logs as well as a wooden bench at each site. These benches are each constructed of a single wooden timber perched atop 2 smaller wooden blocks positioned at each end. The community fire rings are topped with metal grills that can be lifted to place wood into the otherwise open rings. Each metal ring measures approximately 3 feet in diameter and 4 inches high. Campers may collect dead and downed wood found on the island to make open fires in these pits during their visit. The outhouse is located in a large clearing near the trail leading into the campground. Placed in front of the outhouse door is a wooden slat platform with an approximate height of 1 inch. The outhouse door opens outward from right to left. Located a few yards in front of the outhouse is another wooden platform, about 5 inches high, holding a trash receptacle with an upward-slanting metal lid. As you approach the receptacle from the outhouse, you must walk around the platform to the right. The front of the receptacle will now be on your left. Turn left 90 degrees to face the receptacle. There is a handle on the lid's top edge. Also standing in the ground is a structure consisting of 2 metal poles-one vertical pole measuring about 7 feet tall and a second pole of nearly the same length positioned horizontally atop the first pole to create a large letter \"T.\" Campers must purchase a Backcountry Use Permit before camping on the island. Note that camping is allowed in the wilderness area on North Manitou Island, but open fires are prohibited outside the Village Campground.",

    "bodyText": "<p>North Bar Lake beach is one of the most popular beaches in the Lakeshore. Perfect for families, North Bar Lake and its warmer waters are immediately next to Lake Michigan and connected by a small outlet. If the waves on the big lake are knocking over your two-year-old, you can retreat to North Bar Lake. The outlet between the lakes often is so shallow that very small children can wade in the warmer water.</p> <p>The shallow, crystal clear waters of North Bar offer a great place to for swimming, skim boarding, sand dam building, and general splashing around as well as kayaking and paddle boarding.</p> <p><strong>NO pets are allowed on this beach.</strong></p> <p>It takes a few minutes to climb the trail over the dune that separates the lakes, but it's worth it. Once at the Lake Michigan beach, you can walk along the shore north to the bluffs below the Pierce Stocking Drive Lake Michigan Overlook Platform. This perspective gives you a better appreciation of the size and steepness of the bluffs.</p> <p>Some areas of the low dunes that separate the two lakes have experienced severe dune erosion and are closed for restoration. Please obey closure signs.</p> <h3>The channel between North Bar Lake and Lake Michigan</h3> <p>Unlike many inland lakes, North Bar Lake connects to Lake Michigan with a channel that opens and closes with the crashing of waves and blowing of sand during storms. When the sand bar builds up, it separates North Bar Lake from Lake Michigan. When waves eat the sand away, a small connecting channel exists between the two lakes.</p> <p>Longshore currents help move the sand along the shore. Longshore currents act like a river in the lake transporting sand along the lakeshore and reshaping the shoreline. The longshore current at Sleeping Bear Point carries 60,000 square meters of sand a year away from the point, enough to fill 24 Olympic swimming pools a year. You can often see the longshore current (especially from the North Bar Lake Overlook on the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive): it is the greener water paralleling the shore.</p> <p>North Bar Lake occupies part of a former bay on Lake Michigan. This unique connection creates a diversity of aquatic and ecological communities unmatched in most of Michigan. Without the power of Lake Michigan's waves, this beautiful lake would never have formed.</p> <h3>Is this a Shipwreck?</h3> <p>Many boats and ships have been lost in the sometimes treacherous waters of the Manitou Passage-the water trail between the mainland and Manitou Islands. The same natural forces of wind and waves that caused most of the wrecks can quickly uncover a wreck site that has been buried in the sand for over a hundred years. The site may remain visible for weeks or only a few days.<br /> <br /> Did you find a shipwreck? Read more about identifying a shipwreck in the Beach FAQs section of the app.</p> <h3>Beach Safely</h3> <p>**Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!**<br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Beach fires</strong><br /> Roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over glowing coals while watching the sun go down over the lake is a perfect ending to a fun day at the beach. Beach fire are allowed on our mainland Lake Michigan beaches between the water's edge and where the dunes begin, and away from any vegetation. Make sure you use firewood from park approved vendors to help us protect our forests from pest and disease. And be sure to extinguish all beach fires with water. DO NOT bury fires-hidden embers could burn unsuspecting bare feet!<br /> <br /> <strong>Take care around plover nesting area</strong><br /> Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the piping plover, a threatened species that breeds here in the spring. Piping plovers find the cobbled beaches of Sleeping Bear Dunes an ideal place to find mates, nest, and raise their young. To protect the plovers and their nests, some parts of the beach may be temporarily closed to visitors and pets. Please help us protect these special birds by keeping dogs on a leash and obeying all beach closure signs.<br /> <br /> <strong>Step around the Pitcher's thistle</strong><br /> Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcher) blooms only once when the plant is seven years old. This native thistle grows only on the shorelines or sand dunes of the Great Lakes and is common in the Lakeshore. It is a threatened species: it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.<br /> <br /> Walking through foredunes on your way to the beach may trample and kill these plants before they can reproduce. So please watch out for the Pitcher's thistle: stay on the wooden walkways and established trails.<br /> <br /> <strong>Swim safe</strong><br /> The Lakeshore's pristine beaches are ideal for swimming, but forceful waves and rip currents can turn a fun visit into a frightening one. Use caution when swimming alone and take special precautions with children: keep a close watch on all children, stay within arm's reach, and be sure they are wearing a life jacket.<br /> <br /> <strong>Be alert for rip currents</strong><br /> Although they are not common in the Lakeshore, rip currents are dangerous and can occur at any beach with breaking waves.<br /> <br /> Lake Michigan conditions can change quickly. Know what to expect before you go in the water. Monitor the weather and check out the swim risk level for the beach you plan to visit. Read more in Safety.<br /> <br /> <strong>Paddle safe</strong><br /> Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A sandy path between low, grass-covered dunes leads to North Bar Lake Beach, located alongside the warm waters of North Bar Lake. This inland lake drains into Lake Michigan via a small outlet on the opposite side of the dunes. North Bar Lake has clear water and a sandy bottom. As you walk along the beach, you may encounter pieces of wood and a few small stones gathered near the water's edge. Standing a few feet into the dune grass lining portions of the path approaching North Bar Lake Beach and edging the beach itself are a number of short wooden poles connected by rope. Dunes in this area have suffered erosion, so please observe these barriers. Visitors are invited to hike over the dunes that separate North Bar Lake from Lake Michigan and its beaches. Growing on both sides of the trail are plants native to the dunes: dune grass, pitcher's thistle, wormwood, sand cress, and others. Note that sections of the trail leading to Lake Michigan have wide wooden steps.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Manitou Island Association (MIA), formed in 1926 by island land owners, managed the island's economic and social life. During the 1920s, the MIA earned income from farming and from the sale of cattle, beef, pork and potatoes, and the rental of pasture land, farm labor and draft animals. They also earned income from dairy goods, a cherry orchard, an apple orchard, a sugar bush, fishing, logging, and cutting ice off of Lake Manitou.<br /> <br /> The MIA initially focused its operation on agriculture, basing activities at two farms, one located adjacent to North Manitou Village, and the other at the location of the former Crescent lumber camp. During the 1920s the MIA maintained a large free-range beef cattle herd, and substantially expanded the orchard acreage devoted to cherry<br /> production. The MIA also began transforming the island landscape into a more marketable recreational resource. In 1926 the association released a small herd of white-tailed deer on the island with the intent of eventually establishing a population large enough to sustain hunting both for sport and the for the national venison market. The following year the MIA constructed a sawmill near its North Manitou Village farm and began harvesting small amounts of timber to provide lumber and shingles for the construction and maintenance of island buildings.<br /> <br /> Both of these ventures--sport-oriented recreation, and timber harvesting--became increasingly important components of the MIA's business during subsequent decades.<br /> <br /> The MIA hoped to transform the island into an exclusive fishing and hunting retreat. While Lake Michigan and the island's two small inland lakes provided plenty of fishing, hunting opportunities were limited because North Manitou had no large game. The MIA introduced non-native raccoon and white-tailed deer to the island in 1926 in order to provide more varied hunting for sportsmen.<br /> <br /> The Manitou Island Association's office building reflects the MIA's conception of the farm as a business and the association's hierarchical management structure.</p> <h3>Island deer and early deer hunts</h3> <p>Of all the wildlife located on North Manitou, the white-tailed deer is what you are most likely to see. In 1926, William R. Angell introduced six deer to the island. These few deer became the basis for a rapidly expanding herd which supported a hunting preserve for many years.<br /> <br /> The first deer hunt on North Manitou took place in 1937 with 18 deer taken. By counts in the early 1980s, there were about 2,000 deer on the island. Because there were so many deer, they would constantly browse the vegetation within their reach. Over the years, the deer have eaten off all the vegetation which was palatable to them and left that which was not. They don't really care for American beech, so you can find it growing in great abundance on the ground. The vegetation on South Manitou Island is different than that on North Manitou. South Manitou has a thick lush understory of shrubs, ferns, and vines. But the deer browse line on North Manitou is five to six feet up, giving the island a manicured look.<br /> <br /> Edgar McKee, island manger from 1937 to 1942, often served as a hunting guide (and was the guide when the first deer was shot in the fall of 1937), describes the early deer hunts.<br /> <br /> \"Hunting was divided into two, three-day sessions each week, starting around Nov 1. It would cost each hunter $150, which covered the boat trip to and from the Island, hotel and meals, a trained guide to hunt with, and a guaranteed deer. Sounds cheap, but back then that was a lot of money.<br /> <br /> The island was divided into ten sections. Each guide explored his section in advance, and knew where to find the deer. Only ten hunters were allowed to hunt at one time, and no hunter was allowed out without a guide. This was to assure safety. Also, not hunter was allowed out with a gun if there was any evidence of alcohol impairment.\"<br /> <br /> Most of the island's hunting customers were officials of large companies, invited guests of MIA members. \"None of the hardships of hunting and taking care of your deer existed then. The hunter was transported to his hunting spot and picked up at the appointed time. The hunter's job was to shoot the deer his guide pointed out to him. The guide took care of preparing the deer and dragging it to the appointed spot to be picked up.\"<br /> <br /> \"Not every hunter took home a deer. During my stay on the Island, most of the hunters killed their deer, but some didn't. It was my job to keep hanging a few choice bucks and does to supply that need. That was no problem. I would take my rifle in the company station wagon with a couple of guides, and drive through the woods. Most of the deer I shot, I shot from the window of the car. It was not unusual to take in four or five deer in on afternoon.\"<br /> North Manitou Island functioned as an exclusive hunting preserve, much in the tradition of the private hunting clubs that became popular with wealthy men during the late nineteenth century.<br /> <br /> Deer hunt still occurs in November managed under the NPS. But, unlike the hunts of Mr. McKee's time, hunters are on their own and have to find and move their deer themselves.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Located behind the village and straight ahead from the dock is the North Manitou Island Contact Station, a small one-story structure covered with a red-shingled hip roof. Most of the building's exterior walls are constructed of white-painted masonry with portions of 2 intersecting walls that wrap around one corner faced exclusively with stone. Contained in this building are numerous signs providing information about the island itself and safety information for you to consider during your visit. There is also a table-top raised-relief, or terrain, map showing the contours of North Manitou Island. Situated on one side of the station is an approximately 8-foot-wide entrance opening trimmed with brown-painted casing. A small laminated sign tacked to the casing to the right of the opening reads: \"No backpacks, coolers, stoves in this building.\" You must step up approximately 3 or 4 inches from the ground outside this opening to enter the station, which has a cement floor. The North Manitou Island relief map-with land painted green and water painted blue-will be situated a few feet in front of you. A small information desk is located in an adjacent room, its doorway located a few feet beyond the table. Information on the signs hanging on the wall to your left includes the phone number for Manitou Island Ferry-231-256-9061-and instructions to dial 911 in case of emergency. If when dialing 911, you get Wisconsin's emergency service, tell the operator you are on Michigan's North Manitou Island and they will transfer your call to Michigan's Emergency line. Another sign entitled \"Did You Know Ticks Occur in This Area?\" tells us that black-legged ticks found on the island have tested positive for the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Located below the title is a small color photo showing the black-legged tick in its larval, nymphal, and adult stages. Also pictured is the larger American dog tick, which is also common on the island. The sign notes that the American dog tick may carry harmful bacteria, but it does not transmit Lyme disease. Additional text on the sign provides information regarding the precautions to take to prevent ticks from biting you-such as wearing insect repellant, long pants, closed toe shoes and socks-and how to remove a tick if one should attach to your skin. It is also advised that visitors stay on the trail and that adults should check themselves and children for ticks at the end of the day. For more information, visit the park office or contact your local county health department. Located on the grounds near the contact station are a water fountain, trash and recycling receptacles, and a small wooden building holding 2 vault toilets.",

    "audioDescription": "The North Manitou Island's T-shaped ferry dock is located on the island's central eastern shore, directly east of Lake Manitou. <br />Situated furthest from shore is the top of the T, which has a concrete surface and measures 150 feet long. The stem of the T, or the approximately 10-foot-wide and 85-foot-long dock section that extends over the water to the beach, is surfaced with metal grating. Lining this dock section's 2 sides are the top portions of wooden timber pilings spaced about 20 feet apart. There are no railings or other safety barriers on the dock. <br />As you walk onto the island's sandy shore from the dock, the buildings comprising the island's U. S. Life-Saving Service Complex are situated to your left. The first structure you will encounter is the Hans Halseth house, currently used as a private residence for National Park Service staff.",

In 1859, it was awarded a post office. John Shalda built a gristmill on the Lake Michigan outlet of Shalda creek.<br /> <br /> The North Unity School was built around 1856 of the horizontal log construction that is to traditional the Czechs and Bavarian Germans. The logs were close-fitted so that the top of one rested on the log below it for its full length with only an occasional small gap. The corner notches are interlocking dove-tail joints. The dove-tails were cut with a saw. The school has been restored to its original log appearance.<br /> <br /> The school was located about 1.5 miles south of the center of town, likely to either accommodate farm children dispersed at considerable distances from the shores of the Lake or because of the availability or price of land<br /> The North Unity School is ideally accessed from the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail.<br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The North Unity School, located east of the intersection of Basch Rd. and M-22 and up a hill from the bike path near M-22, is a small log building dating to the original settlement of North Unity. The weathered gray logs forming the structure measure about 10 to 14 inches high, with 9 logs total spanning both the width of the building's facade and each of its two sides. The logs, which have been hewn and therefore form a flat surface, are stacked tightly, without gaps. The building's corner notches consist of large interlocking dove-tail joints. The school's gable roof has a slight overhang, and the wide boards and narrow battens forming the facade's triangular gable itself are positioned vertically. There are 2 multi-paned double hung windows trimmed in similarly weathered wood on each of the building's 2 sides and 2 more windows flanking the single wooden door on its facade. This entrance door-multi-paneled and painted white-opens inward from left to right. There are 2 steps leading into the building.<br />The North Unity School, which is also located just west of Narada Lake, is not on the Driving Tour of Port Oneida as there is no parking or turnaround near the school, nor is there an entrance to the school property. Visitors will need to park on M-22 and walk in.",

Want to explore the landscape of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, exercise, and have fun all at the same time? Join the Trail Trekker Challenge! Earn a prize and bragging rights by successfully completing each of the 13 mainland trails in the National Lakeshore. Hiking is a great way to get daily physical exercise and promote health while also discovering the beauty of the area. What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <h3>Hike Safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> <br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> Please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA) is an invasive insect that poses a new threat to northwest Michigan forests. </strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/hemlock-woolly-adelgid.htm\">Learn more about how to prevent the spread of HWA</a>.<br /> <br /> <strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</strong><br /> Avoid ticks by walking in the center of trails and avoiding contact with vegetation.<br /> Use a repellent (on skin or clothing) and wear close-toed shoes, long sleeves, long pants, and socks. Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to easily spot ticks.<br /> <br /> Check your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, fallen logs, or stone walls.<br /> <br /> <strong>After being outdoors</strong><br /> Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, and remove any ticks you find.<br /> Check your clothing for ticks. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat for at least an hour.<br /> Shower soon after being outdoors; it may reduce your risk of being bitten.<br /> Check these parts of your body and your child's body for ticks:<br /> Under the arm, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, in and around hair, between the legs, around the waist.<br /> <br /> <strong>If you are bitten by a tick</strong><br /> Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it. Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible, and then slowly, but firmly, pull it straight out. Immediately wash the bite area and your hands with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic to the bite wound.<br /> <br /> Watch for signs of illness.</p>",

He later sold this farm to Albert and Ida (Dago) Prause. In 1954, Prause sold the farm to Howard Olsen, a grandson of Ole and a nephew of Charles.

    "audioDescription": "A long dirt driveway leads into Ole Olsen Farm, located at the end of Kelderhouse Road. This farm is also situated about a third of a mile west of the back side of Narada Lake. There are several structures here, including a 2-story farmhouse and a weathered 3-bay barn-both built atop fieldstone foundations-and several smaller wood sheds and animal enclosures. Take care as you walk through the grassy yard surrounding these buildings as you may encounter trees and sections of uneven ground. The farmhouse is clad in white clapboard, and its windows-some rectangular, some square-are trimmed in dark green-painted wood. There are 2 gable roofs sheltering the main dwelling-one covered with green shingles and the other constructed of rusted metal sheeting. A single concrete chimney juts up from the slightly lower metal roof, which meets the shingled roof at a right angle. Leaning against the metal gable roof is a weathered wooden ladder positioned vertically to the left of the chimney. As you approach from the driveway, the free gable end of this lower building section will be facing you.<br />Extending below the metal roof on its left side is a sloping shed roof, also metal, that shelters a small concrete porch extending alongside only a small portion of the lower building section. As you approach from the driveway, the 4 steps leading up to the porch, which is supported by 2 slim green pillars on its open left edge, will be straight in front of you. There are no railings alongside the steps nor on the porch, which stands about 4 feet above the ground below. Although unoccupied, this building is not open to the public. <br />If you chose to walk around the house, note that there is a cylindrical white well pipe measuring about 2 feet high standing a few feet to the left of the house as you pass the porch on your right. Take care also to avoid a sloping white cellar hatchway measuring about 8 feet long jutting outward from the side of the house facing the driveway. Among the animal enclosures situated near the house is an approximately 2-foot-wide by 2-to-4-foot-tall weathered wood structure with a steeply sloping shed roof. Painted in green above a small rectangular opening on the front of the structure is the word \"Shep,\"-s-h-e-p.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Platte Plains, the park's most expansive trail system, spans nearly 15 miles total through low dunes with three main loops to explore and a walk-in campground. It's a perfect place to spend the day: pack a picnic, bring your canoe and fishing poles, tie up your hiking shoes, and enjoy the outdoors with family. The trail is surrounded primarily by pine-oak-aspen woods; open fields and lakes are scattered throughout plains.<br /> <br /> <b>Pets are NOT allowed on trail from December 1 to March 31.</b><br /> <br /> There are a number a trail routes you can take, easy, intermediate and advanced: options for every user. Signs are not posted at every intersection so keep your eye on the map.  <br /> <br /> <b>Otter Creek Loop</b> is a 4.6-mile trail that takes you through the woods around Otter Creek and Otter Lake. The terrain is flat and easy through this section.<br /> <b>Bass Lake Loop</b> is a 3.5-mile trail follows a winding course across gently rolling hills through pine-hardwood forest and passes Bass Lake, Deer Lake, and wetland areas. Enjoy the view and wildlife from the bench at the Bass Lake water access. Look for ripening wintergreen berries along the trail mid-loop in the fall.<br /> <b>Lasso Loop</b> is a 6.3-mile trail with diverse terrain and the most difficult terrain in the plains; aÂ few steep ridges and tight switchbacks can be challenging at times, but it offers the best views of Lake Michigan. Take the more strenuous 1.6-mile round-trip spur at the #5 post past the White Pine Backcountry Campground to a quiet Lake Michigan beach and enjoy one of the finest beach walks in the northern lower peninsula.<br /> Be aware: the mosquitoes can be vicious; make sure to bring repellant.</p> <h3>Ridges and swales</h3> <p>The Platte Plains are not your traditional plains with fields, but it is a lowland area between the Platte River, Otter Lake, and Lake Michigan. A satellite view of Platte Bay reveals the ancient shoreline sand dunes, which mark the successive positions of Lake Michigan after each intrusion of glacial ice melted. These geological landforms are called ridges and swales. From the trails, however, they're steep hills.Â </p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Chalenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year? Want to explore the landscape of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, exercise, and have fun all at the same time? Join the Trail Trekker Challenge! Earn a prize and bragging rights by successfully completing each of the 13 mainland trails in the National Lakeshore. Hiking is a great way to get daily physical exercise and promote health while also discovering the beauty of the area. What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> <br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <h3>Hike Safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</strong><br /> Avoid ticks by walking in the center of trails and avoiding contact with vegetation.<br /> Use a repellent (on skin or clothing) and wear close-toed shoes, long sleeves, long pants, and socks.<br /> Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to easily spot ticks.<br /> Check your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, fallen logs, or stone walls.<br /> <br /> <strong>After being outdoors</strong><br /> Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, and remove any ticks you find.<br /> Check your clothing for ticks. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat for at least an hour.<br /> Shower soon after being outdoors; it may reduce your risk of being bitten.<br /> <br /> <strong>Check these parts of your body and your child's body for ticks:</strong><br /> Under the arm, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, in and around hair, between the legs, around the waist.<br /> <br /> <strong>If you are bitten by a tick</strong><br /> Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it. Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible, and then slowly, but firmly, pull it straight out. Immediately wash the bite area and your hands with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic to the bite wound.<br /> <br /> Watch for signs of illness.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Otter Lake, so-named for the otters who populate the lake and the wetlands along its coast, is the largest and northernmost lake of the Platte Plains area lakes. It is surrounded by a maple-beech and pine forest. You may reach Otter Lake by either turning down Trail's End Road off M-22 about 5 miles south of Empire or by taking Esch Road and hiking along Otter Creek up to the lake. Surrounding the lake is a 4.6-mile hiking trail. This is the Otter Creek Loop of the Platte Plains trail. At Otter Lake you will find opportunities for fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. There is no dock here, but you may slide your canoe or kayak into the water from the shore. A swath of tall grass juts up from the water a few feet offshore. Located to both your left and right are small coves, or recesses in the lake's uneven shoreline. There are no restrooms at Otter Lake, but there are vault toilets at Bass Lake and Esch Road Beach. Motorized boats are not allowed on Otter Lake.",

    "audioDescription": "A wayside panel stands near the covered bridge. This panel, entitled with the quotation \"...a perfect setting for a Perfect Day,\" features a large map drawing of the scenic drive, which appears to the left, or west, of Glen Lake. Text below the title tells us: Pierce Stocking (1908-1976) wanted to preserve this area's natural beauty. In the early 1960s, the local lumberman began envisioning \"a haven of rest\" called Sleeping Bear Dunes Park. It opened to the public in 1967. For just $2.75 per vehicle, visitors could drive a fourteen-mile scenic roadway, relax at picnic areas, and delight in spectacular views of Lake Michigan, Glen Lake, and the sand dunes. When Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore purchased Stocking's park in 1976, they renamed it Philip Hart Nature Trail after the U.S. Senator from Michigan who fought to establish the Lakeshore six years earlier. Staff considered removing the scenic drive to protect the fragile dunes. Ultimately, they realized what Stocking had: if you want people to love this earth enough to conserve it, they also have to be able to enjoy it. So the drive remained, and the Lakeshore renamed it in honor of Stocking and his resolve to preserve this place for future generations. This map contrasts the loop you're driving on today (blue) with Stocking's original route (orange). Pictured below this text in the panel's bottom left corner is a color photo of a stocky man, his shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows, standing beside a black dog. A caption accompanying the photo reads: Pierce Stocking worked at a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in Cadillac, Michigan during the Great Depression. The skills he acquired there helped him construct this drive. What do you think this area would look like today without Stocking's efforts? Appearing in a horizontal line to the right of this photo are 4 smaller photos with text, all falling under the general title \"Evolution of a National Treasure.\" Text accompanying the photo on the left, entitled \"Great Lakes Gardens,\" tells us:<br />The drive's original entrance, the Great Lakes Gardens, showcased rose bushes, hiking trails, and ponds in the shape of all five Great Lakes. Text below the second photo, entitled \" A Very Steep Hill,\" explains:<br />From the gardens, Stocking's drive curved up the dune face to Picnic Mountain. Cars stalled; transmissions failed. This ascent was soon dubbed \"Suicide Hill.\" The text accompanying the next photo, entitled \"Porcupine Damage,\" reads:<br />The Lakeshore rebuilt Stocking's covered bridge in 1986 in order to accommodate taller vehicles and to repair damage done by munching porcupines. The last block of text, entitled \"Road Revisions,\" explains:<br />To prevent erosion of the dunes, the Lakeshore moved the drive's entrance; closed segments (orange); and rerouted the drive into a one-way loop (blue). Running along the length of the panel's bottom edge is a timeline beginning with 1960 on the far left and ending with 2016 on the far right. It is noted that in 2011, Good Morning America named the Lakeshore \"The Most Beautiful Place in America.\" Section 3 (182 words)<br />Affixed at an angle to the top of a wooden base located near the wayside panel is a small metal plaque with a verdigris, or bluish-green patina. Appearing in raised letters at the top of the plague is the title \"Pierce Stocking, 1908 through 1976.\" Text below the title reads: Pierce Stocking, a native of northern lower Michigan, worked as a lumberman and spent much of his leisure time in the woods. He wanted to share his love of nature with others and conceived the idea of constructing a scenic drive onto the Sleeping Bear Dunes. He envisioned people of all ages and degrees of physical fitness experiencing the sand dunes and the bluffs overlooking Lake Michigan. At the same time, he hoped to protect the fragile dunes and woods from excessive human use by concentrating activity along the road and at scenic overlooks and picnic areas. In 1967, Pierce Stocking fulfilled his dream with the opening of the scenic drive to the public. The drive was operated privately until 1977 when it became a part of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.",

The wind action alone can dry out plants, expose root systems, or even completely bury vegetation, including trees.<br /> <br /> The cottonwood is the only common tree of the dunes and is well adapted to the dune environment. Because it grows fast, the tree can keep pace with burial by sand. Cottonwood trees grow in a cluster. They reproduce by cloning, sprouting new trunks from roots. The network of roots helps to hold the sand in place, and the tree itself acts as a windbreak, stabilizing the dunes. The dense root networks of various grasses also hold the sand in place. Once the dune is stabilized, new plants can begin growing on it, plants which are not able to survive on an active dune. Common juniper, the evergreen shrub growing among the grasses, is one of the typical plants of stabilized dunes.<br /> <br /> The dunes cover just a small area because they depend on strong winds off Lake Michigan to exist. The active dune zone extends for only about a mile from the lake. Further inland, the wind loses its energy and can no longer build dunes.<br /> The basswood tree across the road is a good example of the contest between trees and vegetation and the wind. Wind action has been threatening the tree's stability. If you were that tree, how much longer do you think you could keep your balance and stay standing?<br /> <br /> As you continue on to the Lake Michigan Overlook, notice the startling contrast between the open, sunny environment of the dunes and the lush, shady world of the beech-maple forest. Sugar maples and American beech are the predominant trees, but non-native insects and diseases are having a devastating effect on these forests. Beech bark disease is killing the beach trees, emerald ash borer, the ash trees. Most of these non-native pests are moved into the Lakeshore by hitching a ride on firewood. Help up protect the forest by leaving your firewood at home!</p>",
    "audioDescription": "As you leave the dunes area and step into the site's maple-beech forest, you will encounter a basswood tree located on your left. This tree is located across the street from a pullout on the right. The rough bark on both the tree's trunk and its wide-stretching limbs has a mottled dark gray surface. Twisted around one another and extending outward several feet just above and along the sandy ground surrounding the basswood's trunk are a series of gnarled branches and exposed roots. Take care as you approach the tree, as these branches and roots may present a tripping hazard.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Wow! Standing in the middle of an approximately four square-mile area called the Sleeping Bear Dunes complex, the panoramic vista from the Dune Overlook includes Glen Lake and its surrounding rolling hills, the historic, privately owned D. H. Day farm with the huge white barn, the spectacular landscape of the Sleeping Bear Dunes, and a dramatic glimpse of Lake Michigan, Sleeping Bear Bay, Pyramid Point, the Manitou Passage, and both North and South Manitou Islands. There's a lot to take in!<br /> <br /> Here on this plateau, you are at the eastern edge of the sand dunes, standing on top of one of the tallest dunes, 200 feet high. Perched dunes and plant life flourish on this harsh landscape. These dunes are called \"perched\" because they are sitting on top of glacial moraine bluffs made of sand and gravel. Prevailing westerly winds blow the sand out of the moraine and deposit it on top of the bluff. In some places the dune fronts advance a few feet per year, while in other places the dunes are stabilized by plants and don't move at all.<br /> <br /> Please stay off the dunes in this area. The dunes are a fragile environment, and hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to grow back.<br /> <br /> <br /> <b>From the Dune Overlook, you can see </b><br /> Pyramid point 8 miles to the northeast<br /> Much of Big Glen Lake with Alligator Hill behind it<br /> The D.H. Day Farm's large white buildings 1.25 miles to the northeast backed by wooded dunes The tops of some of the dunes near the Dune Climb which can be explored on the Cottonwood Trail and the Dune Climb Trail<br /> North Manitou Island, about 12.5 miles to the northeast.<br /> The horizon, about 24 miles distant<br /> The Sun, about 93,000,000 miles away.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Leading from the sidewalk running alongside Dune Overlook is a wide wooden ramp, slanting slightly uphill, that opens onto the top level of a 2-level deck. The wooden deck, which holds 6-foot-long benches placed along its side edges, is surrounded by an approximately 3 1/2-foot-high safety railing. The deck ramp is also flanked by railings on both sides. Directly in front of you as you stand at the edge of the deck is a large sandy area without vegetation, otherwise known as a \"blowout.\" Beyond this windswept area are perched dunes dotted with native grasses and other plants. This overlook is located on the eastern edge of the dunes. The Dune Overlook offers a panoramic view, from left to right, of Lake Michigan, South Manitou Island, North Manitou Island, Pyramid Point, Alligator Hill, and Glen Lake. Also visible in the distance is the historic D.H. Day farm, most notably the farm's large white barn with dark roof.",

This is why you came to the dunes, isn't it? The overlook opens to a myriad of blues from shore to horizon, to glorious sunsets, and brilliant night skies. A popular stop, you'll find lots of people, but there's plenty of room for everyone.<br /> <br /> From the platform, about 450 feet above the lake, if the visibility is good, you will see South Manitou Island ten miles to the northwest; Empire Bluffs four miles to the south; and Platte Bay beyond that. Still further south is Point Betsie, the farthest point of land you can see, 15 miles away as the crow flies. Wisconsin is 54 miles due west, but thanks to the curvature of the earth, you will not see any \"cheeseheads\" waving back at you! Lake Michigan is the largest lake completely within the United States and is the fourth largest fresh-water lake in the world.<br /> <br /> The bluff has been wearing back at the rate of about a foot per year. Waves wear away the base the bluff and sand and rocks from above slide down to the beach. This process has gone on for many years, so we can infer that this hill once extended much further out into the lake. The shallow waters offshore also seem to indicate that a peninsula once extended from here about 2 miles out into the lake. This means that the site of this overlook used to be inland protected from the strong winds off the lake.<br /> <br /> The vast majority of visitors take in the view from atop the bluff and don't risk erosion, injury, and rescue fees by going down-not to mention the hour or two it can take to climb up!<br /> <br /> Take your time, your camera, and a deep breath. Spend some time at the waysides. Learn about the legend and perhaps an Anishinaabek word or two, the migration of the mother bear, and treacherous seas.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A paved path through a section of maple-beech forest leads to the wooden boardwalk that is the approach to Lake Michigan Overlook. This boardwalk winds upward and then downward through sand to a ramp offering a final descent to the overlook's observation deck. The deck is positioned atop a steep bluff that descends to the lake's shoreline 450 feet below. The boardwalk leading to the observation deck's long approach ramp is flush with the sand and without railings. The last leg of this boardwalk slopes downward as it meets the steep ramp, which continues sloping downward, without steps. Both the ramp and deck have 4-foot-high safety railings on all sides. The rectangular area forming the deck is flat, positioned directly above Lake Michigan's shoreline. There is a wooden bench with a back and arms located alongside the boardwalk on your right as you approach the observation deck and another bench placed along the paved path where the 2 paths join.<br />Although much of the bluff is made of a mixture of sand, gravel, and rocks, sparse native plants-grasses and low bushes- are also present. On a clear day, this overlook offers visitors a wide view that includes, to the left, or south, Empire Bluffs and Platte Point, and to the right, or north, South Manitou Island. A small sign affixed atop a wooden pole located to the right of the boardwalk entrance reads: \"Warning. Sand Slide Area. Steep Bluffs. Stay on Trail.\" Affixed to the pole below the sign is a laminated paper sheet entitled \"Sleeping Bear Dunes: Have a Safe Visit. Lake Michigan Overlook number 9.\" Additional information listed as bullet points reads: The National Park Service recommends that you do not attempt to climb down the dune in Lake Michigan. Climbing this dune causes erosion and impacts the dune ecosystem. Every year, people have to be rescued; some of them are seriously ill or injured. Rescue could take hours, cost you several thousand dollars, and put rescuers at risk of injury. It is best to enjoy the view from the top! One last sentence appearing in red lettering above an image of the black, white, and yellow National Park Service Search & Rescue emblem reads: Be Prepared and Stay Safe! Text on a second sign located alongside the boardwalk as you near the deck ramp issues one final warning: Enjoy the view from here. Don't risk injury and rescue fees by going down or the 2 hours it may take to climb back up!",

It is one of the few lakes in the region that has an open channel to Lake Michigan.<br /> <br /> North Bar Lake is ideal for swimming in the summer. It is warmer than Lake Michigan because it is smaller and the sun can warm it up more quickly, and it is surrounded by pure sandy beaches.

    "audioDescription": "The Picnic Mountain picnic area is located just southeast of Dune Overlook. This partly shaded picnic spot, which is well within walking distance of the overlook, offers several metal picnic tables with attached benches and small grills for cooking. There are 2 full restrooms and 2 drinking fountains located here as well. Most of the picnic tables are situated on a large grassy area that is slightly uphill from the parking area. Take care as you approach the tables as you will need to navigate around a number of trees and a large tree stump-about 8 inches high and 3 feet wide with sprawling exposed roots-as well as a drinking fountain placed atop a concrete pillar about 3½ feet high. Three of the 5 picnic tables stand atop low wood floors measuring approximately 1-inch high. The remaining 2 tables are wheelchair accessible. The small building holding the 2 restrooms is located at the end of a short sidewalk that runs perpendicular to the sidewalk bordering the parking area. A sign affixed to the building facade indicates the door to the women's restroom is around the building to the left and the door to the men's restroom is around the building to the right. The site's second drinking fountain is located straight ahead of you, just in front of the building as you approach it from the parking area. Take care to avoid a series of small stones and larger rocks placed in the grass to the sides of the drinking fountain and alongside the sidewalk as it wraps around the building. There is one wheelchair accessible table and grill provided at this picnic area, located in a concrete space just off the sidewalk bordering the parking area. As you face the concrete picnic space, which measures about 14 feet wide by 20 feet deep, the table with attached benches is arranged lengthwise across the width of the area's left half. You may position your wheelchair at the table's right end; take care to avoid the approximately 3-foot-high grill, which will be about 3 feet behind you as you sit at the table. Note that this picnic area is flanked on both sides by low wood curbs. The top of the low wood retaining wall at the back of this area is level with the grassy picnic area beyond. There are 2 brown recycling and trash receptacles located a few feet to the right of the accessible picnic area. The receptacles are approximately 3 1/2 feet tall with top surfaces that slope downward from top to bottom, or toward the edge closest to you. The first receptacle you encounter is for \"mixed recycling,\" and has one lid. The wider trash receptacle to the right of the recycling receptacle has 2 lids. The latches on all 3 lids are located about 4 inches up from the receptacles' front edges; pull up on the latches to open the lids, which are hinged at the top. Take care to avoid the 4 metal feet-2 per receptacle-that jut out to the edge of the sidewalk.",

    "audioDescription": "This panel, entitled \"The Legend of the Manitou Islands and the Sleeping Bear,\" features a large color drawing of 3 dark bears-1 adult and 2 cubs-stepping from a sandy lakeshore into pale blue water. Text below the wayside's title tells us: Once, long ago, in the land called Wisconsin across the great lake, there was terrible hunger and many people died. A bear and two little cubs were trying to leave that place and come around the lake where there would be more food. They walked for many days on the beach together, but after a while the two little cubs began to whimper with hunger and so the bear decided to swim across the rest of the lake. They waded into the water, one cub on each side of the bear, and they swam off into the lake a long way. After a while the cubs began to get very tired, and so the bear said, Try hard, the land is not very far.' And very soon they did come in sight of land. But gradually the cubs got weaker, and only ten miles away, one cub sank into the water. Soon after the other also drowned. The bear's heart was broken, but she could do nothing. She waded ashore and lay down, looking out on the water where her cubs had died. Eventually, both of them came to the surface as two little islands, and so the bear still lies there atop the dunes, looking after her children. To the right of this text is another smaller title: \"Speak Anishinaabemowin.\" Text below this title tells us: The Anishinaabek told parables like this one to teach cultural values. They shared these teachings in the winter around their wigwam fires. For a people dependent on harvesting their own food, famine was the great fear. The choice the bear, or makwa, had to make between starvation or a perilous journey would've been familiar to all. Below this text is a short excerpt from this parable-written in both English, which appears in black lettering, and Anishinaabemowin, which appears in red. This parable echoes the legend presented in the first section of audio description for this panel.",

Eventually you're growing crops, decorating pottery, and boiling sugar from maple sap at camps on Glen Lake. In time, Europeans arrive and wars break out over furs. Your descendents-the Anishinaabek-form a Confederacy of Three Fires: the Odawa and Ojibwe of the upper Great Lakes and the Potawatomi further south. In 1836, with sadness in their hearts, they sign a treaty, allowing Euro-Americans to occupy the land.

The map is split into 4 vertical sections marked in a timeline extending across the top of the panel, from left to right, as \"retreat of the glaciers,\" \"archaic period,\" \"woodland period,\" and, lastly, \"European contact.\" The archaic period is the longest of these timespans, and the \"European contact\" period is the shortest, only about 1/30th the length of the archaic period. Text below the wayside's title, appearing in the panel's bottom left quadrant, reads: Imagine you're the first person to ever take in this view. It's 8,000 years ago. The glaciers have melted; dense forests are growing back. You live lightly on this ground. You hunt, fish, and gather other harvests from the land and lakes. Traders arrive with flint, copper, and ideas. Eventually you're growing crops, decorating pottery, and boiling sugar from maple sap at camps on Glen Lake. In time, Europeans arrive and wars break out over furs. Your descendants-the Anishinaabek-form a Confederacy of Three Fires: the Odawa and Ojibwe of the upper Great Lakes and the Potawatomi further south. In 1836, with sadness in their hearts, they sign a treaty, allowing Euro-Americans to occupy the land. Yet, unlike other tribes, your kin tenaciously resist removal and remain a vibrant part of northern Michigan today. Located in the panel's bottom right corner is more text, entitled \"From Steamships to Automobiles,\" that reads: See that white barn in the distance? D. H. Day built that farm, but he always lived in Glen Haven where he could hear the whistle of boats as they approached his dock. This was the Great Lake frontier and Lake Michigan was the highway. Getting here by car wasn't easy until M-109 was finished in 1929.",

    "audioDescription": "This panel, entitled \"The Legend of the Manitou Islands and the Sleeping Bear,\" features a large color drawing of 3 dark bears-1 adult and 2 cubs-stepping from a sandy lakeshore into pale blue water. Text below the wayside's title tells us: Once, long ago, in the land called Wisconsin across the great lake, there was terrible hunger and many people died. A bear and two little cubs were trying to leave that place and come around the lake where there would be more food. They walked for many days on the beach together, but after a while the two little cubs began to whimper with hunger and so the bear decided to swim across the rest of the lake. They waded into the water, one cub on each side of the bear, and they swam off into the lake a long way. After a while the cubs began to get very tired, and so the bear said, 'Try hard, the land is not very far.' And very soon they did come in sight of land. But gradually the cubs got weaker, and only ten miles away, one cub sank into the water. Soon after the other also drowned. The bear's heart was broken, but she could do nothing. She waded ashore and lay down, looking out on the water where her cubs had died. Eventually, both of them came to the surface as two little islands, and so the bear still lies there atop the dunes, looking after her children. To the right of this text is another smaller title: \"Speak Anishinaabemowin.\" Text below this title tells us: The Anishinaabek told parables like this one to teach cultural values. They shared these teachings in the winter around their wigwam fires. For a people dependent on harvesting their own food, famine was the great fear. The choice the bear, or makwa, had to make between starvation or a perilous journey would've been familiar to all. Below this text is a short excerpt from this parable-written in both English, which appears in black lettering, and Anishinaabemowin, which appears in red. This parable echoes the legend presented in the first section of audio description for this panel.",

    "audioDescription": "Located along the first leg of the one-way loop making up Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive is an approximately 13-foot-long covered bridge with a gable roof. This bridge, which is the first numbered stop along the drive, is constructed of reddish-brown vertical wooden planks. Affixed to the face of the triangular gable located just below the roof's peak is the arrow-shaped sign representing the National Park Service emblem. This version of the emblem includes the words \"Department of the Interior,\" which appear in white at the bottom of the sign. Flanking the road passing under the bridge, and extending several feet beyond the bridge on both ends, are two low wooden guardrails. A pull-off area found just past the bridge offers a spot from where you may both view and photograph the bridge. Note that the covered bridge can be accessed by car, foot, or bicycle. The vehicle clearance under the bridge is 13½ feet. Next draw your attention to a wayside panel standing near the bridge. This panel, entitled with the quotation \"...a perfect setting for a Perfect Day,\" features a large map drawing of the scenic drive, which appears to the left, or west, of Glen Lake.

So the drive remained, and the Lakeshore renamed it in honor of Stocking and his resolve to preserve this place for future generations.This map contrasts the loop you're driving on today (blue) with Stocking's original route (orange).Pictured below this text in the panel's bottom left corner is a color photo of a stocky man, his shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows, standing beside a black dog. A caption accompanying the photo reads: Pierce Stocking worked at a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in Cadillac, Michigan during the Great Depression. The skills he acquired there helped him construct this drive. What do you think this area would look like today without Stocking's efforts?Appearing in a horizontal line to the right of this photo are 4 smaller photos with text, all falling under the general title \"Evolution of a National Treasure.\"Text accompanying the photo on the left, entitled \"Great Lakes Gardens,\" tells us:The drive's original entrance, the Great Lakes Gardens, showcased rose bushes, hiking trails, and ponds in the shape of all five Great Lakes.Text below the second photo, entitled \" A Very Steep Hill,\" explains:From the gardens, Stocking's drive curved up the dune face to Picnic Mountain. Cars stalled; transmissions failed. This ascent was soon dubbed \"Suicide Hill.\"The text accompanying the next photo, entitled \"Porcupine Damage,\" reads:The Lakeshore rebuilt Stocking's covered bridge in 1986 in order to accommodate taller vehicles and to repair damage done by munching porcupines.The last block of text, entitled \"Road Revisions,\" explains:To prevent erosion of the dunes, the Lakeshore moved the drive's entrance; closed segments (orange); and rerouted the drive into a one-way loop (blue).Running along the length of the panel's bottom edge is a timeline beginning with 1960 on the far left and ending with 2016 on the far right. It is noted that in 2011, Good Morning America named the Lakeshore \"The Most Beautiful Place in America.\" Affixed at an angle to the top of a wooden base located near the wayside panel is a small metal plaque with a verdigris, or bluish-green patina. Appearing in raised letters at the top of the plague is the title \"Pierce Stocking, 1908 through 1976.\" Text below the title reads:Pierce Stocking, a native of northern lower Michigan, worked as a lumberman and spent much of his leisure time in the woods. He wanted to share his love of nature with others and conceived the idea of constructing a scenic drive onto the Sleeping Bear Dunes. He envisioned people of all ages and degrees of physical fitness experiencing the sand dunes and the bluffs overlooking Lake Michigan. At the same time, he hoped to protect the fragile dunes and woods from excessive human use by concentrating activity along the road and at scenic overlooks and picnic areas.In 1967, Pierce Stocking fulfilled his dream with the opening of the scenic drive to",

    "audioDescription": "Peter Burfiend Farm is located on the west side of Basch Road just north of M-22. Built by the son of Carsten Burfiend, this farm features a 2-story white clapboard farmhouse with a stone foundation built in the early 1890s and a handful of outbuildings dating to 1900. The 2-story wing on the farmhouse facade's right side has 4 rectangular windows, 2 placed above the other, and a small circular window located just below the center peak of the structure's gray-shingled gable roof. Circling this gable window and jutting out from the face of the building is a section of wooden trim with a crenulated, or notched outer edge. On the facade's left side is another 2-story wing, offset a few feet behind the first wing and covered by a side-facing gable roof with a brick chimney jutting out of its center. A small square window located just below the roofline sits directly above the hip roof sheltering the building's concrete porch, which extends left from the right-side wing. A single concrete step located on the porch's right-most end leads up to the building's entrance door, flanked by 2 rectangular windows to its left. The porch roof is supported by 3 thin pillars positioned on the porch's outer edge, which is situated several inches above the grassy lawn. There are no railings. Outbuildings located in the fields surrounding the house include a weathered gray chicken coop, a small red-painted building with a tractor shed attached at one end, and a tall white clapboard granary building with a gray gable roof.",

Please review the pets in the park page for the most up-to-date information about areas closed to pets.<br /> <strong>https://go.nps.gov/slbepets</strong><br /> <br /> This Lake Michigan beach at the end of Peterson Road is one of the most beautiful and secluded beaches in the Lakeshore. This relaxing, less-crowded beach is a great place to hide out on a hot summer afternoon. Nestle in the deep sand behind a thicket of beach grass, listen to the waves rolling in, and just let go.<br /> <br /> Peterson beach offers vistas of the bluffs along Sleeping Bear Point and Empire Bluff. To the south is Platte River Point. On a clear day, you can also see South Manitou Island.<br /> <br /> Limited parking is available at the end of Peterson Rd and along the roadside. A boardwalk crosses the low dunes from the parking lot to the beach.</p> <h3>Enjoy the Beach safely</h3> <p>**Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!**<br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> **Beach fires**<br /> Roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over glowing coals while watching the sun go down over the lake is a perfect ending to a fun day at the beach. Beach fire are allowed on our mainland Lake Michigan beaches between the water's edge and where the dunes begin, and away from any vegetation. Make sure you use firewood from park approved vendors to help us protect our forests from pest and disease. And be sure to extinguish all beach fires with water. DO NOT bury fires-hidden embers could burn unsuspecting bare feet!<br /> <br /> **Take care around plover nesting area**<br /> Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the piping plover, a threatened species that breeds here in the spring. Piping plovers find the cobbled beaches of Sleeping Bear Dunes an ideal place to find mates, nest, and raise their young. To protect the plovers and their nests, some parts of the beach may be temporarily closed to visitors and pets. Please help us protect these special birds by keeping dogs on a leash and obeying all beach closure signs.<br /> <br /> **Step around the Pitcher's thistle**<br /> Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcher) blooms only once when the plant is seven years old. This native thistle grows only on the shorelines or sand dunes of the Great Lakes and is common in the Lakeshore. It is a threatened species: it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.<br /> <br /> Walking through foredunes on your way to the beach may trample and kill these plants before they can reproduce. So please watch out for the Pitcher's thistle: stay on the wooden walkways and established trails.<br /> <br /> **Swim safe**<br /> The Lakeshore's pristine beaches are ideal for swimming, but forceful waves and rip currents can turn a fun visit into a frightening one. Use caution when swimming alone and take special precautions with children: keep a close watch on all children, stay within arm's reach, and be sure they are wearing a life jacket.<br /> <br /> **Be alert for rip currents**<br /> Although they are not common in the Lakeshore, rip currents are dangerous and can occur at any beach with breaking waves.<br /> Lake Michigan conditions can change quickly. Know what to expect before you go in the water. Monitor the weather and check out the swim risk level for the beach you plan to visit. Read more in Safety.<br /> <br /> **Paddle safe**<br /> Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.</p> <h3>Lake Michigan Pirates: Roaring Dan Seavey</h3> <p>Lake Michigan's eastern shoreline is a paradise treasured by tourists and recreationists. But during the periods of western expansion, the upper Great Lakes region was a very dangerous place. Up until the mid-1800s, a wild west mentality ruled the Great Lakes. The lakes were a source for all kinds of smuggling, poaching, and piracy. Pirates sailed the waters stealing beaver pelts, timber, and sometimes entire ships. One notable pirate was Roaring Dan Seavey, a man that would sail out into the lakes and plunder wherever and whatever he could.<br /> <br /> Seavey and a small crew would silently slip his schooner, the Wanderer, with no running lights, into ports in the dead of night and make off with anything on wharves, in unlocked warehouses, or on nearby streets-cattle, hay, leather goods, fruit--anything of value and could be carried on the schooner.<br /> <br /> Known for his monumental acts of drinking, brawling, whoring, poaching, and stealing, Seavey also practiced moon cussing: a pirate trick of rearranging or removing or putting up fake port lights so that ships coming in would crash on the rocks. Then, his crew would board the ship and steal the cargo. He earned most of his money from poaching venison and stealing. He also ran an offshore casino and brothel.<br /> <br /> Seavey's biggest heist was stealing the 40-ft schooner Nellie Johnson in Grand Haven, Michigan. As the story goes, he gained the trust of the Nellie Johnson's crew and captain and came aboard with booze and drank them all under the table. When the crew was passed out, he and his crew removed them from the schooner and set sail for Chicago to sell the cedar posts onboard. Unable to sell anything and being discovered as a pirate, Seaver took the Nellie Johnson and fled up the coast of Lake Michigan. He eluded federal authorities for two weeks but was captured near Frankfort. He was taken back to Chicago where he claimed he won the ship in a poker game. The ship's real captain never showed up, so charges were dropped and he was set free.<br /> <br /> The only man ever formally charged with piracy on the Great Lakes, Seavey eventually was deputized as a U.S. Marshall and tasked with curbing poaching and robbery on Lake Michigan.<br /> <br /> Pirates in our region were tough, but they were practical too. They wore knitted wool caps and mittens and sweaters. When the lakes iced over, the sweater-wearing pirates would head home until May.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Peterson Beach is a Lake Michigan beach located at the end of Peterson Road in the southern part of the park near the intersection of M-22 and Deadstream Road. Situated south of Esch Beach, the Peterson Road Beach offers a wide, flat swath of white sand with wide vistas of Empire Bluff to the north and Platte River Point to the south. On a clear day, South Manitou Island may also be visible. Peterson Road is a gravel road that leads through the woods for about a mile to a small parking area with vault toilet facilities. A sandy pathway-one short section of it covered with a wooden boardwalk-winds through the low dunes separating the parking area from the beach. The boardwalk is level with the surrounding dunes- which are dotted with grass and other low vegetation-and there are no railings. It is about 540 feet, or 1/10th of a mile, from the parking lot to the beach. Please note that the toilet facilities in the Peterson Beach parking area are open between Memorial Day and Labor Day only. As spots in the parking area are limited, parking is allowed along Peterson Road as well.",

Hart?</h3> <p>Philip A. Hart was a U.S. Senator representing Michigan from 1959 - 1976. He was born in Bryn Mawr, PA in 1912. He graduated from Georgetown University in Washington, DC in 1934 and from the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor in 1937 and was admitted to the Michigan Bar in 1938.<br /> <br /> During World War II he served in the U.S. Army from 1941 until discharged in 1946 as a lieutenant colonel and was wounded during the D-Day assault on Utah Beach in Normandy.<br /> <br /> He served as Michigan Lieutenant Governor 1955 - 1958 and was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1958. He served until his death on December 26, 1976. The third Senate Office Building was named for Senator Hart in 1987.<br /> <br /> Senator Hart was instrumental in the establishment of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Through his tireless efforts, the legislature of the United States of America saw fit to protect the magnificent Sleeping Bear Dunes area in perpetuity.<br /> <br /> \"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That (a) the Congress finds that certain outstanding natural features, including forests, beaches, dune formations and ancient glacial phenomena, exist along the mainland shore of Lake Michigan and on certain nearby islands...and that such features ought to be preserved in their natural setting and protected from developments and uses which would destroy the scenic beauty and natural character of the area.\"</p> <h4><strong>The visitor center is a one stop shop to plan like a Park Ranger for a safe and enjoyable trip.</strong></h4>",
    "audioDescription": "A wide concrete walkway leads to the Philip A. Hart Visitor Center, located on M-72 just east of the intersection with M-22 in Empire, Michigan. This center serves as the park headquarters for the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Here you can learn about the many features and facilities available at the park, as well as experience exhibits, an Eastern National bookstore, and a short multimedia presentation introducing visitors to the Sleeping Bear Dunes. The center is open year-round.The building housing the center is a one-story structure with 2 long wings stretching left and right from a square central tower rising about 50 feet-or approximately 5 stories-above the center's entrance. The entire building is clad in weathered gray clapboard. A series of single white-trimmed windows line the facade of the wings, and there are two similar windows positioned one above the other on the front of the tower. Encircling the tower just below its roofline are several clerestory windows; these windows emit daylight into the upper part of the center's high-ceilinged lobby.A large sign with the words \"Philip A. Hart Visitor Center\" stands in front of a flagpole located to the right of the walkway leading to the building. Also affixed to the sign is a smaller arrowhead-shaped sign with the words \"National Park Service\" appearing in white letters against the sign's rust-colored background. To the left of the letters is the image of a single green sequoia tree; below the letters is a snow-covered mountaintop. Also appearing in white below the tree and mountaintop is the silhouette of a lone bison. This sign represents the National Park Service emblem.A shallow gable roof shades the double glass doors at the building's entrance. These doors open outward and can be opened either manually or by pressing a gray metal wheelchair button-about 4 inches square-located near the top of an approximately 3-foot-tall metal pillar placed to the right of the right-side door. Also flanking the doors are metal safety railings of the same approximate height. The sidewalk leading to the entrance is flat, without steps. A sign affixed to the building to the right of the doors reads: \"Philip A. Hart Visitor Center. Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Open 8 AM to 6 PM. Backpacks, food, and pets must remain outside.\" Just to the right of the metal pillar with the wheelchair button is a lidded recycling receptacle and, standing about 3 feet to the right of this receptacle, an approximately 3-foot-tall cigarette butt disposal container. The pillar-like container stands on the left side of a wooden walkway with a wide U-shaped bench situated on the side closest to the building. This walkway serves as a wheelchair-accessible ramp leading from the building's paved parking area.Located alongside the wooden walkway across from the bench is a structure holding informational signs. One sign includes a color map of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and this list of \"things to do\" at the park: Travel the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive by car, skis or snowshoes.Climb the Dune Climb.Visit Glen Haven Historic Village.Stop at the Visitor Center at Empire.Ride passenger ferries to the Manitou Islands.Hike, ski or snowshoe a trail.Float the Platte or Crystal River.Attend a ranger-led program. And lastly, Ask at the Visitor Center, or any park ranger, for details about these and other activities.A key found on the map's lower left side indicates the location of various features including ranger stations, picnic areas, campgrounds, and trailheads. Located across the driveways in front of the Visitor Center are several picnic tables placed among the trees.As you step inside the center, you will encounter underfoot a mat with rubber edging placed in front of the doors. The rest of the lobby floor is tiled. The information desk is located about 50 feet to the left as you enter the center through the double doors. Here you may obtain park passes, brochures, and maps. Park brochures are available in Braille.Restrooms are located in a narrow vestibule to your right. From the top right corner of the entrance mat, turn right 90 degrees and step forward about 20 feet to reach the open doorway to the vestibule, which stretches left and right. A sign on the vestibule wall located about 3 feet in front of you indicates the women's restroom to the left and the men's restroom to the right. This vestibule is carpeted, with small additional mats placed in front of each door. Take care to avoid a long rectangular electric baseboard heater situated at the bottom of the wall as you step forward into the vestibule.A drinking fountain is located in a small square foyer located in the center's back right corner about 80 feet from the main entrance's double doors. The fountain is situated 6 feet forward on the left as you step into this foyer. The center's restrooms and the water fountain are wheelchair accessible.",

Take a moment along the way to enjoy a picnic, take a walk, or just linger in the sunshine.<br /> <br /> Stopping at all twelve points on the 7.4-mile Scenic Drive will take about two hours. <br /> <br /> The parking lot inside the Scenic Drive entrance serves hikers, bikers, and skiers as the Pierce Stocking Trailhead for the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail and as the Shauger Hill trail trailhead.<br />  </p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p><b>Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive</b> offers a 7.4 mile loop with beautiful views of Lake Michigan, the Glen Lakes, and the dunes, much of which can be appreciated through the vehicle windows.

Wandering children, stopped vehicles, distracted drivers and pedestrians, when combined with our inattention, can quickly turn an enjoyable drive into a series of serious problems.<br />  </p> <h2>A Note to Bicyclists</h2> <p>The scenic drive is a challenging bicycle tour with some steep uphill and downhill grades. Consider your ability before starting. Ride single file, stay to the right, obey the posted speed limit, keep your bicycle under control on the downhill sections, and watch for vehicles entering exiting the scenic overlooks. Remember: Motorists often have difficulty seeing cyclists. Ride defensively.</p> <h2>Who Was Pierce Stocking?</h2> Pierce Stocking spent his youth working as a lumberman in Michigan's forests. He loved the woods and spent most of his spare time there, developing a self-taught knowledge of nature.<br /> <br /> He used to walk the bluffs above Lake Michigan, awed by the views of the dunes, Lake Michigan, and the islands. He wanted to share this beauty with others and conceived the idea of a road to the top of the dunes.<br /> <br /> As a lumberman, he had built roads in difficult terrain before. The planning for the road began in the early 1960s, and in 1967, the road, then known as the Sleeping Bear Dunes Park, first opened to the public.<br /> <br /> Stocking continued to operate the scenic drive until his death in 1976. In 1977, the road became part of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Several years later, based on public opinion, the drive was named the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive.",
    "audioDescription": "Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive is a 7.4-mile paved route with 12-marked stops offering panoramic views of Lake Michigan, Glen Lake, a maple-beech forest, and the park's tall perched dunes. Nine of these stops, which include a variety of wayside panels providing information about each area, are audio-described. The waysides positioned along the drive-and most of the other waysides located at the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore- measure 3 feet wide by 2 feet deep and stand on thin metal legs about 2½ feet high. Located at the drive's entrance is a small fee booth where visitors are asked to purchase a National Park Entrance Pass. This pass is required whenever and wherever you venture into Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, including entrance to the scenic drive, for parking, and for accessing a 1.5-mile walking trail that takes visitors to the top of Dune Climb before looping back to the paved drive. The hiking trail, which also serves as a cross-country ski trail, can be entered alongside the parking area near the drive's entrance. The driving loop is open from May until Veteran's Day depending on weather conditions. There are 3 pairs of vault toilets and one pair of full bathrooms situated along the scenic drive-one facility each for women and men at all 4 locations. These are a pair of vault toilets located at the entrance parking lot, 2 full restrooms with flush toilets and sinks situated across the parking lot at Picnic Mountain, 2 vault toilets located at the Lake Michigan Overlook, and 2 vault toilets located at the North Bar Overlook Picnic Area. The vault toilets are enclosed in small buildings with their 2 doors facing concrete sidewalks bordering the respective parking areas. All 4 buildings are marked with signs indicating the door to the women's toilet on the left and the door to the men's toilet on the right. The toilets and bathrooms are wheelchair accessible as are the 5 overlooks found along the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive. Please take care as you approach both the walking trail and the toilets located at the back end of the entrance parking lot as you will need to walk across paved roadways to reach them. Note, too, that there is a metal bicycle rack located a few feet to the right of the toilet building located near the scenic drive's entrance.",

The trail is surrounded primarily by pine-oak-aspen woods; open fields and lakes are scattered throughout plains.<br /> <br /> <b>Pets are NOT allowed on trail from December 1 to March 31.</b><br /> <br /> There are a number a trail routes you can take, easy, intermediate and advanced: options for every user. Signs are not posted at every intersection so keep your eye on the map.  <br /> <br /> <b>Otter Creek Loop</b> is a 4.6-mile trail that takes you through the woods around Otter Creek and Otter Lake. The terrain is flat and easy through this section.<br /> <b>Bass Lake Loop</b> is a 3.5-mile trail follows a winding course across gently rolling hills through pine-hardwood forest and passes Bass Lake, Deer Lake, and wetland areas. Enjoy the view and wildlife from the bench at the Bass Lake water access. Look for ripening wintergreen berries along the trail mid-loop in the fall.<br /> <b>Lasso Loop</b> is a 6.3-mile trail with diverse terrain and the most difficult terrain in the plains; aÂ few steep ridges and tight switchbacks can be challenging at times, but it offers the best views of Lake Michigan. Take the more strenuous 1.6-mile round-trip spur at the #5 post past the White Pine Backcountry Campground to a quiet Lake Michigan beach and enjoy one of the finest beach walks in the northern lower peninsula.<br /> Be aware: the mosquitoes can be vicious; make sure to bring repellant.</p> <h3>Ridges and swales</h3> <p>The Platte Plains are not your traditional plains with fields, but it is a lowland area between the Platte River, Otter Lake, and Lake Michigan. A satellite view of Platte Bay reveals the ancient shoreline sand dunes, which mark the successive positions of Lake Michigan after each intrusion of glacial ice melted. These geological landforms are called ridges and swales. From the trails, however, they're steep hills.Â </p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Chalenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year? Want to explore the landscape of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, exercise, and have fun all at the same time? Join the Trail Trekker Challenge! Earn a prize and bragging rights by successfully completing each of the 13 mainland trails in the National Lakeshore. Hiking is a great way to get daily physical exercise and promote health while also discovering the beauty of the area. What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> <br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <h3>Hike Safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant.

    "audioDescription": "Platte Plains, the park's most expansive trail system, spans nearly 15 miles total through low dunes with three main loops to explore and a walk-in campground. It's a perfect place to spend the day: pack a picnic, bring your canoe and fishing poles, tie up your hiking shoes, and enjoy the outdoors with family. The trail is surrounded primarily by pine-oak-aspen woods; open fields and lakes are scattered throughout plains. There are a number a trail routes you can take, easy, easy, intermediate and advanced: options for every user. Signs are not posted at every intersection so keep your eye on the map.  **Otter Creek Loop** is a 4.6-mile trail that takes you through the woods around Otter Creek and Otter Lake. The terrain is flat and easy through this section. **Bass Lake Loop** is a 3.5-mile trail follows a winding course across gently rolling hills through pine-hardwood forest and passes Bass Lake, Deer Lake, and wetland areas. Enjoy the view and wildlife from the bench at the Bass Lake water access. Look for ripening wintergreen berries along the trail mid-loop in the fall. **Lasso Loop** is a 6.3-mile trail with diverse terrain and the most difficult terrain in the plains; aÂ few steep ridges and tight switchbacks can be challenging at times, but it offers the best views of Lake Michigan. Take the more strenuous 1.6-mile roundtrip spur at the #5 post past the White Pine Backcountry Campground to a quiet Lake Michigan beach and enjoy one of the finest beach walks in the northern lower peninsula. Be aware: the mosquitoes can be vicious; make sure to bring repellant. Pets are not allowed on the trail in winter. The Platte Plains Trail is a designated cross-country ski trail during the periods of December 1 through March 31.",

    "audioDescription": "The Platte River Campground is a year-round facility that lies in a wooded area within walking distance of the Platte River and less than 2 miles away from the beaches of Lake Michigan. Both the campground and the ranger station standing at its entrance are located 10 miles south of Empire on Lake Michigan Road about ¼ mile off M-22. This is the largest campground at the park, offering a wide variety of nearly 180 camp sites, including back-in and pull-through sites with electric hookups for RVs, tent-only sites, walk-in sites, and hike-in/tent-only group sites. Each site has a campfire ring, picnic table and restrooms with flush toilets and sinks. Hot showers are also available. Most of the sites at this campground are accessible from a series of paved loop roads located behind, or to the east of, the ranger station. The smaller group and walk-in camp areas are located to the north of the ranger station. Water spigots are located throughout the campground with several serving each loop. The Platte River Ranger Station is a one-story structure with wooden board and batten construction and a red-tiled hip roof. There are 2 concrete walkways leading from the parking area to the station-one walkway running directly alongside the building and, about 3 feet to this first walkway's right, another walkway leading to a covered seating area. As you step along the wide concrete walkway closest to the building, you will encounter a metal drinking fountain jutting out from the exterior building wall on your left, and then, about 2 feet further forward and also on your left, a small vestibule containing a pair of restrooms. As you step into the vestibule, turn right 90 degrees to access the door to the women's restroom or turn left 90 degrees to access the men's restroom. These restrooms are wheelchair accessible. The building entrance is also located on the left, about 8 feet beyond the restroom vestibule. Situated several feet in front of the ranger station entrance is a wide U-shaped wooden bench sheltered by a hip roof supported by a series of large square pillars. Most of the floor in front of the entrance is concrete, although the bench itself stands on a wooden plank floor. This wooden floor extends along the left side of the outermost concrete walkway leading back to the parking area. Standing on a separate wooden floor section to the left of this wooden walkway are 2 metal receptacles, the first for landfill materials and the second for mixed recycling. Reservations for camping at the Platte River Campground are accepted for the summer months only, from Memorial Day to Labor Day. An amphitheater located adjacent to the Ranger Station provides evening programs every day during the summer. Fees for camping at the various sites vary. Nearby features include a separate backcountry campground and numerous hiking and backpacking trails. There are also opportunities for canoeing, kayaking, and fishing on Platte River and Lake Michigan.",

    "audioDescription": "A wide concrete walkway leads to the Platte River Picnic Area, which offers 3 large hip-roofed picnic pavilions, each containing 2 picnic tables with attached benches. Each pavilion has its own cooking grill, and there is also a communal fish cleaning station located here. A wooden walkway extending beyond the concrete walkway leads partway into the picnic site, where it then meets another section of concrete walkway. Located to the right of the wooden walkway about 20 feet in is the first of 2 pavilions that are situated on the right. A single pavilion is located to the left of the furthest section of concrete walkway and directly across from the 2nd pavilion on the right. As you approach the picnic area, you will encounter a row of 3 metal receptacles-2 for mixed recycling and a third for landfill materials-placed alongside the left side of the concrete walkway just before it meets the wooden walkway. Directly across from these receptacles to the right of the concrete walkway is a blue-painted water pump pipe measuring about 3 feet tall that stands in a small square area filled with small stones. The pump's long handle juts out from the top of the pipe, and the water spigot, which is located about 6 inches from the pipe's top, is positioned to face away from the walkway. The picnic pavilions are open on all 4 sides, with their roofs slightly overhanging the 4 wide square support pillars located near each of the roof's outer corners. The pavilions' concrete floors extend several feet beyond the areas sheltered by the roofs, and the site's 3 cooking grills-one per pavilion-stand atop short poles anchored in the outer corner of each floor. The concrete floors are flush with the wooden and concrete walkways and with the surrounding grass. There are no railings. There is, however, a low concrete wall edging the wooden walkway's left side as you approach the single pavilion located on the left. Here the walkway and the corresponding wall jog to the left a few feet in front of this pavilion. Connecting the roofs of this pavilion and the furthest pavilion on the right is an open-slatted wooden pergola roof that extends across the wooden walkway at ceiling height. An additional sidewalk running parallel to the nearby parking lot leads to an interpretive pavilion, bathrooms, and a number of concrete picnic table areas before continuing on to the fish cleaning station, which is located to the west of the picnic area.",

You can launch your float down the Platte River from the carry-in access point adjacent to the river walk, or fish from one of the decks over the river's edge, or just sit on a bench and take it all in.</p> <p>Above the river, the Platte River Picnic Area is equipped with accessible parking, restrooms, picnic shelters, and raised grills.</p> <h3>Paddling the Platte</h3> <p>Cooling off with a relaxing float on a tube or raft down the Platte River on a hot summer day is one of the most popular recreational activities in the Lakeshore to beat the heat of summer. The river is shallow and clear, and while it moves along at a good pace, there are no rapids to contend with. You will see a multitude of different wildflowers and birds on your trip, so pay careful attention to the shoreline.</p> <p>Your float may end where the Platte empties into the Lake Michigan and forms a delightful sandy spit full of frolicking children and beachgoers wading across the river. Outstanding views of Platte Bay and massive Empire Bluffs and Sleeping Bear Dunes in the distance reward those who drift all the way to Lake Michigan. It's a wonderful place to take a quick dip if it's a hot day.</p> <p>You can either bring your own tube, raft, air mattress, etc. or you can rent them from local outfitters. If you need to rent during the height of the summer season, you will want to plan ahead and get reservations.</p> <p><strong>From the Platte River Picnic Area water access</strong>, you can float a **one-hour loop** to just above Loon Lake and then carry your tube for a 10-minute walk back to your car.</p> <p>If you want the full paddling experience, a <strong>2-and a half-hour plus float</strong> will take you all the way from the picnic area water access to Lake Michigan. Put in along the ramp and drift down the pristine river, through Loon Lake (you'll have to paddle across the lake), past the fish weir and El Dorado, through beautiful sand dunes, all the way to the mouth of the Platte River. You will need to shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.</p> <p>You can also put in at the <strong>fish weir</strong> just below Loon Lake for a <strong>2-hour float</strong> to the mouth of the Platte. In this case, you will have to carry your tube about 1/4 mile from the road to the river along a gravel road to the fish weir and shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.</p> <p>Offering a nice, easy, <strong>1-mile float</strong> to Lake Michigan, a parking lot, and toilet, <strong>El Dorado</strong> is another popular put-in for tubers. You will have to shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.</p> <p>During the height of summer, the river is busy. And from late June through August, it can be like â€˜bumper boats' with all the kayaks, canoes, and tubes going down the lazy river. Pick a warm day in early summer or September, and you'll have it pretty much to yourself. Fall floats on the river can be quite scenic and a great time to see a lot of fish!</p> <h3>Platte River Fishing Weir</h3> <p>Floating down the gentle flowing Platte you will pass through the State of Michigan's fish weir: an obstruction in the river with gates that can be raised and lowered to stop the migrating salmon from going up stream in the fall. The weir is in operation from the middle of August until October. When the salmon are running, the DNR uses the weir to harvest the fish, and their eggs are used at their hatcheries. During these months, you must portage around the weir. The best times to see returning adult salmon in the Platte River are from mid September to late October at the lower weir.</p> <h3>Paddle Safe</h3> <p>Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.</p> <p><strong>Clean Your Boats</strong><br /> Please clean, drain, and dry your boat after you leave any body of water, especially Lake Michigan, to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. This is especially important for our inland lakes.</p> <p>For more information on aquatic invasive species and their impacts to lakes, streams, and how we recreate please visit the following websites:</p> <p>www.protectyourwaters.net<br /> www.nps.gov/slbe/naturescience/nonnativespecies.htm</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Located near the Platte River Picnic Area at the corner of M-22 and Lake Michigan Road is a several-foot-wide boat ramp that allows access to the Platte River. The surface of the ramp is constructed of an open concrete grid that allows grass to grow around the small square sections making up its surface. The side of the ramp closest to the water is edged with a thin band of wood. Here the water is shallow, and the shore and river bottom are covered with pebbles and small rocks. <br />Affixed to a pole standing by the water a few feet beyond the far end of the boat ramp is a square white sign edged in red and with the outline of a red circle in its center. Appearing in black letters inside the circle is the text, \"Slow, No Wake.\"<br />Also located beyond the boat ramp, a few feet up the bank away from the water, is the entrance to a paved walkway that runs through a wooded area alongside the river. The first few yards of the walkway are flanked by a wooden barrier with a railing on the walkway's left side only; this wooden barrier transitions into a metal barrier with railings that continues on both the walkway's left and right sides.<br />",

The river is shallow and flows rapidly at this point, and kids love swimming and floating in the current and wave action that occurs where the waters merge. The awe-inspiring views of Empire Bluffs and Sleeping Bear Point are just icing on the cake.<br /> <br /> <b>NO pets are allowed on this beach.</b><br /> <br /> Many consider this beach to be the best in the park to watch shorebirds. The Audubon Society has designated the area an Important Bird Area (IBA). During the summer look for piping plovers, spotted sandpipers, killdeer, and also Caspian terns.<br /> A popular plover nesting area, sections of the shoreline are often closed (see below). Watch and enjoy plovers from a distance. You can walk the shoreline around fencing. Don't leave food on the beach or feed gulls and animals who may prey on piping plovers.<br /> <br /> <b>Where should I park?</b><br /> Parking lots fill during busy summer months. The Park Service has two lots on the north and south sides of Lake Michigan Road. The south side is equipped with cell-phone coverage, accessible parking, restrooms with running water, accessible dressing rooms and raised charcoal grills. The automated fee station is at the south lot.<br /> Lake Township Park, owned by Benzie County, is just west of the south lot and has a picnic area in addition to parking. A township user fee is required.</p> <h3>Ever changing shoreline</h3> <p>An active dune field has grown at the mouth of the Platte River to form Platte River Point, and the beach is a sandy gravel becoming increasingly sandy to the north. The beach is wide near the point, with a grassy dune field extending back to the forest. During the summer months, small nearshore sandbars migrate onshore and join the existing the beach, causing it to widen. The same sand will be carried offshore again in fall storms. The shoreline is constantly being sculpted by waves and breaking-wave swash which forms a variety of patterns, and often concentrates thin layers of heavy minerals. Bring a magnet to the beach, and you will be able to separate magnetite (the dark-colored sand) from the other high-density minerals.</p> <h3>Early campers</h3> <p>We aren't the first people to be drawn to the beauty and fun of Platte River Point. Turns out the Platte River has been a hot spot for camping for a very long time. Archeological investigations have shown that small groups of closely related individuals from the Woodland Period (600 B.C. to 1620 A.D.) paid short visits to the area. They may have been a family traveling to their winter hunting grounds, or a group of hunters on an extended trip, or a group that came to gather wild plants and berries. No matter why they stopped to camp, I'll bet it was a highlight of their travels!</p> <h3>Enjoy the Beach Safely</h3> <p><strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> <br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> <br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Beach fires</strong><br /> Roasting hot dogs and marshmallows over glowing coals while watching the sun go down over the lake is a perfect ending to a fun day at the beach. Beach fire are allowed on our mainland Lake Michigan beaches between the water's edge and where the dunes begin, and away from any vegetation. Make sure you use firewood from park approved vendors to help us protect our forests from pest and disease. And be sure to extinguish all beach fires with water. DO NOT bury fires-hidden embers could burn unsuspecting bare feet!<br /> <br /> <strong>Take care around plover nesting area</strong><br /> Keep a watchful eye out for a tiny animal friend, the piping plover, a threatened species that breeds here in the spring. Piping plovers find the cobbled beaches of Sleeping Bear Dunes an ideal place to find mates, nest, and raise their young. To protect the plovers and their nests, some parts of the beach may be temporarily closed to visitors and pets. Please help us protect these special birds by keeping dogs on a leash and obeying all beach closure signs.<br /> <br /> <strong>Step around the Pitcher's thistle</strong><br /> Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcher) blooms only once when the plant is seven years old. This native thistle grows only on the shorelines or sand dunes of the Great Lakes and is common in the Lakeshore. It is aÂ threatened species: it is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.Â <br /> <br /> Walking through foredunes on your way to the beach may trample and kill these plants before they can reproduce. So please watch out for the Pitcher's thistle: stay on the wooden walkways and established trails.<br /> <br /> <strong>Swim safe</strong><br /> The Lakeshore's pristine beaches are ideal for swimming, but forceful waves and rip currents can turn a fun visit into a frightening one. Use caution when swimming alone and take special precautions with children: keep a close watch on all children, stay within arm's reach, and be sure they are wearing a life jacket.<br /> <br /> <strong>Be alert for rip currents</strong><br /> Although they are not common in the Lakeshore, rip currents are dangerous and can occur at any beach with breaking waves.<br /> Lake Michigan conditions can change quickly. Know what to expect before you go in the water. Monitor the weather and check out the swim risk level for the beach you plan to visit. Read more in Safety.<br /> <br /> <strong>Paddle safe</strong><br /> Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.</p> <h3>Lake Michigan Pirates: Roaring Dan Seavey</h3> <p>Lake Michigan's eastern shoreline is a paradise treasured by tourists and recreationists. But during the periods of western expansion, the upper Great Lakes region was a very dangerous place. Up until the mid-1800s, a wild west mentality ruled the Great Lakes. The lakes were a source for all kinds of smuggling, poaching, and piracy. Pirates sailed the waters stealing beaver pelts, timber, and sometimes entire ships. One notable pirate was Roaring Dan Seavey, a man that would sail out into the lakes and plunder wherever and whatever he could.<br /> <br /> Seavey and a small crew would silently slip his schooner, the Wanderer, with no running lights, into ports in the dead of night and make off with anything on wharves, in unlocked warehouses, or on nearby streets-cattle, hay, leather goods, fruit--anything of value and could be carried on the schooner.<br /> <br /> Known for his monumental acts of drinking, brawling, whoring, poaching, and stealing, Seavey also practiced moon cussing: a pirate trick of rearranging or removing or putting up fake port lights so that ships coming in would crash on the rocks. Then, his crew would board the ship and steal the cargo. He earned most of his money from poaching venison and stealing. He also ran an offshore casino and brothel.<br /> <br /> Seavey's biggest heist was stealing the 40-ft schooner Nellie Johnson in Grand Haven, Michigan. As the story goes, he gained the trust of the Nellie Johnson's crew and captain and came aboard with booze and drank them all under the table. When the crew was passed out, he and his crew removed them from the schooner and set sail for Chicago to sell the cedar posts onboard. Unable to sell anything and being discovered as a pirate, Seaver took the Nellie Johnson and fled up the coast of Lake Michigan. He eluded federal authorities for two weeks but was captured near Frankfort. He was taken back to Chicago where he claimed he won the ship in a poker game. The ship's real captain never showed up, so charges were dropped and he was set free.<br /> The only man ever formally charged with piracy on the Great Lakes, Seavey eventually was deputized as a U.S. Marshall and tasked with curbing poaching and robbery on Lake Michigan.<br /> <br /> Pirates in our region were tough, but they were practical too. They wore knitted wool caps and mittens and sweaters. When the lakes iced over, the sweater-wearing pirates would head home until May.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Platte River Point Beach, which is located less than one-quarter of a mile downriver from the Platte River Point launch area, is situated alongside the spot where the Platte River flows into Lake Michigan. Visitors are invited to take the short walk along the river to the beach, where they can view the merging of the 2 bodies of water. A few yards from shore as you stand facing the water from the beach is a long sandbar stretching left and right. The length and height of this sandbar is always changing, and its higher sections may be dotted with grass and other scraggly vegetation. Lake Michigan lies on the opposite side of this sandbar. You may encounter large rocks or boulders near the water's edge in some areas of the beach. Note, too, that the dunes sloping upward toward the mainland from the beach may be covered with small stones. The section of river flowing alongside Platte River Beach moves rapidly, which makes it an ideal spot for tubing. A picnic area with restroom facilities and parking is located at the nearby Lake Township Park.",

    "audioDescription": "The Platte River Picnic Area's Fish Cleaning Station is situated inside a hip-roofed pavilion located west of the picnic area and to one side of the canoe launch situated alongside Lake Michigan Road. The rectangular cleaning station, which stands atop a 2-level concrete floor, measures approximately 5 feet long by 4 feet wide, or deep. It features 2 white plastic counters, or tables, one each running alongside the full length of each of the station's long sides. These tables, which each measure about 1½ feet deep, flank a single water channel, or sink, in the station's center. One long side of the station abuts the floor's top level, where the table and is situated approximately 3 feet off the floor, thus allowing accessibility for wheelchair users. The table on the station's lower level can be reached by taking 2 shallow steps down on either side of the station. Here the table's surface is located about 3½ feet above the floor. There are no railings on either side of the station. Affixed to one end of the station is a sign entitled \"Fish Cleaning Station Instructions\" with numbered text that reads: 1, Push button to start grinder and water jets. 2, Deposit fish carcasses into top with water on. 3, Use spray hose to clean cutting table and sink. 4, Grinder and water will shut off automatically. 5, Restart as needed-cycle time is approximately 2 minutes. 6, Notify park maintenance of any malfunction. The start and stop buttons are located on a small rectangular white plate situated a few inches above the sign's upper left corner, with the green start button positioned on the top and the red stop button positioned below it. Jutting up vertically from the center of the sink is an open-ended steel tube topped with a small square metal structure resembling a box with a missing bottom and 2 missing sides. Slanting outward from the side of this vertical tube and pointing toward the table on the station's upper level, is a second tube, also with an open end. Two signs, one each affixed on either side of the boxlike structure and facing the station's 2 tables, reads: Danger. Severe personal injury can result if hands, arms, clothing, etc. are put into tube. Fish Parts Only.",

    "bodyText": "<p>This beautiful area where the Platte River flows into Lake Michigan is a busy place during the hot summer days. It is the terminus of many tubing, canoeing, or kayaking trips. The river is shallow and flows rapidly at this point, which makes it a favorite place for tubing, and on a breezy day, there will be some interesting wave action when you reach the big lake.<br /> <br /> Platte River Point, offers two accesses to water. One, at the end of Lake Michigan Road, is paved for drive-in trailer access; you can put in your fishing boat and head to Lake Michigan. The second access point is used by those floating down the Platte River in kayaks, canoes, and tubes. It lies just short of the river mouth and is adjacent to the Lakeshore's south parking lot behind the restrooms and changing area.<br /> <br /> There are two parking areas on the north and south sides of Lake Michigan Road. The south side is equipped with accessible parking, restrooms with running water, accessible dressing rooms, raised charcoal grills, and cell phone coverage. (Water and restrooms may only be available between Memorial Day and Labor Day.) An automated fee station is at the south lot.<br /> <br /> The picnic area at Lake Township Park, owned by Benzie County, offers a relaxing way to end your river trip or watch the beach and boating activities. (A township user fee is required.)<br /> <br /> Parking lots fill during busy summer months. An alternative launch site is Eldorado Park one half mile east on Lake Michigan Road.</p> <h3>Paddle safe</h3> <p>Before going out for a paddle, check the weather. Have a boating plan and make sure others know it. Always wear safety gear, including personal flotation devices. Buddy up, don't go out alone. Check your boat and make sure it is safe for conditions. And always keep the shoreline in sight.<br /> <br /> <strong>Clean Your Boat</strong><br /> Please clean, drain, and dry your boat after you leave any body of water, especially Lake Michigan, to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. This is especially important for our inland lakes.<br /> <br /> For more information on aquatic invasive species and their impacts to lakes, streams, and how we recreate please visit the following websites:<br /> www.protectyourwaters.net<br /> www.nps.gov/slbe/naturescience/nonnativespecies.htm</p> <h3>Paddle the Platte</h3> <p><strong>Paddle the Platte</strong><br /> Cooling off with a relaxing float on a tube or raft down the Platte River on a hot summer day is one of the most popular recreational activities in the Lakeshore to beat the heat of summer. The river is shallow and clear, and while it moves along at a good pace, there are no rapids to contend with. You will see a multitude of different wildflowers and birds on your trip, so pay careful attention to the shoreline.<br /> <br /> Your float may end where the Platte empties into the Lake Michigan and forms a delightful sandy spit full of frolicking children and beachgoers wading across the river. Outstanding views of Platte Bay and massive Empire Bluffs and Sleeping Bear Dunes in the distance reward those who drift all the way to Lake Michigan. It's a wonderful place to take a quick dip if it's a hot day.<br /> You can either bring your own tube, raft, air mattress, etc. or you can rent them from local outfitters. If you need to rent during the height of the summer season, you will want to plan ahead and get reservations.<br /> <br /> <strong>From the Platte River Picnic Area water access</strong>, you can float a <strong>one-hour loop</strong> to just above Loon Lake and then carry your tube for a 10-minute walk back to your car.<br /> <br /> If you want the full paddling experience, a <strong>2-and a half-hour plus floa</strong>t will take you all the way from the picnic area water access to Lake Michigan. Put in along the ramp and drift down the pristine river, through Loon Lake (you'll have to paddle across the lake), past the fish weir and El Dorado, through beautiful sand dunes, all the way to the mouth of the Platte River. You will need to shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.<br /> <br /> You can also put in at the <strong>fish weir</strong> just below Loon Lake for a <strong>2-hour float</strong> to the mouth of the Platte. In this case, you will have to carry your tube about 1/4 mile from the road to the river along a gravel road to the fish weir and shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.<br /> <br /> Offering a nice, easy, <strong>1-mile float </strong>to Lake Michigan, a parking lot, and toilet, <strong>El Dorado</strong> is another popular put-in for tubers. You will have to shuttle your car to the parking lot at Platte Point at the end of Lake Michigan Road.<br /> <br /> During the height of summer, the river is busy. And from late June through August, it can be like bumper boats with all the kayaks, canoes, and tubes going down the lazy river. Pick a warm day in early summer or September, and you'll have it pretty much to yourself. Fall floats on the river can be quite scenic and a great time to see a lot of fish!</p> <h3>Platte River Fishing Weir</h3> <p>Floating down the gentle flowing Platte you will pass through the State of Michigan's fish weir: an obstruction in the river with gates that can be raised and lowered to stop the migrating salmon from going up stream in the fall. The weir is in operation from the middle of August until October. When the salmon are running, the DNR uses the weir to harvest the fish, and their eggs are used at their hatcheries. During these months, you must portage around the weir. The best times to see returning adult salmon in the Platte River are from mid September to late October at the lower weir.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The launch ramp at Platte River Point is located about 100 yards from the mouth of the Platte River. Visitors can reach this shallow water access area via a paved walkway leading from the nearby parking lot at Lake Township Park, which also offers a picnic area, water, restrooms, and cell phone coverage. Note that water and restrooms may only be available between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Take care as you approach the water's edge at this launch area as the ramp is edged with a wooden timber that is positioned a few inches above the sand. Standing near the launch area are 2 wooden poles holding signs that read \"canoe pick up area\" and \"no canoes beyond this point.\" Two additional signs indicate that glass receptacles and pets are prohibited here. Another sign supported atop a pole standing in the grass to one side of the launch area reads: \"Slow, No Wake.\" A few yards from shore as you stand facing the water from the launch area is a low dune stretching left and right. Much of this dune, which is part of the mainland, is dotted with grass and other scraggly vegetation.",

Students planted the row of sugar maples along the southern edge of the school yard to celebrate Arbor Day many years ago. They were tapped by the Kelderhouses to make maple syrup.<br /> <br /> Several generations of Port Oneidans attended the school. To prevent any \"problems,\" boys sat on one side of the room and girls on the other, and there were separate coat rooms for boys and girls. A framed image of George Washington hung on the wall as inspiration.<br /> <br /> During recess, everyone played together. According to one former student, \"We all went out, we played together...everybody played the game. It didn't matter whether you were playing ball or playing keep-away, or run-sheep-run, or anything like that. Everybody played together.\"<br /> <br /> And snow days? Not back then. \"When we'd have a blizzard, my dad would hook up the horses to the sled, and bring out the big blankets, and we'd get underneath the blankets, and here he's sitting up there driving the horses, and we kids are underneath the blankets keeping warm, and he'd take us to school.\"<br /> <br /> Not just a schoolhouse, the school was also a central gathering place of the community after the store near the dock closed around 1900. After the school consolidated with the Glen Arbor School in the early 1940s, the building was used as the meeting place for the Port Oneida Community.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A narrow concrete walkway leads to the Port Oneida School, a small white clapboard building with an open bell tower positioned atop the structure's steep-pitched gable roof. The school, which was built in 1890, is located across Port Oneida Road from the Kelderhouse Farm just north of M-22. Stretching left and right in front of the school is a concrete porch, about 5 feet deep, situated one step up from the walkway. Take care as you approach the school as the walkway leading to the porch is somewhat uneven, with grass either covering some sections or growing up through joints and cracks. Supporting the porch's sloping porch roof are 4 slim white-painted wooden pillars, located at the porch's outer edge. Planted in the ground in front of the porch and attached to the 2 pillars flanking the white-painted central entrance doors are two metal handrails, about 3 feet high. You must take one more step up from the porch to enter the school. There are 2 square 6-paned windows located on the building's facade, one window each located on either side of the entrance door. The bottom edges of these windows are positioned about 5 feet above the porch floor and just under the sloping porch roof. There is a small gable located on the porch roof just above the entrance. Located in the grass surrounding the school building are two additional features original to the site. The first is a metal hand pump, about 3 feet high and with a long protruding handle. Take care as you near the pump as it stands in the center of a small concrete area measuring about 3 feet square and with a 4-inch-high lip on all sides. The second feature is a small white outhouse constructed of vertical wooden planks located near the tree line running along the back of the school. A cutout on the top half of the outhouse door, also white, is shaped like a crescent moon with its open side facing left. A single concrete step, about 6 inches high, is positioned in front of the door, whose bottom edge is located another 6 or so inches above the step. A single white pipe juts out of the building's shallow gable roof.",

This overlook, which faces due north, offers a panoramic view of the vast blue waters of Lake Michigan as well as a closer look at the steep dunes descending toward the lakeshore below you. These dunes are largely bare, but, depending upon the season, leafy green trees and other vegetation that is the adjacent maple-beech forest are also visible.

To protect the bluff from erosion and for your safety, do not descend the bluff. Note that the last portion of the trail Basch Road. Watch for traffic. </p> <p><br /> <strong>More details</strong><br /> In an area of the state known for its stunning panoramas of sand dunes, islands, and the many blues of Lake Michigan, Pyramid Point is one of the best. The 2.6-mile trail traverses three diverse landscapes: old farm fields and meadows, century-old beech-maple forests, and the high bluffs overlooking the lake.<br /> <br /> Hike 0.6 miles to the overlook and take in the awe inspiring views of Lake Michigan, the Manitou Islands, and sometimes a Great Lakes freighter. Find the North Manitou Shoal Light-or \"the Crib\"- protecting the passage from a dangerous shoal. It often looks like a large white sail on the lake. Varying depths and shoals create beautiful shades of blues and greens in Lake Michigan. The hike up to the point is fairly easy and appropriate for all ages.<br /> <br /> Going down the steep dune to the water's edge is not advised. It's farther down than it looks (you can't actually see the bottom from the top).<br /> <br /> Most people hike to the the lookout for the view and then return, a 1.2-mile round trip. Continue on the trail and you'll find yourself off the beaten path. Explore the length of this trail and you will be rewarded with gorgeous views, large sand bowls to wander through, meadows of wildflowers, and shaded, leafy forests. You'll often have the trail to yourself. The last 0.4 miles of the loop follows Basch Road, a quiet dirt road.<br /> <br /> There is a connector trail between posts, numbered 2 and 3. This connector shortens the trail to 2 miles. At the end, be careful on Basch Road as you return to the trailhead.<br /> <br /> A vault toilet is available at trailhead.</p> <h4>Hike Safely</h4> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> <br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.</p> <h4>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</h4> <p>Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.</p> <h4>Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</h4> <p>Avoid ticks by walking in the center of trails and avoiding contact with vegetation.<br /> Use a repellent (on skin or clothing) and wear close-toed shoes, long sleeves, long pants, and socks. Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to easily spot ticks.<br /> Check your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, fallen logs, or stone walls.<br /> <br /> <em>After being outdoors</em><br /> Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, and remove any ticks you find.<br /> Check your clothing for ticks. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat for at least an hour.<br /> Shower soon after being outdoors; it may reduce your risk of being bitten.<br /> Check these parts of your body and your child's body for ticks:<br /> Under the arm, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, in and around hair, between the legs, around the waist.<br /> <br /> <em>If you are bitten by a tick</em><br /> Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it. Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible, and then slowly, but firmly, pull it straight out. Immediately wash the bite area and your hands with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic to the bite wound.<br /> Watch for signs of illness.<br /> <br />  </p> <h4>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h4> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year?

    "bodyText": "<p>The Riggs Cottage was built in 1924 for Margaret Riggs who was a frequent guest at Katie Shepard's hotel. Although the exterior form of the Riggs cottage resembles a small, one-story, front gable and-ell dwelling, its interior room arrangement mimics that of the Cottage Row dog-trot houses. Instead of a full front verandah, however, the Riggs cottage has only a small, arch-roofed hood that projects over the stoop.<br /> <br /> Margaret Londergan, who was William Angeli's personal secretary, purchased Margaret Riggs' cottage in 1947. Londergan and her daughter, Jean, had spent summers on the island since 1937. Each summer, Londergan traveled to the island with Angell in order to assist him in the management of the MIA and other business matters.<br /> <br /> A garage and a privy were located behind the house. The house lacked an indoor bathroom until the late 1950s. Ornamental vegetation includes large spruce trees in front of the house, a clump of snowberry at the edge of the bluff, and a ruinous well house below. A cluster of fruit trees extends across the western portion of the lot.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex. It was the island's only speculative resort enterprise, the first of several efforts to turn the island into an exclusive retreat. The individually owned cottages were supported by a communal kitchen and dining facility. This resort setup was common during the nineteenth century and represents a broad trend in recreation on the Great Lakes region.<br /> <br /> The buildings face eastward to take advantage of off-shore breezes, as well as superb views of the Manitou Passage and the Michigan mainland. From this prime vantage point, the summer residents could monitor activities of the life-saving service station, as well as steamship traffic through the passage. The configuration of the Cottage Row parcels and accompanying deed restrictions ensured that each property owner would have an unobstructed view of the beach and the Manitou Passage. A board walk, shaded by sugar maple and Norway maple trees, once extended along this area.<br /> <br /> The Cottage Row colony provided seasonal employment for year-round island residents. Wives and children of North Manitou farmers and U. S. Life-Saving Service crewmen residents took jobs cooking, cleaning, and doing other domestic chores for Cottage Row residents, in the communal dining room, and at hotel operated by Katie Shepard. For the island's year-round residents, the colony represented a significant source of supplemental cash income. Although some of the cottage owners maintained small gardens, the hotel and summer visitors also provided a much-needed local market for fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, and dairy products.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard opened her home as a hotel and offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.<br /> <br /> Getting to and from the island and their cottages wasn't always easy as Mrs. Shirley Foote Alford (whose family built one of the first cottages in 1894) explained:<br /> \"When people were planning to leave the island, their trunks were loaded on the farm wagon which would go to the top of the hill running down to the dock. There the wagon would wait until the steamer came in close and blew her whistle. If it was three whistles, wagon and people hurried down to the dock to see the boat land. If four whistles were sounded (urgent-danger and distress signal). We all went down as fast as possible to the Life Saving Station where passengers, trunks, baby carriages, ice boxes, etc. were taken out to the steamer in the Life-Saving Service surfboat, rowed by the crew, each man with an oar and the captain steering with a long oar in the stern.\"</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Built in 1924, the Margaret Riggs Cottage is a 1½-story gable-roofed structure that stands elevated about 1½ feet above the ground, supported on its corners by stout log pillars or concrete blocks. The cottage is clad in clapboard siding, once painted white but now largely turned gray with age. A one-story wing with an intersecting gable roof extends from the main building's left side.< Situated over the entrance door is an arch-roofed hood that projects over the building's shallow front stoop. This design is echoed in arch-shaped bands of wood inset into the siding above each of the 2 multi-paned windows flanking the door. A few feet above the hood, on the face of the central gable, is a small half-moon window, also arched on top. The 3 concrete steps leading up to the structure's front door are flanked by low red-brick barrier walls. The ground in front of the steps is overgrown with low vegetation.",

There's also a place to fill up your water bottles just outside the bathrooms. Bring water filtration equipment because there are limited sources of purified drinking water. You must carry all of your gear-so travel light, and store your food in hard containers or hung from a line to thwart chipmunks.<br /> <br /> Other tips for spending time on South Manitou Island is to remember bug spray, a hat, and any other light medical supplies (band aids for blisters) that might make your trip a bit more comfortable. Know what poison ivy looks like and bring Benadryl/hydrocortisone cream if you know you will immediately react.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Bay Campground is one of three campgrounds located on South Manitou Island and the closest campsite to the island's dock. To reach this campground, which is located close to the beach on the island's crescent-shaped eastern shore, take a half-mile hike north from the dock and Ranger Station. From this campground, there is a largely unobstructed view of the bay to the east. The campsites are situated in dirt-floored clearings surrounded by both deciduous and evergreen trees. Marking the locations of the campground's 25 individual sites and 3 group sites are 28 wooden posts measuring about 3 feet tall with white triangles painted near their tops. Each individual site is limited to 4 people and 2 tents. Each group site is designed to hold from 9 to 20 campers, with a maximum of 10 tents. Group sites are available by reservation only. As you walk around the campsites, you will encounter a number of wooden benches, each constructed of a single wooden timber perched atop 2 smaller wooden blocks positioned at each end. These benches either stand alone or in pairs, and up to 4 such benches surround the campground's metal community fire rings. Each fire ring, which measures approximately 3 feet in diameter and 4 inches high, is topped with a metal grill. These grills can be lifted to place wood in the otherwise open ring. Campers may collect dead and downed wood found on the island to make open fires in these rings during their visit. Visitors are encouraged to bring their own water filtration equipment because there is no source of purified drinking water at the campsites. Campers are also warned to look out for poison ivy, as it is common in this area. Campers must purchase a Backcountry Use Permit before camping at any of the island's campsites.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) station on South Manitou Island was built in 1901 and officially opened in August of 1902 with a Keeper and a crew of six surfmen. From 1901 to 1915, surfmen gave aid not only to mariners and shipwreck victims, but also to civilians living on the island. The USLSS reports for South Manitou reveal that surfmen often used their boats to take gravely ill islanders to the mainland doctor or to bring the doctor to the island. They also helped put out fires at farm houses and on board ships, provided basic first aid, and rescued people and animals from drowning.<br /> <br /> USLSS Keepers and Surfmen became members of the island's close-knit community. The station house only provided housing for the Keeper and his family and the single men of the crew. Many island residents turned to the USLSS for work when jobs in logging and farming began to decline. Often, family members served on the USLSS crews together and over time, some families had a several generations of men that served the USLSS.</p> <h3>Surfmen stories</h3> <p><strong>Gerald Crowner</strong><br /> Gerald E. Crowner served as a surfman for the United States Coast Guard on South Manitou Island from 1926 to 1928. He published a memoir, The South Manitou Story, of his time on the island in 1982. His book is filled with short stories, poems, and photos that bring his service on the island to life for readers today.<br /> <br /> <strong>The South Patrol on a Windy Fall Night</strong><br /> by Gerald E. Crowner<br /> <br /> <strong>I walked alone<br /> one starlit<br /> windy night<br /> and saw the clouds,<br /> like stately galleons<br /> pass in flight,<br /> eclipsing the star-beams<br /> with shadowy grace,<br /> as they twinkled<br /> and sparkled<br /> through unending space.<br /> And the surf<br /> came in blasting,<br /> with crests flying high,<br /> like the manes of wild horses<br /> against the dark sky.<br /> And over my soul<br /> came a glorious peace,<br /> as I walked<br /> in the starlight<br /> beside turbulent seas.</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>John F. Tobin</strong><br /> John F. Tobin lived on South Manitou Island as a boy. His grandfather, John K. Tobin, served in both the Coast Guard and the Lighthouse Service on South Manitou. John's father, Harold, was born on the island and served at the Coast Guard station there until WWII. While Harold served in the war, John F. and his family moved off of the island. In 2010, John F. was interviewed for an oral history project at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. He shared stories about growing up on South Manitou, attending school, and playing pranks. He was a self-proclaimed \"stinker\" and \"rascal\" during his boyhood days! In this interview clip, John describes the life-saving drills practiced by the Coast Guard, the Navy visiting on the Fourth of July, and the trouble he got into playing with black powder.</p> <h3>U.S. Life-Saving Service</h3> <p>Congress established the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) in 1871 in an effort to reduce the number of lives lost on the oceans and the Great Lakes due to shipwrecks. The surfmen of the USLSS became known as \"storm warriors\" and \"storm fighters.\" Their unofficial motto was, \"you have to go out, but you don't have to come back.\" USLSS crews braved perilous conditions to save shipwreck victims from certain doom.<br /> <br /> The narrow Manitou passage, which runs between the islands and the mainland, is one of the most dangerous on the Great Lakes. Ships have to make several turns here, and because of the shoals surrounding the islands, `they fell asleep. At night, surfmen patrolled the beaches. Each station handled beach patrol a little differently. If stations were fairly close to each other, surfmen on beach patrol carried a small medallion, called a check, which was inscribed with the name of his station and his number. During beach patrol, the surfman hiked down the beach the required distance, up to four or five miles, where he met a surfman from the neighboring station and they exchanged checks. Each surfman turned the check into their Keeper in the morning as a way to prove that he had completed his patrol. Other stations, especially isolated stations such as South Manitou, used time clocks in order to prove that surfmen completed their patrols. A surfman would carry the small clock on a strap over his shoulder as he made their way down the beach. At the end of the patrol was a wooden post in the sand containing a key. The surfman inserted the key into the clock, which recorded the time on a roll of paper. Not only did this prove that surfmen completed their patrols, but also that patrols were completed on time.<br /> <br /> The crew also responsible for maintaining the station; this included keeping it clean. Every morning they cleaned the lamps and lanterns and trimmed and filled them. They swept the hallways; filled wood boxes; swept sidewalks; cleaned cuspidors and ash trays; dusted the stairway; and made their beds neat and smooth. On Saturdays, or scrub day, all station floors were scrubbed, windows washed, and brass polished.<br /> <br /> Surfmen also kept the buildings and equipment gleaming. Maintenance of buildings usually meant repainting the buildings and cutting and splitting wood (enough wood for the two kitchen ranges and two wood burners in the station). But when needed, expanded to renovation tasks like putting on new roofs, laying new flooring, building new outhouses, and even laying new sod (and watering that sod).<br /> <br /> The main duty of the Service was the protection of life and property on the water. But local citizens often looked to the crew when they needed help. An annual report from 1895 lists some of these \"Miscellaneous Services\": surfmen rigging the rope on the flagstaff of the county building, extinguishing 21 fires in homes or buildings, catching a runaway horse, repairing a wagon owned by two ladies who were kept out of the rain at the station while the surfmen worked on their buggy, finding a child lost in the woods, helping sick people get home. And once, helping a farmer get his horse out of a well.</p> <h3>Living at the USLSS</h3> <p>The crew spent most of their down time on the first floor (the sleeping quarters upstairs wasn't heated). The crew's quarters served as a lounging room. According to Gerald Crowner a surfman on South Manitou in 1926, \"A round oak table stood by the east window with a big oil lamp suspended over it. Near the table was a wall bookcase full of books that were seldom read. In the southeast corner stood the little stand that harbored our Monkey Ward record player and the pile of records that were so often played. The big wood burner occupied a space near the south wall, near the door that led to the hallway. Rows of hooks also lined the west wall, where one could hang up coats and caps. Six or eight chairs were lined up under the double window on the north wall that faced the bay.\"<br /> <br /> In the fall and winter months, the monotony of long cold months was broken up by sharing stories and tall tales around the wood burner. Neighbors often stopped in to add their tales. Mail days were happy days. They all looked forward to letters from home, friends, and sweethearts and often gathered at the post office at mail time waiting for the letters to be sorted.<br /> <br /> Many of the surfmen had their own, small houses nearby. This allowed them to be with their families. The surfmen had one day off every 8 days, otherwise they were on duty 24 hours a day. Regulations required the men to sleep at the station except for their day off. But some keepers were more lenient allowing men to stay in their cottages near the station where they could be called quickly to come in an emergency. This allowed the men to people spend a little more time at home.<br /> <br /> There was a telephone cable that snaked its way from Sleeping Bear Point through South Manitou on to the North Manitou Lighthouse and Coast Guard Station and homes. Gerald Crowner a South Manitou surfman in 1926 tells us, \"One of the crewmen on North Manitou played the mouth organ, and he played it beautifully. Quite often, he would call me when I had the midnight to two watch and play songs for me. He could play just about everything in the book. . . .Many times I would call Sleeping Bear Point, and he would call the operator at Maple City, and all of us would enjoy his music and carry on a four-way conversation.\"</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Located on a small beach area near the U.S. Lifesaving and Coastguard Station are 6 wooden picnic tables with attached benches. Take care as you approach the tables, as the sand underfoot may be uneven and/or dotted with small rocks and spindly plants. Only a few low white rocks situated 4 or so feet beyond the tables separate the picnic area from a short drop to the shore of Manitou Passage. Visible beyond the water is a low landmass-the Michigan mainland, and specifically Sleeping Bear Point, located about 7 miles away.",

From the Popple Campground, visitors are offered a clear view of North Manitou Island as well as easy access to the beach fronting Lake Michigan. With 7 individual campsites, this is the smallest of the island's campgrounds. Standing to the right of the narrow dirt trail leading to the campground is a wooden post supporting a small wooden sign with the word \"Popple\" carved into its face. Also carved into the sign is an upward facing arrow and an image of a tent. The campsites are nestled in dirt-floored clearings within a forest of tall leafy trees. The location of each individual campsite is marked by a wooden post measuring about 3 feet tall with a white triangle painted near the top. Each of the 7 campsites is limited to 4 people and 2 tents. Take care as you step around the campground as you may encounter some fallen logs and piles of stones near the various sites. Please note that there are no fire rings at this campground. Visitors are encouraged to bring their own water filtration equipment because there is no source of purified drinking water at the campsites. Campers are also warned to look out for poison ivy, as it is common in this area. Campers must purchase a Backcountry Use Permit before camping at any of the island's campsites.",

There are 20 individual sites and 3 group sites here, with their locations indicated by 23 wooden posts measuring about 3 feet tall and with white triangles painted near their tops. Each individual site is limited to 4 people and 2 tents. Each group site is designed to hold from 9 to 20 campers, with a maximum of 10 tents. Group sites are available by reservation only. As you walk around each campsite, you may encounter one or more wooden benches, each constructed of a single wooden timber perched atop 2 smaller wooden blocks positioned at each end. There are also several low metal community fire rings topped with metal grills. These grills can be lifted to place wood into the otherwise open rings, which measure approximately 3 feet in diameter and 4 inches high. Campers may collect dead and downed wood found on the island to make open fires in these rings during their visit. Visitors are encouraged to bring their own water filtration equipment because there is no source of purified drinking water at the campsites. Campers are also warned to look out for poison ivy, as it is common in this area. Campers must purchase a Backcountry Use Permit before camping at any of the island's campsites.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Looking to stretch your legs after taking in the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive? Check out the Shauger Hill Trail. It starts at the Scenic Drive's adjacent parking lot (just after turning off M109 and before the ranger booth) and loops through hilly, quiet woods. Shauger Hill doesn't access water or overlooks of Lake Michigan, but it's a shady escape on a hot summer day, and is especially beautiful in the fall.<br /> <br /> <b>Pets are NOT allowed on the trail from December 1 to March 31.</b><br /> <br /> The trail, an easy loop taken in an overall clockwise direction without difficult uphill sections, is about 2.4 miles and crosses the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive (paved) twice and also Shauger Hill Road (unpaved) twice.<br /> <br /> A 1.5 mile hike along the unpaved Shauger Hill Road will lead you to a swim at North Bar Lake and Lake Michigan.<br /> <br /> The Shauger Hill trail winds through mature beech-maple hardwood forests with birches fluttering gracefully in the occasional clearing. In the clockwise direction, about .3 miles from the trailhead is a beautiful large stand of mature beech. Among the maples are a number of striped maples as well as the more commonly seen red and sugar maples.<br /> <br /> Shauger Hill's wildflowers are best in the spring before the forest canopy leafs over; look for the many black raspberry bushes lining the beginning of the trail. Pick a handful to enjoy along the way.<br /> <br /> <b>Skiing Shauger Hill</b><br /> Skiers are advised to take the trail in reverse, starting from the ski trail sign at the parking lot. The downhill sections in the clockwise direction are advanced and steep and some have cut logs from trail clearings just off-trail around the bases of some of the hills.</p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year? Want to explore the landscape of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, exercise, and have fun all at the same time? Join the Trail Trekker Challenge! Earn a prize and bragging rights by successfully completing each of the 13 mainland trails in the National Lakeshore. Hiking is a great way to get daily physical exercise and promote health while also discovering the beauty of the area. What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> <br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <h3>Hike safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</strong><br /> Avoid ticks by walking in the center of trails and avoiding contact with vegetation.<br /> Use a repellent (on skin or clothing) and wear close-toed shoes, long sleeves, long pants, and socks. Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to easily spot ticks.<br /> Check your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, fallen logs, or stone walls.<br /> <br /> <strong>After being outdoors</strong><br /> Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, and remove any ticks you find.<br /> Check your clothing for ticks. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat for at least an hour.<br /> Shower soon after being outdoors; it may reduce your risk of being bitten.<br /> Check these parts of your body and your child's body for ticks:<br /> Under the arm, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, in and around hair, between the legs, around the waist.<br /> <br /> <strong>If you are bitten by a tick</strong><br /> Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it. Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible, and then slowly, but firmly, pull it straight out. Immediately wash the bite area and your hands with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic to the bite wound.<br /> Watch for signs of illness.<br />  </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Lumbering is an important component of the island's human history. The North Manitou Island Sawmill is a rare, intact example of a steam-powered lumber mill in Michigan and stands as a symbol to the island lumber industry that built two villages and brought entrepreneurs to the island and left cleared fields and forty-two miles of roads behind.<br /> <br /> The latest sawmill on the island, built in the late 1920s, was built with traditional technology of the earlier mills. The engine and equipment date from 1875, and the method of construction and layout are typical of sawmills of the late 1800s. Steam powered mills of this type, which were once common in this area, are now rare.<br /> <br /> The sawmill supplied material for building the large east side barn in 1927-28, as well as providing a continuous supply of timber and heavy planks to maintain the docks, often damaged by ice in the winter and pounding waves during storms. When MIA was expanding the island into a sportsman paradise, it put the mill back into operation: the lodge was remodeled, and a wing housing the grocery store and post office was added; the village barn was also built for dressing and packaging deer shot on the island. The mill remained active, turning out material for all island building projects including rental cottages for married staff, migrant orchard workers' cabins, and many, many shingles. The machinery was antiquated, even by 1940 standards.</p> <h3>Island deer and early deer hunts</h3> <p>Of all the wildlife located on North Manitou, the white-tailed deer is what you are most likely to see. In 1926, William R. Angell introduced six deer to the island. These few deer became the basis for a rapidly expanding herd which supported a hunting preserve for many years.<br /> <br /> The first deer hunt on North Manitou took place in 1937 with 18 deer taken. By counts in the early 1980s, there were about 2,000 deer on the island. Because there were so many deer, they would constantly browse the vegetation within their reach. Over the years, the deer have eaten off all the vegetation which was palatable to them and left that which was not. They don't really care for American beech, so you can find it growing in great abundance on the ground. The vegetation on South Manitou Island is different than that on North Manitou. South Manitou has a thick lush understory of shrubs, ferns, and vines. But the deer browse line on North Manitou is five to six feet up, giving the island a manicured look.<br /> <br /> Edgar McKee, island manger from 1937 to 1942, often served as a hunting guide (and was the guide when the first deer was shot in the fall of 1937), describes the early deer hunts. \"Hunting was divided into two, three-day sessions each week, starting around Nov 1. It would cost each hunter $150, which covered the boat trip to and from the Island, hotel and meals, a trained guide to hunt with, and a guaranteed deer. Sounds cheap, but back then that was a lot of money.<br /> <br /> The island was divided into ten sections. Each guide explored his section in advance, and knew where to find the deer. Only ten hunters were allowed to hunt at one time, and no hunter was allowed out without a guide. This was to assure safety. Also, not hunter was allowed out with a gun if there was any evidence of alcohol impairment.\"<br /> <br /> Most of the island's hunting customers were officials of large companies, invited guests of MIA members. \"None of the hardships of hunting and taking care of your deer existed then. The hunter was transported to his hunting spot and picked up at the appointed time. The hunter's job was to shoot the deer his guide pointed out to him. The guide took care of preparing the deer and dragging it to the appointed spot to be picked up.\"<br /> <br /> \"Not every hunter took home a deer. During my stay on the Island, most of the hunters killed their deer, but some didn't. It was my job to keep hanging a few choice bucks and does to supply that need. That was no problem. I would take my rifle in the company station wagon with a couple of guides, and drive through the woods. Most of the deer I shot, I shot from the window of the car. It was not unusual to take in four or five deer in on afternoon.\"<br /> <br /> North Manitou Island functioned as an exclusive hunting preserve, much in the tradition of the private hunting clubs that became popular with wealthy men during the late nineteenth century.<br /> <br /> Deer hunt still occurs in November managed under the NPS. But, unlike the hunts of Mr. McKee's time, hunters are on their own and have to find and move their deer themselves.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Located north of the North Manitou Island dock, on the north edge of the village, is the island's most recent sawmill, a long 2-story vertical wooden plank structure with a corrugated metal gable roof. Extending from the mill's upper story on one side of the building is a long, narrow addition with an intersecting gable roof, also metal. This 2nd-story addition, which resembles a covered bridge, is supported on its front end, or the end farthest from the main building, by 2 tall wooden pillars. Also attached to the main building and flanking the 2nd-story addition, which is situated about halfway between the mill's 2 ends, are 2 smaller building sections, each covered with a sloping shed roof. During the time of your visit, the open space below the 2nd-story addition may be empty or it may house large equipment or machinery. Although built around 1927, this sawmill still holds the 1875 steam engine and other equipment from the original sawmill once located south of the village. This massive metal engine, which measures about 6 feet wide by 8 feet tall, is fitted with several hinged openings on its front end. Take care as you explore the interior of the sawmill as there are a number of tripping hazards, including several long boards placed atop wooden frames. The North Manitou Island sawmill is the only known original steam-powered sawmill remaining in Michigan.",

In addition to Day and his family, the inn hosted an eclectic mix of lumberjacks, dock workers, businessmen and posh passengers. But these two types of guests were kept apart. The inn was divided into two sections: the visitors or vacationers occupied the better rooms at the front the workmen and lumbermen occupied the crowded upstairs and rear. Management even staggered meal times so that the two types of guest would rarely interact.<br /> <br /> The inn provided three good meals a day with pancakes their specialty: plain, blueberry, and strawberry. The inn did not provide alcohol (alcohol was never permitted in lumber camps because it disrupted worker's efficiency). Travelers were required to abide by those rules also. But, there is a story told about a locomotive operator forgetting to flip a switch and driving the engine right off the dock into Lake Michigan because he was inebriated.<br /> <br /> In 1928 a major renovation modified the Inn, enclosing the porch and adding a wooden stairway in the rear, the two red brick fireplaces, and interior bathrooms. These improvements allowed tourism to live on even after other area industries closed. The Sleeping Bear Inn closed in 1972.<br /> <br /> Look for a sign, high on the east facing wall, that states \"Erected in 1857.\" That was the date the original builder and proprietor, Charles C.

    "audioDescription": "A concrete sidewalk leads to the Sleeping Bear Inn garages, a long white clapboard structure consisting of a 2-story building with a black-shingled gable roof. There are 6 single garage doors ad one entry door along the front of the garage. Five single multi-paned windows line the front of the second story. Standing alongside the sidewalk to the right of the garage is a wayside panel entitled \"Taking a spin on the dunes.\" Featured on this panel a large black-and-white photo of a dark-colored mid-20th-century convertible parked lengthwise atop a sand dune's flat, level surface. The words \"Sleeping Bear Dunesmobile\" are painted in white on the car's passenger-side door. Sitting at the steering wheel is a man wearing a dark-billed white cap, presumably acting as chauffeur for the 2 people sitting in the car's rear seat. Visible beyond the car are more rolling dunes and, in the far background, 2 long hills jutting into a wide lake. Text below the wayside's title reads: Balloon tires careened along the shoreline and splashed in the shallows, its riders screaming as if on a roller coaster. With spectacular dune-top views and thrilling plummets down slopes of sand, the Sleeping Bear Dunesmobile rides became the favorite attraction for Glen Haven visitors. Marion Day Warnes and her husband Louis installed balloon tires on a 1934 Ford to create the first Dunesmobile in 1935: just 25 cents a ride. Over the next four decades, various fleets of cars and pickup trucks were adapted to transport tourists for the exciting 12-mile trip. The drivers, many of them local residents, each developed their own routine for the trip. Though fun and exciting for passengers, the dune rides were discontinued in 1978 when Louis Warnes retired and the National Park Service decided to cease their impacts on the dunes. Superimposed over the large background photo in the panel's upper right quadrant are 2 additional images. The first, which appears on the left, is a black-and-white photo of 7 men wearing shirts and ties and 2 women in belted dresses posing in front of a small clapboard building. Text painted on a sign affixed above the building's porch includes \"Sand Dune cars use Mobil gas ethyl and Mobil oil. Fill your car here and feel the difference.\" A smaller sign nailed to the central porch pillar reads \"Scenic Dune Rides Here.\" The words \"Beer and Wine\" and \"Groceries\" are painted on the building's 2 large plate-glass front windows. Lastly, pictured on the far left are 2 gas pumps topped with round signs labeled with the words \"Mobilgas\" and \"Mobilgas ethyl\" respectively. Appearing on the Mobilgas sign is the image of a galloping horse with wings-the company's Pegasus logo. The date 1939 is printed in the photo's bottom right corner. To the right of this smaller photo is the image of a red, white, and black pamphlet printed with the text: Sleeping Bear Dunes Wagon, Dune Rides. The Original Dunes Ride, Established 1935. An exciting excursion into strange, secluded desert land, over the largest shifting dunes in the U.S. Also included on the pamphlet are drawings of a curled-up bear, its head resting on its front paws, and a long red truck with an open back filled with several rows of seats. Two captions accompanying the small photo and the pamphlet tell us: The Sleeping Bear Dunes Rides operated from Glen Haven for 43 years. Passengers bought their tickets at the store. In 1978, the last year of operations, the fleet consisted of 13 \"dunes wagons\" that each carried 14 passengers on the 35-minute trip.",

You may not notice this phenomenon one day to the next, but year after year the tiny quartz grains shift little by little. Constant winds blowing off of Lake Michigan cause the dunes to migrate and expand, and for new dunes to grow.Â <br /> <br /> Over time, the drifting and accumulating sand engulfs whatever is in its path, including trees. When migrating sand moves into a wooded area, it gradually buries andÂ kills the trees. As the years pass and the sand continues on its journey, the trees are eventually uncovered. Those that remain standing appear as ghosts-dead, white, and stripped of their branches.</p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year? Want to explore the landscape of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, exercise, and have fun all at the same time? Join the Trail Trekker Challenge! Earn a prize and bragging rights by successfully completing each of the 13 mainland trails in the National Lakeshore. Hiking is a great way to get daily physical exercise and promote health while also discovering the beauty of the area. What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> <br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <h3>Hike Safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> <br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</strong><br /> Avoid ticks by walking in the center of trails and avoiding contact with vegetation.<br /> Use a repellent (on skin or clothing) and wear close-toed shoes, long sleeves, long pants, and socks.<br /> Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to easily spot ticks.<br /> Check your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, fallen logs, or stone walls.<br /> <br /> <strong>After being outdoors</strong><br /> Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, and remove any ticks you find.<br /> Check your clothing for ticks. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat for at least an hour.<br /> Shower soon after being outdoors; it may reduce your risk of being bitten.<br /> <br /> <em>Check these parts of your body and your child's body for ticks:</em><br /> Under the arm, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, in and around hair, between the legs, around the waist.<br /> <br /> <em>If you are bitten by a tick</em><br /> Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it. Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible, and then slowly, but firmly, pull it straight out. Immediately wash the bite area and your hands with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic to the bite wound.<br /> Watch for signs of illness.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The USLSS built the boat house in 1901. A wooden ramp with metal rails leads from the front of the boathouse down to a slip at the water's edge. Surfmen pushed the surfboat on its metal carriage down the ramp and into the harbor. From there, they could row or sail to ships in distress.</p> <h3>Life-Saving Equipment</h3> <p>Surfmen had a variety of life-saving equipment at their disposal. According to regulation, if one method of rescue failed surfmen were required to attempt all other available forms of rescue. Weekly drills ensured that all surfmen became proficient at using life-saving equipment. Their hard work paid off-the USLSS had an overall 99% success rate.<br /> <br /> <strong>Boats</strong><br /> Generally, the USLSS used two types of rescue boats-the lifeboat and the surfboat. The lifeboat was an English invention adopted by the USLSS. Lifeboats were self-bailing and self-righting. They could be sailed or rowed. Lifeboats were long and heavy; some measured as long as 40 feet and weighed up to 4,000 pounds! Other advantages of this boat included its stability, sturdiness, and ability to handle heavy seas. However, the weight also made the boat almost impossible to haul down the beach; instead, it had to be launched from the boathouse directly into a sheltered harbor. Later models of lifeboats were lighter and even motorized. With the addition of a motor, surfmen could travel to wrecks farther away and get there faster and with much less energy than rowing required.<br /> <br /> Surfmen also used surfboats, an American invention. Surfboats were smaller, lighter, and faster than their English counterparts. These boats sat on a carriage that surfman could haul down beaches and over dunes in order to get as close to a wreck as possible before launching directly into rough surf. The Keeper steered and the surfmen rowed. Surfboats could also carry more shipwreck victims than lifeboats, anywhere from 10-15 victims. One disadvantage was that the first surfboats were not self-righting, only self-bailing. Like the lifeboat, later models were also motorized.<br /> <br /> Eventually, most USLSS stations had both a lifeboat and a surfboat. Surprisingly, in many instances boats were not the surfmen's preferred method of rescue. Instead, surfmen and station Keepers often preferred to use breeches buoys and lifecars to rescue shipwreck victims. These methods of rescue both relied on one of the only guns designed to save lives-the Lyle gun.<br /> <br /> <strong>Lyle Gun</strong><br /> The USLSS recruited Lt. David Lyle, an Army Ordnance officer, to design a gun that would aid in shipwreck rescues. Lyle invented small, bronze cannon that sat on a wooden carriage. Depending on size, the cannon and carriage together weighed about 160 pounds. The Lyle gun and other rescue equipment were stored on a cart that the surfmen could pull down the beach, close to the wreck. Surfmen tied a line to an eye bolt screwed onto the end of a cast iron projectile and then loaded it into the cannon. A charge of black powder, up to 8 ounces, shot the projectile and line 250 to almost 700 yards. The goal was to shoot the line over a wreck so that it could be used to haul a series of other lines from the beach. Shipwreck victims attached the heaviest of these lines, the hawser, to the mast (or the sturdiest part of the wreck) while surfmen back on the beach propped up the line with a crotch. Next, surfmen could attach a breeches buoy or a lifecar to the line and haul it out to the wreck.<br /> <br /> <strong>Breeches Buoy</strong><br /> Once the surfmen set up the hawser line, they could attach a breeches buoy and send it out to the wreck. This was also referred to as the beach apparatus. The breeches buoy itself was a life preserver with a pair of canvas breeches, or shorts, sewn onto the bottom. One by one, shipwreck victims would climb into the breeches buoy and the surfmen on the shore would haul on the line, pulling them over the waves and back to shore. This was the preferred method of rescue because the surfmen stayed on the beach and because the breeches buoy was lighter and easier to haul over the beach than the heavier lifecar.<br /> <br /> <strong>Life car</strong><br /> Several designs of lifecars existed as early as the 1840s. The United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) commonly used Joseph Francis' 1847 lifecar. This iron-covered lifeboat included a deck hatch in the top used by shipwreck victims to climb inside to safety. There was room for four passengers inside this iron life-saving device. Early models were so small that passengers had to lie on top of each other in order to fit; later models were taller so that passengers could sit upright. Once the hatch was closed, the lifecar was water-tight. Two rings on top of the car allowed the heavy hawser line to pass through and surfmen could haul the lifecar to and from the shore. Small holes at the top of the lifecar let air inside. However, it would have been a dark, bumpy, uncomfortable ride.<br /> <br /> Like the breeches buoy, the lifecar had some advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage was that instead of only being able to save one victim at a time, the lifecar had room for 4 or 5 passengers. Passengers were also protected from weather, debris, and waves. However, the weight of the lifecar was a major issue. This 550 pound vessel had to be loaded into the already heavy beach cart and hauled through the sand. Surfmen were totally exhausted by the time they reached the site of the wreck, and they still had to fire the Lyle gun, ready the lifecar, and then haul on the line that pulled it out to the wreck and back.</p> <h3>Shipwreck!</h3> <p>During the heyday of shipping on the Great Lakes, the Manitou Passage served as a busy highway. Faster and safer than sailing around North and South Manitou Islands, this passage acted as a shortcut and also provided access to the deep harbor at South Manitou. Thick fog and bad storms led many ships to seek refuge in South Manitou's harbor. Lighthouses on South Manitou, North Manitou, fog signals, a lightship, and a shoal light helped guide mariners through the passage. However, the passage was also dangerous because of shallow shoals where ships could run aground. The surfmen of the United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) and later the United States Coast Guard (USCG) responded to hundreds of ships in distress. Read more about some of these incidents below.<br /> <br /> <strong><em>Walter L. Frost</em></strong><br /> On November 4, 1903 a night thick with fog, the steamer Walter L. Frost sounded distress signals when it ran aground on the southwest end of South Manitou Island. The island's USLSS crew launched their surfboat and made their way to the wreck where they attempted to free the boat by removing some of her cargo. When that failed, two tug boats attempted to tow her out, which also failed. Finally, worsening weather made freeing the steamer too dangerous and the 21 member crew abandoned her and took refuge at the Life-Saving station. The steamer and most of her cargo of corn and general merchandise were a total loss.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Congress</strong></em><br /> On October 4, 1907, the surfmen at the USLSS station on South Manitou Island received a telephone call from the island post office stating that a steamer loaded with lumber was on fire. The Keeper and his crew launched a surfboat and rowed out to the Congress. They were able to tow the steamer away from the dock and save some of the cargo, but were not able to put out the fire. The steamer continued to burn and sank later that night.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Three Brothers</strong></em><br /> The steamer Three Brothers was bound from Boyne City, MI to Chicago, IL with a load of lumber when it began taking on water during a storm. On the night of September 27, 1911 the captain ran her aground off of South Manitou Island. All thirteen aboard were saved and spent thirteen days at the South Manitou Island station. Most of the lumber aboard was salvaged, but the damage to the steamer was too expensive to repair, so she was abandoned. Eventually, shifting sand covered the Three Brothers and she became buried shortly after being abandoned. Then in 1996, the sand over the wreck washed away and exposed her for the first time in nearly 85 years! Today, the wreck is a popular dive site and is protected by the Manitou Passage Underwater Preserve.<br /> <br /> <em><strong>Fransisco Morazan</strong></em><br /> On November 29, 1960, the Liberian freighter Fransisco Morazan ran aground at the south end of South Manitou Island during a blinding snowstorm. The freighter was bound from Chicago to the St. Lawrence Seaway in order to reach Holland. The crew remained aboard the stranded ship until December 4th, when they finally abandoned her and were taken to Traverse City by the USCG. The captain never returned and today the wreck sits in about 15 feet of water.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The South Manitou Island Lifesaving Service Boathouse is located at the end of the island's long wooden dock. This one-story structure is clad in white board-and-batten siding and has a black-shingled hip roof. Jutting out just below the roofline on all 4 sides are the short ends, or tails, of several exposed rafters, also painted white. A slender brick chimney rises from one side of the roof. There are 2 doors on the structure's land side-a single wooden door on the left and one pair of wooden double doors on the right. All 3 doors are painted dark green and may or may not be positioned in their open positions during your visit. Leading up to these doors is a wide upward-sloping concrete ramp without railings. Take care as you access the boathouse from the ramp as the drop from ramp to ground is about 4 feet at its highest point, or the section closest to the building. Please note that the left-side door is nearly flush with the ramp's left edge. Standing atop an approximately 4-inch-high wooden platform on the left side of the interior is a tall counter with one sign listing departure times for the ferry boat and times for lighthouse tours and another sign that reads \"Camper Registration.\" As you enter the building, the counter's left side will be facing toward you. Situated beyond the counter's right side is a white-painted surfboat resembling a long rowboat with an upward-curving stern and bow. The boat is placed atop a wheeled platform which in turn sits atop a short section of metal railway. A sign affixed to the boat's far end indicates that this \"monomoy-type surfboat,\" which was built in 1957 by the Curtis Bay Boatyard of Baltimore, Maryland, measures 26 feet long and is constructed of double-planked wood. Additional text on the sign tells us: Rugged and seaworthy surfboats of this type served at Coast Guard shore stations throughout the Great Lakes. Though not self-bailing or self-righting, interior air cases provided flotation. These double-ended boats could be sailed or rowed. Surfboats at the South Manitou Island station were kept on the marine railway in the boathouse. There they were ready to launch in all kinds of weather. The marine railway once ran down to the water. Other features displayed inside the boathouse include a wooden table with a large raised-relief, or terrain, map of South Manitou Island covering its top surface. Featured on the map are various lines and symbols indicating the locations of hiking trails, unpaved roads, campgrounds, and buildings on the island, which is painted dark green, as well as shipwrecks visible in the surrounding water, painted blue.",

They began their married life together on March 21, 1865 in DeKalb, Illinois. Aaron, a wounded Civil War veteran, became Keeper of the South Manitou Island light in 1866. He and Julia started a family on the island, eventually having six sons! After the new 104 foot lighthouse tower was constructed, the Lighthouse Service appointed Julia as the very first Assistant Keeper, making her the only woman to officially serve at the South Manitou Island light. The Sheridan's also owned eighty acres of land on the island near Lake Florence, where they had a small farm.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, tragedy struck the Sheridan family in March of 1878, Julia, Aaron and their youngest son Robert were returning to the island when their boat capsized. All three drowned. The five other Sheridan children went to live with their grandparents in Illinois. Aaron and Julia had lived and worked at the lighthouse for twelve years. Lyman Sheridan, Aaron's cousin, succeeded him as light keeper. Today, descendants of Aaron and Julia often visit the island and work as volunteers. In 2006, the family placed grave stones for Julia, Aaron, and Robert in the island cemetery.</p> <h3>Andrew T. Burdick</h3> <p>Andrew T. Burdick was born on South Manitou Island on November 23, 1889. His parents, Andrew Putnam Burdick and Sarah Ellen Kitchen had been married since 1874. Andrew had six older siblings, five of whom survived to adulthood. His father was a farmer and he and his brothers worked on the farm and went to school at the island's one-room school house. Andrew's oldest brother, James Putnam, worked his way up the ranks at the South Manitou Island lighthouse as a Second Assistant, First Assistant, and eventually the longest-serving Keeper. His brother William also worked as Second and First Assistant. Andrew's father passed away in January 1917, leaving him the head of household on the farm. Later that year in June, Andrew registered for the draft. His draft card reveals that he was unmarried, working as a farmer, and supporting his widowed mother. He described himself as short and of medium build with blue eyes and light hair.<br /> <br /> The United States entered World War I in the spring of 1917. Private Andrew Burdick served in Company B of the 339th Regiment in the U.S. Army's 85th Division. The 85th Division headed to Camp Custer near Battle Creek, Michigan during the summer of 1918 to complete their training before departing for England. Once in England, the men of the 339th were issued Russian weapons and set sail for Archangel, Russia; their mission was unclear-originally, they were only meant to guard military stores. However, their role became much more complicated. While sailing for Archangel, an outbreak of Spanish Influenza had occurred on two out of the three transport ships. When the 339th arrived in Archangel on September 4, 1918, over a hundred men were seriously ill. Andrew Burdick died just fifteen days later on September 19, 1918 of disease at the age of twenty eight. The fall of 1918 marked the start of the worldwide influenza epidemic that claimed the lives of over fifty million people-more than died in World War I.<br /> <br /> Andrew Burdick's regiment went on to become actively engaged in fighting the Bolsheviks, who had overthrown the Russian Czar the previous year. Fighting actually continued past the end of World War I on November 11, 1918. The men of the 85th division became known as the \"Polar Bears\" because of the long winter they spent fighting Bolshevik troops. American troops were not withdrawn from northern Russia until June 1919 and finally returned to Detroit in July. Andrew Burdick was one of over two hundred casualties during the nine months the Polar Bears spent in Russia. He was eventually laid to rest on his peaceful island home.</p> <h3>Bertha Peth</h3> <p>Bertha Peth immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1881 with her parents when she was about seven years old. At some point in the early 1890s, she came to South Manitou Island to work-some people that knew her wrote that Bertha came with a visiting family as a nursemaid for their children; others stated that she was hired by a family on the island. In 1893, at the age of nineteen, she married island farmer John Hutzler in Chicago, Illinois. By 1900, the couple had one child, a son named Stanley. Tragically, Bertha and John lost their son when he was just two years old. He died in Chicago in 1901 after twenty days of illness, possibly of leukemia. Back on the island, rumors began to circulate about the cause of his death and about Bertha. In 1904, John filed for divorce which was granted the following year. Bertha may have stayed in Chicago for a time after the death of her son and divorce, but by 1920 she had returned and was living in a house in the village on South Manitou.<br /> <br /> From the 1920s through the 1940s, Bertha lived in her house in the village and supported herself in a number of ways. She operated a small store from her home, collected and sold wild ginseng, and may have done laundry for the men at the nearby U.S. Coast Guard Station. Former islanders wrote that she and John Hutzler may have helped each other even after they divorced-she baked bread for him and he chopped wood for her. Children that grew up during that time on the island later shared very fond memories of Bertha. Former islanders, like Ronald Rosie, described her as being \"always at a trot\" as she walked around the island, looking for ginseng. Ronald's friend, John Tobin said that he thought the world of Bertha and described her as very motherly, even though she was something of a character. He also mentioned that she \"always had candy.\" Visiting her small store to pick out candy and gum was a treat for school children and many returned to visit her as adults, even after moving off of the island.<br /> According to an article from a Benzie County newspaper published in Charles M. Anderson's memoir of his childhood on the island, Bertha left South Manitou when she was eighty-two. She had injured her eye and the U.S. Coast Guard transported her to the hospital in Frankfort. She then moved into a nursing home on the mainland. Apparently, Bertha had once spent a period of over twenty years on South Manitou without leaving-earning her the nickname of \"Queen of the Island.\" Bertha died in 1953. Her story is still well known by many who visit South Manitou today.</p> <h3>Ronald W. Riker</h3> <p>Ronald Riker arrived on South Manitou Island with his parents, Ed and Esther, and his two older brothers in 1953 when he was just a year and half old. His parents had been hired by William Boals of the Lee Island Company, a group that purchased several farms on the island in the late 1940s and attempted to start a resort business. In addition to tourism, the Lee Island Company also continued some farming and started a small Hereford cattle operation. The Rikers came to work as tenant farmers and raise cattle, but also ran tours of the island for summer visitors. At one point, they were the only year-round residents living on South Manitou.<br /> <br /> When the Riker boys got older, they attended school and lived on the mainland during the school year with their mother, returning to the island in the summer time. Tragically during the summer of 1967, sixteen year old Ronald drowned while exploring the wreck of the Fransisco Morazon with friends. Ed and Esther Riker continued to work for the Lee Island Company until South Manitou Island became a part of the newly-established Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. In 1972, they were the last permanent residents to leave the island. In 2005, Ed and Esther were buried near Ronald in the island cemetery.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Located about 2 miles from the South Manitou Island village is the island's main cemetery, which can be reached by hiking one mile north of the island's schoolhouse on Ohio Road. Here you will find about 2 dozen granite or marble headstones and smaller grave markers indicating the final resting places of several descendants of the island's earliest settlers. All of these markers bear dates from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Families represented here include Burdick, Beck, Sheridan, Haas, Hutzler, and Peth. Two short sticks, each holding a United States flag, and, below the flag, a round brass medallion adorned with a star marked \"U.S.\" in its center, are planted alongside the graves of Aaron A. Sheridan, who lived from 1834 to 1878, and Private Andrew T. Burdick, who lived from 1889 to 1918. The men's respective headstones also tell us that Sheridan served as a corporal in the 13 Illinois Infantry during the Civil War and acted as South Manitou's Lighthouse Keeper from 1866 until his death and that Burdick served in Company B of the 339th Infantry. Although most of the headstones are scattered about with large areas of grass between them, take care as you walk around the cemetery as the ground is hilly in several spots and you may encounter a number of tall shade trees and small bushes.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Today a trip to South Manitou Island can feel like visiting a ghost town. Yet less than a century ago, this island was a bustling logging, farming, and maritime community. Native Americans used South Manitou seasonally for fishing and hunting. They were followed by the first permanent settlers, who began to arrive in the 1830s.<br /> <br /> The island's location along a major shipping channel, the Manitou Passage, and its deep harbor made it a logical place to seek refuge during bad weather. Steamships also needed to refuel with wood cut from the island's forests. Some of South Manitou Island's very first permanent settlers made a living cutting and selling cord word to passing steamships. Logging also soon became a profitable business.<br /> <br /> Once many of the island's hardwood forests were cleared, islanders made a living by farming and fishing. With the increase of commerce and shipping in the area, shipwrecks began to occur at a higher frequency.<br /> <br /> In order to provide aid to mariners, the federal government provided funds for the construction of the first South Manitou Island Lighthouse in 1839 and a United States Life-Saving Service Station in 1901. The men of the Lighthouse and Life-Saving Service and their families quickly became a part of the small island community.<br /> <br /> South Manitou Island was a close-knit, interdependent community. Everyone on the island knew everybody else. Admiral Willard Smith grew up on the island in the 1920s; and according to Admiral Smith, \"growing up on SMI was probably the greatest experience a youngster could have. You had an island with a nice little lake in the middle of it, sand hills and woods, that was your backyard. You could go anyplace you wanted and do anything you wanted to do, and it was a great place to be a small boy.<br /> <br /> The island children liked to watch the beach cart drill, the firing of the little cannon. The children had to stay out of the way as the crew set up the drill, but they would let the children ride down on the beaches buoy once in a while. The surfmen taught the children about signaling, how to tie knots and hand lines, and how to make bow and arrows.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The South Manitou Island dock is located on the southernmost tip of the Crescent Bay shoreline on the island's eastern side. This is where the passenger ferry arrives and departs. As you face in from the water, the first dock section you will encounter is a narrow L-shaped wooden platform or pier built over the water atop thick wooden pilings. This dock section extends several feet onto shore where it eventually transitions into a sandy path running to the right of the island's boathouse. Both this pier and the wooden walkway that continues on shore are flanked by evenly spaced wooden posts, or bollards, on both sides. Situated to the left of this narrow section is a wider wooden section, spanning about 25 feet across, that extends inland to the island's boathouse. This section also once served as a boat launch for Coast Guard vessels. Take care as you step along this central dock section as it slants slightly upward and is elevated a few feet above the ground as you near the wide doors leading into the boathouse. There are no railings. Finally, to the left of the wider dock section is a wooden ramp, about 8 feet wide, that slopes downward to a paved path that runs along the left side of the boathouse. This third ramp, also without railings, is wheelchair accessible. Flanking each side of the boathouse, and level with the wide central dock section, is a small wooden platform measuring about 2½ feet square. Four steps on the front of each platform, or the side facing the bay, lead to the ground below. There are wooden railings on the platforms' backs and the steps' outside edges only. To the left of the paved path extending from the wheelchair ramp and leading into the South Manitou Island village is a metal bench with a slat back, its long side facing you.",

Wages were low and teachers were charged room and board, but teaching was one of the few occupations open to women on the island.<br /> <br /> The schoolhouse on SMI served as one of the centers of the community. It was here that families gathered for plays, school picnics, and meetings. At Christmas time, the students cut down a tree from the woods nearby and ornamented it with homemade decorations. At recess, they fished in nearby Lake Florence, played ball in the field across from the school house, and had picnics. The schoolhouse was in operation until the early 1940s.</p> <h3>Island Teaching</h3> <p>The young women and men who worked as teachers here were responsible for teaching grades one through eight. Many local teachers, especially women, worked as teachers and lived at home with their parents. Occasionally a teacher from the mainland came to work on the island and boarded with the families of the children that they taught. Teachers had to pump water from the well, split wood, and build a fire in the stove before the students arrived in the morning.<br /> One young teacher, Myrtle Kelderhouse, later wrote of her three years teaching on the island that she acted as a teacher, principal, school nurse, and custodian! Myrtle also wrote: \"What a wonderful place to teach, with nature right at your doorstep-the many beautiful trees, the wild flowers, the farmland, all . surrounded by the beauty of Lake Michigan.\"</p> <h3>Raising the Dickens</h3> <p>Living on a remote island in Lake Michigan posed many challenges for the people that called this place home. But for the children who grew up here, life was something of an adventure! Ronald Rosie, Jr. and John Tobin spent their childhood on South Manitou and were the best of friends. Ron's father served as an Assistant Keeper of the South Manitou Island Lighthouse and Ron lived in the Keeper's Quarters with his parents and his younger brother, Roger. John Tobin's father worked for the United States Coast Guard on the island until World War II began. Ron and John attended school at the island's one-room schoolhouse in the mid-1930s. During their long walks to and from school they picked berries, played games, and stopped at Bertha Peth's house to buy candy from her store. The boys enjoyed fishing in Lake Florence at recess and playing in the wigwam they built across the road from the school. The schoolchildren also had fun putting on school plays at the Coast Guard station; islanders flocked to social events, taking advantage of the opportunity for some entertainment.<br /> <br /> The Coast Guard station provided an almost constant source of entertainment for the children, who often showed up to watch the daily and weekly life-saving drills. One time, John, a self-proclaimed \"stinker\" and \"rascal\" took a bullet from the Coast Guard station and snuck it to school with him the next day. As he sat at his desk, he looked at the lunch pails lined up on top of the wood-burning stove that kept the school warm, and decided that it might \"be kind of interesting\" to see what would happen if he put the bullet in the stove. When his teacher's back was turned, John made a dash for the stove and threw in the bullet. After a moment, it exploded, causing the lids of the lunch pails to fly off and soup and left-over supper splattered all over the room! Years later, John spoke of his adventures with his old pal, Ron and said, \"...me and him played together...I was up there and run them hallways...all over the place, me and Ronald...we'd go down there and raise the dickens.\" He also said: \"...to me, what I remember is we had a lot of fun.\" And they certainly did!</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A short hike north on Ohio Road leads to the South Manitou Island Schoolhouse, a one-room school built in 1899. This small white clapboard building with gable roof features an open bell tower-also with a gable roof-and a sloping shed roof tucked under the structure's large triangular front gable. This shed roof shelters an enclosed entrance vestibule spanning the width of the building. There are no windows on the front of this building section, just a single wooden entrance door. Two tall metal pipes jut out from the shed roof's left side. As you walk the worn path to the schoolhouse, you will encounter a small square wooden platform, about 4 or 5 inches high, placed in front of the lowest of 3 concrete steps leading up to the entrance door. There are no railings alongside the platform, steps, or the small stoop in front of the door. Arranged in 3 vertical rows on the building interior's plank wood floor are several small wooden desks with attached benches and filigree metal frames with feet. Placed in the middle of the room a few feet behind the 3 desks forming the middle row is an iron wood stove without its stove pipe. Other objects include a larger wooden desk and chair placed at an angle in the room's front left corner just to the right of one of several windows running along the left-hand wall; a flagpole-without its flag-placed in the room's front right corner; and, hanging on the wall to the left of the flagpole, portraits of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln respectively. Next draw your attention to a stool holding a conical light-colored cap with the word \"dunce\" printed on it in dark lettering. Beside the cap is a sign entitled \"Dunce Cap.\" Text below this title tells us: The dunce cap comes from a 13th century Scottish philosopher named John Duns Scotus. He believed that the conical hats actually increased learning potential. He theorized that knowledge is centralized at the apex and then funneled down into the mind of the wearer. He was widely praised in his day but eventually fell out of intellectual favor. His \"duns cap\" was an obvious target of derision and came to symbolize stupidity. The logic behind the dunce cap is that it makes slow students learn better but was later used to humiliate the wearer and motivate students to try harder. Also featured is a small dark-brown wooden plaque with one chipped corner and its surface worn from age. Text carved into the wood reads: \"To have a true friend is to have true wealth.\"",

Islanders bought the staples which could not be produced on the island, such as tea, coffee, salt, flour, sugar, molasses, and spices.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A paved walkway leads to the South Manitou Island Visitor Center, a one-story white clapboard building with several black-shingled gable roofs. Four steps flanked by railings on both sides lead up to a small stoop situated in front of the center's entrance door, which is located near the left end of the building. Inside this visitor center you will find a collection of historic photos and artifacts as well as informational pamphlets about the area. Positioned alongside, and standing parallel to, the walkway's left edge a few yards from the building is a white-painted wooden frame measuring about 6 feet wide and 5 feet high. Suspended from 2 short metal chains attached to the frame's horizontal top section is a sign that reads \"Visitor Center.\" Standing to the right of the sign, and also positioned parallel to the walkway, is a white-painted bench with the date 1939 carved into one side. As you near the steps, the walkway is flanked by a drinking fountain on the left and a small sign bolted to a low post on the right. The sign, which stands between 2 tall trees, reads \"Please leave backpack outside.\" Displayed on the grassy yard to the right of the walkway are 4 large vintage machines constructed of either wood or metal rusted from the elements. These include a road grader, a disc tiller, a hay rake, and the lower section of a wooden wagon frame. Standing in front of the wagon frame is a tall pole supporting a large metal foghorn. Take care as you explore these features as they may present tripping hazards. Artifacts found inside the visitor center include a series of wooden mailboxes situated behind a counter dating to the time when this building housed the island's general store and post office. Text on a small sign placed atop the counter tells us the names of islanders are written inside each box and that the storekeeper and post mistress kept the change maker and money box hidden below the counter. Another sign, entitled \"In This Old House,\" tells us that Thomas Thompson built the house for his wife Matilda \"Hattie\" Beck around 1903, the same year he won the mail contract. Thomas made the mail run between the island and Glen Haven for 7 years until his death by drowning in 1910. Hattie, who later remarried, assumed the job of island postmistress and made this house the island post office. Following ownership by several other island families, the post office closed in the late 1940s. The building was sold to the National Park Service in 1971 and became the island's visitor center in 1975. Following a series of building rehabilitation projects including the addition of dry wall, woodwork refinishing, and foundation reinforcement, new exhibits were installed in 2015 and 2016.",

    "bodyText": "<p>For nearly a century, lighthouse keepers kept a light burning at the top of this 104 foot tower to guide mariners through the dangerous Manitou Passage. This passage between the mainland and the Manitou Islands once served as a busy transportation highway for schooners and steamships loaded with cargo and passengers bound for large ports like Chicago and Milwaukee. South Manitou Island also provided the only deep, natural harbor between Chicago and the Straits of Mackinaw where ships could seek shelter during storms. Additionally, the island's dense hardwood forest provided an abundant supply of cordwood for steamships needing to refuel.<br /> <br /> The United States Lighthouse Service recognized the need for a navigational beacon in this hazardous but busy passage and authorized construction of the first South Manitou Island light in 1838. Not much is known about this first building, other than its critical role as the only light in the area for at least a decade. In 1858, construction of a new Keeper's Quarters with a 35 foot tower and a separate fog signal building began. The current lighthouse's construction commenced in 1871 after the Lighthouse Service realized that the island's harbor was one of the most heavily used refuges on the Great Lakes. The 104 foot tower raised the focal plane of the light to 100 feet while the new Third Order Fresnel Lens projected the light 17¾ miles.<br /> <br /> In 1939, the federal government transferred management of all lighthouses to the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The USCG ceased operations of the South Manitou Island light in 1958. Today you can climb the 117 steps to the balcony, see the replica Fresnel lens above you, and enjoy a spectacular view of the Manitou Passage and South Manitou Island!<br /> <br /> <b>Hours</b><br /> The South Manitou Island Lighthouse tower is open for tours during the summer months. No admission is charged.</p> <h3>Fresnel Lens</h3> <p>In 1822, French physicist Augustin Fresnel invented a lens that transformed lighthouse technology. This beehive-like lens is comprised of many glass prisms held in place by a brass frame. The lens houses a light which the glass prisms reflect, refract, and magnify. This lens is more effective than an open flame or a light with a reflector behind it; open flames lose 97% of their light, lights with reflectors lose 60-80%, while lights within a Fresnel lens only lose 20%. Prior to the Fresnel lens, the furthest a lighthouse light could be seen was 12 miles. The Fresnel lens increased that distance to a maximum of 20 miles-all the way to the horizon! The size of the lens determines the distance the light can be seen. Originally there were seven orders, or sizes, of Fresnel lenses.<br /> <br /> The Fresnel lens also allowed for lighthouses to be distinguished from one another at night when the tower and accompanying buildings were not visible. The combination of different flash patterns and colored lights gave mariners the ability to know exactly which lighthouse they were passing, and therefore what dangers might lie ahead and where they might be able to take refuge.<br /> <br /> Once the United States Coast Guard decommissioned the South Manitou Island light in 1958, the tower and sat dark and quiet on the shores of South Manitou Island for over 50 years. Luckily in 2009, after a restoration of the lantern room and staircase, and with help from park partners, volunteers and park service staff installed a new lamp and replica lens. Today, you can see the light shine once again from the top of this century-old sentinel every night from May to October.</p> <h3>Outbuildings</h3> <p><strong>Whistle Shed and Fuel Storage</strong><br /> <strong>Whistle Shed</strong><br /> Sometimes the fog rolling in off of Lake Michigan was so thick, mariners could not see the lighthouse or the light. So the Keeper and his assistants used a fog bell and later a fog whistle as a verbal warning to those making their way through the Manitou Passage. The first fog bell was installed in 1839 and was in use until 1874 when the light station received what was possibly the first steam-powered fog signal whistle on the Great Lakes.<br /> <br /> Imagine what it might have been like to live here at the light station on a foggy day. Ronald Rosie, the son of the last lighthouse keeper before the United States Coast Guard assumed responsibility of the light, spoke about the fog horn. He said, \"...you could blow that fog horn for three or four days and we never heard it in the house...we had to listen to see if it was blowing...you got used to it, you didn't pay attention to the darn thing.\"<br /> <br /> <strong>Oil Shed</strong><br /> This small, circular structure is made of metal and was used to store oil and other flammable fuels such as kerosene used to power the lighthouse's lamp. The lighthouse service chose to construct the building out of metal to reduce the risk of fire should the fuel ignite.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fuel Storage/Magazine</strong><br /> This simple brick building with a metal roof was used to store flammable fuel, such as the kerosene used in the lamp housed inside the Fresnel lens. Each morning, the keeper or his assistants filled buckets with kerosene and carried them up the 117 steps to the top of the tower. They refilled the lamp so that it was ready to be lit as the sun was setting that evening. On bad weather days, the lamp might be lit all day and all night, requiring several trips to the fuel storage shed. A Fourth Order Fresnel lens consumed about 5.25 ounces of fuel per hour and a Third Order lens about 7 ounces. Prior to kerosene, whale oil was a common fuel used in the lamps.</p> <h3>Life of a Keeper</h3> <p><strong>Daily Life</strong><br /> From 1840 to 1939, 17 lighthouse keepers and 32 assistants faithfully tended to the South Manitou Island Lighthouse along with help from their families. The life of a lighthouse keeper, though often romanticized, was a difficult job. Keepers and assistants spent most of their time with the very unromantic task of cleaning. They cleaned the glass of the lamp and the prisms of the Fresnel lens every morning. They also had to occasionally polish the lens prisms and the brass framework with special polish.<br /> <br /> Reflectors around the lamp needed dusting and polishing, too. The revolving mechanism and associated clockwork that made the lens rotate had to be cleaned of dust and oiled regularly. The floors and stairs were to be kept clean and free of dust, debris, and residue. Besides this daily and weekly maintenance, keepers were also responsible for painting the lighthouse, inside and out, whenever needed. They also kept the whistle shed, steam whistle, and Keeper's Quarters clean and tidy. Other mundane, but necessary duties include keeping track of all supplies used (including food and household items, such as soap) on a daily basis in order to report back to the Lighthouse Service.<br /> <br /> All of these tasks were necessary to keep the light burning bright all night long and during foul weather. The true job of keepers and assistants was to keep mariners safe, after all. Because of this, the light itself was almost always constantly attended to-especially during storms. Keepers and assistants kept watch from the lookout room below the balcony; they noted the condition of the light and the fog signal, kept track of shipwrecks and offered aid to shipwreck victims when necessary. The lighthouse complex could never be left unattended, so either the keeper or one of his assistants was always on duty.<br /> <br /> Isolated duty stations often meant that life as a lighthouse keeper could be very lonely; however, the keepers at South Manitou were lucky. Even though they lived on an island, the small community of farmers, fishermen, and the United States Life Saving Service crew kept life interesting. One advantage of being a lighthouse keeper, even if you lived in a remote location, was being able to have your family with you. Wives often served as Assistant Keepers. Children helped with the many chores around the station and helped tend to gardens and livestock. They had some time for fun, too! The keeper's children attended school at the island's one room school house and had their friends over to play. One of these island children, John Tobin, fondly recalled spending time with his Ron Rosie, the assistant lighthouse keeper's son. He said in an oral history interview: \"His dad was the lighthouse keeper...I was up there and run them hallways...all over the place, me and Ronald...we'd go down there and raise the dickens.\"<br /> <br /> <strong>The Sheridan Family Tragedy</strong><br /> Life at a lighthouse could also be dangerous. Lake Michigan is an inland sea with dangerous gales, fog, snow, and ice. Living on South Manitou Island meant that if the weather was foul, or you were iced-in, you could be stranded on the island and cut off from medical help, supplies, and mail for long periods of time. Accidents didn't just happen to ships sailing through the Manitou Passage, but to those that lived on the island as well. There are many harrowing tales of accidents and illness on South Manitou, but one of the most tragic is that of Julia and Aaron Sheridan.<br /> <br /> Aaron Sheridan, a Civil War veteran, became Keeper of the South Manitou Island light in 1866. He and his wife Julia started a family on the island, eventually having six sons! After the new 104 foot lighthouse tower was constructed, the Lighthouse Service appointed Julia as the very first Assistant Keeper, making her the only woman to officially serve at the South Manitou Island light. In March of 1878, Julia, Aaron and their youngest son Robert were returning to the island from a boat ride. The boat capsized and tragically, all three Sheridan's drowned. Their five other children went to live with their grandparents. Today, descendants of Aaron and Julia often visit the island and share their story. They placed grave stones for Julia, Aaron, and Robert in the island cemetery in 2006.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Last Lighthouse Keeper</strong><br /> Ronald Rose, Sr. became the last Assistant Keeper of the South Manitou Island Light. He and his wife, Johanna, and two sons, Ronald, Jr. (Ron) and Roger, arrived in 1935. They lived in the Keeper's Quarters for four years before Ronald was transferred to another lighthouse. In 2009, Ron was interviewed about his boyhood on the island as a part of an oral history project for Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. He shared many stories about the work of a lighthouse keeper, attending school at the one-room schoolhouse, and becoming friends with other members of the island community. In the clip below, listen to Ron describe how his father lit the light every night and how the fog horn functioned.</p>",

They also owned sheep, pigs, chickens, and a few dairy cattle.<br /> <br /> Electricity came to the farm in 1945; the Thoresons bought their first tractor in 1947 and purchased a milking machine in 1949.<br /> John and Ingeborg emigrated from Norway on the same boat, but according to family lore, they never really met on the boat. Ingeborg resided with the higher-priced ticket holders, while John remained below deck with the lower-fare travelers. Along with their sons Ole and Fred, they built the farm around 1890. Ole and Fred Thoreson and Ole's son Leonard ran the farm though the 1950's.<br /> <br /> According to Leonard Thoreson, Port Oneida was the best place in the world to grow up. The neighbors had many good times together but worked hard. \"The farmers all pulled together and thrashed & filled silo and worked together; anybody that needed help buzzing wood, they all helped. The more you helped somebody else, the more people you had to help you on yours.\"<br /> <br /> The Thoresons were welcoming and always seemed to have a someone staying with them. They took care of sick neighbors and hired others who needed money.

    "audioDescription": "A gravel driveway leads through a vast grassy field to the Thoreson Farm, located on the west side of Thoreson Road about 2 miles from M-22. This farm, which is situated near the Lake Michigan bluffs, is one of 18 historical farms located in the Port Oneida Rural Historic District. There are several buildings still standing at the farm, including a 2-story white clapboard farmhouse with a concrete front porch stretching across about two-thirds of the building's front side. There is one concrete step leading up from the grass to the porch, whose roof is supported by 3 thin pillars. There are 2 gables on the front of the farmhouse, one topping the 2-story section to the left of the porch, and one above the porch roof. Affixed on each gable just below the roofline and above their respective windows are decorative wood panels-one, a half-circle, the other, a triangle-each painted with a red and white sunburst design. Other buildings at the farm include a 2-story red clapboard granary building with center gable and sloping shed roof on one end; a large weathered wood barn with a tall central gable, a long one-story wood building with a rusty metal roof, a fieldstone building with large white-painted double doors but no windows; and a small white-painted stone milk house with one side built into the adjacent hill. Located alongside the driveway are 2 additional small white clapboard buildings placed side by side. A cutout on the door of one of the building is shaped like a crescent moon with its open side facing right. This is the farm's outhouse. One additional structure is the farm's corncrib, a narrow building with outward-slanting sides constructed of red-painted wooden slats stacked horizontally with wide gaps left between them. The building's back end has the same slat construction, whereas the building's front end has a single white wooden door, shaded by the structure's overhanging gable roof. Located behind and to one side of the corncrib is a rectangular concrete trough, its thick walls measuring about 2 feet high. A short metal pole topped with a bright blue handle-a water pum-stands in the grass to one side of the long, narrow trough.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Considered a special treat within the lakeshore, the Treat Farm is one of the most underrated attractions. A hike through the woods along the old road leads to the fascinating old farmhouse and related buildings.<br /> <br /> <b>Leashed pets are allowed on the trail.</b><br /> <br /> Charles Treat was a farmer and an engineer. He and his wife Martha purchased 220 acres including several buildings from John Tweddle (of the nearby Tweddle Farm) in 1912.<br /> <br /> The farm is of historic and cultural importance and is also one of the most beautiful areas for spring wildflowers in Michigan.<br /> The farmhouse is a white two story building built by the Tweddles. Later the Treats rebuilt the front porch, adding a concrete foundation and a workshop with a metalworking forge under the porch. There was no running water at the house and a deep well dug to provide running water silted up quickly and completely. The Treats modified the gutter system of the house to direct rainwater from the roof to a cistern built into the ground in the back of the house and then hand pumped water into the kitchen.<br /> The barn, restored in 2004, is a steep roofed vertically planked structure with an imposing prow covering the barn's pulley, which was \"mostly used for raising hay into the hayloft.\" Treat bought the barn in the Detroit area. He had it disassembled, had each piece numbered, and had it shipped to the farm where he reassembled it on a concrete foundation which he poured.<br /> <br /> A concrete root cellar built into a hill is the smaller of two structures which show Treat's ongoing interest in working with reinforced concrete.<br /> <br /> There is a larger circular garage which Treat built using four-inch thick reinforced concrete wall, poured a bucket of concrete at a time. The roof was 2.5 inches thick made of reinforced concrete with a frame of heavy cedar and a hand set spiral network of steel bar for reinforcement.<br /> <br /> There are several other buildings including a woodshed and machine sheds for storing farm equipment.<br /> <br /> The Treat Farm was primarily a subsistence farm. They grew asparagus, beans, plums, apples, potatoes and raspberries among other plants, mostly for their own consumption. They raised corn and hay for animal feed. They maintained a small dairy herd and raised chickens as well, and despite the poor soil, continued farming into the 1930's.</p> <h3>Lake Overlook</h3> <p>After exploring the Treat Farm, hike through poplars and other unique foliage to the ridge above the water for a breathtaking view of Lake Michigan and the surrounding beach and dunes. Climb to the top of Old Baldy (you can't miss it) for a wide-open Lake Michigan view and an up-close-and-personal look at the Empire Bluffs immediately to the north.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Charles H. Treat Farm is situated at the end of a ½-mile-long trail that leads slightly uphill from the corner of Norconk Road through a portion of the maple-beech forest. The buildings still remaining at this farm include a 2-story gable-roofed farmhouse dating to around 1880, a barn, a concrete garage, a root cellar, a machine shed, and a chicken coop. The final approach to the farm is a wide grassy path running through a clearing flanked by low vegetation. The Treat farmhouse, which is clad in white clapboard, has a porch situated on its left side as you approach from the grassy path. A set of 4 concrete steps flanked by low concrete barrier walls on both sides leads up to the rightmost end of the porch, which is edged by a concrete kick wall on 2 sides. Supporting the porch's shed roof are 4 square white-painted pillars positioned atop the kick wall near the roof's front edge. The porch holds a picnic table with attached benches; you will encounter one end of this table a few feet to your left as you step onto the porch. Protruding from the house to the right of the porch, and tucked below a secondary gable on the main structure, is a 4-sided building appendage resembling a bay window with a foundation. At least 2 of the 4 windows on this appendage are boarded up while the others are covered by louvered shutters. Located about 4 feet from the rear of the house, and jutting up about 6 inches from the ground, is the round concrete cap of the farmhouse cistern. Placed atop this cap, which measures about 3 feet in diameter, is a wooden frame consisting of a flat board with a short leg on each end. Hanging from the nearby roof is a section of a metal gutter once used to drain rainwater into the cistern. Take care as you approach the cistern as the wooden frame, which is positioned perpendicular to the house, juts out several inches beyond the cap's edge. Two additional structures at the farm include a garage with a concrete dome roof and a rounded concrete root cellar built into the hill near the garage. The garage and the root cellar each have 2 wide metal doors with a single padlock in the center.",

    "bodyText": "<p>In 1895 or 1896, a solid-looking shingle-style cottage was constructed here by a couple known as Mr. and Mrs. Hewitt. Shirley Foote Alford described the Hewitts' Cottage Row house, furnished in burlap and calico, as \"the prettiest cottage of all.<br /> <br /> A few years later the Hewitts, who were immigrants from England, sold the cottage to Dr. John Edwin and Louise Rhoades. In a wooded area adjacent to the cottage, the Rhoades built a small play house for their daughter, Margaret. Later, after Margaret married Roderick Peattie, a lower floor was added to the play house, transforming it into a small, two-story, private cottage for Margaret and Roderick called \"the treehouse.\"<br /> <br /> In 1927, soon after inheriting her parent's cottage, Margaret Peattie sold the property to the Manitou Island Association. Jean Lundquist recalled that sometime during 1937-1950s the tree house was occupied by an American Indian man named Raphael. The cottage eventually fell into disuse and was torn down by the Manitou Island Association. However, Margaret and Roderick Peattie's \"treehouse\" remains standing on the site.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex. It was the island's only speculative resort enterprise, the first of several efforts to turn the island into an exclusive retreat. The individually owned cottages were supported by a communal kitchen and dining facility. This resort setup was common during the nineteenth century and represents a broad trend in recreation on the Great Lakes region.<br /> <br /> The buildings face eastward to take advantage of off-shore breezes, as well as superb views of the Manitou Passage and the Michigan mainland. From this prime vantage point, the summer residents could monitor activities of the life-saving service station, as well as steamship traffic through the passage. The configuration of the Cottage Row parcels and accompanying deed restrictions ensured that each property owner would have an unobstructed view of the beach and the Manitou Passage. A board walk, shaded by sugar maple and Norway maple trees, once extended along this area.<br /> <br /> The Cottage Row colony provided seasonal employment for year-round island residents. Wives and children of North Manitou farmers and U. S. Life-Saving Service crewmen residents took jobs cooking, cleaning, and doing other domestic chores for Cottage Row residents, in the communal dining room, and at hotel operated by Katie Shepard. For the island's year-round residents, the colony represented a significant source of supplemental cash income. Although some of the cottage owners maintained small gardens, the hotel and summer visitors also provided a much-needed local market for fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, and dairy products.<br /> <br /> Because residents and guests took meals at the communal dining room located at the northern end of Cottage Row, individual cottages originally lacked kitchens. After the Cottage Row dining room closed around 1900, Katie Shepard opened her home as a hotel and offered meals to summer residents in a detached dining pavilion. Rear kitchen ells later were added to several Cottage Row houses. Most of the additions probably were constructed during the early 1930s, shortly after Katie Shepard closed her hotel and dining room.<br /> <br /> Getting to and from the island and their cottages wasn't always easy as Mrs. Shirley Foote Alford (whose family built one of the first cottages in 1894) explained:<br /> \"When people were planning to leave the island, their trunks were loaded on the farm wagon which would go to the top of the hill running down to the dock. There the wagon would wait until the steamer came in close and blew her whistle. If it was three whistles, wagon and people hurried down to the dock to see the boat land. If four whistles were sounded (urgent-danger and distress signal). We all went down as fast as possible to the Life Saving Station where passengers, trunks, baby carriages, ice boxes, etc. were taken out to the steamer in the Life-Saving Service surfboat, rowed by the crew, each man with an oar and the captain steering with a long oar in the stern.\"</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Backed by woods and standing beside a tree stump measuring about 4 feet tall is a 2-story weathered gray clapboard structure with a side-facing gable roof and a foundation faced with wooden shingles. This building was once a private cottage known as the Treehouse. The Treehouse began as a play house for the daughter of the Rhoades family, who lived in the main cottage on this lot in the early 1900s. The main cottage, which was built by the Hewitt family around 1895, is no longer standing. Located to the right of the structure's right-most upper-story window, and situated at least 12 feet above the grassy ground, is a rectangular door opening covered with a wooden board. Two of the 3 small windows here also appear to be at least partially boarded up. There are no doors at ground level on this side of the building. Directly behind the tree trunk, which is situated near the building facade's left side, is a small one-story addition with a shed roof that extends from the building's left end.

Based on a dog-trot architectural plan; its rooms are arranged along each side of a covered breezeway, with the doors opening into the central passage.<br /> <br /> The origins of the dog-trot plan are traced to the gulf coast area of Mississippi, where it later evolved into a bungalow house type, with a breezeway that was enclosed to form a central room, one or two fireplaces, and a gallery or verandah that extended across the front of the house. The verandah was positioned to capture on-shore/off-shore breezes to cool the house naturally.<br /> How the dog-trot bungalow house type was transported to a remote comer of northern Michigan, far removed from coastal Mississippi, is a mystery that has prompted considerable speculation among architectural historians.<br /> <br /> The Trude cottage, like all of the other Cottage Row houses, originally did not have a dining room or kitchen, as residents took meals at the communal dining hall located at the northern end of the row. As with the other Cottage Row houses, a kitchen was added to the Trude cottage after the closing of Katie Shepard's dining room during the 1930s. The addition also included an indoor bathroom, although the cottage remained without electrical service. The interior walls of the cottage were not plastered; rather, decorative moldings were added in the spaces between structural members, and all of the exposed wood surfaces were varnished.<br /> <br /> The broad front gallery of the Trude cottage takes advantage of the building's orientation toward the Manitou Passage. Located behind the Trude cottage are a water cistern, an automobile garage, a storage shed, and a privy.<br /> <br /> Ornamental vegetation includes a lilac shrub located south of the house, and a cluster of lilacs growing in front of the house, at the edge of the bluff.</p> <h3>Wouldn't we all love a cottage on Cottage Row</h3> <p>The Cottage Row district is a linear cluster of small, wood-frame houses and other landscape elements sitting along the crest of the beach ridge that overlooks the Life-saving Service complex.

    "audioDescription": "The Frederick and Mary Trude Cottage is a one-story white clapboard building with a gray-shingled hip roof and a wide front porch. Supporting the section of the hip roof shading the slightly elevated porch are 4 square pillars, 2 of them flanking the porch's approximately 8-foot-wide entrance opening. Like the Monte Carlo Cottage, this cottage was based on the \"dog-trot\" architectural plan. Situated in front of the porch and bridging a small gap between the sloping ground and the base of the porch, is a small rectangular concrete area resembling a flat stoop. You must take a single step up from this stoop to reach the wooden porch floor. There are no railings flanking the stoop, but the porch itself is edged on its front and both ends with flat wooden railings mounted atop a series of evenly spaced square wooden balusters. Both the balusters and the railings-which are about 3 feet high on the front of the porch and 4 feet high on the ends-are painted white. There are 4 double-hung windows on the building's facade, 2 each flanking the central entrance door, which is painted dark green with a grid of glass panes filling its top half. The rear of the cottage extends well into the lot's back yard, with an additional entrance on its right side. A single brick chimney juts from the roof. Situated behind and to the right of the cottage is a smaller white clapboard building, also with a dark-shingled hip roof and a single door and a small square window located on its front side. Dotting the yard surrounding both the cottage and the smaller building are several tall shade trees.",

    "bodyText": "<p>This picturesque farm was home to the Tweddle family. John Tweddle originally settled in this area around 1840 and built a one room log cabin at the present site of the Treat Farm about ½ mile due west from here. The family built the larger house, now known as the Treat Farmhouse, around 1880, and, around 1895, they moved down to this site at the corner of Norconk Road. Sometime later, the Crouch family purchased the farm from the Tweddle family.<br /> <br /> The buildings are typical of small family farms. The barn was used for dairy cattle in the bottom level with hay storage above. The metal silo near the barn was used for silage. The other smaller silo may have been used to store dry grains. There are also several smaller buildings: a corn crib, granary, chicken coop, pump house, etc.<br /> <br /> Dairy operations can often be identified by the silos which were used to store chopped corn or alfalfa, which would ferment and provide a high energy food for the cows. A feed bunk used to feed the silage to the cows. The farmer (or his kids) would climb up into the silo and, using a pitch fork, dig out the packed silage and throw it down the chute to the little room at the bottom. The silage would then be carried in baskets or a wheelbarrow down the bunk for the cows to eat. The cows love this feed, and they would clean it right up. There would be barely a speck of silage left when they were done!<br /> <br /> The Tweddle barn has a good example of stanchions used in the dairy operations. In this case, there are two sets of stanchions facing a manger. Two rows of cows would face each other over a common manger where hay or grain would be placed in front of them, and the stanchions would be closed to hold the cows in place while they were being milked. Cows are creatures of habit and would usually go to the same stanchion day after day.<br /> <br /> The Tweddle Farm is currently used for housing NPS seasonal employees as well as Sleeping Bear's Artist-In-Residence program. You can clearly see why this picturesque farmstead would be so highly inspirational for artists.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "An unpaved driveway leads to the Tweddle Farm, located about 1 mile west of M-22 on Norconk Road. Here you will find a 2-story white clapboard farmhouse with a large stone chimney, as well as a large 2-story red barn and several other red-painted clapboard outbuildings with windows trimmed in white wood. The Tweddle farmhouse, the only building standing to the left of the driveway, dates to the late 1880s. There are 2 metal silos on this farm-a tall silo standing beside the large red dairy barn, and a shorter silo standing alongside the farm's corncrib and small granary. The dairy barn has a corrugated metal roof with a multi-gabled cupola jutting from its center. There are also several smaller buildings dotting the grassy field here, including a chicken coop and a pump house. Please take care as you walk around the buildings to the right of the driveway as you may encounter several large stones surrounding a well pipe located to one side of the nearest outbuilding as well as some bushes and a large shade tree. Tweddle Farm is currently used as temporary housing for National Park Service seasonal employees, volunteers, and the park's annual Artists-In-Residence program.",

Their farm dates to the late 1850's or early 1860's and is the oldest maintained farm in the Port Oneida Historical District.<br /> <br /> Port Oneida was known as a close-knit community, but this doesn't mean the community didn't have its share of serious disagreements. Fifteen years after building their farmstead, the Werners were informed by their neighbor to the north, Thomas Kelderhouse, that their home was on the wrong side of the line. We don't know why the two men could not come to an easier agreement, but the Werners had to disassemble their hard-built home and farm and relocate 1/4 mile south to this location.<br /> <br /> In 1885, the Werner's son and daughter-in-law, Richard and Katie (Portner) Werner, were farming at this site. After Richard Werner's death in 1890, Katie married Benjamin Holland, who took over the farm. Ben was known for being very particular. \"He had the straightest corn rows in the area!\" By 1891, Frederick and Margaretta Werner had divided their parcel, ceding the northern 122 acres to their daughter and son-in-law, Mattie and John Miller.<br /> <br /> The Werners established a family cemetery atop the bluff along the lake that is believed to contain the five children who died here during the early years, as well as Frederick, Margretha, and others.<br /> <br /> Frederick and Margaretta Werner's great-grandson, Franklin Basch, was raised on the farm and purchased it in 1943. According to Franklin Basch, their farming activities ceased around 1930 because they were unable to produce adequate crops.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A paved driveway provides access to the Werner Farm, located on the west side of M-22 just west of the intersection with Thoreson Road. This farm is also close to the trailhead of the Bay View trail. The farm dates to the late 1850s or early 1860s. The first building you will encounter as you enter the property is a 2-story light blue-gray clapboard farmhouse with a red-shingled gable roof. On the left side of the facade, or the side closest to the driveway, is what appears to be an enclosed porch lined with several windows flanking a single entrance door. This wooden door, which is covered by an outer screen door, is painted dark bluish-gray, as is the wooden trim surrounding the house's many windows. Hugging the front of the house are several sizeable bushes and trees, including a tall leafy green tree rising like a wide column in front of the porch's front left corner. The top of this tree reaches high above the farmhouse roofline. Other buildings at the farm include a large weathered gray barn, a small white clapboard outhouse, a small stone garage with a red-shingled gable roof, as well as sheds and other outbuildings of various sizes. Flanking the driveway are two wooden poles, each about 5 to 6 feet tall, with 5 rows of metal fins spaced evenly below a top cover resembling an angled roof. These structures house yard lights. Jutting out of the ground to the side of one light pole is a cylindrical well pipe, about 1 foot tall. Take care to avoid these objects as they may present tripping hazards.",

The Edge Effect</strong><br /> Where the forest meets the field, we find an especially rich variety of plant and animal life. This is called the \"edge effect.\" The edge zone provides good habitat for robins, bluebirds, deer, and rabbits because both food and cover are available here. The wide variety of different life forms found here indicates a healthy natural community.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. The Apple Tree</strong><br /> The apple tree on the left is an old variety called Duchess of Oldenburg, brought to this country from Russia in 1835 and once widely grown. Look at the trunk: it is riddled with sapsucker holes. The original habitat for this member of the woodpecker family was forests with clearings, but it has come to favor orchards as well.<br /> <br /> Apple trees may have originated in Asia Minor or in the mountains of Caucasia. They were brought to the New World by European settlers, and today cultivation of apples and other fruits is an important industry in northern Michigan.<br /> <br /> Occasionally, cultivated plants suffer from disease, insects and drought. Scientists then turn to old varieties or their wild cousins to seek types that are resistant. Wild plants or old cultivated varieties are a reservoir of genetic diversity, and for this reason it is important to preserve them. Throughout history, many different kinds of plants have proven useful to people. Even today, almost half of prescription medicines contain drugs of natural origin. Unfortunately, we are destroying natural habitat worldwide so rapidly that many species are going extinct before they can be studied to determine potential uses and their role in the natural community.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. The Old Field</strong><br /> This former farm field has been lying fallow for many years since the National Lakeshore purchased the land. Gradually, the natural process of plant succession is occurring. The first plants to colonize an old field can include raspberries and other bushes. Common juniper is often the first large plant to grow. The first trees to enter the old field are those that do well in sunlight, such as poplar, white birch and black cherry. Eventually they will produce so much shade that only the seedlings of other more tolerant species such as maple, oak, and ash can survive. Barring natural disaster or human interference, the mature hardwood forests will eventually again dominate the former field.<br /> <br /> <strong>4. The Young Trees</strong><br /> Did you notice that all the trees for several feet on both sides of the trail are relatively young? The trail follows an old roadbed that was obviously fairly wide. After vehicles no longer used it, tree seedlings began to grow. Now they are relatively crowded, but as time goes on many will die from insufficient sunlight and nourishment and only a few widely spaced and hardy survivors will remain.<br /> Did you know that Michigan has an official state soil? Be sure to stop at the wayside exhibit down the trail a little way and learn why \"It's More Than Just Dirt!\"<br /> <br /> <strong>5. The Big Maple</strong><br /> This giant sugar maple was at least a century old before it died; perhaps even much older. Why do you suppose it was spared when all the other surrounding trees were cut for lumber or to clear the area for farming? Pause here for a moment and think about the changes that have happened on the land since this tree was a seedling. If you feel a sense of awe, then you understand another reason for preserving biological diversity. Every time the world loses a species, we lose the opportunity to experience its unique beauty and wonder.<br /> <br /> <strong>6. Wildlife</strong><br /> Can you see any signs of animal life around this hollow tree? Old beech trees often develop internal rot and the holes become ideal homes for porcupines, squirrels, and raccoons. Beech trees also produce large crops of edible nuts. The outside is spiny and splits into four parts, releasing the triangular nut inside. These are favorite food of the many birds and mammals.<br /> While the park provides habitat for about forty different species of mammals, we should also give a moment's thought to the ones that are rare and absent. At one time bears roamed this area, but now they are seldom seen. Wolves once inhabited most of North America, but now they are limited to just a few locations. The park is not large enough to provide habitat for the large, far-ranging mammals. In order to preserve biological diversity, large tracts of wilderness are necessary.<br /> <br /> <strong>7. Glen Lake Overlook</strong><br /> Over the tops of the trees down the trail you can glimpse a portion of Glen Lake, originally called Bear Lake by early settlers. The lake is actually a remnant of a bay from a few thousand years ago when Lake Michigan was much higher that it is now. As the level of Lake Michigan fell, waves and currents along the shore deposited a sandbar across the bay mouth, leaving Glen Lake landlocked. The village of Glen Arbor now sits atop that old sandbar.<br /> <br /> A variety of habitats exist in the park: sand dunes, lakes, rivers, bogs, forests, fields. When we attempt to preserve biological diversity, we must preserve all of the various habitats that support that diversity as well.<br /> <br /> In 1964, Congress passed the Wilderness Act to assure that a growing population and expanding settlement did not eliminate all lands existing in their natural condition.<br /> <br /> Portions of this park have been designated as Wilderness and are managed as wilderness. Wilderness is important as a recreational resource as well as an area where natural diversity can flourish.<br /> <br /> <strong>8. Woodpecker Holes</strong><br /> Have you ever wondered, \"What good is an old, dead tree?\" Infested trees are a valuable source of food for woodpeckers. The elongated holes are made by the pileated woodpecker. This crow-sized bird with a red crest lives in mature forests, but it has become scarce in places where logging has destroyed its natural habitat. It usually makes a new nesting hole each year, and other birds often nest in the old holes. About 85 different kinds of North American birds including bluebirds, chickadees, wrens, and owls make their nests in old, hollow tress. When these old trees are removed, many different kinds of birds are affected.<br /> There are many complex interrelationships in the web of life. When we damage one strand, we weaken the entire web.<br /> <br /> <strong>9. The Pine Plantation</strong><br /> After loggers cleared the native forest, pine trees were planted. You can recognize pine plantations because they lack variety. Because most of the trees are of the same species and age, they are susceptible to the same diseases and insect infestations. The planting of large tracts of a single plant is known as monoculture. Other examples of monoculture are cornfields and vegetable farms. A natural plant community is healthier because the greater variety of plant life makes for milder effects of insects or disease.<br /> <br /> <strong>Conclusion</strong><br /> It is just a short way back to the trailhead. We hope you have enjoyed the beauty of the natural surroundings and have gained a better understanding of the importance of biological diversity. If this subject has touched you, perhaps you will work through community groups and environmental organizations to assure the continuation of natural, diverse communities on our plant Earth.</p> <h3>Take the Trail Trekker Challenge</h3> <p>Do you think you can hike all of the trails in one year?

Earn a prize and bragging rights by successfully completing each of the 13 mainland trails in the National Lakeshore. Hiking is a great way to get daily physical exercise and promote health while also discovering the beauty of the area. What better way to get your muscles warm, your heart pumping, and your senses savoring the views!<br /> <br /> Pick up a copy of the Trail Trekker Challenge brochure/logbook at the visitor center in Empire.</p> <h3>Hike Safely</h3> <p>Before you take off down the trail, take time to prepare for a successful hike. Make sure the trail is appropriate for your ability, and travel with a companion and notify someone of your route and expected return time.<br /> Take plenty of drinking water, bring sunscreen, wear a hat, and be prepared for mosquitoes.<br /> Be careful of your footing-trails have uneven ground, exposed roots, etc.<br /> <br /> Sand slide danger is always present on steep dunes. Stay off steep bluffs to avoid falls and dislodging rocks that can injure people below. Because of heavy treefall, avoid forested trails on windy days.<br /> <br /> Remember, deer rifle season is November 15-30. Other hunting seasons occur throughout the year. Wear bright-colored clothing to be seen and safe in the woods.<br /> <br /> And please stay on designated trails and help prevent erosion and damage to vegetation. Off-trail hikers can quickly produce paths that take years to revegetate. Threatened and endangered species occur in the park, avoid disturbing plants and animals.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Poison Ivy: leaves of three, leave it be!</strong><br /> Poison ivy grows plentifully in many areas of the Lakeshore as a vine or low shrub. The leaves are red in early spring, shiny green in summer, and an attractive red or orange in the fall. Each leaf consists of three leaflets. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes the skin itch, blister, and swell.<br /> Avoid contact with all parts of the plant. Avoid plants with three leaflets.<br /> If exposed, wash the affected skin with soap and water as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> <strong>Don't get ticked!: protect yourself from tick bites</strong><br /> Avoid ticks by walking in the center of trails and avoiding contact with vegetation.<br /> Use a repellent (on skin or clothing) and wear close-toed shoes, long sleeves, long pants, and socks. Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to easily spot ticks.<br /> Check your clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks. Avoid sitting directly on the ground, fallen logs, or stone walls.<br /> <br /> <strong>After being outdoors</strong><br /> Check your body for ticks after being outdoors, and remove any ticks you find.<br /> Check your clothing for ticks. Place clothes into a dryer on high heat for at least an hour.<br /> Shower soon after being outdoors; it may reduce your risk of being bitten.<br /> Check these parts of your body and your child's body for ticks:<br /> Under the arm, in and around the ears, inside the belly button, back of the knees, in and around hair, between the legs, around the waist.<br /> <strong>If you are bitten by a tick</strong><br /> Remove an attached tick as soon as you notice it. Using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible, and then slowly, but firmly, pull it straight out. Immediately wash the bite area and your hands with soap and water, then apply an antiseptic to the bite wound.<br /> Watch for signs of illness.</p>",

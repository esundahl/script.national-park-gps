    "audioDescription": "(502 words)<br />Constitution Gardens is a park area in Washington, DC, located at the west end of the National Mall. The fifty-acre (200,000 m2) park is bounded on the west by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, on the east by 17th St NW, on the north by Constitution Avenue, and on the south by the Washington Monument Reflecting Pool.<br />There are a number of access points into the park along gravel pedestrian walkways on the 17th and Constitution avenue sides, and from the midpoint and east end of the Reflecting Pool.<br />A one thousand-foot long, four hundred-foot wide shallow, hourglass-shaped lake sits to the west, which includes an island with a weeping willow tree that juts into the lake from its north side.<br />A gravel walkway surrounds the entire lake and walkways lead down to the park from various points around the block. Trees ring the lake and lawn areas on east, west and north sides.<br />A fifty-foot long, twelve foot-wide, flat wooden bridge carries onto the island from the north side of the lake. There are no railings on either side. A plaque set in granite at the north side of the bridge is adorned with a bronze star. Text below is inscribed to read:<br />A MEMORIAL TO THE 56 SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE<br />A GIFT FROM<br />THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION<br />BICENTENNIAL ADMNISTRATION<br />1976<br />A granite walkway at the south end of the bridge leads twenty feet to a semi-circular stone wall, about three feet high and forty-five feet long on each side.<br />A circular cobblestone plaza fills the space, which is open to the lake at the south side of the island. The cobblestone stretches seventy feet east and west along the edge of the lake. At the walkway's north end by the wood bridge, an inscription in italics on the granite path reads:<br />In CONGRESS, July 4, 1776.<br />The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,<br />An inscription at the south end of the walk reads:<br />And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other<br />our Lives,<br />our Fortunes<br />and our sacred Honor.<br />Three steps lead down to the plaza area. Set in the plaza at its north end is a bronze star, bracketed by an inscription of two roses connected by an interwoven line design above.<br />The curved wall consists of two rows of pink granite blocks. Each is inscribed on its smooth top surface with gold signatures, and names, occupations, and states of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.<br />The thirteen original colonies are inscribed along the plaza at the base of each granite block. In the center is inscribed \"Independence Hall, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\"<br />Two thirty-foot tall weeping willow trees sit on the east and west sides of the island, and smaller trees line the plaza area. A two-foot tall stone retaining wall snakes around seventy-five feet from the plaza to the east and west, about twenty feet south of the lakefront.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Four sets of three steps lead up to the fountain base from the plaza, and are connected by curved cobblestone areas on all sides.<br />The upper basin is supported by a concrete shaft adorned with three eight-foot tall figures. One is represented by a female figure with long hair holding a boat in her right hand while caressing a seagull on her shoulder with her left hand. Her left foot rests on a dolphin.

    "audioDescription": "(308 words)<br />The African American Civil War Memorial is located in the U Street neighborhood of Washington, DC, on the south side of U Street, NW and bordered on the east by Vermont Avenue. The African American Civil War Museum is directly across Vermont Avenue to the east.<br />The memorial sits on an approximately one hundred square foot granite plaza. An entrance to the subway is at the north end. At the center of the plaza is a nine-foot tall bronze sculpture that sits atop a rounded, two-foot high pedestal. Emerging from a shaft are three African American soldiers and one sailor, all facing outward with their backs to the shaft and firmly grasping their rifles. The sailor stands to the right of a bearded soldier as he steers half of the ship's wheel that protrudes from the shaft behind him. Etched above them is the face of a shrouded woman. Her eyes are closed and hands crossed at her chest. Wavy lines run from the woman's head and extend to the back of the memorial, which features a triangular alcove in the back.<br />Set on the opposite side alcove are two women, one holding a baby, and a man standing on either side of a soldier. The man faces the soldier and holds his left hand, while the soldier holds his rifle. Two small children stand in between them.<br />Encircling the plaza's south side are two rows of curved walls divided by a five-foot wide walkway. The walls feature stainless steel panels inscribed with 209,145 names of United States Colored Troops. The inner wall is about four feet tall and the outer wall about five feet at its ends and six feet tall at its center. Along a stretch of granite at the center of the back wall is inscribed with a quote by Frederick Douglass, see content text.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Humphrey Building, the headquarters of the United States Department of Health and Human Services; adjacent to and northeast of the Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Federal Building; and southeast and adjacent to the Bartholdi Fountain portion of the grounds of the United States Botanic Garden.<br />The centerpiece of the memorial's design is a black granite five-pointed star-shaped fountain and triangular reflecting pool, both about ten inches tall. The star, measuring thirteen feet from point to point, sits at the north end of the memorial plaza and the reflecting pool stretches south and east from the southern-most two points of the star. The pool spans forty feet on its longest, western side. Water in the basin quietly overflows the sides of the fountain and collects in a small trough at the base. A flame in the center of the star breaks through the surface of the dark water in the fountain. Black granite benches line the perimeter.<br />Two twelve-foot tall, thirty-foot long white granite walls frame the east side of the memorial. A gap between the two allows for access into the memorial at its mid-point.<br />The wall is inscribed, on the inside and outside surfaces:<br />AMERICAN VETERANS DISABLED FOR LIFE MEMORIAL<br />Three staggered glass walls form the southern portion of the memorial. They consist of forty-nine laminated panels, each eight and one-half feet tall and four feet wide. On the interior sheets of the glass are inscribed photo-realistic images of veterans and quotations.<br />Four bronze panels, with silhouettes of soldiers cut from their center, stand behind some of the glass panels. The four bronze panels feature a saluting soldier in dress uniform, a soldier rescuing a wounded comrade slung over his shoulders, a running soldier bowed beneath a full pack, and a soldier with an amputated leg using crutches to hold himself upright.<br />A grove of twenty-three cypress trees sit amongst a pedestrian pathway that passes through the grove and glass walls, and a row of sixty-nine gingko trees lines the perimeter of the memorial.

Originally built to display and house material from the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, the Arts and Industries Building was designed by Washington architects Adolf Cluss and Paul Schulze in 1879. It stands today as one of the premier examples of exhibition architecture in the United States. Unlike other exposition buildings from this period, the Arts and Industries Building was designed to be a permanent museum institution and housed the nation’s most important historical and natural artifacts continuing a long tradition of cultural stewardship in Washington D.C. that continues to this day. </p> <p paraeid=\"{dbe48b7d-1a77-477a-8e7f-e29ddb77b8ac}{255}\" paraid=\"1838041137\">Beginning in the 1850’s, European cities began hosting international expositions aimed at displaying the cultural and technological innovations of the industrial age. World’s Fairs, as these events came to be known, were months-long events where new technological, cultural, and artistic ideas and innovations were highlighted. Paris’ Eiffel Tower and London’s Crystal Palace were new technological wonders showcased at these events. In 1876, the United States hosted one of the first major World’s Fairs. Known as the Centennial Exposition, the fair was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the nation’s founding. At the conclusion of the Exposition, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. acquired many of the items exhibited in Philadelphia and attempted to permanently house and display them.</p> <p paraeid=\"{e31b001f-96d9-4c6a-956a-5de0d79bee5a}{100}\" paraid=\"108294904\">The Smithsonian’s Board of Regents determined that their main building, the <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/history/smithsonian-institution-building-castle\">Smithsonian Institution Building</a> (now known as the Smithsonian Castle) was not large enough to house the Centennial’s materials and the board made plans for the construction of the U.S. National Museum. In 1879, the Board adopted the design plans of famed Washington architectural firm Cluss and Schulze and hired former Civil War General and engineer Montgomery C. Meigs to oversee construction of the facility. Situated directly adjacent to the Smithsonian Institution Building, the National Museum was officially opened in 1881 and immediately became a prominent Washington landmark hosting important social events including the inaugural ball of President James Garfield. In addition to housing the Centennial Exposition materials, the museum contained many of the nation’s most important historical artifacts including Betsy Ross’ <i>Star-Spangled Banner</i> and the dresses of several First Ladies.</p> <p paraeid=\"{e31b001f-96d9-4c6a-956a-5de0d79bee5a}{236}\" paraid=\"1013665437\">As with most exposition architecture, the National Museum was designed to enclose a large open museum space with a visually compelling and dramatic exterior meant to draw interest from the passing public. Cluss and Schulze’s design included a wide, one-story Greek cross plan with a large central rotunda and iron truss roof system that accommodated the wide and uninterrupted interior exhibit spaces. The building includes nearly 1,000 windows allowing for the interior to be naturally lit. The entrance to the museum is flanked by two large Romanesque Revival towers and a Neoclassical sculpture of a female figure by Caspar Brubel entitled <em>Columbia Protecting Science and Industry</em>. <br /> <br /> In 1910, the Smithsonian built the National Museum of Natural History to house the institution’s growing natural history collection after it was determined that the National Museum's increasingly limited exhibit space made it unsuitable for collection maintenance. The Arts and Industries Building, as it was renamed in 1910, continued to display artifacts of American aviation and national history, including the <em>Spirit of St. Louis</em> and the Wright Brothers’ <em>Flyer</em> aircraft that were exhibited in a neighboring building that eventually became the National Air and Space Museum in 1946. </p> <p paraeid=\"{33f56d34-7364-43a7-8715-fa3ef5f1b0f1}{87}\" paraid=\"2075373965\"> In 1974, the Arts and Industries Building was designated a National Historic Landmark and underwent two years of renovations before reopening for the United States’ Bicentennial in 1976. As part of the nationwide celebrations, the Arts and Industries Building hosted an exhibit on the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition which included many of the original artifacts and attractions from the fair. From the late 1970s to the early 2000s, the Arts and Industries Building hosted a number of experimental exhibits and art installations. By 2009, the deteriorating condition of the building forced the Smithsonian to renovate the structure’s roofing and interior. The renovation process is ongoing and the building remains closed to the public except for occasional public programs. The Arts and Industries Building remains one of the best surviving examples of World’s Fair architecture in the nation. Its role in the development of museums in the United States also establishes its national significance.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{33f56d34-7364-43a7-8715-fa3ef5f1b0f1}{155}\" paraid=\"1602954390\"><u>Sources:</u> </p> <p paraeid=\"{33f56d34-7364-43a7-8715-fa3ef5f1b0f1}{161}\" paraid=\"2013753202\">Boyle, Katherine  <br /> 2014   Smithsonian will not Reopen Arts and Industries Building after renovation, Washington Post, published 1/29/2014.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{33f56d34-7364-43a7-8715-fa3ef5f1b0f1}{183}\" paraid=\"725110885\">National Park Service <br /> 1971   Arts and Industries Building National Historic Landmark Nomination, National Park Service </p> <p paraeid=\"{33f56d34-7364-43a7-8715-fa3ef5f1b0f1}{203}\" paraid=\"214855320\">Post, Robert C.  <br /> 2001   A Corner of the Nation’s Attic, Technology and Culture Vol. 42, No. 3, the Johns Hopkins University Press </p> <p paraeid=\"{33f56d34-7364-43a7-8715-fa3ef5f1b0f1}{231}\" paraid=\"1907772484\">Smithsonian Institution Archives  <br /> Arts and Industries Building, <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/history/arts-and-industries-building\">https://siarchives.si.edu/history/arts-and-industries-building</a></p> <p paraeid=\"{33f56d34-7364-43a7-8715-fa3ef5f1b0f1}{248}\" paraid=\"721919329\">Smithsonian Institution Archives  <br /> 1948   Wright Flyer Placed on Display at the Smithsonian, History of the Smithsonian Catalog, <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_2423\">https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_2423</a>  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c86e15ce-1893-4e02-8fd2-c517714f5e47}{28}\" paraid=\"974274070\">Wermiel, Sara E.  <br /> 2006   Adolf Cluss, Architect: From Germany to America: Shaping a City Worthy of a Republic: at the Charles Sumner School, Technology and Culture Vol. 47, No. 3, Technology <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c86e15ce-1893-4e02-8fd2-c517714f5e47}{58}\" paraid=\"1404503886\"><em><a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/117691785\">NHL Nomination</a></em><br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c86e15ce-1893-4e02-8fd2-c517714f5e47}{65}\" paraid=\"426321211\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nhl/index.htm\">National Historic Landmarks (NHLs)</a> are historic places that possess exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States.

Turn right and follow the pedestrian walkway about three hundred feet west. To the south will be the World War II Atlantic entrance.<br />The Atlantic entrance consists of a forty-three-foot tall granite arched pavilion, engraved at the top to read: ATLANTIC. The interior of the pavilion features four, twelve-foot tall bronze columns supporting four bronze bald eagles, holding in their beaks a ribbon wrapped around a wreath.<br />On either side of the pavilion are fourteen granite pillars, each seventeen feet tall. Each features a bronze wreath towards the top on either side, a rectangular opening, and are engraved at the bottom with the name of an American state or territory. Along with twenty-eight pillars on the opposite, Pacific side they form a semi-circle around the memorial plaza.<br />The floor of the Atlantic entrance has a round bronze plaque in its center, engraved to read: World War II. The plaque has an image depicting a robed woman looking to her right. She holds the broken handle of a sword in her right hand and the blade in her left. She stands behind the shining sun and rests her right bare foot on top of a warrior's helmet in the ground. A circular block pattern of granite stone surrounds the plaque. A six-inch gray outer border is engraved in bronze at the north end to read:<br />1941-1945<br />Engraved around the border in clockwise direction reads:<br />Victory on Land<br />Victory at Sea<br />Victory in Air<br />The south end of the Pacific entrance has a two-foot tall arched granite wall. Beyond is the center plaza of the memorial, about six feet below. Set in the center is a large circular pool area with fountain in the middle surrounded by a ring of water jets. A block pattern of gray squares lines the plaza interior. To the south sits the Pacific entrance and surrounding pillars with bronze interior wreaths. To the west a wall of gold stars lines the outer edge of the plaza and waterfalls flow at either side.<br />Walkways arc down along the pillars to the plaza level below from the east and west sides of the Atlantic entrance. Granite benches line the plaza's outer wall and two steps provide seating along the fountain pool's edge.<br />The interior side of the Atlantic entrance features a fountain and pool at its edge within the memorial plaza. Stone blocks both in the pool and lining its outer edge are engraved with campaigns of the Atlantic Theater.<br />Inscriptions along the wall on both sides of the fountain quote Generals George C.

A bronze plaque on the left edge of the perimeter wall reads:<br />BENJAMIN BANNEKER PARK<br />Set in the center is an approximately ninety-foot wide circular pool with a fountain in the middle. Water cascades down an angled, circular piece of granite, about forty feet wide and with a fifteen-foot radius. Water collects into a moat area that encircles the round granite center piece. A two-foot wide granite border lines the perimeter of the pool.<br />Twelve granite benches surround the fountain and four others are set along with trees on the east and west outer edges of the plaza.<br />A three-foot tall cement wall lines the perimeter of the plaza and views to the south look out over Maine Avenue below and the Wharf development along Washington Channel.<br />Set along the right side of the entrance into the plaza is a two by three-foot wayside. An image of a postage stamp on the left shows an African American man with white hair wearing a suit and high collar.

This commemorative postage stamp issued on February 15, 1980, is based upon descriptions provided by neighbors who knew him.<br />Along the top is a quote that reads:<br />\"<br />...it is the indispensable duty of those, who maintain for themselves the rights of human nature,...to extend their power and influence to the relief of every part of the human race...\"<br />- Benjamin Banneker<br />Text below describes the life of Benjamin Banneker:<br />Benjamin Banneker (1731-1806) was born a free black in Maryland near the headwaters of the Chesapeake Bay. With very little formal schooling, he became America's first black man of science, an accomplished mathematician, astronomer, and producer of almanacs.<br />In 1791 Major Andrew Ellicott selected Banneker to assist him in the survey of the ten-mile square that became the District of Columbia. Banneker's astronomical work contributed significantly to making the boundaries of the new capital of the United States exact.<br />After returning to his farm in Maryland, Banneker completed calculations for an almanac for the year 1792. His almanacs continued to be published for the years 1792 through 1797. At least 28 editions were printed and were widely distributed in the United States and abroad.<br />An image on the left shows a book open to a page of diagrams and math calculations. Text below reads:<br />Banneker was able to calculate and predict precisely the positions of the sun, moon, and planets each year for his almanacs. Writing and charting in his journal on April 3, 1791, he recorded this solar eclipse.<br />To the right is an image of the cover of a book, titled:<br />Benjamin Banneker's Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia<br />Almanack and Ephemeris<br />For the Years of our Lord<br />1792<br />Text below reads:<br />In colonial America, the almanac was an indispensable reference work found in almost every home.<br />An image in the bottom right shows a mechanical structure with gears inside. Text below reads:<br />Banneker became intrigued by a pocket watch he had seen as a young man. Using a knife he intricately carved out the wheels and gears of a wooden timepiece. The remarkable clock he constructed from memory kept time and struck the hours for the next fifty years.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>During the Civil War there was no official system in place to document missing or dead soldiers. As the war ended Clara Barton, the \"Angel of the Battlefield\" who had achieved fame as a nurse during the war, took it upon herself to fill this void. She began to receive letters from family members trying to find out the fate of their loved ones who had not returned home. Each of these letters led to a painstaking process of researching the whereabouts of these missing soldiers and to respond to the family members' inquiries. </p> <p>In June of 1865 a young clerk named Dorence Atwater contacted Barton and requested copies of her lists of missing soldiers. Atwater had been a prisoner at Andersonville and had been paroled to work in the hospital, where he diligently maintained a copy of the death records. Ecstatic, Barton contacted Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and asked to accompany the US Army's expedition to Andersonville to identify the graves there.</p> <p>At Andersonville in July and August of 1865, Atwater and Barton poured through the letters she had received, and began to search for these missing soldiers in the Andersonville Death Register and captured hospital records. While laborers worked to erect headboards in the cemetery, Barton wrote dozens of letters informing families that their loved ones had died at Andersonville. At the end of the expedition, Barton was given the honor of raising the American flag for the first time over the recently established Andersonville National Cemetery.</p> <p>After returning from Andersonville, Barton set up the Missing Soldier's Office in Washington in 1865. She hired numerous clerks, including Dorence Atwater, to respond to the more than 60,000 letters that she received. By the time the Missing Soldiers Office closed in 1867, Barton and her staff had identified more than 20,000 missing soldiers, including nearly 13,000 who had died at Andersonville Prison.<br /> <br />  </p> <p>Because of her fame as a nurse, she received much of the credit for the work of the Missing Soldiers Office and the Andersonville expedition. In a post war speaking series she was hailed as the \"Heroine of Andersonville\" and toured the nation displaying artifacts that she had collected at the prison site and lectured on the sufferings of the prisoners. She was even inducted as an honorary member of the Andersonville Survivor's Association, and the army's expedition to Andersonville to identify the graves quickly became known as Barton's expedition, even though she had only accompanied the previously planned endeavor and had worked primarily writing letters - not identifying graves as has often been claimed.</p> <p>Barton's greatest contribution to the Andersonville story is through her work in the Missing Soldiers Office and her support of Dorence Atwater. Atwater was court-martialed and jailed in the fall of 1865 related to a dispute over the ownership of the Andersonville Death Register. It was through Barton's efforts that he was finally released and she then supported his publication of the Death Register. Barton is often mistakenly given credit for identifying the graves at Andersonville. However, she deserves a great deal of credit for her efforts to account for the missing soldiers, both at Andersonville and across countless battlefields.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "(472 words)<br />Constitution Gardens is a park area in Washington, DC, located at the west end of the National Mall. The fifty-acre (200,000 m2) park is bounded on the west by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, on the east by 17th St NW, on the north by Constitution Avenue, and on the south by the Washington Monument Reflecting Pool.<br />There are a number of access points into the park along gravel pedestrian walkways on the 17th and Constitution avenue sides, and from the midpoint and east end of the Reflecting Pool.<br />The east side of the park features an elevated one hundred square foot gravel plaza area. Ramps at the north and south sides lead down to Constitution Gardens below. Set in between the ramps is a three-tiered viewing area separated by three-foot tall, eight-foot wide stone walls. Three trees sit in each of the platforms.<br />A one thousand-foot long, four hundred-foot wide shallow, hourglass-shaped lake sits to the west, which includes an island with a weeping willow tree that juts into the lake from its north side.<br />A gravel walkway surrounds the entire lake and walkways lead down to the park from various points around the block. Trees ring the lake and lawn areas on east, west and north sides.<br />A fifty-foot long, twelve foot-wide, flat wooden bridge carries over the lake and onto the island from the north side. There are no railings on either side. A plaque set in granite at the north side of the bridge is inscribed to read:<br />A MEMORIAL TO THE 56 SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE<br />A GIFT FROM<br />THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION<br />BICENTENNIAL ADMINISTRATION<br />1976<br />A granite walkway on the south side of the bridge leads twenty feet to a semi-circular stone wall, about three feet high and forty-five feet long on each side. A cobblestone plaza fills the space, which is open to the lake at the south side of the island. The cobblestone stretches seventy feet east and west along the edge of the lake.<br />The curved wall consists of two rows of pink granite blocks. Each is inscribed on its smooth top surface with a gold signature, and a name, occupation, and state beneath. City and state names are inscribed along the plaza at the base of each granite block.<br />A two-foot tall stone retaining wall snakes around seventy-five feet from the plaza to the east and west, about twenty feet south of the lakefront.<br />Further west along the lake, weeping willow trees sit on the north side of the gravel walkway. At the far west end of the lake sits an octagonal shaped one-story building, providing drinks and refreshments. Facing back to the east from this location, the Washington Monument sits in the distance, its image reflecting off the still lake water along with the surrounding trees, blue sky and clouds above.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Washington, D.C., is surrounded by over a dozen tribal nations that thrive along the Anacostia and Potomac River watersheds, Chesapeake Bay area, and the states of Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware. Washington, D.C. sits on the ancestral lands of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/native-peoples-of-washington-dc.htm\">Anacostans (also documented as Nacotchtank</a>), and the neighboring Piscataway and Pamunkey peoples. </p> <h3 aria-level=\"2\" lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9da398d5-fdea-46a8-b60a-4af3dd67f2dc}{121}\" paraid=\"1978538993\" role=\"heading\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Pacific Circle </h3> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9da398d5-fdea-46a8-b60a-4af3dd67f2dc}{139}\" paraid=\"1673660750\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">When Pierre Charles L'Enfant drew up plans for the City of Washington in 1791, he envisioned a city of grand vistas and diagonal avenues meeting in circles of green space. The location that became Dupont Circle has a direct connection to the White House along Connecticut Avenue. Nevertheless, until the late nineteenth century, the neighborhood was sparsely populated and undeveloped. <br />  <br /> In 1872, the city paved Connecticut Avenue, improving landscaping and public works in the neighborhood, which was then called Pacific Circle. William Stewart, a U.S. Senator from Nevada, built what became known as Stewart Castle on the north section of the circle in 1873. The five-story mansion with center turret was impressive, although some wondered why Stewart built his house so far away from the prestigious areas of the city. A year later, the British Legation Building was completed at 1300 Connecticut Avenue, which began the transformation of the area into desirable real estate. </p> <h3 lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9da398d5-fdea-46a8-b60a-4af3dd67f2dc}{145}\" paraid=\"1097814283\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Dupont</h3> <p paraeid=\"{0d105dce-974b-44f5-84cb-40f8bcb997fd}{181}\" paraid=\"1116014623\">Samuel F. Dupont had a long and varied career in the U.S. Navy. Born at Berge Point, New Jersey, in 1803, he joined the Navy at the age of 12. Year by year, he worked his way up the promotional ladder and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1856. Dupont was serving as commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard when the American Civil War began in 1861. To protect Washington, D.C., which was surrounded by states of unclear loyalty, Dupont sent the forces under his command to occupy Annapolis, Maryland. This move allowed U.S. troops to reach the beleaguered capital. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0d105dce-974b-44f5-84cb-40f8bcb997fd}{185}\" paraid=\"31554947\">Later, Dupont was put in command of the South Atlantic Blockade Squadron. On November 7, 1861, he helped to capture Fort Royal, South Carolina. The following year, he was promoted to rear admiral. But after an unsuccessful attack on Fort Sumter at Charleston, South Carolina, Dupont was relieved of command. He retired to the family home in Wilmington, Delaware, and died in 1865. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0d105dce-974b-44f5-84cb-40f8bcb997fd}{189}\" paraid=\"294747892\">Despite the inauspicious end to his naval career, Dupont never lost his popularity with the people of Wilmington. In 1882, at their behest, Congress decided to raise a statue to Dupont's memory in downtown Washington, D.C. The bronze statue of Samuel Dupont, standing and holding a pair of binoculars, by the sculptor Launt Thompson was dedicated on December 20, 1884. Pacific Circle was renamed in Dupont's honor.</p> <h3 paraeid=\"{0d105dce-974b-44f5-84cb-40f8bcb997fd}{189}\" paraid=\"294747892\">Dupont Circle </h3> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{9da398d5-fdea-46a8-b60a-4af3dd67f2dc}{145}\" paraid=\"1097814283\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Between 1880 and 1940, the neighborhood transformed, eventually including many Victorian and Beaux Arts residences. It became a sought-after address in the 1920s, home to notable Washingtonians like newspaper editor Cissy Patterson (organizer of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-cherry-tree-rebellion.htm\">Cherry Tree Rebellion</a>.)<br /> <br /> But the Dupont family was unhappy with the statue, and in February 1917, Congress passed legislation to remove it and commission a new memorial to Dupont, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nama/planyourvisit/dupont.htm\">a white stone fountain</a> designed by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/linc/learn/historyculture/lincoln-memorial-design-individuals.htm\">Henry Bacon and Daniel Chester French, </a>the team who also designed the Lincoln Memorial. In the sculpture, which was dedicated in 1921, the bowl of the fountain is held aloft by three figures representing “The Sea,” “The Wind,” and “The Stars.” The fountain has become a gathering place for numerous celebrations and events throughout the year, including the annual Pride Festival and Parade. The National Park Service began caring for the fountain and the surrounding park in 1933. </p> <h3 paraeid=\"{0d105dce-974b-44f5-84cb-40f8bcb997fd}{189}\" paraid=\"294747892\">LGBTQ History </h3> <p>In the 1970s, Dupont Circle became a welcoming place for the city's LGBTQ community. Activist Deacon Maccubbin opened Earthworks, a craft store and \"headshop\" that was the city's first openly gay business that wasn't a bar. Earthworks became a center for the gay community. Maccubbin expanded the business to open Lambda Rising, which he advertised as  \"The Largest Lesbian and Gay Liberation Bookstore in the U.S.A.\"  Lambda Rising moved several times throughout the years to different locations around Dupont Circle, eventually settling at 1625 Connecticut Avenue, NW, where it operated until 2010. The neighborhood was also home to <em>The Gay Blade </em>newspaper (now called <em>Washington Blade,) </em>and <em>off our backs, </em>a lesbian feminist publication. <br /> <br /> Maccubbin organized Gay Pride Day in June 1975, a small community gathering that grew every year. The event is now called Capital Pride and draws tens of thousands of people to Dupont Circle for the annual parade. Since 1986, the Tuesday before Halloween in Dupont Circle means the High Heel Race. Thousands of people gather to watch drag queens race for three blocks down 17th Street in high heels. Although it began as an impromptu competition, the event is now hosted by the D.C. Mayor's Office and includes a parade and other festivities. </p> <h3>The Circle Today</h3> <p>Today, the park continues to serve the community as a popular gathering point for games of chess, drum circles, demonstrations, concerts, and snowball fights. The only surviving structure from the Pacific Circle era is the 1882 Blaine Mansion, located at the corner of 20th and P Streets. The neighborhood still includes elegant examples of historic Queen Anne, Beaux Arts, and Georgian Revival architecture along with more modern buildings. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Dupont Circle park is a green space in the center of a traffic circle at the intersection of several diagonal avenues, P Street, and 19th Street in northwest Washington, D.C. The park includes many large trees and benches. A sidewalk is located around the perimeter of the circle Six radial paths corresponding to the surrounding streets lead from the edges of the park to the center plaza. The center plaza is paved with a double-tiered white marble fountain on a concrete base. The upper basin of the fountain is approximately 3 feet or 0.91 meters high and 11.6 feet or 3.5 meters wide. It is supported by an 8-ton shaft adorned with three allegorical figures representing the sea, the stars, and the wind which are approximately 8 feet or 2.4 meters tall and 4.5 feet or 1.4 meters wide. The Sea is represented by a female figure with long hair holding a boat in her right hand while caressing a seagull on her shoulder with her left hand. Her left foot rests on a dolphin. The Stars is a nude female figure with long hair holding a globe in her left hand and is faced downward. The Wind is a nude male figure draped with a ship sail. He is holding a conch shell with his left hand to use as a horn and is facing right. The water pours over the upper basin into a large lower basin that is approximately 1.8 feet or 0.55 meters tall. The inscription on the outer rim of the lower basin states: \"THIS MEMORIAL FOUNTAIN REPLACES A STATUE ERECTED BY THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES IN RECOGNITION OF HIS DISTINGUISHED SERVICES. SAMUEL FRANCIS DUPONT UNITED STATES NAVY 1803 – 1865.\" The circular concrete base features four sets of three steps that lead to the surrounding plaza.",

On the right side of the memorial, Eisenhower is depicted as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force during World War II. The sculpture is based on a photograph of Eisenhower speaking to paratroopers in the 101st Airborne Division before their jump into France as part of Operation Overlord, the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Behind the sculptures is a bas relief depicting the Normandy landings on D-Day, June 6, 1944. On the left side of the memorial, the bronze heroic-sized statue of Eisenhower as 34th President of the United States places him at the center of the White House Oval Office flanked by sculptures of civilian and military advisors, symbolizing the balance Eisenhower struck between conflicting demands of national security and peaceful progress. The bas relief global background depicts a map of the world symbolizing Eisenhower's role as a world statesman and preeminent internationalist pursuing universal peace. A pedestal on the northwest plaza entrance depicts Eisenhower as a boy, symbolizing his roots in Abilene, Kansas, and perhaps serving as a hopeful inspiration to children who visit the memorial.<br /> <br /> Designer: Frank Gehry<br /> Sculptor: Sergey Eylanbekov<br /> Artist (tapestry): Tomas Osinski<br /> <br /> <b>Inscriptions:</b><br /> \"Because no man is really a man who has lost out of himself all of the boy, I want to speak first of the dreams of a barefoot boy. Frequently, they are to be of a street car conductor or he sees himself as the town policeman, above all he may reach to a position of locomotive engineer, but always in his dreams is that day when he finally comes home. Comes home to a welcome from his own home town. Because today that dream of mine of 45 years or more ago has been realized beyond the wildest stretches of my own imagination, I come here, first, to thank you, to say the proudest thing I can claim is that I am from Abilene. - Homecoming speech, Abilene, Kansas - June 22, 1945\"<br /> <br /> \"The high sense of distinction I feel in receiving this great honor from the city of London is inescapably mingled with feelings of profound sadness. All of us must always regret that your great country and mine were ever faced with the tragic situation that compelled the appointment of an Allied Commander in Chief, the capacity in which I have just been so extravagantly commended. Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives acclaim earned in the blood of his followers and the sacrifices of his friends. Conceivably a commander may have been professionally superior. He may have given everything of his heart and mind to meet the spiritual and physical needs of his comrades. He may have written a chapter that will glow forever in the pages of military history. Still, even such a man--if he existed--would sadly face the facts that his honors cannot hide in his memories the crosses marking the resting places of the dead. They cannot soothe the anguish of the widow, or the orphan, whose husband or father will not return. The only attitude in which a commander may with satisfaction receive the tributes of his friends is in the humble acknowledgment that no matter how unworthy he may be, his position is the symbol of great human forces that have labored arduously and successfully for a righteous cause. Unless he feels this symbolism and this rightness in what he has tried to do, then he is disregardful of the courage, fortitude and devotion of the vast multitudes he has been honored to command. If all Allied men and women that have served with me in this war can only know that it is they whom this august body is really honoring today, then indeed I will be content.~ No petty differences in the world of trade, traditions, or national pride should ever blind us to our identities in priceless values. If we keep our eyes on this guidepost, then no difficulties along our path of mutual co-operation can ever be insurmountable. Moreover, when this truth has permeated to the remotest hamlet and heart of all peoples, then indeed may we beat our swords into plowshares, and all nations can enjoy the fruitfulness of the earth. Second Inaugural Address - January 21, 1957\"<br /> <br /> \"We must be ready to dare all for our country. For history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid. We must acquire proficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose. We must be willing, individually and as a nation, to accept whatever sacrifices may be required of us. A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both. Patriotism means equipped forces and a prepared citizenry. Moral stamina means more energy and more productivity, on the farm and in the factory. Love of liberty means the guarding of every resource that makes freedom possible - from the sanctity of our families and the wealth of our soil to the genius of our scientists. And so each citizen plays an indispensable role. The productivity of our heads, our hands and our hearts is the source of all the strength we can command, for both the enrichment of our lives and the winning of the Peace. This is the hope that beckons us onward in this century of trial. This is the work that awaits us all, to be done with bravery, with charity and with prayer to almighty God. First Inaugural Address - January 20, 1953\"<br /> <br /> \"Throughout America's adventure in free government, our basic purposes have been to keep the peace; to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity and integrity among people and among nations. A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.~ This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience.~ We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.~ In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.~ Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.~ It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system-ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.~ We pray that , all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.

    "audioDescription": "1513 words.Welcome to the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial. This 4-acre, park-like landscape is dedicated to the celebrated 5-star General and 34th President of the United States. Elements of Eisenhower's life, from boyhood to WWII to the U.S. Presidency, are incorporated in the forms of sculpture, engraved words, and landscaping. As you visit, you are welcome to touch the statuary and reliefs, stand next to the statues, but not to climb on any of the other elements of the memorial.The memorial is located on a rectangular plot of land, the long sides bounded on the north by Independence Ave and the National Air and Space Museum across the street and on the south by the LBJ Department of Education Building, and the short sides on the east by 4th St and on the west by 6th St. The core of the Memorial is a rectangular plaza with two sculptural groups depicting Eisenhower as General and President. It is accessed by two walkways in the shape of a wide V stretching from the northern corners to the plaza at the center of the southern edge. A narrow limestone plaza hugs the eastern edge of the memorial along 4th St. The bookstore, information center, and public restrooms sit at the southern end of this plaza.Six stone columns on the south edge and one in each northern corner, measuring 80 feet tall and 10 feet wide, frame the space. A woven metal tapestry, measuring 60 feet tall by 447 feet long, runs vertically across the front of the southern columns. The tapestry is made of pale silver mesh screen welded with dark, thick wire that depicts an abstract line drawing of the cliffs in Normandy. In order to see the full picture, the tapestry is best seen from a distance. The stonework in the memorial is a light, sandy-colored limestone from Spain, streaked with dark brown and reddish hues. Features made of this stone include the columns, walkways, benches, and sculpture bases. Entering from the northwestern corner at Independence Ave and 6th St, we first approach a sculpture of Eisenhower as a young teenager growing up in small-town Kansas. He sits on a 3 foot tall block of stone centered in the walkway just outside the space framed by the columns. The sculpture is bronze, but with a light green patina. He sits facing south, slightly relaxed, but his head is turned left, gazing toward the center of the memorial. The bangs of his tousled hair hang almost to his eyebrows. His knees are drawn up, left foot tucked behind the right, and his arms wrap around his knees. His right hand lightly clasps his left wrist. Young Eisenhower is dressed in overalls and a long-sleeved collared shirt, wrinkled by his posture, and laced work boots.In front of the boyhood statue is a rectangular block of stone engraved with the introduction of General Eisenhower's Homecoming Speech, given in Abilene, Kansas on June 22, 1945.As we walk toward the core of the memorial, the northwestern column is on our left. About six feet above the ground, on the south-facing side, there are five 5-pointed metal stars. They are arranged in a pentagonal pattern, with touching points, as could be seen on a ranking 5-star general's uniform. Below the stars is engraved \"General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force, 1944-1945\".Continuing, benches are spaced along the edge of the walkway. Beyond, trees and grasses common to the Kansas landscape are planted. Halfway towards the core of the memorial, a swath of grass 45 feet wide bisects the landscaping, stretching diagonally from the southwestern to northeastern corner. This strip of grass illustrates the historic path of Maryland Ave SW, which continues beyond the edges of the memorial. Looking to the left, the Capitol dome is framed between the memorial's shade trees.At the central core of the memorial is the limestone plaza and the two main sculptural groups. Arranged near the south side, the two sculptural scenes depict Eisenhower's professional careers. Both scenes mimic a stage: bronze statues stand on a raised stone platform, and a stone block rises 15 feet behind the statues as a backdrop. Atop the vertical block, a second block atop each platform is angled in toward the viewer with an inscription. The scenes are angled towards the center of the plaza, standing about 60 feet apart. Centered beyond the two scenes is a 40-foot-long inscription of DWIGHT D EISENHOWER on a six-foot-high wall. Between the wall and sculptural scenes is a walkway, allowing visitors to walk fully around the two stone and bronze scenes. The woven metal tapestry hangs vertically beyond the plaza. The Department of Education Building is seen between the wall and the lower edge of the tapestry.In the right-hand scene, six uniformed military men stand in two groups facing General Eisenhower to the right; a group of two to the far left and a group of four in the center. Their combat fatigues are rumpled, standing in stark contrast to the general's pressed service uniform. They",

From November 1942 through December 1943, Ike’s diplomacy and determination created a multinational headquarters that controlled British and American units. His forces liberated North Africa, Sicily and Southern Italy which weakened Nazi Germany’s strategic position.<br /> <br /> The culmination of Eisenhower’s success in building an allied force was the amphibious assault from the southern coast of England to Normandy, France. [second sentence removed] On the night of 5\\6 June 1944, British and American airborne personnel landed behind enemy lines and they secured the flanks of the beaches from German attack. After an air and sea bombardment that morning, British, Canadian, and American troops stormed ashore from small landing craft to defeat Germans in fortified positions. American commandos, known as Rangers climbed up the one hundred foot tall cliff at Pointe du Hoc where they destroyed a dangerous German artillery position.<br /> <br /> Eisenhower’s forces then made great sacrifices along a broad front that moved across Western Europe into Germany. Many of them were buried in a series of military cemeteries on the continent. For the rest of his very active life, Eisenhower remembered the high price that his personnel paid to preserve humanity’s right to choose their own governments. On the twentieth anniversary of D-Day, he visited one of the Normandy cemeteries and said, “These people gave us a chance… so that we can do better than we have before.”",

The bas-relief global background depicts a map of the world symbolizing Eisenhower's role as a world statesman and preeminent internationalist pursuing universal peace.<br /> <br /> The 1950s was a time of sweeping change as nations adjusted to a new world order. Above it all hung the cloud of the Cold War and its threat of mutual destruction. As president, Eisenhower worked to ease that threat and bring about peace.<br /> <br /> He began his presidency in 1952 by seeking an end to the Korean War. In 1955, with Cold War tension at a breaking point, he made a breakthrough with the Soviet Union with his Open Skies proposal. In his time in office, Eisenhower de-escalated crises worldwide with great diplomacy and tact.<br /> <br /> On the domestic front, Eisenhower oversaw great expansion. A moderate Republican, he continued many of the New Deal programs of his predecessors. He raised the minimum wage, expanded Social Security, established the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and improved the nation's infrastructure with the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956.<br /> <br /> The 1954 Brown v Board ruling by the Supreme Court declared public schools were to be desegregated. Eisenhower made sure the law was carried out, even if it meant using a measure of force. He further broke the yoke of Jim Crow when he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1957. This protected African Americans at the voting booth and was the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction.<br /> <br /> In 1957, the Soviet Union became the first nation to reach space with its satellite Sputnik. In response, Eisenhower signed off on legislation to create what is now known as NASA. The space race had begun, and, building from this foundation, would be won by Eisenhower's successors.<br /> <br /> Eisenhower’s public approval numbers remained high during his two terms. People believed in his integrity, sincerity, and sense of duty. For his part, Eisenhower believed in the people and what they could do for the country, the world, and each other. As he said in his first inaugural address, “Whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of America.”",

The tapestry depicts the Pointe du Hoc promontory of France’s Normandy coastline during peacetime and serves as a symbol of the peace Eisenhower sought and won as Supreme Allied Commander during World War II and then maintained and nurtured as 34<sup>th</sup> president. Although the artistic feature draws inspiration from historic tapestries, the process and materials implemented in the Eisenhower Memorial introduce a new innovative perspective on the conventional practice of tapestry weaving.<br /> <br /> Juggling many factors and possibilities, the artistic team of the Eisenhower Memorial chose to use stainless steel for its durability. Stainless steel possesses a metal with natural qualities that ensure its longevity. The metal has a natural oxidation process that protects the steel from corrosion. The element of chromium in the steel makes the material resistant to corrosion when exposed to oxygen. Because the tapestry will reside outdoors, many physical and metallurgical tests were conducted to decide which type of steel would be used in the project. The tapestry proved widely successful in these tests including withstanding the vacuum pressure of an airplane propeller and losing only six of the six-thousand welds that were subject to simulated hurricane wind for one month.<br /> <br /> At 447 feet long and 60 feet tall, a stainless steel tapestry of this size has never been attempted before. Made of 600 panels, each measuring 3 feet by 15 feet, the steel tapestry is supported by a cable net system suspended from a stone-clad concrete colonnade spanning the southern perimeter of the memorial. Architect Frank Gehry chose an expansive element to add gravitas to the memorial park, to serve as a commemorative element providing context for the memorial, and as an urban planning element defining the space in its urban surroundings.<br /> <br /> The initial memorial narrative featured a depiction of the Kansas landscape, commemoratingEisenhower's ties to his home state. As the design process continued, the design team proposed an image of Normandy's coastline to symbolize Eisenhower's role as a preeminent world leader.<br /> <br /> The initial artwork was a photographic representation of the Normandy cliffs and French landscape compiled from images captured by drone. As the team collaborated and received artistic feedback from the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the tapestry artwork evolved from a photographic montage to an artful abstract line drawing of the Pointe du Hoc promontory in peacetime.",

A strong family and community raised him. Dwight’s parents, David and Ida, structured family life around religion, school, as well as hard work on the farm and creamery. As a result, he became a good student, worker, athlete, and general. In June 1945, Eisenhower returned to his hometown as not the leader of the forces that helped to defeat Nazi Germany but as another citizen who was proud of the values that he learned from the people there.",

    "bodyText": "<p>From \"<a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/history-of-fbi-headquarters\">History of FBI Headquarters</a>\" <br /> <br /> \"From its inception in 1908 until 1975, the main offices of the FBI were housed in the Department of Justice building. The first request for a separate FBI building occurred in 1939. Although the Public Buildings Agency initiated plans for an FBI building in 1941, America’s entry into World War II required postponing all government building projects. The next serious request to Congress for a separate building was not made until 1961...</p>   <p>On October 7, 1964, the National Capital Planning Commission approved the major design concept with its security modifications. The approved plan consisted of 2,800,876 square feet of space for 7,090 employees. Height limits of 107 feet (seven stories) along Pennsylvania Avenue and 160 feet (eleven stories) along E Street conformed to the Pennsylvania Avenue Advisory Council and District of Columbia requirements.</p> <p>For reasons of economy, the approving agencies insisted upon poured concrete as the major outside building material. The concrete used for the FBI building contained an aggregate of crushed dolomite limestone, a unique composition. While contrasting with the traditional marble, granite, or limestone government buildings, it echoed a major architectural style of the 1960s. The concrete was poured into reusable steel forms separated by metal ties. The ties remained in the concrete when the molds were removed. This technique produced an architectural feature of evenly spaced holes throughout the exterior....</p> <p>The first FBI employees moved into the new building June 28, 1974. At that time, FBI Headquarters offices were housed in nine separate locations. By May 30, 1975, the Director, the associate director, and several divisions had moved in. Thirty-eight years after the first proposal for a separate FBI building and 15 years after Congress approved construction on the Pennsylvania Avenue site, the last employees moved into the building in June 1977.</p> <p>The building received its official name, the J. Edgar Hoover F.B.I. Building, through Public Law, 92-520, which President Richard Nixon signed May 4, 1972, two days after Director Hoover’s death. President Gerald Ford dedicated the building on September 30, 1975.\"<br /> For information on visiting the FBI Headquarters, visit \"<a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/fbi-headquarters/the-fbi-experience\">The FBI Experience</a>\"</p>",

A windowless wooden door they all face remains closed in front of them. The wall and door are imbedded in an approximately ten-foot high granite wall about seventy-five feet long.<br />Just behind them, to the left, is an inscription on the granite wall which reads:<br />The Test of Our Progress is Not Whether Add More to the Abundance of Those Who Have Much, It Is Whether WE Provide Enough for Those Who Have Too Little.<br />Further to the left is another bronze sculpture, of two sullen figures. A man stands with both arms at his sides. To the right is a woman in a chair, her hands in her lap. Behind them is an eight-foot high wooden wall with open swinging wooden window.<br />Spanning the top of the granite wall, above both sculptures, is an inscription that reads:<br />I See One Third of a Nation Ill-Housed, Ill-Clad, Ill-Nourished<br />Along the west-side wall of this plaza area is another bronze sculpture. It features an approximately fifty-foot wide, ten-foot tall granite wall with a thirty-foot wide, eight-foot tall square opening, that recedes about three feet into the wall at an angle. On the left side of the open space in the wall is a sculpture of a man in pants and rolled up sleeves is seated slightly to the right, his arms resting on his knees, as he listens to a 1940's-era radio on a wooden stand.<br />Along the right side of the granite wall is an inscription that reads:<br />I Never Forget That I Live in a House Owned by All the American People and That I Have Been Given Their Trust.<br />Walking around the wall, you will come into an open area with five ten-foot tall pillars with four-foot tall bases and tops.<br />An about one-hundred foot-long, eight-foot high mural runs across the backside of the wall. Similar artwork is wrapped around the middle of the five pillars. The five-paneled wall mural is a collage of various scenes and objects, including initials, faces, and hands; the images on the mural are inverted on the five columns and feature tactile reliefs with braille writing.<br />On the opposite side of this plaza from the wall is a thirty-foot wide stepped waterfall. An inscription to the left reads:<br />I PROPOSE TO CREATE A CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS TO BE USED IN SIMPLE WORK...MORE IMPORTANT, HOWEVER, THAN THE MATERIAL GAINS WILL BE THE MORAL AND SPIRITUAL VALUE OF SUCH WORK.<br />One additional wall inscription within the 2nd Term room reads:<br />IT IS TIME TO EXTEND PLANNING TO A WIDER FIELD, IN THIS INSTANCE COMPREHENDING IN ONE GREAT PROJECT MANY STATES DIRECTLY CONCERNED WITH THE BASIN OF ONE OF OUR GREATEST RIVERS.<br />TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "The FDR Memorial: 4th Term room is home to the statue of Eleanor Roosevelt. As you enter, inscribed on the ground is: FOURTH TERM 1945. On the granite wall to the left is inscribed: \"More Than an End to Wars, We Want and End to the Beginnings of All Wars.\" Entering the plaza area from the west, a bronze mural sits in a space setback and down a ramp about fifty feet, on the granite perimeter wall along the right side. The mural is a bas-relief depicting the funeral procession of FDR. Spanning about thirty feet across, it shows three horses on the far left, the lead horse cloaked in a blanket. They pull a funeral carriage followed by about fifteen people, heads bowed. A still pool of water about four-feet wide and running along the entire back wall, sits beneath the mural. Following the ramp back down and the right, a couple steps and two railings are on the right side along the wall. A two by two square foot granite wall borders the ramp in the middle of this area. Around the corner to the right, and setback in a four-foot deep alcove is the statue of Eleanor Roosevelt. She wears a long coat and her hands are clasped. She stands next to a bronze United Nations emblem of a globe bracketed by a wreath of olive branches. Beneath the emblem is inscribed: Eleanor Roosevelt First United States Delegate To the United Nations. An inscription to the left of the sculpture reads: \"The Structure of World Peace Cannot be the Work of One Man, or One Party, or One Nation... It Must be a Peace Which Rests on the Cooperative Effort of the Whole World.\" Five steps arch around the backside of Room 4, three have inscriptions of a timeline of events in President Roosevelt's life. A final waterfall of large five by six granite blocks lines the right-side wall as you leave this area. Spanning about sixty feet across, it seems as if the blocks are being put back in place. Some are stacked neatly on top of each other, others sit in the pool of water below, as if the structure is not yet complete but well in progress. Inscriptions on the right wall around the corner from the waterfall and as you exit the memorial to the east read: \"The Only Limit to Our Realization of Tomorrow Will be Our Doubts of Today. Let Us Move Forward with Strong and Active Faith. Freedom of Speech; Freedom of Worship; Freedom from Want; Freedom of Fear.",

Visitors will discover that Room Two is divided into two halves by a wall. There are two sculptures straight ahead on the wall in the first half. “Appalachian Couple” and “The Breadline”, both created by sculptor George Segal, clearly depict the troubling times faced by both urban and rural communities during the Depression and the Dust Bowl. To the right of both those works is a third sculpture, also by George Segal. “Fireside Chat”, set in an alcove, shows how FDR often communicated to the American people. It’s a reminder that his radio broadcasts were intended to inform Americans that his administration was working for them to solve the problems facing the nation.</span></p> <h3>Combating Economic Depression</h3> <p><span style=\"color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\">Continuing to combat the Great Depression, President Roosevelt's New Deal created federal programs to stabilize the economy, provide relief, and create jobs for millions of Americans. Most Americans had never heard a president's voice before FDR began his radio broadcasts. His confident and plain-spoken \"fireside chats\" reassured Americans even as many New Deal programs failed, and the Great Depression dragged on. FDR easily won reelection to a second term in 1936. <br /> <br /> Roosevelt's administrations created over 75 new programs to fight the Great Depression. These sculptures represent 54 of the \"alphabet soup\" of New Deal programs. Explore this model (right) depicting some of these programs. If you carry a Social Security card, you participate in one of the lasting New Deal programs. </span></p> <h3>New Deal Programs</h3> <p><span style=\"color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\">Civilian Conservation Corps (C.C.C.), Federal Communications Commission (F.C.C.), Federal Deposit Insurance Corps (F.D.I.C.), Federal Housing Administration (F.H.A.), National Labor Relations Board (N.L.R.B.), Social Security Board (S.S.B.), Tennessee Valley Authority (T.V.A.)</span></p> <h3>Memorial Quotes in Room Two<strong> </strong></h3> <p><span style=\"color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\"><em>\"We must scrupulously guard the civil rights and civil liberties of all our citizens, whatever their background.

With 93 beds - each with a different variety of bright blooms - the library features a variety of lovely flowers that are planted over months.<br /> <br /> The flower beds are prepared by National Park Service gardeners in the fall, so they can be planted in the spring with tulip bulbs from Holland. Once the tulips have bloomed, the season progresses and the bulbs are removed, so our team can start preparing for the annuals. The display of annuals changes each summer. The final group is the planting of chrysanthemums in the fall before the tulip buds are prepared for the following spring.<br /> <br /> The Floral Library was established in 1969, as a part of First Lady \"Lady Bird\" Johnson’s Capital Beautification Project. The garden concept was based on putting “masses of flowers where masses pass.” The goal was to make the National Mall more appealing and engaging. So now, when you see locals and tourists near the Floral Library with their picnics and photo shoots, you'll know the reasons why and all the work that goes into it. It is a location to be enjoyed, but please don't pick the flowers.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4> <p>A revolutionary presidential memorial that opened in 1997, the FDR Memorial was not a monolithic, white marble structure, but a flowing landscape architecture design. The memorial is designed as a timeline best experienced by starting at the northernmost end of the memorial. Bronze sculptures by several artists depict the longest-serving president and the major issues he dealt with during his presidency including the Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II.<br /> <br /> This entry is an overview of the entire memorial with specific attention to the \"Prologue\" room. For more specific information about each \"room\" in the memorial, see the following records:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fdr-memorial-1st-term.htm\">FDR 1st Term</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fdr-memorial-2nd-term.htm\">FDR 2nd Term</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fdr-memorial-3rd-term.htm\">FDR 3rd Term</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fdr-memorial-4th-term.htm\">FDR 4th Term</a></li> </ul> <h4>About the memorial</h4> <p>The national memorial dedicated to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States, lies about half way between the Lincoln Memorial and the Thomas Jefferson Memorial in Washington, DC. Its four open-air rooms represent each of the four terms of office to which he was elected. A meandering pathway leads past waterfalls, bronze sculptures, and FDR’s own powerful words carved on the granite walls. The memorial honors the memory of one of America’s great leaders and the optimism and courage that he shared with his fellow citizens through the ordeals of the Great Depression and World War II. A statue of Roosevelt sitting in a wheelchair greets visitors and reminds them of the man who refused to let disability stop him. <br /> <br /> When Congress established the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission in 1955, there was already a modest memorial to Roosevelt in Washington, DC. Roosevelt told his friend Felix Frankfurter what he wanted: “a block about the size of [this desk] . . . in the center of that green plot in front of the Archives Building.” The new, larger memorial took over 40 years of planning before its dedication on May 2, 1997.<br />  <br /> The FDR Memorial Commission selected landscape architect Lawrence Halprin to design the memorial in 1974. The result, with its shade trees, waterfalls, and quiet alcoves, feels more like a secluded garden than a traditional memorial. Walls of red South Dakota granite define the memorial’s outdoor rooms and the passageways connecting them. Waterfalls, quiet pools of water, and Roosevelt’s own words, beautifully incised into the granite walls by master carver John Benson, create a mood of quiet reflection.<br />  <br /> Each room conveys in its own way the spirit of the man. In Room One, a bronze bas-relief of the first inauguration, one of the early public sculptures created by Robert Graham, introduces the first years of Roosevelt’s presidency, when he launched the New Deal in response to the worst economic crisis the nation had ever known. George Segal created the powerful sculptures in Room Two. The Breadline represents the despair of the Great Depression. The Fireside Chat depicts the hope that Roosevelt’s inspiring words gave to ordinary people.<br />  <br /> In Room Three of the memorial, a waterfall crashes over scattered boulders, suggesting the destruction and violence of World War II, which dominated Roosevelt’s third term in office. Neil Estern created the statues of Roosevelt and his beloved dog, Fala, calmly presiding over the chaos surrounding them. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s hopes for the future are engraved on the wall next to his statue:<br />  <br /> <em>\"We have faith that future generations will know that here, in the middle of the twentieth century, there came a time when men of good will found a way to unite, and produce, and fight to destroy the forces of ignorance, and intolerance, and slavery, and war.\"</em><br />  <br /> The centerpiece of Room Four is a monumental bas-relief created by sculptor Leonard Baskin. The Funeral Cortege represents the nation in mourning after the death of the only president many of them could remember. Neil Estern’s statue of Eleanor Roosevelt honors her contributions as first lady and as one of the early delegates representing the United States at the newly formed United Nations.<br />  <br /> One of the things visitors to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial see is a simple, but powerful, statue of FDR sitting in the kind of wheelchair he used after the polio attack that paralyzed his legs in 1921. Halprin carefully designed the FDR Memorial to be accessible for people with all kinds of disabilities, but the original plans did not include this sculpture. Spokespersons for the disabled protested, arguing that showing the truth of FDR’s paralysis, something that he himself rarely allowed, would increase awareness and set an inspiring example for others who struggled with disability. Congress agreed. Robert Graham created the present statue, dedicated in January 2001.<br /> <br /> <strong>Landscape Architect: </strong>Lawrence Halprin</p> <h4>Inscriptions - \"Prologue\" section of memorial</h4> <p>Outer wall, front<br /> Franklin Delano Roosevelt<br /> President of the United States<br /> 1933 - 1945<br /> Outer wall, back<br /> Men and Nature Must Work Hand in Hand.

    "audioDescription": "(294 words) The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial is located along the western edge of the Tidal Basin, south of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, on West Basin Drive SW, about 400 feet east of Ohio Drive SW. The memorial covers seven and one-half acres and consists of a sequence of four open-air rooms. A meandering pathway leads past water features, bronze sculptures, and FDR’s own words carved on the granite walls. Approaching the memorial from the west-side main entrance, an open plaza area is shaded by thirty-foot trees on the left. A twenty-foot tall wall of granite blocks runs along the left half of the plaza’s far end. Across the wall is inscribed: Franklin Delano Roosevelt President of the United States 1933 - 1945 Also, on the left of the entrance plaza is a one-story building, featuring equal-sized thirty by twenty-foot FDR exhibit room on the right and bookstore to the left. An area of five, two-foot high granite benches are set along the building’s left front, and three thirty-foot tall trees line the front of the building entrance. This building also houses restrooms on its backside. A life-size bronze statue of Roosevelt sitting in a wheelchair greets visitors on the right side of this entrance plaza area. Behind him along a ten-foot high granite wall is a bronze sign that reads \"Franklin's illness...gave him strength and courage he had not had before. He had to think out the fundamentals of living and learn the greatest of all lessons - infinite patience and never ending persistence.\" Eleanor Roosevelt The same text in enlarged braille is below. Four two-foot high granite benches surround the statue. As you leave this area and proceed east to the next space, inscribed on the granite block pathway is written: PROLOGUE END OF DESCRIPTION",

The stone pavers of Freedom Plaza depict a map of Washington, DC, according to planner Pierre Charles L'Enfant's plan for the city.<br /> <br /> Inscriptions<br /> WESTERN PLAZA PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE<br /> Western plaza consists of a large raised terrace in which part of L'Enfant's original 1791 plan for Washington, DC is rendered in black and white stone. At one end of the raised terrace is a pool. At the other is a shaded sitting area around a statue of General Pulaski.<br /> Inscribed on the upper terrace are historic quotations about Washington. Low walls separate the plaza from the surrounding traffic. Eleven large urns rest on top of these walls and contain seasonal plantings. The upper map terrace has a grass lawn where the Mall occurs and inlaid bronze plans of the White House and the Capitol located at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue. The inlays illustrate L'Enfant's intention to have these two buildings balance each other and symbolize two main branches of government. The siting of the Treasury in the 19th century blocked the view of the White House and obscured this relationship.<br /> L'Enfant's plan of Washington combines two orders of scale. The giant order is the diagonal avenues that sometimes terminate in a building or a monument. This order is the rectangular grid pattern of the local structure of the city.<br /> Western Plaza acknowledges both orders since it is shaped by the rectangular grid of the local scale and is an element within the giant order of Pennsylvania Avenue.<br /> 1 Pool 3 Mall 5 Capitol<br /> 2 White House 4 L'Enfant's Plan 6 Pulaski Statue<br /> Plaque, north side<br /> THE GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES<br /> 1782 1782 1885<br /> OBVERSE REVERSE OBVERSE<br /> IN 1776 THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS ADOPTED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE CREATION OF A SEAL FOR THE NEW NATION.

TO UNDERTAKE THE TREMENDOUS WORK OF ORGANIZING THE AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCES, GENERAL PERSHING LANDED IN FRANCE ON 13 JUNE 1917.<br /> BEGINNING ON 21 MARCH 1918, THE GERMAN ARMIES LAUNCHED A SERIES OF POWERFUL ATTACKS ON THE WESTERN FRONT. ON THAT DATE THERE WERE ONLY 300,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN FRANCE MOST OF THEM BUT PARIALLY TRAINED. THE FIRST OFFENSIVE ACTION BY A U.S. DIVISION CAME ON 28 MAY WHEN CANTIGNY WAS ATTACKED AND HELD DESPITE VIOLENT ENEMY REACTION.<br /> SIMULTANEOUSLY THE GERMANS SURGED ACROSS THE AISNE RIVER AND ADVANCED RAPIDLY TOWARD THE MARNE. U.S. REINFORCEMENTS HURRIEDLY BROUGHT INTO POSITIONS DIRECTLY ACROSS THE GERMAN PATH OF ADVANCE TOWARD PARIS, STOPPED THE ATTACK, THEN, ON 6 JUNE, U.S. TROOPS, INCLUDING A BRIGADE OF MARINES, STRUCK BACK AND IN FIERCE COMBAT LASTING A MONTH, RECAPTURED BELLEAU WOOD AND THE TOWN OF VAUX. THE LAST GREAT GERMAN OFFENSIVE OF THE WAR CAME ON 15 JULY ALONG THE MARNE EAST OF CHATEAU-THIERR. IT WAS PROMPTLY REPULSED IN A SEVER STRUGGLE IN WHICH AMERICAN TROOPS PLAYED A LEADING PART. THE IMMEDIATE U.S.-FRENCH COUNTERATTACK ON 18 JULY AT SOISSONS MARKED THE TURNING POINT OF THE WAR.<br /> THEREUPON THE U.S. FIRST ARMY WAS ORGANIZED AS A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT AMERICAN ARMY WITH ITS OWN ASSIGNED SECTOR. AS GENERAL PERSHING HAD INSISTED FROM THE BEGINNING, UNDER HIS COMMAND. ON 12 SEPTEMBER, IT ASSAULTED THE ST. MIHIEL SALIENT WHICH HAD WITHSTOOD ALL ATTACKS FOR 4 YEARS. BY 16 SEPTEMBER, THE SALIENT WAS ELIMINATED. TEN DAYS LATER, THE FIRST ARMY LAUNCHED THE MEUSE-ARGONNE OFFENSIVE SUDDENLY CONCEIVED, HURRIED IN PLAN AND PREPARATION, AND BRILLIANTLY EXECUTED, THIS BATTLE, IN WHICH OVER 1,000,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS FOUGHT, STANDS OUT AS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN ARMS.<br /> DURING OCTOBER ALSO, U.S. TROOPS HAD SEIZED BLANC MONT RIDGE AND GENERAL PERSHING HAD ORGANIZED THE U.S. SECOND ARMY, WHICH ENTERED THE LINE ON THE RIGHT OF THE FIRST, ON OTHER BATTLEFIELDS, AMERICANS SERVING WITH THE BRITISH ARMIES HAD ATTACKED IN AUGUST NEAR YPRES, BELGIUM AND HAD TAKEN PART IN THE SOMME OFFENSIVE. IN SEPTEMBER, NEAR ST. QUENTIN, THEY HAD BROKEN THROUGH THE HINDENBURG LINE. DURING OCTOBER, THEIR ADVANCE CONTINUED, AND NOVEMBER SAW U.S. UNITS ADVANCING FURTHER INTO BELGIUM. ELSEWHERE, AMERICANS SERVED WITH DISTINCTION IN ITALY, NORTHERN RUSSIA, AND SIBERIA.<br /> DURING THE WAR, THE AIR SERVICE WAS EXPANDED INTO A STRIKING FORCE WHICH SUPPORTED THE GROUND TROOPS AND GAVE PROMISE OF THE VITAL ROLE THAT OUR AIR FORCES WOULD PLAY IN THE FUTURE. AT THE SIGNING OF THE ARMISTICE ON 11 NOVEMBER 1918, MORE THAN 2,000,000 AMERICANS WERE SERVING IN EUROPE, EITHER WITH THE COMBAT FORCES OR IN THE SERVICES OF SUPPLY, WHOSE UNHERALDED WORK MADE POSSIBLE THE BRILLIANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE ARMIES IN THE FIELD.<br /> DURING SEPTEMBER 1918 THE ALLIED FORCES LAUNCHED A GENERAL OFFENSIVE ON THE WESTERN FRONT. IN THIS OPERATION THE U.S. FIRST ARMY WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF BREAKING THROUGH THE EXTREMELY STRONG AND VITAL DEFENSIVE SYSTEM BETWEEN THE MEUSE RIVER AND THE ARGONNE FOREST. THE ATTACK STARTED ON 26 SEPTEMBER AND AFTER TWO DAYS OF INTENSE FIGHTING THE DOMINATING HILL OF MONTFAUCON WAS CAPTURED. THE GERMAN TROOPS STUBBORNLY DEFENDED EACH POSITION, BUT BY 30 SEPTEMBER HAD BEEN DRIVEN BACK SIX MILES.<br /> ON 4 OCTOBER, THE ASSAULT WAS RENEWED. THE RESISTANCE ENCOUNTERED WAS DESPERATE WITH THE ENEMY RAPIDLY POURING IN MORE DIVISIONS FROM OTHER BATTLE FRONTS. THOUGH DUBJECTED TO FURIOUS COUNTERATTACKS, THE ADVANCE CONTINUED RELENTLESSLY ON THE LEFT FLANK. A BRILLIANT ATTACK IN THE AIRE VALLEY MADE POSSIBLE THE CAPTURE OF THE ARGONNE FOREST. ON THE RIGHT U.S. AND FRENCH TROOPS CROSSED THE MEUSE WHERE SEVERE FIGHTING ENSUED FOR POSSESSION OF THE HEIGHTS BEYOND. ANOTHER ASSAULT ON 14 OCTOBER DEVELOPED INTO A PROLONGED STRUGGLE AGAINST VIOLENT RESISTANCE BUT THESE ATTACKS, NEAR CUNEL AND ROMAGNE, BROKE THROUGH THE GERMAN MAIN LINE OF DEFENSE AND PENETRATED THAT LINE BEYOND THE VILLAGES OF ST. JUVIN AND GRANDPRE.<br /> THE LAST GREAT OFFENSIVE BEGAN ON 1 NOVEMBER WITH THE CAPTURE OF THE FORMIDABLE POSITION ON BARRICOURT HEIGHTS. THREE DAYS LATER THE ENEMY WAS IN FULL RETREAT WEST OF THE MEUSE CONTINUOUSLY PURSUED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER. THESE SUCCESSES AND THOSE OF OUR ALLIES COMPELLED THE GERMANS TO ASK FOR AN IMMEDIATE ARMISTICE WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE 11 NOVEMBER 1918.</p>",

The grass lawn measures eighty feet long, parallel to Constitution avenue and seventy feet wide.<br />Each of the two side garden areas features a circular cobblestone plaza with fountains in their center, bracketed by garden areas. The plazas measure fifty feet long and forty feet wide. Granite benches line the inner arc of the plaza, facing east and west. Wood benches sit at the north side of the garden along Constitution avenue allowing for views of the Washington Monument and White House.<br />The inner gardens, closest to the plaza, are rectangular and measure fifty feet long and forty feet wide. They each have a thirty-foot tall, hanging tree and shrubs, plantings and flowers throughout.<br />The outer gardens are thinner, twenty feet wide and seventy feet long and feature bushes, shrubs and other plantings.<br />A plaque set along the base of the west garden along Constitution avenue, has an inscription that reads:<br />German-American Friendship Garden<br />1683-1983<br />Commemorates 300 years of German immigration and contributions to America and symbolizes the friendship between the German and American people.<br />Also set along Constitution avenue, to the east of the central garden and along the sidewalk, is a three by four-foot wayside.

The background behind them is an image of the American and Germany flags melding together in the middle. Text:<br />In 1983, President Ronald Reagan established the Presidential Commission for the German-American Tricentennial. The commission's planning included this landscape designed by Wolfgang Oehme. During German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's final White House meeting with President Reagan on November 15, 1988 (above), Kohl noted the spirit of \"friendship and solidarity\" this garden evokes.<br />The bottom left corner features a black and white image of a three-story home with four windows on the first level, five windows across the second, and two gabled windows on the roof. A man rides a seated bicycle down the sidewalk to the left. Below the picture is labeled:<br />The Deshler-Morris House<br />The first organized group of German immigrants landed on American shores on October 6, 1683. They purchased land from William Penn, proprietor of Pennsylvania, and established the village of Germantown. The Deshler-Morris House (left) is also known as the Germantown White House because President George Washington used it in the 1790s while Philadelphia served as the national capital.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

His chin rests on his right hand and he has a somber look on his face. He holds an unmarked book in his left hand and another under his left arm.<br />Inscribed on the front face of the pedestal is written:<br />\"LONGFELLOW\"<br />A three-inch high banded wheat-designed border connects the pedestal and its fourteen square foot-wide bottom base. At the bottom left edge of the statue base is etched:<br />\"Gorham Co. Founders\"<br />The statute sits in a sixty square foot plaza area with stone tile floor. Longfellow faces Connecticut avenue to the east. To his right and behind him are wood benches set under a thirty-foot tall tree set in the plaza area. Tress and bushes also line the back of the plaza area.<br />The plaza angles to a point at its north end, with a two-foot high, brick walled flower bed about twenty feet long and ten feet wide. A smaller flowerbed is set on the opposite side of the plaza, which angles around to the back. Benches are set before and after the right-side flower bed.<br />A walkway with traffic light is at the north end, 18th and Connecticut avenue, as well as at the south end intersections of M street with 18th street and Connecticut avenue.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Part of the plan was to collectivize agriculture, meaning farmers had to surrender their crop to the state for redistribution among the entire population.

    "audioDescription": "(391 words)<br />The Holodomor Memorial to Victims of the Ukrainian Famine-Genocide of 1932-1933 is located at the intersection of North Capitol Street, Massachusetts Avenue, and F Streets N.W. The memorial is set just off the sidewalk and opens up to face you on the right side as you walk slightly uphill east on Massachusetts Avenue, one block before Union Station.<br />The main feature of the memorial is a six-foot tall dark bronze wall with a five-foot high relief design of a wheat field. A gray cement brick-pattern defines the triangle-shaped space from the red brick sidewalk that runs along Massachusetts Avenue.<br />Facing the wall, from left to right across 30 feet, highly articulated bronze wheat heads and stalks about four feet tall initially project outward from the rectangular pane, and then gradually recede into the wall and finally, as the recess steadily deepens on the right, fade away completely.<br />\"HOLODOMOR 1932-1933\" appears in raised lettering about 6inches tall at the base of the receding wheat stalks, the dates farthest to the right where the recess is greatest. The entire bronze wall rests on a black granite base that is about two feet tall at its highest point on the left and deepens as the site slopes down to the right, spanning about seventy feet from the sidewalk to the left around to the end of the memorial on the right.<br />To the right of the wheat field design on a separate panel of the black granite wall is a bronze panel about 6-feet tall by three-feet wide with raised lettering in English and below in Ukrainian that reads<br />FAMINE-GENOCIDE<br />IN UKRAINE<br />In Memory of the Millions of Innocent Victims<br />Of a man-made famine<br />In Ukraine engineered and<br />Implemented by Stalin's<br />Totalitarian regime<br />The west side of the plaza area features a three-foot high black granite ledge for seating that spans thirty feet. A three-foot long bench spans the northern end, closest to the sidewalk.<br />The back of the memorial wall features a design pattern of black squares, trapezoids, and random shapes of about 3 by 3 inches along the back wall. A bed of shrubs and about seven-foot shade trees line the back behind the wall, which is bordered by a 3-inch high rounded cement curb. The entire back is bordered by the red brick of the street sidewalk.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "In front of you is an illustration of the sculpture that will be installed in this space in 2024. \"A Soldier's Journey\" depicts a series of scenes based on the myth of \"the hero's journey,\" in which a recurring figure of an American soldier embarks on a quest, wins victory in an epic struggle, and comes home changed by his passage through peril. The soldier also represents, on a second level, the American experience of World War I. This illustration shows the artistic process from initial sketch, to clay sculpture, to finished bronze.<br /> <br /> The sculpture is the work of Sabin Howard, who together with architect Joseph Weishaar won the competition to redesign Pershing Park as a national World War I memorial. Howard began by viewing thousands of photographs of the war. He then brought actors and models into his studio, where he posed them in scenes inspired by his research. Rather than putting them into static, artificial poses, he gave them stage directions to move through a scene, and then captured the motion in more than 12,000 photos. <br /> <br /> Howard then selected and assembled images into a series of tableaus similar to what is before you. As Howard took new photos and revised the images, the story evolved. The process culminated in a six-foot-long scale model or \"maquette\" of the proposed sculpture.<br /> <br /> Once the maquette was approved, Howard re-shot every figure in a rig holding 160 high-speed digital cameras. Working with Pangolin Editions foundry and Steve Russell Studios, Howard generated 3-D computer images from the terabytes of digital data. Pangolin then created full-scale polyurethane versions of the images, which formed the armatures for the sculpture. This process, which took about 15 months to complete, would have taken six years using traditional methods.<br /> <br /> Howard then applied clay to the armatures and began sculpting the figures. As each of four sections is completed, it is cast in bronze. When all four sections have been cast, they will be re-assembled and shipped here for installation. <h2>Photo captions</h2> Sculptor Sabin Howard sculpts a maquette of \"A Soldier's Journey.\"<br /> Howard works on the clay sculpture that will ultimately be cast in bronze.",

Set on a south east corner on a grassy patch of the park is a three by four-foot wayside. The quoted title across the top reads:<br />\"Damn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead!\"<br />The main body text reads:<br />With the legendary words, naval officer David G. Farragut led the Union fleet past Confederate mines (then call torpedoes) and to victory at the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. From the rigging of his flagship, USS Hartford, Farragut directed the clash with the ironclad CSS Tennessee, as shown in this painting of the battle.<br />Earlier in the Civil War, Farragut gained national prominence by capturing New Orleans after a fierce battle with Confederate forts and ships. President Lincoln had assigned him command of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. Lincoln believed Farragut was one of the best appointments he made during the entire war.<br />The left two-thirds of the sign are a color painting depicting the battle of two ships. Smoke fills the area as a crowd of about thirty men work the riggings and cannon of a ship in the foreground. In the background towards the top, a man stands confidently along the ships mast as others look on from his right, amongst the chaotic scene. An American flag waves in the top left corner. A tattered Confederate flag can be seen through thick smoke on the right side.<br />The top right corner of the sign shows a black and white photograph of an older man in naval officer's uniform. Text written across the torso of the image reads:<br />David Glasgow Farragut 1801-1870<br />United States Navy's First:<br />**Rear Admiral<br />***Vice Admiral 1862<br />****Full Admiral 1866<br />Text to his left reads:<br />Congress created three new naval ranks, including Full Admiral, especially for David G. Farragut. Admiral Farragut was the son of Jorge Farragut, a Spanish-born mariner and hero of the American Revolution.<br />The lower two-thirds of the sign's right column show a black and white photograph of a woman wearing a headscarf, sitting on a stool and working on a ten-foot tall white statue of a naval officer holding a telescope and resembling the Farragut statue. Text on the right reads:<br />Vinnie Ream Hoxie, a young female sculptor, carefully researched the life of Farragut and produced Washington, DC's first statue of a Civil War hero. The statue was dedicated on April 25, 1881, the nineteenth anniversary of Farragut's capture of New Orleans. The ten-foot figure and the four mortars were cast from the propeller of the Admiral's flagship, USS Harford.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

The field of trees spans about 300 feet across and back about 200 feet to the south.<br />The wayside sign features text in three columns in English and French. Waving American and Canadian flags of about 3 by 3 inches are in the lower left corner.<br />The lower right corner features a 6 by 5-inch color photograph of two fully grown, bright red maple trees. An image of a red maple leaf lays over the bottom right edge of the photograph.<br />A caption below the photograph reads:<br />Mature red maples display their brilliant deep scarlet leaves in autumn. The red maple leaf (right) is the central element of the flag of Canada.<br />The left column of text reads on the sign:<br />Standing before you are several of the 150 maples given to the United States by Canada in celebration of our northern neighbor's 150th anniversary (1867-2017).<br />The maple leaf is recognized worldwide as a symbol of Canadian strength, endurance, and values. From the maple's early discovery by Canada's Indigenous Peoples, this symbol can be found on Canada's national flag, currency, and military uniforms.<br />The United States and Canada have a unique relationship among the community of nations. The two countries share the world's longest and most secure border and have a long history of peace. In addition to geographic proximity, close connections are shared by families, friends, and communities in the two countries. The United States and Canada also have the most successful trade and investment relationship in the world and share the values of freedom and democracy.<br />The French translation of this text forms the middle column.<br />The third column of text reads:<br />\"On our own, we make progress. But together, we make history. Duty-bound, loyal, and forever linked. Whatever the future holds, we will face it together. Neighbours, friends, partners, and allies. That is our experience and our example to the world.\"<br />- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, March 10, 2016<br />French translation of this text is just below the English version, and just above the photograph of the two maple trees and red maple leaf image.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "<h2>The Evolution of a City Block</h2> General John J. Pershing died in 1948. The troops he led to victory 30 years before in World War I wanted a memorial. of the potential locations, the block that you are standing on was the most appealing. It was available and it was next to the most famous street in the nation's capital.<br /> <br /> Pennsylvania Avenue is the symbolic and physical connection between the Capitol and the White House. Early on, the street attracted stores, hotels, and theaters. But after 120 years, the federal government needed more space. Workers demolished many blocks of old buildings, including this one. Offices were built on the other side of Pennsylvania Ave. but this block sat empty.<br /> <br /> By 1959, approvals and a design for a Pershing memorial were complete. The project only needed money. Then, John F. Kennedy rode up Pennsylvania Avenue during his 1961 Inauguration Day paratde. He noticed that this area was r un-down and reportedly told an aide to \"fix it.\" Kennedy's request became a priority and the Pershing Memorial went on hold while a larger plan was developed.<br /> <br /> The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation dedicated Pershing Park in 1981. In the intervening years, planners had changed the purpose of the block from a memorial to a place for many activities. A tribute to the general, designed by Wallace Harrison, was included.<br /> <br /> The rest of the site was a modernist landscape designed by M. Paul Friedberg. Grassy hills secluded the park from the city. A sunken area became a pool in warm weather and a skating rink in cold. A kiosk rented skates and sold food. Seating at the park's edges gave people a place to eat their lunches or watch skaters.<br /> <br /> As the 2014-2018 centennial of World War I approached, Pershings last living soldier, Frank Buckles, wanted a national memorial to the war. Authorities again proposed and considered locations and selected this site. Congress passed a law in 2014 converting Pershing Park into the World War I Memorial.<br /> <br /> Photo captions:<br /> 1846 - Today this place is the World War I Memorial but its first name was simply \"Block 226.\"<br /> 1875 - The earliest structures on this block were theaters and row houses.<br /> 1939 - This block existed as an immense traffic island for many years.<br /> 1981 - Friedberg's Pershing Park in front of the Willard Hotel, undergoing expansion.<br />  ",

Logan Memorial sits in the center of Logan Circle at the convergence of 13th street, P street, Rhode Island Avenue and Vermont Avenue, NW. Walkways with traffic lights lead into the circle and monument from all intersecting streets.<br />Approaching from the east, a one-hundred-foot walkway leads into the circle and memorial from P street, NW. About eighty feet along the path a three by four-foot wayside sign is on the left. A three-foot tall iron gate runs from the right of the sign towards the park center plaza.<br />The top lines of the wayside contain the following quote attributed to John A. Logan, with an image of his signature to the right of it:<br />\"We should guard their graves with sacred vigilance. All that the consecrated wealth and taste of the Nation can add to their adornment and security is but a fitting tribute to the memory of her slain defenders.\"<br />Below on the left is a black and white photograph of Logan with a full mustache and dress in military uniform with double-breasted buttons and a medal on the left of his chest. Beneath is written: \"John A. Logan 1826-1886\"<br />The main body text of the wayside reads:<br />Politician turned soldier, Illinois Congressman John Alexander Logan ranks among the great Civil War heroes. Faithful to Abraham Lincoln and the Union, he courageously fought alongside Federal troops in 1861 at the First Battle of Bull Run in Virginia. After four years of service, Maj. Gen. Logan proudly led the Union Army of the Tennessee along Pennsylvania Avenue in the 1865 Grand Review of the victorious Union armies. Once again a politician, Logan championed veterans' rights as chairman of the powerful House Committee on Military Affairs, and as the 1884 Republican Nominee for Vie-President of the United States. Logan's great legacy emerges each May when this Nation recognizes all its fallen military heroes on Memorial Day.<br />The right side of the sign features four pictures. The top left image is a historic illustration showing rows of men in military uniform marching while waving American flags. A soldier plays a drum in the front. A quote along the top reads:<br />\"While above them floats Old Glory, Boon to all the world oppressed\"<br />Along the bottom is written:<br />1861-1865<br />Text below reads:<br />As Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), a Union veterans organization, Logan issued General Order No. 11 in 1868, establishing May 30 as Decoration Day evolved into Memorial Day to honor every American who died in wartime service. In 1971, Congress changed the date from May 30 to the last Monday in May.<br />To the right is a black and white photo of a man standing among a crowd of seated men in top hats. American flags blanket the railing on front of them. Text below reads:<br />April 9, 1901 - President William McKinley (seated at center, above) officiated the Logan Memorial dedication ceremony. The memorial took its place at the center of Iowa - later Logan - Circle. Unique among Washington's equestrian tributes, with statue and main pedestal each cast in bronze, this memorial incorporates the visions of American sculptor Franklin Simmons and Logan's widow, Mary.<br />The bottom left image is the profile of two men in suits, set amongst American flags and a bald eagle set in the top center. A woman cloaked in the flag is set between them. The right man is labeled James G. Blaine, and below the right man is John A. Logan. Text beneath them reads:<br />The Republican Party nominated Logan as James G. Blaine's Vice-Presidential running mate in 1884.<br />At the bottom right is a black and white image of a casket draped with the American flag and lined with sprays of flowers. A row of people stands behind. Text below reads:<br />December 26, 1886 - John A. Logan died. He laid in state in the US Capitol rotunda and later was buried in Washington's Soldiers' Home National Cemetery.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION <br />",

It features a yellow background and is titled in the upper left corner in black letters:<br />Lighting the Way<br />Below is a color picture of a woman in a yellow Japanese kimono with blue, red, and green flowers. Her right arm is extended as she lights a flame in a black stone lantern with four curls along its roof. Text beneath and to the right of the picture<br />Each year the National Park Service and the National Conference of State Societies conduct the traditional Lantern Lighting Ceremony. The Embassy of Japan appoints a Cherry Blossom Princess for the occasion. As the audience counts down from five, the lantern is lit in an exciting event that signals the arrival of spring in the Nation's Capital.<br />Originally offered in 1921 to complement Japan's 1912 gift of flowering cherry trees, this two-ton, 17th century stone lantern soon fell victim to deteriorating relations between the United States and Japan. For thirty-two more years, it stood next to its twin in Tokyo's Ueno Park, awaiting developments. Tension erupted on December 7, 1941 after the Japanese military bombed US Naval forces at pearl Harbor, Hawaii.<br />When cultural ties, peace, amity, and commerce reemerged following World War II, Ambassador Sadao Iguchi of Japan presented the lantern to the city of Washington, DC Dedicated on March 30, 1954, the lantern celebrates the centennial of the opening of peaceful relations between the two nations. This 1854 event also is honored by a Washington Monument commemorative stone, a United States Navy Memorial bronze bas-relief, and the Japanese Pagoda across the Tidal Basin.<br />The right column of the sign shows a diagram of a lantern with letters from A to G lining the left side at various points along the lantern. Text below identifies and explains the locations:<br />A. houju - a sacred gem<br />B. kasa - cherry blossom adorned hood<br />C. hibukuro - firebox with moon phases<br />D. chuudai - lotus flower middle base<br />E. soa - lantern support<br />F. kiso - lantern base<br />G. kidan - lantern platform<br />About two feet to the right is a second wayside. It features an upper background picture of a line of trees along the edge of a still body of water. The title in the upper left corner in white letters reads:<br />A Symbol of<br />International Friendship<br />Text below reads:<br />On March 27, 1912, First Lady Helen Herron Taft, Viscountess Iwa Chinda, wife of the Japanese ambassador to the United States, and a small group of people assembled at the Tidal Basin. There they planed the first two of more than 3,000 flowering cherry trees that were given to the city of Washington, DC by the city of Tokyo. Afterwards Mrs. Taft presented Viscountess Chinda with a bouquet of American Beauty roses. Four years later when the young trees bloomed, the blossoms began to serv as an annual reminder of the friendship between the United States and Japan.<br />Set on a green background at the bottom half of the sign are two black and white photographs. The left picture is of a seated woman in a rose of her dress. Below she is identified as: First Lady Helen Herron Taft. The right picture is of a woman on a fur coat with a tall-brimmed hat. She is identified below as: Vicountess Iwa Chinda.<br />Text in the center of the sign describes the image of trees that sits above:<br />Two Original Trees<br />The grove you are looking at is the site of the original planting. Staying on the trails and the walkways helps protect the trees by preventing soil compaction.<br />The lower right corner features a picture of a plaque set on the face of a small stone set among a grove of cherry trees. An enlarged image of the plaque shows an inscription on the commemorative stone:<br />THE FIRST<br />JAPANESE CHERRY TREES<br />PRESENTED TO<br />THE CITY OF WASHINGTON<br />AS A GESTURE OF FRIENDSHIP<br />AND GOOD WILL BY THE CITY OF<br />TOKYO, WERE PLANTED ON THIS SITE,<br />MARCH 27, 1912.<br />National Capital Sesquicentennial Commission<br />1950<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

About fifty feet northwest from the northern end of the parking lot is a two by three-foot wayside, set on the west side of a pedestrian sidewalk. About fifty feet to the west, beyond a grass lawn lined with cherry trees is the Tidal Basin.<br />The sign features a color image across the left two-thirds of the sign showing two people sitting on a park bench in front of a still body of water. A cherry tree with pink leaves in full bloom hangs over them. Two other people walk along the water's edge to the left. The sign is titled below them on a light-green background to read:<br />Keeping the Cherry Trees Healthy<br />Text below reads:<br />Flowering cherry trees need constant care to keep them growing and blooming well. They are pruned once a year to remove damaged or diseased limbs. A second annual pruning shapes the trees. Soil that has been compacted - one of the great dangers to the trees' health - must be aerated so that oxygen and moisture can reach their roots. Dead trees are replaced with young saplings grown from cuttings so the original stock is constantly replenished. Healthy, well-maintained trees live longer and produce more blooms. National Park Service arborists have been so successful in their work that about 100 of the more than 3,000 trees planted in 1912 survive today.<br />The upper right corner of the sign features a closeup image of a person pruning a tree branch. The picture is titled above: A Gift for Japan.<br />The famed cherry trees along the Arakawa River near Tokyo, which provided the parent stock for the original 1912 gift to Washington, DC, had fallen into decline after World War II. Japan requested assistance in rejuvenating the grove in the Adachi Ward; in 1952, the National Park service shipped budwood from descendants of the original trees to Tokyo.<br />Below is a picture of four men in hardhats standing with chain saws, the Jefferson Memorial stands behind them. The image is titled above: Cherry Trees Are Their Business.<br />The trees have been cared for and maintained using the best-known tree care practices since they arrived from the city of Tokyo in 1912. The tree crew is made up of trained professionals and certified arborists. They are dedicated, many working for more than twenty years, and a few have been second-generation tree crew members. Their work is year-round and demanding, requiring attention to the numerous varieties of cherry blossom trees that have become world-renowned.<br />A set of chain saws and gardening tools is displayed below. Text below reads:<br />Keeping tools clean and sharp is essential for successful pruning. Clean cuts made by bypass pruners, hand saws, and chain saws minimize the danger that pests of disease will harm the trees.

In 1909, the project was endorsed at the highest level by First Lady Helen Herron Taft, who had seen photographs of the flowering trees from Japan. The first gift of trees from the city of Tokyo to the city of Washington, DC arrived the next year.<br />A brown box below reads:<br />The 1910 Shipment.<br />Two thousand cherry trees arrived in Washington, DC from Tokyo on January 6, 1910. US Department of Agriculture scientists were becoming more aware of the danger posed by insects and pests imported from abroad. Insects and nematodes were found on the trees and the entire shipment had to be destroyed. A difficult diplomatic situation was avoided through the combined efforts of the US State Department and Japanese authorities. On March 26, 1912, a new shipment of more than 3,000 healthy trees arrived. The first two trees were planted the next day.<br />Below is an image of a one-page telegram. Text below reads:<br />The 1910 letter from the US State Department to Japanese officials.<br />A black and white image to the right shows tree branches stacked into a pile and set on fire. Text below reads:<br />Burning the trees, 1910.<br />Four black and white photographs are line along the bottom of the sign to the right. The first image is of a woman in a high-collared dress. Text below reads:<br />Eliza Scidmore<br />(1856-1928) had a career in journalism and a deep interest in Japanese culture. Shoe promoted the planting of Japanese flowering cherry trees in Washington, DC for more than 20 years.<br />The next image to the right is of an older man in round glasses and gray mustache. Text beneath reads:<br />Dr. David Fairchild<br />(1869-1954), a US Department of Agriculture botanist, oversaw the introduction of thousands of ornamental, food, and other plant species into the United States.<br />The third picture is of a man in a hat with a curled mustache. Text below identifies him as:<br />Yukio Ozaki<br />(1858-1954), Mayor of Tokyo at the time of the gift of cherry trees, was committed to advancing good relations between Japan and the United States.<br />The furthest picture to the right is of an older man with a curled mustache in a suit and tie. Text below reads:<br />Dr. Jokichi Takamine<br />(1854-1922), a distinguished chemist famous for the isolation of the hormone adrenaline and the first president of the pharmaceutical company Daiichi Sankyo, played a pivotal role in the city of Tokyo's gift of trees to the city of Washington, DC<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Turn left and proceed about fifty feet southeast. Set on the northeast side of a large circular plaza is a three by four-foot wayside.<br />The sign has a blue background and is titled across the top in gold letters:<br />The Navy Memorial - From Bow to Stern<br />A quote below in gold letters reads:<br />\"...without a decisive naval force we can do nothing definitive, and with it, everything honorable and glorious.\"<br />George Washington<br />The center right of the sign features a color photograph of a soldier in blue naval uniform with white cap facing to the right and holding a baby in his arms. Text:<br />The United States Navy Memorial's roots are as old as the Nation's Capital itself. Major Peter C. L'Enfant envisioned a great federal city that would be home to grand government buildings and prominent memorials. L'Enfant signaled the importance of the Navy by selecting the notable 8th Street vista - midway between the Capitol and the White House - as the site for a Naval Itinerary Column.<br />The column never appeared, but the current memorial suitably sits astride that 8th Street vista. Here, one may honor those who forged the Navy's heritage, pay tribute to the fallen, and demonstrate gratitude to those Sailors now serving.<br />Below is a color photograph showing an overhead view of a circular plaza surrounded by six flagpoles, lined with triangular fountains at its bottom corners, and featuring a black and white map of the world in its center. Two tall curved buildings with columns sit at the top two sides of the plaza, their curved facades following that of the round plaza. Yellow dots on the picture with numbers one through eight identify various aspects of the site. Those locations are listed to the left of the picture:<br />1. Compass Rose - the entrance point to the Navy Memorial. Surmounted by the Department of the Navy seal, this represents the Navy's true course in defending our nation.<br />2. Fountain Pool - honors the men and women of the US Navy as well as the international navies that cooperate with the US Navy. Each pool annually is salted with water from the Seven Seas and the Great Lakes.<br />3. Bronze Reliefs - 26 sculptures depict naval scenes from times of war and peace.<br />4. The Lone Sailor<br />5. The Granite Sea - this granite map reminds visitors of the expanse of the earth's oceans, aligns perfectly with the earth, and is centered in Washington, DC<br />6. The Concert Stage - plays host to military band performances.<br />7. The 8th Street Vista<br />8. Naval Heritage Center - celebrates the heritage and history of sea service people and their time honored traditions of the sea.<br />In the top right corner of the sign is a color picture of men standing at attention with rifles set at their shoulders. They wear sailor uniforms with flap collars, white caps and knickers. Among them is a waving American flag and set in the foreground is the backside of a bronze statue of a man in sailor's jacket with a duffle bag at his left side. Text:<br />The Lone Sailor<br />Perhaps, the most enduring element of the memorial and the one to which most visitors are drawn, is The Lone Sailor. Although a seasoned, seagoing veteran, The Lone Sailor depicts an individual, at most 25 years of age, who willingly serves his country but longs for his return home to family and friends.<br />The bronze sculpture fittingly contains metal from eight historic US Navy ships - USS Constitution, USS Constellation, USS Hartford, USS Maine, USS Ranger, USS Biloxi, USS Hancock, USS Seawolf - and the modern Navy's National Defense Service Medal.<br />Across the bottom of the sign are a series of flags. An American flag, larger than the others, sits in the left corner. From left to right the other flags represent the US Navy, US Marine Corps, US Coast Guard, US Merchant Marine, Prisoner of Wear - Missing in Action, Chief of Nava Operations, and Navy First Jack.<br />Text above states:<br />All images courtesy of the US Navy Memorial Foundation and the United States Navy.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II honors Japanese Americans who lived in incarceration camps and those who served in the US military during WWII.<br /> <br /> Located just north of the U.S. Capitol at the intersection of New Jersey Ave. & D. St NW, this memorial reflects on the legacy of Japanese incarceration camps in the United States during World War II. Many Japanese Americans were treated with suspicion and as potential spies, and were sent to incarceration camps, in many cases for several years, to sit out the war because of their race, not because of any actual espionage. As a result, many were displaced and were never able to return home when the war ended.<br /> <br /> The memorial incorporates symbolism such as a zen garden motif, but the most striking feature may be the bronze sculpture of Japanese cranes entangled in barbed wire.</p> <h2>Inscriptions</h2> <h4>Pool edge</h4> <p>\"Here we admit a wrong. Here we affirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law.\"<br /> President Ronald W Reagan Upon Singing the Civil Liberties Act 1988</p> <h4>Left wall</h4> <p>\"May this memorial be a tribute to the indomitable spirit of a citizenry in World War II who remained steadfast in their faith in our democratic system.\"<br /> Norman Y. Mineta, internee at Heart Mountain, Wyoming.<br /> <br /> \"I am proud that I am an American<br /> of Japanese ancestry.<br /> I believe in this nation's<br /> institutions, ideals and traditions.<br /> I glory in her heritage.<br /> I boast of her history.<br /> I trust in her future.\"<br /> Mike M. Masaoka, civil rights advocate, staff sergeant at 442nd Regimental Combat Team.<br /> <br /> \"Our actions in passing the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 are essential for giving credibility to our constitutional system and reinforcing our tradition of justice.\"<br /> Robert T Matsui, internee at Tule Lake.</p> <h4>Right wall</h4> <p>On February 19, 1942, 73 days after the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 which resulted in the removal of 120,000 Japanese American men, women and children from their homes in the western states and Hawaii.<br /> <br /> Allowed only what they could carry, families were forced to abandon homes, friends, farms and businesses to live in ten remote relocation centers guarded by armed troops and surrounded by barbed wire fences. Some remained in the relocation centers until March 1946.<br /> <br /> In addition 4,500 were arrested by the Justice Department and held in incarceration camps, such as Santa Fe, New Mexico. 2,500 were also held at the family camp in Crystal City, Texas.<br /> <br /> Answering the call of duty, young Japanese Americans entered into military service, joining many pre-war draftees. The 100th infantry battalion and 442nd regimental combat team, fighting in Europe, became the most highly decorated army unit for its size and length of service in American Military History. Japanese Americans in the Military Intelligence Service used their bilingual skills to help shorten the war in the Pacific and thus saved countless American lives.

    "audioDescription": "(408 words)<br />The Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II is located on a 3/4-acre triangular site at the intersection of Louisiana Ave, New Jersey Ave, and D Street NW, just north of the US Capitol. When facing north from the intersection of Louisiana and New Jersey Avenues you will be at the entrance.<br />An approximately 7-foot wide cement walkway bends slightly around to the left as you enter, past grassy areas on both sides with 7 to 10-foot tall trees. Flower gardens with a 3-foot high cement border are on both sides. Etched into the cement curb on the right is:<br />\"Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II\"<br />The walkway leads into a semi-circular plaza, surrounded by 7-foot tall white granite wall on the back side. Five large white granite boulders, between four and seven-feet wide sit in an elevated pond area beyond a lower four-foot high section of the wall to the right.<br />At the center of the plaza area sits a bronze sculpture consisting of two Japanese cranes with 5 to 6-foot wing spans spread wide vertically. They are both caught in barbed wire and are on top of an approximately 7-foot tall, square pedestal made to resemble natural carved rock.<br />Turning clockwise, the wall lowers to about 4 feet for a span of 25 to 30 feet, offering a view of the pool, then rises again to seven feet.<br />At the north end of the plaza, the walkway bends around to the right and opens up to the pond area on the right. The pond is elevated about three feet, and the five white boulders sit in its center. The water spills over this side of the pond, in front of three cement benches.<br />Further along the wall, following these quotes, and also opposite the pond, are five panels of the wall which feature over 800 engraved names. Beneath the names is inscribed:<br />\"Here we honor those who died in service during World War II\"<br />On the opposite side of the walkway a round, shiny metal tube hangs horizontally from the wall at about seven feet. A metal guard rail is below the metal tube.<br />Just beyond the pond and bell the walkway reaches the exit to the memorial and sidewalk. A red Japanese maple tree sits at the memorial corner to the right, amongst a garden bed which also lines the front of the pond along the sidewalk of Louisiana Avenue.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(744 words)<br />The John Ericsson Memorial sits in a small traffic circle south of the Lincoln Memorial and the intersection of Ohio Drive SW and Independence Avenue SW in the west end of West Potomac Park in Washington, DC.<br />The Potomac River sits to the south of Ohio Drive and access to this memorial is easiest from the pedestrian walkway along the Potomac River. There is no crosswalk however and access is very difficult.<br />The monument sits on a grassy patch of land that curves at its south end by eastbound Ohio Drive, and comes to a pointed end one hundred feet to the north at Independence Avenue.<br />The granite memorial features a seated six foot five-inch figure in a long coat. He rests his right arm on his knee and holds his left hand across his chest. Standing behind him are three figures amidst.<br />Directly behind Ericsson is a female figure clothed only in a slipping cloth around her waist. She holds a cloth over her head. Below her is inscribed: Vision.<br />The south facing figure is a shirtless man resting a staff with circular handle on the ground. Beneath him is inscribed Labor.<br />The third figure is an armored warrior in a helmet and protecting his left side with a large shield. He grips a sword in his right hand. Beneath him reads: Adventure.<br />The sculpture stands fifteen feet tall and rests on a round pedestal, which sits on a fifty by fifty-foot square block. Engraved around the top edge of the square pedestal block is:<br />John Ericsson<br />AD 1803<br />AD 1883<br />Inventor and Builder of the Monitor<br />He Revolutionized Navigation by His Invention of the Screw Propeller<br />The circular plaza of the memorial measures one hundred feet in circumference and features three sets of steps along its east, west and south sides. Bushes line the seventy-foot backside of the memorial and provide five openings to enter from the grass lawn.<br />Across Ohio Drive about fifty feet to the north is a four by three-foot wayside, titled across the top to read:<br />\"I love this country. I love its people and its laws; and I would give my life for it just as soon as not.\"<br />John Ericsson<br />Swedish-born John Ericsson revolutionized maritime navigation through the first practical use of a stern-mounted propeller. Ironically he remains better known for an invention to sink ships not propel them.<br />During the early stages of the Civil War, concern over the Confederate ironclad vessel Virginia gripped American seaports. Wooden-hulled ships remained no match for those sheathed in armor.<br />On March 9, 1862, the USS Monitor - an ironclad of Ericsson's design - fought the Virginia to a draw at Hampton Roads near Norfolk, Virginia. Its success initiated construction of more Ericsson-designed ironclads for President Abraham Lincoln's increasingly formidable arsenal.<br />Following the war Ericsson continued his groundbreaking work in the fields of naval engineering and solar power development. His successful career provided a shining example to immigrants who journeyed to American shores in search of a better way of life.<br />A faded image to the right shows a half-bald man in coat with his arms crossed. Below the image is labeled:<br />John Ericsson<br />1803-1889<br />To his right is a diagram of the hull of a ship, labeled USS Monitor below.<br />The bottom half of the sign shows two iron ships at battle. The ship in the foreground has a rounded top and is almost completely submerged. It shoots out of a gun in the rounded center at another iron ship in front of it. A ship sinks to the left among other sailing ships in the background. Text on the right side reads:<br />The Memorial<br />Lobbied by the American Scandinavian Alliance, Congress authorized the John Ericsson Memorial in 1916. Architect Albert Randolph Ross and sculptor James Earle Fraser were tapped to be its creative forces. The memorial was dedicated on May 29, 1926, before a crowd of 5,000, which included President Calvin Coolidge and Swedish Crown Prince Gustav Adolf Fraser's sculpture embodied Ericsson seated in deep thought shadowed by the female figure of Vision, and American ironworker as Labor, and a Viking warrior as Adventure. At their backs, stands the Tree of Life from Norse mythology. All are symbols of Ericsson's genius, heritage, and adopted homeland. The pink Milford, Massachusetts granite used here is also used in the Lincoln Memorial. In fitting tribute, these two guardians of the Union - Lincoln and Erickson- together maintain silent watch along the Potomac River.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(656 words)<br />The John Paul Jones Memorial lies west of the Washington Monument, east of the World War II Memorial, and north of the Tidal Basin in West Potomac Park in Washington, DC<br />The memorial sits on a triangular park on the north side of westbound Independence Avenue, at the intersection with 17th Street. The park is bordered by busy streets and access is very difficult.<br />The statue stands in front of a shallow rectangular alcove in a fifteen-foot tall, ten-foot wide marble shaft. Three steps lead up to the bronze Jones statue, which measures ten feet tall.<br />Jones faces to the north and wears a tri-fold hat, long, buttoned military coat with shoulder tassels, ruffled tie with buttoned vest, and buckled shoes. His right fist is clenched and his left-hand rests on the handle of a sword at his waist.<br />Above Jones an inscription along the pylon reads:<br />John Paul Jones<br />Two wreaths sit above on both sides. Along the top of the pylon face is a sculpted eagle with spread wings and encircled by a wreath. On both sides are an anchor among reeds and wrapped by a rope.<br />Below the statue is an inscription that reads:<br />1747. 1792.<br />FIRST<br />TO COMPEL FOREIGN<br />MAN OF WAR<br />TO STRIKE COLORS<br />TO THE STARS AND STRIPES<br />On each side of the monument water flows out of the mouths of sculpted fish into a ten by five-foot pool. On the reverse side of the monument is a bas-relief of Jones raising the American flag on a ship. Below him is inscribed:<br />In Life He Honored the Flag. In Death the Flag Shall Honor Him.<br />On both sides of the inscription is a design of a military helmet with floral top sitting amongst swords, hatchets, and tridents.<br />Along the top face of the backside of the pylon is inscribed:<br />Surrender?<br />I Have Not Yet Begun to Fight!<br />Across Maine Avenue to the north sits a four by three-foot wayside. The light-blue sign is titled in black letters across the top to read:<br />\"Every officer in our Navy should know by heart the deeds of John Paul Jones\"<br />President Theodore Roosevelt<br />Text below reads:<br />The American Revolution<br />A bold captain - fearless even when facing the superior British Royal Navy - John Paul Jones ensured his place in American history.<br />Further below is a black and white image of a man in tri-fold hat and military uniform. To his right he is labeled:<br />John Paul Jones<br />1747-1792<br />Text below details the life of John Paul Jones:<br />Jones, a recent Scottish immigrant, readily accepted an appointment in the new Continental Navy following the start of the American Revolution. He captained several ships during the war and became a celebrated hero. Jones' voyage to fame became a familiar story to immigrants who succeeded through personal achievement instead of inherited right of birth.<br />The main feature of the sign is a vivid image of three ships in sea at battle, with bright red, blue, and red and white striped sails. Smoke billows from two of the ships and men stand along the masts and ship decks. Three other ships approach in a line from the left. Text in the center reads:<br />In 1779, while captaining the Bonhomme Richard, Jones captured the H.M.S. Serapis during a spectacular and bloody engagement fought within the view of the British shore. Dubbed \"the pirate Paul Jones,\" Jones' exploits reminded British citizens they were not immune from the effects of war. Perhaps Jones' greatest contribution toward American independence was that he became a hero precisely when the cause needed one.<br />Text in the upper right corner, titled The Memorial, reads:<br />On April 17, 1912, President William Howard Taft dedicated this memorial. Jones is depicted standing defiantly upon the deck of the Bonhomme Richard during battle and is surrounded by nautical symbols and fountains. Jones' memorial honors someone who exemplified bravery, heroism, and devotion to duty in the face of overwhelming odds.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(513 words)<br />The Korean War Veterans Memorial is located south of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, and north of Independence Avenue SW in the West Potomac Park of Washington, DC<br />From the intersection of westbound Independence Avenue and Daniel French Drive, SW, travel east about eighty feet along Independence Avenue. Turn left and proceed up the pedestrian walkway four hundred feet to the north. Turn right and proceed one hundred seventy feet to the Korean War Veterans Memorial north entrance.<br />The design of the Korean War Veterans Memorial is of a triangle intersecting with a circle. North and south walkways lead into the memorial through the sides of a forest area to a field of statues.<br />Nineteen stainless steel statues, all about seven feet tall, stand in patches of Juniper bushes and are separated by polished granite strips that run horizontally between them. The men are spaced about ten feet apart. The field is about one hundred feet wide at its west end and narrows to a point about one hundred fifty feet to the east.<br />The troops wear helmets and ponchos covering their weapons and equipment. Some carry rifles and radios and appear to have backpacks under their ponchos. The men are of varying ethnicities. All are generally faced towards the memorial center to the east, although some look back behind them and to the sides as they walk.<br />A polished black granite wall, about six feet tall, spans the south side of the south walkway that leads to the center of the memorial. The wall stretches east one hundred sixty-four feet towards the memorial center. Over two thousand five hundred white images of soldiers are etched along the black surface of the wall. The images of the silver military statues across the walkway also reflect in the shiny wall surface, making the nineteen statues appear to be thirty-eight.<br />Along the north edge of the northside walkway into the memorial is an angled granite curb inscribed with the names of twenty-two countries separated by an emblem of a map of the world set over a pattern of circles and lines and bracketed by a wreath.<br />Set at the east end of the memorial is a tree-lined circular plaza. In the center is a shallow circular pool, two hundred fifty feet in circumference, lined with black granite and surrounded by a grove of linden trees and seven granite benches. The pool features a one-foot waterfall around its edge.<br />The trees are trimmed to have a block-shaped leaf design and allow for six feet of clearance space underneath. An inner row of trees surrounds the pool and a second row is set about ten feet back along the outer edge of the plaza.<br />A black granite wall, about four feet tall lines the south side of an alcove that protrudes into the pool. An inscription of the north side of the wall reads:<br />FREEDOM IS NOT FREE<br />An inscription on a low angled curb on the opposite side of the alcove displays statistics on the number of US and United Nations casualties of the Korean War.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Lincoln Memorial honors the 16th president of the United States, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/lincoln-memorial-statue-of-lincoln.htm\">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Presiding through the Civil War, Lincoln not only saved the Union, preserving its government, boundaries, and ideals, he reinvigorated the nation's founding principle - that all men are created equal. The memorial opened in 1922, and is not only a national landmark, it is a source of contemplation and inspiration for millions of visitors each year. <br /> <br /> The memorial is built in the style of the Greek Parthenon, a rectangular structure with tall, white columns towering above those walking among them. The columns represent the states in the United States during Lincoln's presidency, and correspond to state names listed above. Symbolizing the strength of the union of the states, the motif of a bundle of rods appears throughout the building: below Lincoln's arms, in the mural above the Gettysburg Address, in the margins of the Second Inaugural Address, on the walls flanking the stairs, and in the columns of the building itself. The memorial makes little doubt of Lincoln's importance as the \"Savior of the Union.\"<br /> <br /> Until the late 1800s, the current land under the Lincoln Memorial did not exist; it was in the Potomac River. When the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deepened the river, they deposited the dredged silt along the banks, expanding the land to its current configuration. Almost immediately, the memorial's backers proposed the reclaimed land as the site for a memorial to Lincoln, but this nearly mile-wide swath of dredged, stinking mud formed an unappealing aesthetic. Its attractiveness improved after landscaping and engineering transformed the land's appearance by the early 1900s.<br /> <br /> The decision to place the memorial at its current location came in 1913, and construction started the following year. Henry Bacon designed the building, Daniel French sculpted the statue, and Jules Guerin painted the two murals. Working together, they created an iconic symbol of our nation and our ideals.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(436 words)The Lincoln Memorial is located on the western end of the National Mall in Washington, DC, east of the Potomac River and west of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. From the intersection of Lincoln Memorial Circle, NW and Henry Bacon Drive, proceed three hundred sixty-five feet south through an open plaza area to the base of the Lincoln Memorial steps.The memorial resembles a classic Greek temple, roughly 67 yards wide, 44 yards deep, and 26 yards tall. Among bas reliefs of wreaths and garlands, the names of the states in the union at the time of Lincoln's death are inscribed above the colonnade, and the names of the states in the union at the time of the memorial's dedication are inscribed above them. The years that the dates entered the union are inscribed in Roman numerals below their names.<br />Travel west up granite steps past twelve forty-four-foot-tall columns that line the front of the memorial. The Memorial's interior is divided into three chambers by two rows of four columns, each fifty feet tall.<br />Set along the back, west interior wall is the sixty foot-wide, seventy-four foot-deep, and sixty-foot-high white marble Lincoln statue. He faces east, looking across the Reflecting Pool and out at the Washington Monument. On the south interior wall, to the right of where Lincoln is seated, is inscribed the Gettysburg Address, and on the north wall, Lincoln's second inaugural speech. Inscribed on the wall behind the statue is:<br />IN THIS TEMPLE<br />AS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE<br />FOR WHOM HE SAVED THE UNION<br />THE MEMORY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN<br />IS ENSHRINED FOREVER.<br />The bearded Lincoln wears a long coat and vest. His hands rest on the arms of the chair on which he sits. Fasces are etched along the front faces of the chair arms.<br />The sides and back of the memorial feature a twenty-foot wide platform among the columns of the structure, providing views of tree-lined Lincoln Memorial Circle to the north and south, and Arlington Memorial Bridge to the west as it carries over the Potomac River.<br />Set on the highest platform of the memorial steps is an inscription commemorating Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. The inscription faces away from the memorial directing the reader to look out over the steps and plaza below, the tree-lined Reflecting Pool and the Washington Monument all in a straight line to the east.<br />A small bookshop area is in the northeast corner of the interior chamber. Restrooms and a Lincoln exhibit space are located at the left side of the memorial at the bottom of the steps.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br /> But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work, which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us. That from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.

    "bodyText": "<p>Inscribed into the north side of the Lincoln Memorial chamber is President Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, delivered in 1865. In the speech, Lincoln explores the causes and meanings of the American Civil War, which was nearing its end. Above the insciption is a mural by painter Jules Guerin depicting the concept of unity. In the mural, the Angel of Truth joins the hands of two figures representing the north and south. Her protective wings cradle figures representing the arts of Painting, Philosophy, Music, Architecture, Chemistry, Literature, and Sculpture.<br /> <br /> Fellow-Countrymen, at this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.<br /> On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war--seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.<br /> One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh. If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said \"the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\"<br /> With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) was the preeminent civil rights leader of the 1950s and '60s. King was a Baptist preacher and evangelist of nonviolent resistance. King rose to prominence through the effort to desegregate buses in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955-6 and the demonstrations in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963 where he wrote is famous \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" At the height of the Civil Rights movement, King delivered his renowned \"I Have a Dream\" speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963 during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The demonstration in particular, and the larger movement in general, helped spur lawmakers to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ending segregation and discriminatory voting laws and practices.<br /> <br /> King was particularly notable for his insistence on \"nonviolent resistance,\" a strategy he developed after studying and applying the work of Henry David Thoreau, Mohandas Gandhi, and Reinhold Niebuhr, among others. King realized that non-violent resistance could only succeed \"if the groups against whom the resistance was taking place had some degree of moral conscience.\" If all Americans could see the injustice inherent in Jim Crow laws, King believed morality would compel the nation to side with the activists.<br /> <br /> The strategy of non-violence allowed the demonstrators to retain a clear position as victims of amoral oppression and violence. Television, photographs, and print media would allow the world to witness the drama of oppression in the South. Men, women, and children joined in the protests knowing that they could and would be jailed, injured, or even killed. The people's courage to put themselves in harm's way in the historic moment of the Civil Rights Movement was fueled by generations of blacks that King said had been \"seared in the flames of withering injustice,\" and bolstered by faith in Dr. King's method of non-violence.<br /> <br /> This memorial to King depicts a 30-foot carving of King on a feature called the \"Stone of Hope\" that is being moved out of a feature called the \"Mountain of Despair,\" a reference to a line in the \"I Have a Dream speech\" called back in the inscription on the side of the statue. King is represented standing firm, resolute, and thoughtful, holding a rolled stack of papers. Quotations from speeches and writings are engraved on the arced \"Inscription Wall\" on the flanks of the memorial.<br /> <br /> Books and memorabilia are available in the adjacent bookstore; head through the mountain sculpture and the building will be across the street to the left. Restrooms are also located at the bookstore, accessed from outdoors on the left side of the building. <br /> <br /> The memorial opened in August 2011. The formal dedication was scheduled for the anniversary of the March on Washington on August 28, 2011 but was postponed to October due to a hurricane. The participants included President Barack Obama. </p> <h4>Inscriptions</h4> <p>\"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" District of Columbia, 1968<br /> <br /> \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.\" 1963<br /> <br /> \"I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger that evil triumphant.\" Norway 1964<br /> <br /> \"Make a career of humanity. Commit yourself to the noble struggle for equal rights. You will make a greater person of yourself, a greater nation of your country, and a finer world to live in.\" District of Columbia, 1959<br /> <br /> \"I oppose the war in Vietnam because I love America. I speak out against it not in anger but with anxiety and sorrow in my heart, and above all with a passionate desire to see our beloved country stand as a moral example of the world.\" California 1967<br /> <br /> \"If we are to have peace on earth, our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class, and our nation; and this means we must develop a world perspective.\" Georgia 1967<br /> <br /> \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\" Alabama 1963<br /> <br /> \"I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.\" Norway 1964<br /> <br /> \"It is not enough to say 'We must not wage war.' It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it. We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war, but on the positive affirmation of peace.\" California 1967<br /> <br /> \"The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.\" 1963<br /> <br /> \"Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies.\" New York 1967<br /> <br /> \"We are determined here in Montgomery to work and fight until justice runs down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.\" Alabama 1955<br /> <br /> \"We must come to see that the end we seek is a society at peace with itself, a society that can live with its conscience.\" Alabama 1965<br /> <br /> \"True peace is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice.\" 1958<br /> <br /> Statue (south side): \"Out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope\"<br /> Statue: (north side, in lower corner): \"雷宜锌 12.30.2010\"</p> <h4> </h4>",
    "audioDescription": "(304 words) The Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial is located along the northwest bank of the Tidal Basin in West Potomac Park, midway between the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials. The memorial covers four acres, and is centered around the Stone of Hope, a 30-foot granite statue of Martin Luther King, Jr. Two similar large slabs of granite sit apart and slightly behind the statue, known as the Mountain of Despair. The King statue seems to emerge from these two large boulders. The MLK figure faces southeast, in the direction of the Jefferson Memorial. His gaze is off slightly to the side and his arms are crossed. He holds what looks to be a rolled-up scroll of paper in his left hand. On the side of the Stone of Hope is the inscription \"Out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.\" The signature of sculptor Lei Yixin can be found in the lower right corner. There are four entrances to the memorial. The main entrance leads through the two large open granite slabs. There are entrances on both sides of the memorial, and a fourth from the opposite side at the Tidal Basin. Restrooms can be found behind the center entrance and across Independence Avenue. Beyond the Stone of Hope is a wide plaza area which opens to reveal a stunning view of the Tidal Basin, Jefferson Memorial, and Washington Monument. Surrounding the King statue is a 450-foot arced wall featuring 14 quotes from King's speeches and writings. Trees surround the wall and also are within the plaza area. Water flows gently from the wall at its openings on both sides. The arc of the wall references King's quote \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" The Inscription Wall displays fourteen quotes from Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. END OF DESCRIPTION",

    "bodyText": "Many people walk right past this pink building, not realizing its importance to the Civil War. That skylight looks into the floor below where the photos of many prominent and lesser-known Americans were taken. On the top three floors of this building was Brady’s Gallery where he and his assistants famously took and developed photos for over thirty years. By the time he moved into this studio in 1849, Brady had already established himself as a famous photographer in New York City. Here, Brady and his assistants photographed prominent Americans such as politicians Henry Clay, Abraham Lincoln and his cabinet, Civil War generals such as U.S Grant, William Sherman, and Robert E. Lee, Native American tribal representatives, others including Frederick Douglass, Walt Whitman, Mary Todd Lincoln, and Clara Barton. His fame, though, came from photographs taken on the battlefield.When the war first began, Brady rushed to the Manassas battlefield and took photos of the grisly results of war. Brady himself, though, actually took very few of these photos, as his eyesight was failing by that time. Instead, he left the photography to his assistants including Alexander Gardner. Gardner traveled to Antietam and took photos that became part of Brady’s exhibition, \"The Dead at Antietam.\" Much to the anger of Gardner, Brady gave him no credit for the photos, and failed to note who took any of them. Gardner later decided to open his own studio two blocks north of here on 7<sup>th</sup> Street. While we might see Brady’s tactics as unethical today, it was quite common at the time in the world of photography. Once his assistants returned from the battlefields, Brady had the photos developed, and displayed here. During and after the war, he had several exhibitions here and in his studio in New York City. However, after four years of war, people grew tired and even uneasy of seeing photos of the dead, and Brady’s gallery struggled. He continued to operate his studio here until he went bankrupt in the 1880s. ",

Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen.

In other words, will it lead to a swarm for the hungry and spiritually starving millions? Then you will find your doubts and yourself melting away\". 1947<br /> Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) was a pivotal world figure of the twentieth century. Gandhi renounced all worldly possessions, devoting his life to work for the dignity and uplift of the downtrodden. To his people, he was a mahatma (Sanskrit for great soul) as proclaimed by the great Indian poet Tagore. He kept purity of means and peaceful resistance (satyagraha) at the heart of a campaign against racial discrimination in South Africa from 1893-1914. He led a famous march to the sea against the increase of salt tax in India in 1930. A charismatic leader of millions, Gandhi was the central figure in India's struggle for freedom from British rule. Gandhi was inspired by the world's great religions, and influenced by the writings of Ruskin, Thoreau and Tolstoy. His life and message inspired great leaders internationally, notably Jawaharlal Nehru, Martin Luther King, Jr., Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Nelson Mandela, The Dalai Lama, Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel and Aung San Suu Kyl. Gandhi is revered by people of conscience in all walks of life around the world.<br /> I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the cultures of all the lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any.

What would a man not pay for living?\" 1938</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(302 words)<br />The Mohandas Gandhi Memorial sits in the northwest corner of a small, triangular park formed by the intersection of Q Street, 21st Street, and Massachusetts Avenue, NW. The Embassy of India is directly across Q street to the north.<br />The park begins at a rounded point at the east end, fronted by a lawn that runs about thirty feet and widens to about ten feet across as it reaches the memorial. Pedestrian walkways lined with a six-inch curb provide a buffer between the traffic circle from the three busy thoroughfares.<br />A circular plaza of black granite brick surrounds the eight and one-half foot figure of Gandhi, who is mounted on a nine-foot by seven-foot by three-foot tall pedestal of roughly-hewn red granite.<br />The Gandhi statue has round-rimmed glasses and wears a robe around his bare torso, which is also wrapped around his right arm. He is stepping forward with his right foot and leaning on a six-foot tall staff with his right hand as he gazes downward. To the left of his left foot on the statue base is inscribed the sculptor's signature (see content text). See the content text for two additional inscriptions on the base.<br />A five-foot long red granite bench is located on the plaza's western section, facing the front of the statue, and behind it sit two rose bushes. Opposite the bench, on the plaza's eastern section, are three red granite panels with inscriptions on them, which form a twenty-foot arc around this side of the plaza. See the content text for the inscriptions on the granite panels.<br />Rose bushes and other plants are set outside the granite panels.<br />Beyond the plaza a lawn area runs sixty feet back and fifty feet along 21st street. In the middle of the lawn sits a twenty-foot tall weeping beech tree.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "Between 15th and 12th Street on the south side of Pennsylvania Avenue, once stood a neighborhood in Washington DC which by the 1850s had a very poor reputation. It’s not hard to imagine why - the smell would have been horrendous. Only three blocks south, on what is now Constitution Avenue, was the Washington City canal. Originally built for commerce, by the Civil War the canal had been abandoned and was informally used as a city sewer. Everything was thrown in, from dead animals to waste. In 1863, the Secretary of the Interior called it \"a shallow, open sewer, of about one hundred and fifty feet in width, (sometimes called a canal,) which stretches its filthy surface through the heart of the city.” With so many in DC temporarily here for the war effort, this undesirable area became home to saloons, gambling establishments, and brothels for those seeking diversions. Was this why the neighborhood was nicknamed Murder Bay by some? We may never know. But while the area was unsanitary, overcrowded, and unpleasant, many people did live here, by desperation or necessity. The Civil War more than doubled the number of those living in the city and notably included formerly enslaved African Americans seeking freedom, who were legally referred to as contraband. The military argued that since the Confederacy called them property, the Union Army had the right to seize and hire them. Many so-called contrabands moved into DC in the time leading up to the Emancipation Proclamation, and were paid to build many of the fortifications around the city. Looking for places to live, in a city undergoing a housing crisis, they established contraband camps north of the White House and here along the canal. They were joined in this area by others who found themselves in difficult circumstances.  Life was difficult for these men, women, and children who lived here, and they suffered from impoverished conditions, disease, and crime. For those living here, why did they seek refuge in such horrible conditions? We will never know. They had the greater goal, though, of seeking freedom which they achieved on April 16, 1862, when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act that freed those enslaved in the District of Columbia. While they gained this freedom, they suffered from hardships that others in the city did not face.",

A large plaza framed by two crescent-shaped light-colored marble walls, the memorial is a three-acre park nestled between the east and west buildings of the Washington DC Superior Court.<br />At either side of both the east and west entrances is a glass and metal stand with a book listing the names of police officers killed in the line of duty. Each of the two areas is encircled with a grassy lawn area and two forty-foot tall trees.<br />From the west entrance, is an approximately 100-foot long, thirty-foot wide reflecting pool. Along the front end of the pool on a three-foot high rounded curb is engraved:<br />This Memorial is Dedicated to Law Enforcement Officers in the United States of America<br />Inscribed on these Walls are the Names of Those<br />Men and Women Who Died in the Line of Duty<br />Just under the lip of the pool at its far end is engraved: \"National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\"<br />Along the outer edges of walkways on both sides of the memorial are light-colored marble walls that are inscribed with names of all US law enforcement officers-federal, state, and local-who have died in the line of duty. Each wall is 304 feet long and four feet high.<br />The walkway entrances are flanked by four bronze lions about six feet long --two male at the north entrance and two females at the south entrance. All peer across the side walkway from beds of tall grass, watching over pairs of lion cubs on the other sides. Below each of the four lions is an inscription (see main content text).<br />Each of the two outer walkways is shaded on both sides by a canopy of forty-foot tall trees sitting in garden beds of tall grass and ivy. They are all trimmed in square shapes from about six feet to their tops, providing nice shade while still allowing views into the center of the plaza. Rounded white granite curbs of about three feet high follow along the walkway on its inner sides. American and Law Enforcement Officers flags line the walkways.<br />An eighty-foot long metro escalator is at the plaza's north-side entrance, and two metro elevators rise further into the memorial plaza. Two flagpoles stand about 30 feet tall at this entrance.<br />White trellises surround the round plaza area, in the center of the memorial. A white and brown arching design pattern maps the floor, centering around a bronze medallion, about two feet across. In the center of the medallion is a rose covering a shield. Smaller shields surround the rose image, and a border of leaves encircles the shields. Engraved around the outer border of the medallion reads: \"National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\"<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

The Mall is bordered by Constitution Avenue on its north side and Independence Avenue to the south. At its center is are eight four-hundred-fifty-foot long, one hundred seventy-foot wide stretches of grass lawn that run end-to-end between the Washington Monument and US Capitol building. The lawns are separated by cross streets and a thirty-five-foot wide gravel path that also spans the outer perimeter. One hundred thirty-foot wide groves of trees sit beyond the lawn on its north and south sides.</p> <h2>Significance and Symbolism</h2> <p>The central landscape itself is the clarifying the vista - and thus the symbolic relation - between the Capitol and the Washington Monument, representing the legislative and executive branches of government (since the Washington Monument stands on axis with the White House) – the primary design intent of both the L’Enfant and the McMillan Plans, which significantly contributed to the designs of the Mall. The Mall is therefore a symbol of American democracy.</p> <p>Conceived in 1791, modified in 1902, and constructed, for the most part, in 1932-36, the Mall lies at the very center of the plan of the federal city. The Period of Significance for the Mall includes two separate periods:</p> <ul> <li>1791- 1792, encompassing the year the L’Enfant Plan was created, and the subsequent year, when changes were made to the plan by L’Enfant’s successor, Andrew Ellicott; and</li> <li>1902-1975, extending from the publication of the McMillan Plan, encompassing the years 1932-1936 when the plan was revised and largely implemented, to the year when the final tree panel was planted with elm trees following the removal of the last temporary war building a few years earlier.</li> </ul> <p>The Mall gains its significance not only from being part of the L’Enfant Plan, but also from its inclusion in the central area of the McMillan Plan, and the adaptation of this plan by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., and other planners in the 1930s. Olmsted, one of the leading twentieth century American landscape architects, for many decades played a major role in the design of Washington and helped oversee the Mall’s construction in 1932-36. This construction was authorized by an Act of Congress passed in March 1929, and funded by the Public Works Administration in the early years of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration.<br /> <br /> The Mall evolved over the course of time with the nation. From a grazing ground for animals to the protests of soldiers seeking their World War I pensions and citizens seeking their civil rights, it has been the stage for our national conversation. Today the Mall provides the setting for hundreds of public events each year, from political demonstrations to cultural celebrations, all of them expressions of American citizens’ First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly. Together with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wamo/index.htm\">Washington Monument</a> and West Potomac Park (including the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/linc/index.htm\">Lincoln</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thje/index.htm\">Jefferson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/vive/index.htm\">Vietnam Veterans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/kowa/index.htm\">Korean War Veterans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wwii/index.htm\">World War II</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/frde/index.htm\">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> memorials) the National Mall is one of the most symbolic and significant places in America. <br /> <br /> Everyday the employees of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nama/index.htm\">National Mall and Memorial Parks</a> care for the National Mall through ongoing maintenance, careful planning and management. </p>",

    "audioDescription": "(549 words)<br />This two-story tan brick and white marble paneled building is located on Ohio Drive in East Potomac Park, about 500 feet north from Buckeye Drive. Across Ohio Drive to the west is the Potomac River.<br />The building is set back about 75 feet from the sidewalk, with five cement steps leading up to a five-foot by ten-foot lime-stone landing and a glass front double door. Metal white railings run along both sides of the front steps. A wheel-chair accessible three-foot wide ramp with white railings on both sides makes a 90 degree turn around bushes on the right side and leading to the front door.<br />Gold lettering directly above the glass door front entry states \"US Park Police\". A prominent feature is the awning above the front door, which consists of four two-foot wide metal pieces which span the entire entryway, about 20 feet across, and make slight 45 degree angles in the shape of a W. Glass windows and four-foot by three-foot tall rectangular white marble paneling are also distinct features above the entryway and along the left front side of the building.<br />Four two-foot tall bushes are set just off the sidewalk about 100 feet in front of the building on the right side. A wayside is set directly in front of these bushes. The wayside is titled \"The Line of Duty\". It features a color photograph showing about thirty uniformed US Park Police Officers standing at attention along the left front side of the building with the American flag raised on a flagpole, a white park police vehicle in front, and eight horse-mounted US Park Police with light-blue helmets lined up along the right side.<br />The building in front of you serves as headquarters for the United States Park Police. Created by President George Washington in 1791, the US Park Police functions as a unit of the National Park Service with jurisdiction in all parks.<br />US Park Police officers provide law enforcement in the Washington, DC, New York City, and San Francisco metropolitan areas. Officers investigate and detain those suspected of committing offenses against the United States. The US Park Police also carries out services for many notable events conducted in national parks.<br />Several officers have paid the ultimate sacrifice while performing honorable duties for the safety and protection of the Unites States and its citizens. Their names are forever remembered and memorialized on the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.<br />\"It is not how these officers died that made them heroes, it is how they lived.\"<br />- Vivian Eney Cross, Survivor<br />Facing the building to the left, just before the front steps are two benches and two circular planters beneath a 20-foot tall shade tree. The building extends about 100 feet to the left. Between the left front side of the building and the sidewalk is a grassy area with trees which extends along the front of the building continues along the left side to the end of the block.<br />A 30-foot wide grassy patch is to the right side of the building. There is also a 20-foot tall tree on the right with a smaller seven-foot tree directly in front of it. Further to the right is another walkway, then a 40-foot wide grass area with benches and trees, then Ohio Drive.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>The National Portrait Gallery was authorized and founded by Congress in 1962 with the mission to acquire and display portraits of individuals who have made significant contributions to the history, development, and culture of the people of the United States. Today, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery continues to narrate the multi-faceted and ever-changing story of America through the individuals who have shaped its culture. Through the visual arts, performing arts, and new media, the Portrait Gallery presents poets and presidents, visionaries and villains, actors and activists whose lives form our national identity.</p> <p>As the nation's only complete collection of presidential portraits outside the White House, the \"America's Presidents\" exhibition lies at the heart of the Portrait Gallery's mission to tell the country's history through the individuals who have shaped it. Gilbert Stuart's \"Lansdowne\" painting of George Washington is the grand introductory image to this exhibition. In 2000, the Portrait Gallery was in danger of losing this painting—which had been on loan since the museum's opening in 1968—when its owner decided to sell it. A generous gift from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation allowed the \"Lansdowne\" painting to be purchased as a gift to the nation. \"America's Presidents\" continues to acquire portraits—including paintings, sculpture, photographs, caricatures, video, and time-based media—of each succeeding president. </p> <p>Over the years the collections, which were initially restricted to paintings, prints, drawings, and engravings, have grown to over 23,000 items in all media, from daguerreotypes to digital. In the late 1990s, the Portrait Gallery began commissioning portraits of presidents, beginning with George H. W. Bush. In 2006, the Portrait Gallery hosted the first Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, now a prestigious triennial event, which also brings commissioned works into the collection. The 2013 winner was Bo Gehring, whose close-up video and sound portrait of jazz musician Esperanza Spalding draws delight and praise from visitors.</p>",

    "bodyText": "The current building was finished in the 1920s and is the sixth theater on this spot. The first National Theatre was built here in 1835, but less than 10 years later it burned down. Theaters were notorious firetraps at the time, and many burned. It was rebuilt only to burn down again in the late 1850s, after which it remained vacant for over five years.At the start of the Civil War, as the National was being rebuilt, there were only two theatres in the capital, the Washington Theatre and Canterbury Hall. Canterbury Hall was a variety theater, which would later become vaudeville. Opening its doors in 1804, the Washington Theatre was the oldest theatre in DC, situated on the corner of 11<sup>th</sup> Street and Pennsylvania Avenue where the IRS building is today. During the first two years of the war, the Washington Theatre filled the entertainment void, as it was the only respectable theatre in town. On January 23, 1862, the Washington Theatre hosted President Abraham Lincoln and his wife Mary, where they saw an Italian opera. President Lincoln returned the following year in April to see a comedy with his son, Tad. Ironically, two weeks later, the actor John Wilkes Booth started leasing and managing the theatre. He continued to manage it for the next six months, before giving up his lease to the actress Laura Keene whose path he crossed again at Ford’s Theatre on April 14, 1865.By 1863, the Washington Theatre now had competition. On tenth street, John T. Ford had opened a new theater, Ford’s Theatre. Additionally, the National was finally finished, now called Grover’s Theatre for its manager, Leonard Grover. During the Civil War, this theatre became a place where the city residents escaped from the horrors of war. The three-story theater could hold over two thousand people. On the first floor and lower balcony, were the most expensive seats. The upper balcony were the cheap seats, set aside for the working class. Conveniently, Grovers provided them with a saloon. This third level, which was segregated, was likely the only option for African Americans seeking entertainment. Grover’s was also a favorite spot for the Lincoln family who attended numerous plays at the theater. On April 14, 1865, Tad Lincoln was here watching Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp when he learned the horrible news that his father had been shot at Ford’s Theatre.",

    "audioDescription": "(390 words)<br />Tucked between two pedestrian walkways on Rhode Island Avenue and M street, NW is the Nuns of the Battlefield Memorial. The site is set in a small plot about two hundred thirty feet east of Connecticut avenue, along two busy commuter streets. St. Matthew's Cathedral is across Rhode Island Avenue to the north.<br />The memorial space is rounded at its west end, where the sidewalks of M street and Rhode Island avenue meet. At this end a curved cement curb runs along a grassy lawn that leads east about twenty feet to a flower bed in front of the monument. Beyond the flower bed, a cement bench is set in front of the memorial and on a twenty-four by twenty-seven-foot cobblestone plaza.<br />The memorial features a large bronze bas-relief on a six by eleven-foot rectangular granite slab that sits on a twenty-foot long granite base. The panel is of twelve nuns shown standing from head to toe and dressed in traditional habits. Above the relief is inscribed:<br />They comforted the dying, nursed the wounded, carried hope to the imprisoned, gave in his name a drink of water to the thirsty.<br />Centered above the inscription is an engraving of a cross encircled by a wreath. Beneath the relief is another inscription which reads:<br />To the memory and in honor of the various orders of sisters who gave their services as nurses on battlefields and in hospitals during the Civil War<br />Each end of the slab has a seated bronze female statue. The left-side figure wears a helmet, robes, and armor. Sitting, she holds a shield in her left hand and a scroll in her lap with her right hand. On the right side of the slab, a winged figure sits wearing a long dress, a bodice, and a scarf around her head. Her hands are folded on her lap. Along the bottom right side of the sculpture a signature is inscribed:<br />Jerome Connor 1924<br />An inscription on the lower back of the granite slab reads:<br />Erected by the Ladies Auxiliary to the Ancient Order of Hibernians of America. A.D. 1924<br />By Authority of the Congress of the United States<br />Four-foot tall bushes line both sides of the memorial and run along the back. Beyond the back-side bushes to the east is a garden of ivy, about twenty by thirty feet across.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

A one-story, gray building with green roof and columns sits on the north side of the road, to the left of a tree-lined circular plaza. Proceed north about one hundred feet through the plaza and an approximately one hundred-foot walkway will lead you to the World War II Memorial Pacific entrance.<br />The Pacific entrance consists of a forty-three-foot tall granite arched pavilion, engraved at the top to read: PACIFIC. The interior of the pavilion features four, twelve-foot tall bronze columns supporting four bronze bald eagles, holding in their beaks a ribbon wrapped around a wreath.<br />On either side of the pavilion are fourteen granite pillars, each seventeen feet tall. Each features a bronze wreath towards the top on either side, a rectangular opening, and are engraved at the bottom with the name of an American state or territory. Along with twenty-eight pillars on the opposite, Atlantic side they form a semi-circle around the memorial plaza.<br />The floor of the Pacific entrance has a round bronze plaque in its center, engraved to read: World War II. The plaque has an image depicting a robed woman looking to her right. She holds the broken handle of a sword in her right hand and the blade in her left. She stands behind the shining sun and rests her right bare foot on top of a warrior's helmet in the ground. A circular block pattern of granite stone surrounds the plaque. A six-inch gray outer border is engraved in bronze at the north end to read:<br />1941-1945<br />Engraved around the border in clockwise direction reads:<br />Victory on Land<br />Victory at Sea<br />Victory in Air<br />The north end of the Pacific entrance has a two-foot tall arched granite wall. Beyond is the center plaza of the memorial, about six feet below. Set in the center is a large circular pool area with fountain in the middle surrounded by a ring of water jets. A block pattern of gray squares lines the plaza interior. To the north sits the Atlantic entrance and surrounding pillars with bronze interior wreaths. To the west a wall of gold stars lines the outer edge of the plaza and waterfalls flow at either side.<br />Walkways arc down along the pillars to the plaza level below from the east and west sides of the Pacific entrance. Granite benches line the plaza's outer wall and two steps provide seating along the fountain pool's edge.<br />The interior side of the Pacific entrance features a fountain and pool at its edge within the memorial plaza.

Grief holds her covered face against the shoulder of History and weeps in mourning. History holds a stylus and a tablet that was inscribed \"They died that their country might live.\" Below Grief and History, another life-size classical female figure represents Victory, holding high a laurel wreath and carrying an oak branch, signifying strength. Below her are the infant Mars, the god of war, and the infant Neptune, god of the sea. The shaft of the monument is decorated with wreaths, ribbons and scallop shells.</p> <p>Facing the U.S. Capitol is Peace, a classical figure draped from the waist down and holding an olive sprig. Below her are symbols of peace and industry. A dove, now missing and not documented in any known photographs, once nested upon a sheaf of wheat in a grouping of a cornucopia, turned earth, and a sickle resting across a sword. Opposite, the symbols of science, literature and art (including an angle, a gear, a book, and a pair of dividers) signify the progress of civilization that peace makes possible.</p> <p>At the corners of the monument, four marble globes are visually supported by massive brackets. The fountain below, with a jet on each side, empties into a quatrefoil-shaped basin. Inscribed \"In memory of the officers, seamen and marines of the United States Navy who fell in defense of the Union and liberty of their country, 1861-1865,\" this sculptural group has also been called the Naval Monument.</p> <p>The sculptor of the monument was Franklin Simmons (1839-1913), who was born in Maine, where he became known for his portrait busts. He worked in Rome after 1867, when he received the commission for a statue of <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/roger-williams\">Roger Williams</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/about-national-statuary-hall-collection\">National Statuary Hall collection</a>. In all, he created four statues and three busts for the United States Capitol. The Peace Monument is an example of his idealized <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/architecture-styles/neoclassical-architecture-capitol-hill\">neoclassical</a> sculpture.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>Peace Monument, first intended for Annapolis, was conceived by Admiral David D. Porter, who had commanded fleets of gunboats and troop transports during the war. Porter first sketched a simple design depicting Grief and History; beginning in 1865, he raised funds from private contributors, and the monument was commissioned from Simmons in 1871. The sculptor carved the Carrara marble in Rome and worked directly with Admiral Porter on many changes in the designs, including the addition of other figures. The architectural part of the monument was made by the Bonanni Brothers of Carrara, Italy, under Simmons's direction. The marble pieces were shipped to Washington in 1876; in 1877 the monument was erected on the base of Maine blue granite (designed by Architect of the Capitol <a href=\"https://www.aoc.gov/architect-of-the-capitol/edward-clark\">Edward Clark</a>); and the final figure, Peace, was set into place in January 1878.\"</p>",

Disability rights advocates, including the National Organization on Disability, successfully lobbied President Bill Clinton and Congress to add this explicit portrayal in 2001. The new statue depicted FDR as his family and close associates saw him. Why do you think the original designers left out a statue like this one? </p> <h3>A Carefully Crafted Image</h3> <p>The original 1997 memorial barely hinted at Franklin Roosevelt's paralyzed legs- much as FDR had during his Presidency. Roosevelt's battle with polio was not a secret. The president worried that if people knew he was unable to walk, his opponents could portray him as too weak for office. Years before live video, the press agreed not to report on FDR using a wheelchair or aides carrying the president. <br /> <br /> \"Franklin's illness... gave him strength and courage he had not had before. He had to think out the fundamentals of living and learn the greatest of all lessons- infinite patience and never ending persistence.\" - Eleanor Roosevelt (Below the quote is the quote in braille symbols, but at a size too large to be read by those who can read braille.)<br /> <br /> These hand sketches (right) appear on the back of the FDR statue in the Prologue. FDR believed a standard 1920s wheelchair was too bulky, so he designed his own. He oversaw the construction of his wheelchair, created by adding wheels to a kitchen chair. <br /> <br /> <strong>Inscriptions:</strong></p> <p>Arriving at the west end of the Franklin Delano Memorial from West Basin Drive, one enters the paved entrance plaza. Zelcova trees shade the plaza. Straight ahead is a wall of large stone blocks stacked four rows high. Three lines of inscription on the wall reads:</p> <p><em>Franklin Delano Roosevelt<br /> President Of The United States<br /> 1933 – 1945</em><br /> <br /> There is an inscription, <em>Prolouge</em>, on the pavement in front of FDR. </p>",

Under Roosevelt's urging, representatives from 26 countries signed a \"Declaration by United Nations\" in 1942. After FDR died, Eleanor Roosevelt served as a delegate to the UN. She chaired the commission that adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. <br /> <br /> FDR (seated, second from the left) signed the \"Declaration by United Nations\" in Washington on January 1, 1942. The countries agreed to \"defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom, and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands.\"  <h3>Room Four Fountain</h3> The United States created a diplomatic framework to prevent another world war. The fear of nuclear war between former allies and nuclear powers the United States and the Soviet Union maintained a Cold War peace. The unorderly blocks in this fountain represent this uneasy stability. The two adversaries remained at odds throughout the second half of the 20th century. <h3>Memorial Quotes in Room Four</h3> <em>\"The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active faith.\"</em> Undelivered Address, Prepared for April 13, 1945<br /> <br /> <em>\"Freedom of speech... Freedom of worship... Freedom from want... Freedom from fear.\"</em> Annual Address to Congress, January 6, 1941<br />   <p><strong>Etched on the middle three stairs:</strong></p> <em>“January 30, 1882, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Born At Hyde Park, New York. 1905 Marries Anna Eleanor Roosevelt. 1921, Stricken With Poliomyelitis – He Never Again Walked Unaided. 1928-1932, Governor Of New York.\"<br /> <br /> \"1932, Pledges “a New Deal” For The American People. 1932, Elected Thirty-second President Of The United States. 1933, Delivers First Fireside Chat. 1936, Re-elected To Second Term As President. 1940, Re-elected To Third Term As President.”<br /> <br /> “1941, Delivers Four Freedoms Speech. 1941, Japan Attacks Pearl Harbor – War Declared. 1941, Germany And Japan Declare War On The United States. 1944, Re-elected To Fourth Term As President.

    "audioDescription": "Visitors often get so focused on looking at the fountain that they end up missing an interesting feature of Room 4. There is an elongated set of 5 stairs that connects the upper level to the lower level. It gives the look of an amphitheater, where one might sit to watch the big show of the impressive fountain. Etched on the middle three stairs is a biography of important events in FDR’s life. There are seven stone blocks on the upper level, above the aforementioned steps, acting as a safety feature to help alert visitors of the change of levels of the curved steps.",

    "audioDescription": "(403 words)<br />The Samuel Gompers Memorial is a bronze statue located in a triangular park along the sidewalk at the intersection of 10th street, L street, and Massachusetts avenue, NW.<br />At the west end intersection of 11th street and Massachusetts avenue, sits a one by three-foot granite block set in the ground and inscribed to read: SAMUEL GOMPERS MEMORIAL PARK. Two trees sit at this end of the park and provide shade to the space. Further south along Massachusetts avenue, the grassy park area continues about fifty feet to the memorial on the north side of the street on your left.<br />An eighteen-foot wide walkway with four steps leads twenty feet to the front of the memorial. It features a twenty-foot wide, twelve-foot deep, and three-foot high bronze base, set on a one-foot tall granite platform.<br />The statue of Gompers sits atop a ledge that is flanked by five-foot wide walls with inscriptions. He wears a three-piece suit and tie and rests his right arm on the chair. His left hand is balled into a fist and sits on his left thigh. Below him on the pedestal is inscribed:<br />\"SAMUEL GOMPERS\"<br />On the wall behind Gompers are two bare-chested men in tattered shorts, shaking hands. On the left wall, slightly behind the man on the left, are two female figures. One is standing and wearing a robe and crown. She holds a bundle of wooden rods. At her feet is another woman, nursing a baby and holding the standing woman's left hand with her left hand.<br />A female angel with wings stands on the wall slightly set back on the right. She gazes upward while holding a sword against her body in her left hand and a sabre and wheat under her right arm. Two small round shields hang from her left side. At her feet is a shirtless man in a robe, sitting on his knees and reading a book. Just behind his left arm, which supports him on the ground, is a toy train.<br />The backside of the center pedestal has an engraving of two hands shaking over a background of North and South America. Encircled around the image are two borders with inscriptions. The design is shrouded with a banner over the top and sides.<br />A twenty-six-foot long, fifteen-foot-wide walkway in the back with three-foot high iron fencing on either side leads to the north sidewalk on L street.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

There sits a larger than life statue of FDR wearing a cloak, portrayed in one of his favorite chairs at Hyde Park, New York. Hidden from view are the wheels on the chair located on the back. The wheels are there, if one looks. Just as FDR hid his disability due to polio, Halprin wanted to make sure the disability was hidden from visitors to the memorial. Accessibility advocates had lobbied during the design process for the statue of FDR statue to be shown in a wheelchair. Halprin, however, was a big fan of FDR and thus wanted to hold true to what FDR did during his presidency, hiding his disability. Accessibility groups continued to lobby even after the memorial was dedicated and won approval for a second statue of FDR, which is located in the Prologue Room. Next to the statue of FDR in Room Three is a statue of his dog, Fala, a Scottish terrier. Both bronze statues were sculpted by Neil Estern.</p> <h3>Wartime President</h3> <p>FDR said the US must be a \"great aresal for democracy.\" His administration sent military supplies to allies like Great Britain. After entering World War II, FDR and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill formed a close alliance.

Join by the Soviet Union during the war, the Allies defeated the Axis powers.<br /> <br /> FDR joined British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (left) and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin (right) at the second \"Big Three\" conference in Yalta.

His slightly opened right hand is pointed downwards and hangs by his side. He is depicted as a young-to-middle age adult with short wavy hair and a moustache.<br />The relief depicts a bearded Greek god clothed only in a towel. His wrists are chained over his head. His ankles are also chained to a shattering wall and his body is twisted around and legs are crossed. The statue and wall are on a four-stepped platform surrounded by a stone plaza, twenty by thirty feet wide at its base.<br />The platform sits in a forty-foot square cement plaza. Leading up to the plaza are four twenty-foot wide, twelve-foot-long cement platforms that gradually rise by one step each from the south end of the park to the memorial. Two steps lead to the sidewalk from the memorial platform's west side, and a ramp leads to the sidewalk on the east side.<br />A shaded forty-foot wide, twenty-foot long cement plaza area sits at the south end of the park. Two granite benches line the back, and a thirty-foot tall tree is set on the left side. Four feet further to the left is a small circular fountain, about three feet across.<br />Three-foot tall bushes guard the very south end of the park, and a grass lawn lines both sides of the park along 22nd and 23rd streets.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "While his father did some work in the district, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. had an enormous influence over the design of Washington D.C. Starting as a member of the Senate Park (McMillan) Commission in 1901, Jr. founded and served on the Commission of Fine Arts from 1910 to 1918, and was a member of the National Capital Park and Planning Commission from 1926 to 1932.<br /> <br /> The National Capital Park and Planning Commission was tasked with restoring the National Mall to its original design as Pierre Charles L’Enfant had envisioned it. Olmsted Jr.’s redesign of the National Mall, beginning in the mid-1930s, helped to transform a densely planted Victorian park into formally arranged lawn panels lined with trees. This design would emphasize the importance of the view between the U.S. Capitol Building and the Washington Monument.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. made radical planting changes during his work on the National Mall, removing nearly every tree and replacing them with rows of American elms, following what was described in the 1901 McMillan Plan. Olmsted’s work of many decades, not just on the National Mall but Washington D.C., helped create a city threaded by parks, creating a unified special composition.",

    "audioDescription": "(411 words)<br />The Tidal Basin Inlet Bridge is located at the south end of the Tidal Basin, at the intersection of Ohio Avenue SW and East Basin Drive. The bridge connects East and West Potomac Park.<br />The concrete bridge is 184 feet long with a 25-foot wide roadway flanked by sidewalks on both sides, each 7 feet 3 inches in width.<br />The bridge stands about thirty feet above the water line. At its center is a green lock, made consisting of two swinging gates. The lock span is 46 feet by 26 feet. Above the gates is a matching green archway. At sidewalk level on both sides of the bridge is a white metal railing above the lock section.<br />The remaining ends of the bridge railing are concrete, featuring four sets of four decorative round open spaces side-by-side about one foot wide, each on both sides of the bridge. An inscription on the west side of the bridge reads: 1909. An alternate column on the east side of the bridge has an inscription reading: 1908.<br />On the north side of the bridge, two support pillars along either side of the lock section, feature cement gargoyle faces with open mouths and arches above them. Carvings representing falling water are below each face. Two arched spans of the bridge are on either side of these pillars, and along with the lock in the center, comprise the entire bridge.<br />The inlet gate, located on the south side of the basin, allows water to enter during high tide, and can be seen flowing in under the bridge. People are frequently in paddleboats floating around the basin, and in the Spring cherry blossoms are in full pink bloom around the entire basin area.<br />Facing north from the bridge the entire Tidal Basin spans about 107 acres. Clockwise from left to right, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, Thomas Jefferson Memorial, and George Mason Memorial are all adjacent to the Tidal Basin. The Washington Monument is directly north, and Post Office Tower can be seen slightly to the right.<br />Standing on top of the bridge and facing north are two green bronze fountains in archways set back about one foot into a column on either end. Both fountains feature one-foot long gargoyles a man with a smiling face and body of a dolphin. The dolphin body is facing downward with fins outstretched on either side. A shallow two-foot wide bronze basin sits below each gargoyle.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

FDR campaigned on keeping the US out of the war while secretly providing weapons and ships to democratic Great Britain without Congress knowing. These resources helped Great Britain fight authoritarian German and Japanese forces. With conflict raging off both coasts, voters reelected President Roosevelt to an unprecedented third term. Within a year, a Japanese attack on a Hawaiian naval base compelled the US to enter the war. <br /> <br /> FDR realized the US military was too small and outdated to fight a modern war. He authorized the first peacetime draft and the construction of new ships, aircraft, and other material. After the Japanese bombed the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war in December 1941. <h3>Memorial Quotes in Room Three</h3> \"We must be the great arsenal of democracy.\" Radio Address, December 29, 1940.<br /> <br /> \"I have seen war. I have seen war on land and sea. I have seen blood running from the wounded... I have seen the dead in the mud. I have seen cities destroyed... I have seen children starving. I have seen the agony of mothers and wives. I hate war.\" Address at Chautauqua, New York, August 14, 1936.  <h3>Tumbled Blocks</h3> By 1940 military conflict raged from China and Australia to Africa and Europe. Projecting his desire to stay out of the war, FDR declared, \"I have seen war.... I hate war.\" These tumbled blocks represent the breakdown of international order. FDR's words did not prevent the US joining the fighting. <br />  ",

The National Archives is directly across Pennsylvania Avenue to the south.<br />A one hundred-foot diameter circular plaza is surrounded by six flagpoles, lined with triangular-shaped fountains at its southern corners, and features a black and white granite map of the world in its center. The plaza slopes slightly from its southern end to the north. Set in the north center of the plaza is a seven-foot tall bronze statue of a sailor in a cap and his hands tucked in the pockets of his jacket. His collar is raised, and his packed duffel bag stands to his left.<br />Two eight-story curved buildings each fronted with thirteen columns sit at the top two sides of the plaza, their curved facades following that of the round plaza. The east-side building houses the Navy Visitor Center in its ground floor.<br />Stairs lead down into the plaza from its north end and granite benches curve around the northeast and northwest sides of the plaza. <br />The southern half of the plaza features twenty-six thirty-two-inch by thirty-six-inch bronze bas-reliefs panels set along the outer side of curved walls lining the southeast and southwest sides of the plaza. Each depicts an important person or event in naval history.<br />Granite benches line the south side of the plaza with inscriptions.<br />Inside the memorial at the bottom of the south entry steps, a bronze compass is set in the granite walkway approaching the memorial. In its center is an eagle standing on an anchor that sits behind it.<br />Inscribed on the outer walls of the memorial at its southern entrance is written:<br />\"UNITED STATES NAVY MEMORIAL\"<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

In addition to being a functioning meeting hall, it also houses important American art, and stands as an architectural symbol in its own right.</span></p> <p><span>Construction of the Capitol building began in 1793. Using ancient architectural models, the young American republic sought to connect its radical experiment in democracy with familiar, stoic building forms that projected strength and stability. The building would continue to evolve, change, and be added to in order to meet the needs of a growing Congress and an evolving American public over the course of the next two hundred years under the care of dozens of architects.</span></p> <p>Congress convened in the Capitol for the first time in 1800, despite the building not being completed. The first iteration was completed in 1811 but did not last long. On August 22, 1814, about 4,500 British troops arrived in southern Maryland, 16 miles from Washington, D.C., to avenge an attack on the Canadian capital the year prior. The troops arrived in the city on August 24<sup>th</sup>, and began following their orders to destroy public buildings. The Capitol was <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc29/pdf/GPO-CDOC-106sdoc29-6-3.pdf\">burned</a> at approximately 9:00 in the evening, but a light rain minimized the permanent damage. Still, the newly finished seat of American government <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3b51944/\">required renovation</a>, beginning in 1815 and continuing through 1819.</p> <p>The Capitol would continue to <a href=\"http://www.visitthecapitol.gov/about-the-capitol/evolution-the-capitol\">grow</a>. As the population of the nation expanded, so did its House of Representatives, requiring <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/wash/dc76.htm\">more space</a>. Today, the building is still maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.aoc.gov/\">Architect of the Capitol</a>. Centrally located in downtown Washington, D.C., it stands as a beacon and symbol of the endurance and flexibility of democracy.</p>",

Her arms are bare and she holds above her head with both hands and slightly off to the right a two-foot-tall staff of flames.<br />The statue sits atop a circular black granite base about three feet tall and three feet wide. A six-inch border rings the bottom of the base at a slight angle. Raised engraved lettering around the border reads:<br />\"Victims of Communism Memorial\"<br />The memorial is set in a small plaza area with a triangular shape, about thirty feet along its sides, with a curved back about fifty feet around. Along the back side is a black granite ledge for sitting, about three feet tall. The plaza area follows a brick pattern of gray rectangular granite about two by three feet each in size.<br />Behind the statue and bench area the park extends out to a grassy lawn area at a triangle until reaching a rounded point at the end of the block.

    "bodyText": "<p>Dedicated in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was a revolutionary minimalist design for a war memorial. From afar, the memorial appears as a gash on the landscape, an unhealed wound. The names of over 58,000 servicemembers who gave their lives between 1957 and 1975 are listed on the wall in chronological order starting and ending at the center of the wall.<br /> <br /> Guidebooks at the entrances to the memorial can help visitors find a specific name, corresponding to the panel number at the base of each panel and the row as counted from the top of the panel.<br /> <br /> According to a 2019 audit by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, 58,390 names are on the wall, but due to corrections, duplicates, or individuals who lived or are of unknown status, the wall represents 58,276 individuals.<br /> <br /> Names indicated with a cross are listed as missing in action, while a diamond superimposed on a cross represents a servicemember who was listed as missing in action when the memorial was built in 1982, but has since been determined to be killed in action.<br /> <br /> The nearby statues at the Vietnam Women's Memorial, the statue known as \"The Three Servicemen,\" and the flagpole representing the branches of the military are related features.<br /> <br /> Designer: Maya Ying Lin</p> <h4>Inscriptions</h4> <p>Apex panel, top<br /> 1959<br /> IN HONOR OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES WHO SERVED IN THE VIETNAM WAR.

    "audioDescription": "The Vietnam Veterans Memorial sits on two acres of land northwest of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC. The memorial is bordered by Constitution Avenue, NW to the north, Henry Bacon Drive NW to the west and the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool to the south. From the intersection of Lincoln Memorial Circle and Henry Bacon Drive, travel north about two hundred feet along a pedestrian walkway that runs parallel to Henry Bacon Drive, on its east side. On the left of the walkway are two three-foot tall glass-encased spiral-bound directories in bronze cases, providing on the location of Vietnam veteran's names on the Memorial Wall. One hundred twenty feet to the northeast a cobblestone entrance leads one hundred feet into the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. Two black granite walls built into a grass lawn embankment come together to form a \"V\", the ends of which point toward the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial respectively. Each wall is two hundred forty-six feet long and ten feet tall at their apex in the middle. Over fifty-eight thousand names are inscribed along the polished black wall. Names are inscribed with a + or diamond to denote whether missing in action or confirmed dead. The year \"1959\" is inscribed in large numbers on the top of the panel abutting the right side of the apex. To the right of this date is the inscription: IN HONOR OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES WHO SERVED IN THE VIETNAM WAR. THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES AND OF THOSE WHO REMAIN MISSING ARE INSCRIBED IN THE ORDER THEY WERE TAKEN FROM US. The year \"1975\" is inscribed in large numbers on the bottom of the panel abutting the left side of the apex. To the left of this date is the inscription: OUR NATION HONORS THE COURAGE, SACRIFICE AND DEVOTION TO DUTY AND COUNTRY OF ITS VIETNAM VETERANS. THIS MEMORIAL WAS BUILT WITH PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOVEMBER 11, 1982. South of the Memorial Wall is a plaza featuring three bronze statues of men in military gear, set among a small patch of shrubs. A sixty-foot tall flagpole flying the American flag stands about thirty feet west of the Three Servicemen statue. About three hundred fifty feet west, along a pedestrian walkway south of the Three Servicemen Statue, in a tree-lined plaza is the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Women's Memorial. Eight yellowwood trees surround the plaza and benches are set along the south, east, and west sides. A sixty-foot tall flagpole flying the American flag stands about thirty feet west of the Three Servicemen statue. A gold inscription around its base reads: This flag represents the service rendered to our country by the veterans of the Vietnam War. The flag affirms the principles of freedom for which they fought and their pride in having served under difficult circumstances.<br />Circular medallions are engraved around a star pattern at the flagpole base representing the Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, Department of the Air Force, and United States Coast Guard.<br />Set at the southwest end of the memorial, just northeast of Lincoln Memorial Circle is a tan, circular one-story octagonal building with a green roof and brown border around its roofline will be on your left. The structure has three double-sided sliding windows on its west-facing sides and a National Park Service attendee is available at the front window to assist visitors with information about the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.",

As Hart described the sculpture, \"The contrast between the innocence of their youth and the weapons of war underscores the poignancy of their sacrifice. There is about them the physical contact and sense of unity that bespeaks the bonds of love and sacrifice that is the nature of men at war...Their strength and their vulnerability are both evident.\"<br /> <br /> The base of the 60-foot flagpole contains emblems of the five services of the military.

One woman crouches along a wall of sandbags with the man draped across her lap, supporting his upper body with her right arm. Her left arm is bent, with her hand holding a piece of cloth to the man’s chest. The man’s eyes are covered with another piece of cloth. He appears limp and lifeless, with right arm hanging down along the sandbags, left arm across his lower body, and head back with mouth open. His right leg is straight with foot slightly turned, left leg bent at a slight angle. The woman gazes down at the man with an expression of concern. To her left and slightly behind, another woman wearing military fatigues and cap looks upward towards the sky with mouth open in an expression of anticipation. Her back is towards the fallen man. Her right arm is bent and resting along the left arm of the woman next to her, with right hand loosely gripping the other woman’s elbow. Between these two, a third woman kneels next to the sandbags and reaches down to pick up the fallen man’s helmet, her brow furrowed in concern. The oval stone base of the statue is 8 inches (20 centimeters) high. There is no fence around the statue and visitors are welcome to walk up and touch it. Eight yellowwood trees are planted around the outer perimeter of the circle representing the eight women who died during their service in the Vietnam War.",

The wayside text reads:<br />The Price of Freedom.<br />Freedom Wall holds 4,048 gold stars. Each gold star represents one hundred American service personnel who died or remain missing in the war. The 405,399 American dead and missing from World War II are second only to the loss of more than 620,000 Americans during our Civil War.<br />On either side of the wall of stars are thirty-five-foot long waterfalls that cascade down in five sections, each about five feet wide, from pools at ground level above.

In 1816 John Tayloe built a row of six two-story-and-attic houses as an investment. By 1818 the corner was being used as a hotel. In 1847 Benjamin Ogle Tayloe leased the establishment to Henry A. Willard and his brother, Edwin. Edwin withdrew from the management, to be replaced by his brother Joseph C.Willard in 1849. In 1853 the brothers purchased the entire row of houses from Tayloe's heirs, uniting the buildings architecturally in a major remodeling. In 1858 the Willards expanded again, purchasing the property of Col. James Kearney on the southwest corner of 14th and F Streets. They demolished the Kearney Mansion and built a six-story addition to the hotel. Next an adjoining Presbyterian Church on F Street was acquired and converted to an auditorium known as Willard Hall. In succeeding years, as business increased, the roofs of the conglomerate hotel were raised to allow for vertical expansion. Finally, at the turn of the century, the Willard underwent a massive transformation.<br /> <br /> The new Willard, designed by New York architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh and erected by the George A. Fuller Company, was hailed at its opening as Washington's first skyscraper. Completed in 1904, the new building saw an addition of 100 rooms in 1925, broadening the F Street facade by about 49 feet. The property remained in the Willard family until 1946, closed in 1968, and underwent extensive renovation, again opening its doors in 1986.<br /> <br /> Presidents <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/zachary-taylor.htm\">Taylor</a>, Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/abraham-lincoln.htm\">Lincoln</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/ulysses-s-grant.htm\">Grant</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wiho/index.htm\">Taft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/woodrow-wilson-prophet-of-peace-teaching-with-historic-places.htm\">Wilson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/moru/learn/historyculture/calvin-coolidge.htm\">Coolidge</a>, and Harding stayed at the Willard. Other notable guests have included Charles Dickens, Buffalo Bill, David Lloyd George, P.T. Barnum, Lord and Lady Napper and countless others. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/walt-whitman.htm\">Walt Whitman</a> included the Willard in his verses and Mark Twain wrote two books there in the early 1900s. It was Vice President Thomas R. Marshall, irritated at the Willard's high prices, who coined the phrase \"What this country needs is a good 5-cent cigar.\"<br /> <br /> The Willard Hotel is located at 1401-09 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 15, 1974 and is part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/paav/index.htm\">Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site</a>.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The American flag was raised over the World War I Memorial for the first time on Friday, April 16, 2021 at the formal unveiling of the memorial that honors the 4.7 million Americans who served their nation in World War I, including 116,516 who made the supreme sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Built by the United States World War I Centennial Commission and designed by architect Joseph Weishaar, the new memorial incorporates the existing memorial to Gen. John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces during the war. The memorial also includes the Peace Fountain, a cascade of water behind an excerpt from the poem “The Young Dead Soldiers Do Not Speak” by Archibald MacLeish; engraved quotes and references to theaters, campaigns and battles in which American forces participated; and exhibits about the role of the United States in World War I.<br /> <br /> The memorial’s central feature, a sculpture titled <em>A Soldier’s Journey</em>, is scheduled for installation in September 2024. The 58-foot-long bas-relief sculpture by Sabin Howard will feature 38 figures depicting the journey of a recurring American soldier and representing the larger American experience of World War I. <br /> <br /> The memorial is located at the former Pershing Park, 1.76-acres along Pennsylvania Avenue NW between 14th Street NW and 15th Street NW, across from the White House Visitor Center. The World War I Memorial builds on the original design of Pershing Park, dedicated at the site in 1981 as the American Expeditionary Forces Memorial. </p> <h4><strong>Sculpture - <em>A Soldier's Journey</em></strong></h4> <p>Memorial architect Joe Weishaar calls Sabin Howard’s <em>A Soldier’s Journey</em> sculpture “The Everyman.” Thirty-eight separate figures, spread over approximately 58 feet of wall towards the western end of the Memorial Core, portray the experience of one American soldier. Starting from the left, the soldier takes leave from his wife and daughter, charges into combat, sees men around him killed, wounded, and gassed, and recovers from the shock to come home to his family. The figures are mounted on the wall.<br /> <br /> In the <em>departure</em>, the soldier’s daughter hand him his helmet, while his wife touches him with a restraining arm, as if to hold him back as he answers the call to battle – representing the debate over American involvement in the war. In the <em>initiation</em>, the soldier joins the parade to war, as the United States joins the epic battle in Europe.<br /> <br /> The parade, and the work as a whole, includes African Americans and other ethnic groups who answered their country’s call.<br /> <br /> In the middle scene, the <em>ordeal</em>, the parade devolves into the tension before the charge and then the tumult of desperate and violent combat. At the center our hero calls his comrades into battle, illustrating the famous American battle cry from Belleau Wood: “Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever?”<br /> <br /> The <em>aftermath</em> depicts the physical and mental wounds of the fighters. Here are represented American women who served at home and on the fighting front. And here the turbulent, left-to-right narrative pauses, as the hero stops and looks directly at the viewer. The soldier’s look of shock and loss – the thousand-year stare – along with the empty helmets piled at his feet, invite the viewer to stop and contemplate with him the costs of war.<br /> <br /> In the <em>return</em>, the soldier rejoins the homecoming parade. One figure look back with pride, while a flag bearer leads the country forward into “the American century.” Our soldier returns home and hands his helmet back to his daughter. She looks into the helmet and sees World War II, the war that will bring America back to Europe little more than 20 years later.<br /> <br /> Due to the size and complexity of the casting process, the sculpture will not be installed September 2024. Until then, artwork showing what the final product will look like will be in its place. The wall is surrounded by water and is viewed from a platform several feet in front of it.</p> <h4>The Belvedere</h4> <p>A belvedere is an architectural feature providing a particularly scenic view. At the World War I Memorial, the Belvedere is the conceptual center of the memorial, as it provides a commanding view of the elements and features of the memorial – the American Expeditionary Forces memorial and General John J. Pershing statue is located to the viewer’s left, the <em>A Soldier’s Journey </em>sculpture is to the front, and flagstaff are and quotes from President Woodrow Wilson and others are to the right.<br /> <br /> At the center of the Belvedere is a large rendering of the front of the World War I Victory Medal centered upon the memorial floor. The medal depicts a winged Victory holding a shield and sword on the front, heralding the dawn of a new era of peace.<br /> <br /> Exhibit panels along the Belvedere wall describe the American accomplishments of the war, roles played by Americans of all forces and the legacy of the war.</p> <p><br /> Encircling the exterior of the Belvedere are listed the names of the campaigns in which U.S. forces participated during the war.</p> <ul> <li>Cambrai</li> <li>Somme Defensive</li> <li>Lys</li> <li>Aisne</li> <li>Montdidier-Noyon</li> <li>Champagne-Marne</li> <li>Aisne-Marne</li> <li>Somme Offensive</li> <li>Oise-Aisne</li> <li>Ypres-Lys</li> <li>Saint Mihiel</li> <li>Meuse-Argonne</li> <li>Vittorio Veneto</li> <li>North Russia</li> <li>Siberia</li> <li>Atlantic Convoys</li> <li>Western Atlantic</li> <li>North Sea</li> <li>Mediterranean</li> </ul>",

    "audioDescription": "(485 words)<br />The World War II Memorial is located on 17th Street, between Constitution Avenue NW to the north and Independence Avenue, SW to the south, and is flanked by the Washington Monument to the east and the Lincoln Memorial to the west.<br />From the intersection of 17th Street, NW and Independence Avenue, travel north on 17th street about five hundred thirty feet. The granite pillars, water fountains and columns of the memorial will be to the west, on your left.<br />The seven and one-half acre World War II Memorial site consists of fifty-six granite pillars, each seventeen feet tall, arranged in a semicircle around a plaza with two, forty-three-foot arches on north and south sides. Each pillar is adorned with a bronze wreath and inscribed with the name of one of forty-eight US states, as well as the District of Columbia and seven territories. The northern arch is inscribed along the top to read: Atlantic, the southern one: Pacific. Each arch features a bronze sculpture of bald eagles holding a wreath.<br />The plaza is three hundred thirty-seven feet long, two hundred-forty feet wide, and is sunk six feet below grade. In its center is a pool that is two hundred fifty feet long and one hundred fifty feet wide. A fountain set in the middle shoots a plume of water into the air and is surrounded by a ring of water jets.<br />On approaching the memorial main entrance from the east, a visitor walks between flagpoles set with the American flag at either side, and along walls to the north and south side picturing scenes of the war experience in bas relief. The left wall, toward the Pacific arch, features scenes beginning with soon-to-be servicemen getting physical exams, taking the oath, and being issued military gear. The right wall depicts a variety of battle and preparation scenes for air, land and sea assaults. The final scene is a handshake between military men as they cross over a broken walkway. Set between the two bas relief walls are three grass lawn areas, each about seventy-feet wide and ten feet long.<br />Along the west end of the plaza is a semi-circle granite wall featuring four thousand forty-eight sculpted gold stars, each about two inches tall atop a blue background. The wall stands nine feet tall and spans eighty-four feet across. A basin sits in front of the wall and an angled block of marble lines the front edge. An engraving on the marble block reads:<br />HERE WE MARK THE PRICE OF FREEDOM<br />On either side of the wall of stars are thirty-five-foot long waterfalls that cascade down in five sections, each about five feet wide, from pools at ground level above. The waterfalls stand about five feet tall and when facing them the Lincoln Memorial sits at eye level, one half mile to the west.<br />A one-story visitor center and kiosk sits to the south of the memorial.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

The wall extends out from two points and has an <i>‘auwai</i> (channel) that is used mainly for water flushing or inflow, depending on the rising and dropping of the tides. This <i>auwai is</i> also used during harvesting and stocking. The seawall is 30-40ft. wide and 6 ½ ft high. stretching for 250 yards and is the largest retaining fishpond wall in the state. The native Hawaiians built this wall by dry-stacking the water worn stones and built 2 channels called <i>‘auwai kai</i> and placed a <i>mākāhā</i> (or sluice gate) in the channel.",

When the Wright Brothers were here, Big Kill Devil Hill – the hill in front of you- was a massive sand dune. Thousands of times, the brothers trekked up this and three nearby dunes to conduct glider experiments.Climbing the hill was strenuous. Deep, soft sand caused every step up the slope to slip part-way back down. The Wrights were also burdened with carrying their heavy gliders up the hill for each flight. Their tireless efforts paid off as they mastered their flying skills and refined their flight controls.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: Black and white photograph showing a glider with a pilot flying from the dune. The flyer is angled, as if turning. A big sand dune can be seen in the distance.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The Wrights mastered flight controls with their 1902 glider.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #2: A black and white photograph showing a man pushing a plow behind a donkey. They are working on a sand dune. In the foreground is bunches of grass ready to be planted.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Starting in 1929, workers planted grass to stabilize Big Kill Devil Hill so the Wright Brothers Monument could be built on top.",

The panel features text in the top third of the panel. The bottom third of the panel features a large artistic rendering of the first flight, including the two camp buildings. Next to the painting, is a black and white photograph of the actual first flight.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: The First Flight Sculpture is about 50 yards behind this wayside. The sculpture is on a sandy surface and surrounded by green grass. About 40 feet to the left of the sculpture is a small tree with a bench beneath it.<br /> <br /> TEXT: 12 Seconds That Changed the World. After more than four years of hard work and experimentation, it only took the Wright Brothers 12 seconds to change the world. On December 17, 1903, at 10:35 a.m., Orville wright made the world’s first controlled, powered, heavier-than-air flight.The photograph that documented the Wrights’ success was taken by John T. Daniels, a Kill Devil Hills Life Saving Station surfman, who had never used a camera before. It was not until the Wright Brothers returned to Dayton, Ohio, that they developed the photograph and saw their first flight captured on film. The Daniels’ photo, however, only gives one perspective of that historic event – from the back of the airplane.Stephen Smith’s “First Flight” sculpture, unveiled during the 2003 Centennial, and Frank Wootton’s painting help us see the first flight from different angles. Just as the Wright Brothers’ success depended on viewing the problems of flight in novel and creative ways, perhaps these new perspectives will inspire us to change the world and explore new horizons.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: Black and white photograph of the first flight. The 1903 flyer is centered flying away from the viewer, just getting liftoff from the rail below it. A man, Orville Wright, is seen lying on his stomach in the center of the flyer. Another man dressed in a dark suit is standing to the side of the flyer’s wings on the right side of the photo.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: John T. Daniels, a Kill Devil Hills Life Saving Station surfman, took this photograph (above), documenting the first flight. Stand beside the sculpture of Surfman Daniels to see if you can capture this image.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #2: A gold framed painting of the first flight, as depicted from the front of the flyer. The sky is blue and patched with grey, fluffy clouds. The painting is set farther away than the photograph, showing the witnesses much smaller. The two camp buildings can be seen close by to the flyer and the witnesses on the left.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Frank Wootton’s painting (right) of the first flight offers another view of the historic event.",

Tate, Kitty Hawk Postmaster, in a letter to Wilbur Wright dated August 18, 1900.<br /> <br /> WAYSIDE LAYOUT: Landscape-oriented rectangular panel featuring a black band across the top. The black band has text that reads, “Wright Brothers National Memorial” and “National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior.” The panel features a large black and white image on the background, text in two columns across the top and 1 small black and white photograph to the right of the text.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: In the distance, to the left is the hill with the Wright Brothers Monument atop it. To the right is the First flight sculpture. Directly behind the wayside, about 20 feet is the parking area and road.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND IMAGE: A large black and white photograph of the 1903 flyer as it rests on the launching rail on the slope of the sandy dune. Behind the flyer to the right is a group of people. From left to right there are 2 men stand with a dog between them and a small boy stands next to them. Farther behind them is another man and a small boy, and finally a lone man stands farther to the right.<br /> <br /> TEXT: Wilbur and Orville Wright accepted Tate’s invitation and found that the Outer Banks of North Carolina not only provided hospitable people but also the conditions that they needed to fly – wind, sand, and solitude. While solitude was important to get the work done, the Wrights did not work alone. From 1900 to 1903, families from the local communities and the crews from the local life saving stations provided much-needed assistance to the Wrights. On the morning of December 17, 1903, the Wrights signaled for help and “John T. Daniels, W.S. Dough, A.D. Etheridge, W.C. Brinkley of Manteo, and Johnny Moore of Nags Head arrive,” wrote Orville. With their help the Flyer was moved to the launch rail. The men then cheered as the Flyer lifted off the ground.The “First Flight” sculpture captures the Wrights’ historic achievement and the hospitable people who supported them. Local families and descendants of the first flight witnesses continue to welcome visitors to the Memorial and the Outer Banks.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: A black and white photograph of a family posing for a picture on a porch.

For the first time, the location of the first flight received as much attention as the flight itself. Orville Wright, Amelia Earhart, and more than 3,000 people from the area participated in the event. Ironically, to attend they traveled by almost every means but air.Over the years local citizens, the First Flight Society, and people from all over the state of North Carolina have continued to provide the grass roots support necessary to host annual commemorative events. With their help, the reconstructed camp buildings were opened during the 50<sup>th</sup> – anniversary celebration. The First Flight Airstrip opened during the 60<sup>th</sup> – anniversary and the “First Flight” sculpture, a gift from the people of North Carolina, was dedicated during the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: A black and white photograph of 2 men and 1 woman, all well dressed in suits dresses, standing in front of a boulder with a plaque on it.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Orville Wright, U.S. Senator Hiram Bingham, and Amelia Earhart attend the unveiling of the first flight marker, December 17, 1928.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #2: Colored photograph of the monument atop a hill.

In 1902, they added 10 feet of space to the workshop to use as living quarters, as the past visits to Kitty Hawk had proven tent living as unsustainable.<br /> <br /> The workshop and living quarters were abandoned by the brothers after 1911, allowing nature to destroy the structures.</p> <h3>Living on the Outer Banks</h3> <p>When the Wright brothers arrived here in September 1900, the Outer Banks were very different from today. There were no bridges connecting the Outer Banks to the mainland and Kitty Hawk was a remote, self-sustaining fishing village with few residents and even fewer structures.<br /> <br /> The Kitty Hawk Life-Saving Station and the US Weather Bureau station were four miles apart, with nothing but desolate sand dunes between them. Despite this isolation, the few friends that the brothers did make here proved invaluable, as the members of the life-saving service often assisted the Wrights in their flying experiments.<br /> <br /> As Wibur wrote in November, 1900:</p> <blockquote> <p>In October my brother and myself spent a vacation of several weeks at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, experimenting with a soaring machine. We located on the bar which separates Albemarle Sound from the ocean. South of Kitty Hawk the bar is absolutely bare of vegetation and flat as a floor, from sound to ocean, for a distance of nearly five miles, except a sand hill one hundred and five ft. high which rises almost in its center. The main slope of the hill is to the northeast, which is facing the prevailing winds...To the north, northeast, east, and southeast there is nothing but flat plain and ocean for a thousand miles nearly. It is an ideal place for gliding experiments except for its inaccessibility. The person who goes there must take everything he will possibly need, for he cannot depend on getting any needed article from the outside world in less than three weeks.</p> </blockquote> <h3>Camp Life</h3> <blockquote> <p>Trying to camp down here reminds me of those poor arctic explorers. We are living nearly the whole time on reduced rations. Once in a while we get a mess of fish, and if our stuff comes about the same time from Elizabeth City - which stuff consists of canned tomatoes, peaches, condensed milk, flour, bacon & butter- we have a big blowout...But it only lasts a day...</p> <p>   - Orville Wright, October 18, 1900</p> </blockquote> <p>When the brothers first arrived at Kitty Hawk in 1900, they lived in rudimentary tents that often blew over in the nearly constant winds. In addition, they were plagued by mosquitos and a lack of supplies. Nonetheless, creature comforts were outweighed by their desire to perfect flight.<br /> <br /> In 1901, the brothers improved their camp conditions. They constructed a more permanent wood-frame workshop and storage facility. In 1902, with the help of local residents, they upgraded their camp buildings further by adding more space to the workshop for use as living quarters. When they returned to the Outer Banks yet again in 1903, they repaired the storage facility/workshop, which had been blown off its foundation by storms, and they also constructed a hangar to assemble their powered aircraft.</p> <h3>Reconstruction</h3> <p>The camp buildings were first reconstructed in 1953 in commmoration of the 50th anniversary of the first flight. Due to storm and termite damage, these structures were removed in 1963 and rebuilt between 1963 and 1965.<br /> <br /> In 1976, the hangar was replaced due to deteriorating conditions and the living quarters recieved much needed repairs the same year.<br /> <br /> In 1984, the hangar was rebuilt for a third time, to more exact specifications, after being damaged by a storm.<br /> <br /> In 1993, the parks preservation team rebuilt both the living quarters and the hangar building. Although they subsequently require occasional replacement materials and repairs, these are the current structures that stand today. </p>",

The black band has text that reads, “Wright Brothers National Memorial” and “National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior.” The panel has a large black and white photograph. In the center of the panel is a quote. The main body of text is located on the bottom left of the panel and there is a column of three photographs on the right.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: Slightly to the right is the monument in the far distance, atop a big grass covered hill. Directly in front of the wayside is a large, flat, open grass covered field. Looking to the right, there is a pathway leading to brown, wooden shed like buildings.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND IMAGE: A black and white photograph of a large, manned glider flying across the top left. Below the flyer is an aerial photograph overlooking the wide-open sandy, puddle filled landscape with two small wooden camp buildings in the distance.<br /> <br /> QUOTE: “We came down here for wind and sand, and we have got them.” Orville Wright to his sister, 1900<br /> <br /> TEXT: Wilbur and Orville Wright tested and proved their flight theories in Dayton, Ohio. To test actual flight, however, they needed a special location to experiment. Using US Weather Bureau statistics, they looked for a place that was windy, sandy, and out of the public eye. They found Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on the Outer Banks to be the right area to test their gliders.<br /> <br /> COLUMN OF IMAGES:<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #1: A black and white photograph that shows two men standing, in dark clothing, holding their hats to their head, another man sitting on the ground wears much lighter colored clothing and is to the right. In the background, is the shadowy figure of another person in the distance. The men are looking towards the sky as a large glider flies past them overhead. The area close to the men is hazy, indicating that the sand is being blown by a strong wind.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Wind helped with lift.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #2: A black and white photograph of a pilot lying prone on a glider as it sits on a sandy surface.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: Sand provided a soft landing.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION #3: Black and white photograph of the sandy dune. There is a lone group of trees in the distance and a few patches of grass in the foreground.<br /> <br /> CAPTION: The isolated location offered privacy from the public.",

Spanning the width of the panel, at the bottom, is a graphic depiction of the first four flights, their times and the distances they traveled.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: In front of you is a flat, grassy area. The entire first flight line, with markers, can be seen from this spot. Looking towards the left is the large first flight boulder. Straight ahead are the markers for the first 3 flights, spaced relatively close to one another. Looking towards the right, in the far distance, is the 4<sup>th</sup> and last flight marker.  <br /> <br /> TEXT: The Wright Brothers made four successful sustained powered flights the morning of December 17, 1903. The commemorative granite boulder and replica monorail mark the lift-off point of those four flights, the numbered markers the terminating point.Since soft sand prohibited launching with conventional wheels, the Wright Flyer was place on a 60-foot monorail with its landing skits resting on a wheeled truck. Once the engine started, the Flyer was released and slid down the rail until it gained enough speed to lift into the air.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION: A black and white photograph showing the 1903 Flyer in preparation for flight on the launching rail. In this image, the full flyer can be seen, and a man dressed in a suit and wearing a hat is standing at the front of the flyer.<br /> <br /> GRAPHIC IMAGE: This graphic shows each flight and its path with different types of lines with small rises and falls in elevation. The path for the first flight is small dots and shows the flight lasting 12 seconds and traveling 120 feet. The path for the second flight is a small dashed line showing the flight lasting 12 seconds and traveling 175 feet. The third flight path is a longer dashed line showing the flight lasting 15 seconds and traveling 200 feet. The fourth flight path is a heavier, longer dashed line showing the flight lasting 59 seconds and traveling 852 feet.",

On this cold and windy morning, the Wrights achieved the world’s first controlled flights. Here, they realized not only own dream – but also one of humanity’s oldest dreams – to fly!The boulder and numbered markers on the field in front of you mark the takeoff and landing spots of those four flights.<br /> <br /> GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION: The First Four Flights. Each flight and its path are shown with different types of lines. The path for the first flight is small dots and shows the flight lasting 12 seconds and traveling 120 feet. The path for the second flight is a small dashed line showing the flight lasting 12 seconds and traveling 175 feet. The third flight path is a longer dashed line showing the flight lasting 15 seconds and traveling 200 feet. The fourth flight path is a heavier, longer dashed line showing the flight lasting 59 seconds and traveling 852 feet.",

The black band has text that reads, “Wright Brothers National Memorial” and “National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior.” The panel features full panel image of an artistic rendering of the 1903 flyer as if the viewer is looking down the rail at the back of the flyer taking off. On the bottom left is a small block of text and on the bottom right is a large block of text.<br /> <br /> VIEW FROM WAYSIDE: Directly in front of the wayside is the reconstructed launching rail. Forty feet ahead is the first flight boulder and in the distance the first flight line.<br /> <br /> DESCRIPTION: The panel is filled with a large colored drawing of the 1903 flyer as if it were in motion about to lift off. The view looks down the length of the launching monorail at the rudder and rear of the flyer. The propellers are blurred, indicating movement. Orville can be seen lying down, piloting the flyer in the center, while Wilbur is running along the right wing, holding on as it takes off. There are callouts pointing to the dolly, located below the flyer, and the Launch rail, which is below the dolly.<br /> <br /> TEXT #1: The Launch Rail & Dolly. The soft sand was not a good “runway.” The brothers build a 60-foot wooden rail with metal stripping to provide a hard and smooth surface for takeoff. A dolly of wood and bicycle hubs was placed on the rail to hold the flyer above the sand as it accelerated forward to liftoff.<br /> <br /> TEXT #2: Getting off the Ground. After four years of scientific research and rigorous experimentation, and with their 1903 Flyer on the rail, the Wrights are set to fly. In unison, they each pull down on a propeller. The engine roars to life and the propellers whip through the air; only a restraining wire keeps the flyer in place. Orville climbs onto the machine and positions himself into the hip-cradle. He releases the restraining wire and the machine slowly moves forward. Wilbur runs alongside to steady the machine. After traveling 40 feet down the rail, the flyer lifts into the air, ushering in the Age of Flight.",

Orville Wright and Amelia Earhart were among the 3,000 people in attendance.</p> <h3>Determining the Location</h3> <p>Identifying the exact location of the takeoff was problematic because the topography of the site had shifted in the years following the Wrights' experiments. On November 4, 1928, Captain William Tate organized a meeting of three of the four surviving witnesses to determine the point of takeoff.<br /> <br /> Using Orville Wright's account of the flight, Will Dough, Adam Etheridge, and Johnny Moore identified the approximate location of takeoff. Tate described their methods at the marker's dedication ceremony:<br /> <br /> > Dough, Etheridge, Moore and I assembled here and I explained to them the importance of arriving at a definite conclusion with respect to the spot where the Wright brothers' airplane, in making its first successful flight, first began to move along the ground. We located the four corners of the building in which the machine was housed...We took into consideration what Mr. Orville Wright said about it in his article How We Made Our First Flight. We had a compass with us and we were sure of our compass course. After considering all these things and talking it over these three men proceeded by themselves to come out here on this point and select the spot on which this magnificent boulder stands and said that this was the spot where the Wright airplane started its first successful flight...After agreeing upon this exact spot we signed a paper to that effect...</p> <h3>The 25th Anniversary</h3> <p>An important first step in the realization of the Wright Brothers National Memorial occurred on December 17, 1928, when 200 delegates from the International Civil Aeronautics Conference and more than 3,000 visitors dedicated a granite marker placed at the approximate location of the 1903 liftoff, and laid the cornerstone of the monument to be placed on Big Kill Devil Hill. Among those in attendance were Orville Wright and Amelia Earhart.</p> <h3>Launch Rail (Reproduction)</h3> <p>The launching rail is a reproduction of the rail the brothers used to launch their flyer on December 17, 1903.<br /> <br /> The original rail the brothers installed consisted of four 15-foot 2x4s standing on the long edge. The reproduction is the same, with the addition of metal on top to preserve the wooden structure.</p>",

After Big Kill Devil Hill-which shifted continuously due to wind and weather-was stabilized by the Quartermaster's Corps in 1929, the construction began in earnest.<br /> <br /> The monument was officially dedicated in 1932, with approximately 1,000 people in attendance-Orville Wright among them.</p> <h3>Laying the Cornerstone</h3> <p>The cornerstone for the monument was laid atop Kill Devil Hill on December 17, 1928-the 25th anniversary of the first flight and the same day of the First Flight Boulder dedication.</p> <h3>Stabilizing the Dune</h3> <p>In order to build a large monument atop Big Kill Devil Hill, the sand dune needed to be stabilized. In 1929, the dune was stabilized using a mixture of Bermuda grass, bitter panic grass, yaupon, myrtle, pine, live oak, and sumac-all found locally and transplanted. Rye and crotalaria grasses were also used.<br /> <br /> Description of the planting method use:<br /> > Shallow furrows plowed about thirty inches apart. Fertilizer applied, wire [Bermuda] grass roots placed in furrow, and different grass seeds sowed with the wire [Bermuda] grass roots. All planting then covered with a thin layer of sand and the entire area covered with two to three inches of wood's mold. Wood mold helped to fertilize sand and prevented the movement of sand while the seeds were germinating.</p> <h3>Design</h3> <p>In June, 1928, the Office of the Quartermaster General announced a design competition for the development of the monument. In October, 1928, the Office suggested that Big Kill Devil Hill would be a suitable location for the monument. By January, 1929, 36 entries had been received.<br /> <br /> The selection of the winning design was made in accordance with principles established by the American Institute of Architects. The jury chose the submission by the New York architectural firm of Rodgers and Poor, and the Commission of Fine Arts concurred. The winning Art Deco-inspired design was a masonry shaft and base of approximately 60 feet set on a star-shaped foundation. The design implied ancient Egyptian motifs, an important source for Art Deco designs.</p> <h3>Construction</h3> <p>The Wills and Mafera Corporation of New York won the bid for general contractor of the monument. The North Carolina Granite Corporation of Mount Airy, North Carolina, received the contract to supply the granite.<br /> <br /> Construction began in December 1931 and was completed by November 1932.</p> <h3>Dedication</h3> <p>The monument was dedicated in December 1932-one month after completion.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Wright Brothers Monument<br />403 words (3-Â½ minutes)<br /><br />Located at the top of Big Kill Devil Hill, the 60-foot-tall, granite monument is the tallest point at Wright Brothers National Memorial. With various concrete walking paths winding their way up the hill to the monument, the footpath around the monument is made up of small, square granite stones. <br /><br />The words \"Wilbur Wright Orville Wright\" are carved into the southern end of the monument. A quote reading \"In Commemoration of the Conquest of the Air, By the Brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright, Conceived by Genius, Achieved by Dauntless Resolution and Unconquerable Faith\" is carved 360 degrees around the monument, approximately 7 feet off the base. As you stand at the southern end of the monument, two busts of the brothers are visible at the base, Wilbur at right and Orville at left. A steel door at the base of the southern end shows various panels representing the history of aviation. <br /><br />The view from the monument looking west reveals the hill sloping down to the loop road with a coniferous tree-line just beyond the road. A portion of the First Flight Airstrip is also visible. The tree-line extends again beyond the airstrip with distant views of Albemarle Sound.<br /><br />Looking east from the monument, the hill slopes to the eastern portion of the loop road with a strip of coniferous trees just beyond. In the distance is the town of Kill Devil Hills with the Atlantic Ocean visible beyond.<br /><br />The view north reveals the hill sloping down to the north end of the loop road. Beyond the road is a large grassy field with a concrete walking path extending north to the site of the brothers' first powered flight. The walkway turns east-northeast past the camp buildings and toward the visitor center in the distance. The visitor center parking lot are in the northeast distance on the near side of the visitor center, with the towns of Kill Devil Hills and Kitty Hawk visible beyond. The Atlantic Ocean is visible to the northeast. A coniferous forest is visible to the northwest.<br /><br />The view south includes a rapid, downward slope of the hill to a grassy area with the southern loop road beyond. Just beyond the loop road lies the bronze sculpture garden depicting the scene of the first flight. In the southeast distance lies Kill Devil Hills and the Atlantic Ocean.

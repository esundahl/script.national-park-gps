Glacial ice, however, is embedded with sand, rocks, and boulders. The ice and stone work together like a sheet of sandpaper on the landscape. Debris carried along the bottom of the glacier abrades and polishes bedrock surfaces. Rock fragments frozen into the glacier gouge scratches and grooves in the rock surface. These scratches, or striations, provide evidence of the glacier’s path, though not necessarily its direction of travel.<br /> <br /> The exposed mountain face across the road has been polished by glacial gravel. Comparing its color and texture with Champlain Mountain in the distance, it appears the two are composed of different rock types. The nearby mountain face is light yellow-pink in color, and the mountain in the distance is a darker green-grey color. This color variation is not due to different rock types, but to the different appearances of clean, polished granite versus weathered, lichen-covered granite. Much of the granite on the island may have been polished by glaciers, but exposure to the elements and plant life has weather and eroded exposed rock faces, erasing their polished surfaces. The mountain face before you, however, was covered by a protective layer of soil until the 1900s, when the soil eroded away and the polished surface became visible.<br /> <br /> The rock face is slick and dangerous; even lichens cannot cling to the polished rock surface. For your protection and the preservation of the rock face, please keep off the rock. <h2>Congratulations</h2> This last site, along with previous stops in the EarthCache Program, shows the wide variety of impacts that glaciers have had on this land. You observed a glacier’s ability to cause reorientation of the mountains, to create Somes Sound, and to develop the ponds and lakes that characterize this region. You also experienced the signatures of glacial activity—glacial erratics and glacial plucking. Finally, you learned how the land was forced underwater from the enormous burden of ice upon it, then how it rebounded as the glacier retreated.<br /> <br /> Individually these sites are intriguing. Together they help tell the story of glaciation and provide a window into the past. Although the glaciers are no longer here for us to observe, the signs they left behind are part of what makes Acadia National Park so special. <h2>Final Clue</h2> On this journey, you have visited five glacially impacted areas. Using the map on the park brochure, locate the places you have been. Stops 1, 2, 3, and 5 form a line. Retracing the stops in order and using the compass in the map legend, in which direction does this line head? This is your final answer. <h3>What’s next?</h3> To get an imprint from a hand-carved stamp that proves course completion and to log your name, recount your experience, and add your letterbox stamp to the logbook, proceed to the Information Desk inside the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hulls-cove-visitor-center.htm\">Hulls Cove Visitor Center</a>, 25 Visitor Center Road, Bar Harbor, ME, off Route 3. Tell the ranger that you are participating in the EarthCache Program and give them your answer to the final clue. With your correct answer, you are given the opportunity to sign the logbook and receive the Acadia National Park EarthCache Program official stamp imprint.<br /> <br /> We hope you enjoyed your journey along the stops in the EarthCache program. Thank you for participating.<br /> <br /> <br />  ",

The sheer immensity of the last glacial ice sheet, estimated to have been about one-mile thick, also had a tremendous vertical impact on the land.<br /> <br /> When you step into a boat, you displace water. Similarly, when a tremendous amount of weight is placed upon the earth’s surface, the crust sinks. How much weight would it take to compress Mount Desert Island? To give you an idea, the mass of one square inch of ice that extendes one mile high is more than one ton, which menas one square foot of land could have more that 144 tons exerted upon it. When you consider how many square feet of land were covered by the last glacier, you get an idea of the tremendous strain placed upon the landscape—weight sufficient to compress the earth’s crust. Due to this significant weight, Mount Desert Island was pushed down and made into a series of islands surrounded by the sea. As the glacier melted, the weight decreased and consequently released the pressure, allowing hte land to once again rise above sea level.<br /> <br /> At this stop, you are given the opportunity to compare today’s sea level with the sea level near the end of the last ice age. Begin by cross Park Loop Road and walking along Ocean Path to the rock wall. From the path, look down into Monument Cove. There you will find a sea stack, a pillar of rock formed by water and wave activity.Now hike up Gorham Mountain Trail for a distance of 0.2 miles. At the “Pathmaker” plaque, the trail splits. Take the right for to Cadillac Cliffs, about 0.1 miles farther. Stop at the following coordinates:<br /> <br /> N 44° 19.284’<br /> W 68° 11.545’<br /> <br /> At this site you will see a landform that looks remarkably similar to the sea stack in Monument Cove. Observe the cliffs and the ancient sea cave. They were carved by waves more than 12,000 years ago! At the end of the last glacial period, this site was at sea level. <h2>Next Clue</h2> Use your GPS unit to determine the elevation of the old sea level at Cadillac Cliffs. Fill in the blank:<br /> <br /> The old sea level was _65 feet above the current sea level.<br /> <br /> Use that same number to fill in the blanks below to uncover the final coordinate<br /> N 44° _1.560’<br /> W 68° 1_.362’",

At 1,530 feet, Cadillac Mountain provides a bird’s-eye view of glacial impacts on the surrounding area.<br /> <br /> On a clear day, looking towards Bar Harbor you will see a group of islands known as the Porcupine Islands. On foggy days, you may need to refer to the exhibit above. The islands share a distinctive look caused by glacial plucking. As the ice sheet expanded from the north, the north sides of the islands and surrounding mountains were scoured by the glaciers, leaving gentle, polished slopes. The south sides experienced glacial plucking, which resulted in steep, irregular, and jagged slopes. Plucking occurs when ice melts due to increased pressure and the water under the glacier penetrates bedrock fractures. Subsequent freezing separates rocks from the bedrock and surrounds them in ice. Another terrific example of plucking may be seen from Sand Beach looking towards the mountain known as the Beehive, which you will be passing on the way to your next location.<br /> <br /> Cadillac Mountain also provides close-up opportunities to see glacial impacts. Look in the direction of Bar Harbor and the Porcupines (use the exhibit if it’s foggy), and you will spot a nearby glacial erratic nicknamed “the Jellybean.” Like Bubble Rock, this erratic also came from the region of Lucerne, Maine, 30 miles away.<br /> <br /> Please keep off the vegetation growing among the rocks; it is part of the fragile Cadillac Mountain ecosystem and is easily damaged by footsteps. <h2>Next Clue</h2> Count the number of islands labeled in the exhibit above.

Then look closely at the rounded boulder perched on the edge of the cliff. Do the two look different from one another?<br /> <br /> The two rocks are, in fact, composed of different types of granite. The bedrock is called Cadillac Mountain Granite, the same type of rock found atop Cadillac Mountain and prevalent throughout Acadia. Bubble Rock is composed of Lucerne Granite. Lucerne Granite did not form on Mount Desert Island; it formed about 30 miles northwest of Acadia, near the community of Lucerne, Maine.<br /> <br /> So, how did a 100-ton boulder the size of a minivan move such a distance? Bubble Rock is known as a glacial erratic, a geological term for a rock transported by a glacier and deposited on a different bedrock. Evidence of its travels can be seen in its appearance. Bubble Rock appears rounded like the cobblestones found along Maine’s shoreline. As the rock was carried, sharp edges were eroded away as the glacier ground along the terrain. How did the rock end up on the edge of a cliff? As the glacier melted, the boulder dropped free from the frozen mass and landed at its present location.<br /> <br /> Just as glaciers have the ability to deposit glacial erratics, they may also deposit large amounts of rock debris during heavy melting. As a glacier retreats, piles of boulders, stone, and till, called moraines, form. They may act as dams to glacier meltwater or other water sources. Jordan Pond is dammed by an end moraine, a moraine that forms at the front edge of a glacier. You can see Jordan Pond and the surrounding landscape from the summit of South Bubble. <h2>Next Clue</h2> Use your GPS unit to determine the elevation of Bubble Rock (not the elevation of South Bubble Mountain).

    "bodyText": "The first stop on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/acadia-earthcache.htm\">Acadia's Earthcache Tour</a> is Somes Sound.  <h2>Coordinates</h2> N 44° 19.110’<br /> W 68° 18.364’ <h2>Reading</h2> Acadia’s glacial story begins with one of North America’s greatest examples of a glacier’s erosive power. Acting like a bulldozer, the glacier carved through the mountains before you, forming a deep valley.The distinctive contour of the U-shaped valley you see is commonly associated with glacial activity. As glaciers advance, they follow the path of least resistance. Because Somes Sound is bordered by fractured granite, it provided an easier path for glaciers to follow.<br /> <br /> Somes Sound has been the subject of increasing debate over the years. As indicated on the above exhibit, Somes Sound was once considered a fjord. As research continues, evidence indicates that the sound is technically a fjard.A fjord is a long, narrow, glacially eroded valley filled by seawater. Fjords reach depths of hundreds of meters and have steep rocky cliffs near the ocean. Characterized as a glacially carved embayment drowned by the sea, a fjard is smaller in many respects to a fjord. At 300 meters from the depths of the water to the tops of the mountains, Somes Sound is minor compared to fjords found in Norway, which reach more than 1,000 meters. Nearer to the mouth of Somes Sound and not far below the surface of the water lies a sill, a layer of igneous rock that is parallel to the existing bedrock. Unlike true fjords, the sill in Somes Sound is too small to interrupt the flow of water from the ocean into the sound.<br /> <br /> Regardless of how it is classified, Somes Sound is a dramatic example of the raw power of glaciers. <h2>Next Clue</h2> According to the above exhibit, how deep is Somes Sound? To locate your next stop, place the missing numbers in the coordinates below.<br /> <br /> N 44° 20.470’<br /> W 68° _ _._45’",

    "bodyText": "The idea of preserving portions of Mount Desert Island to be made into a public park was first proposed by senior Olmsted Firm member Charles Eliot. After Eliot’s untimely death, his father and Harvard University President Charles W. Eliot worked to secure the land donations to honor his late son.<br /> <br /> In 1916, the year Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.’s Organic Act would be signed into law, land in Mount Desert Island was acquired by the federal government. From 1908 until this point, automobiles were banned on the island due to a disagreement between permanent residents and summer visitors.<br /> <br /> Summer resident John D. Rockefeller, seeing the inevitability of automobile use in the park with increased visitors, would help finance a loop road that would keep automobiles off the carriage roads and away from the park’s interior.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers joined the park in 1929 to recommend routes, locate scenic overlooks, and prepare engineering details for the loop road, with Olmsted Jr. taking the lead on this project. The National Park Loop Road Olmsted Brothers created provides automobiles access to numerous trails and attractions, like glacial lakes and Cadillac Mountain, the highest peak on the Atlantic Coast.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit: <br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=1058,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157665835628973/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/09138\">Olmsted Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/acadia-national-park\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/index.htm\">Acadia National Park</a>",

Friends of Acadia raised $9 million in private donations, a substantial portion of which came from the Colkets. Fundraising goals were met in July 2000, two years earlier than anticipated. The National Park Service committed the remaining money in federal funds.<br /> <br /> From the money raised by Friends of Acadia, three endowments were established. One was for continued maintenance of the trails, once they had been restored. Another funds the annual <a href=\"https://friendsofacadia.org/what-we-do/tomorrows-stewards/aycc/\">Acadia Youth Conservation Corps</a>.

The fourth side is a bulletin board, which contains notices of interest to visitors, such as ranger-led programs and safety reminders.

It is protected by cliffs on the west and the arm of Great Head to the east. Behind the beachfront are sand dunes and a wetland area, which are off limits to visitors to protect fragile ecosystems. This destination is particularly popular with Acadia visitors, and the parking area frequently fills by 9 am in the peak season.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{88ae634b-b39e-4bff-aef5-5cdd98b0f624}{45}\" paraid=\"1038119912\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Note:</strong> Sand Beach is not wheelchair-accessible, as the beach can only be reached via a staircase down the cliffside. </p> <p paraeid=\"{88ae634b-b39e-4bff-aef5-5cdd98b0f624}{57}\" paraid=\"277440179\">The beachfront is wide with ample space to relax by the waves or to swim.

The area, once known as Bliss Field is now designated as Atwater Kent Field. Kent was probably most well known for the establishment of the country’s biggest radio manufacturing business. His estate in Bar Harbor, Sonogee, survived the Fire of 1947 and until recently operated as a nursing home.<br /> <br /> A memorial plaque dedicated to him can be found off of the Schooner Head Path. The inscription reads as follows: </p> <blockquote> <div style=\"text-align: center;\">ATWATER KENT FIELD<br /> OF APPROXIMATELY 62 ACRES<br /> WAS DONATED IN 1946 BY THE<br /> ATWATER KENT FOUNDATION<br /> TO THE UNITED STATES OF<br /> AMERICA<br /> AS A PART OF<br /> ACADIA NATIONAL PARK</div> </blockquote> <h2>About Atwater Kent</h2> Atwater Kent was born in Vermont in 1873 and was married to Mabel Lucas Kent. He attended Worcester Polytechnic Institute (Worcester, MA) but dropped out in 1896 before graduating and went on to forge a successful career developing numerous mechanical inventions. He is most famous for patenting the modern form of induction ignition coil in 1921. As a noted inventor and radio pioneer he became a resident of Philadelphia, creating the successful Atwater Kent Manufacturing Company and eventually donated the funds for the Atwater Kent Museum of Philadelphia. Atwater Kent died in 1949 but his generous art legacy survives today, as well as the non-profit philanthropic foundation that carries his name.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Beehive and many of Acadia’s other mountains are examples of a geologic feature called a “roche mountonée.” Roches mountonée always have this distinct shape: a gradual slope leading up to a steep drop-off. This shape was created by glaciers, which covered Acadia from 35,000 to 16,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> As they made their way over mountains like the Beehive, glaciers had to fight against gravity as the mountain pushed them up toward the sky. This created a lot of pressure on the surface of the mountain. Not only were the glaciers working against the force of gravity, but the glaciers here were over a mile thick! That ice adds up to a lot of weight. The pressure from the combined weight of the ice and the gravity pulling it downwards meant that the glacier smoothed the surface of the mountains it traveled over, much like sandpaper. When we look at the Beehive and see the gentle slope leading up to its summit, we are looking at the path that the glaciers created as they passed over the mountain.<br /> <br /> But if glaciers have smoothed one side to a gentle slope, why does the other side look so steep? After the glacier reached the summit, there was a large release in the pressure that we previously talked about. Now, gravity was helping to pull that heavy ice back down the mountain. As the ice moved back down the mountain, changes in pressure meant that some of the ice at the base of the glacier melted – and that water seeped into cracks of the mountain’s surface. Eventually, that water would refreeze, breaking chunks of rock loose from the mountain as it expanded into ice. The glacier continued “plucking” rocks from the surface, making a steeper slope each time. This process happened over and over again as the glacier continued sliding over the mountain; eventually, it created the famously steep path up the Beehive that Acadia visitors know today.</p>",

Hadlock Store,\" and later as the \"Islesford Market.\" It was also run as a grocery store from a very early date (possibly from the date of its construction) both by Edwin Hadlock and later by his son's William E. and Gilbert T.. Thanks to the Hadlock family's consisten records, we can find detailed ledgers of the comings and goings of Islesfords residents and sailing vessels who purchased essential items from the Blue Duck. <br /> <br /> Edwin's father, Samuel (1770-1854) had moved to Little Cranberry island from Mount Desert Island around 1791, and opened a store in 1808 (This store was later removed in the early 1900s). Edwin was Master of the schooner <em>Samuel Hadlock</em> and as such he traded along the eastern coast between 1848 and 1853. Samuel Hadlock died in 1854. A Hadlock family genology remembers: <br />   <div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>In 1854, at the age of 84, Samuel Hadlock died, having outlived all of his sons but Edwin and several of his nephews. He left considerable property which we distributed among his numerous heirs. The business was carried on by Edwin, the only son who did not die at sea or in a some foreign port. Edwin died in the \"sand beach\" house on Little Cranberry Island in 1875... </em><br />  </div> The store remained in the Hadlock family until 1916 when a George Hadlock sold the land on which the building sites to Lewis G. Stanley, who in turn sold the property to Archibald A. Stevenson and Professor William Otis Sawtelle. A Haverford College professor who had taken up summer residence on the island, William Otis Sawtelle (1874-1939), had become deeply immersed in its history and families, and collected a large body of objects and documents related to the island. He was approached by artists Scott White, Charles Kincaid, and Harold Warren (who would later call themselves the \"Three Islesford Painters\" about using the upstairs of the store building as a gallery. The artists suggested to Sawtelle that he set up his collection in the first floor during their gallery showing in 1919 and this seemed to have sparked Sawtelle's interest in establishing a museum. A dated photograph of the building indicates that by 1919 the first story of the building was being used as a museum, and continued to be used as such until the new <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/islesford-historical-museum.htm\">Iselsford Historical Museum</a> was opened in 1928.  <br /> <br /> In 1948 ownership of the structure was transferred to the National Park Service, who by 1951 was utilizing the building as a ranger station and comfort station. The bathrooms installed in the north half of the first story of the building date to 1953 while the rest of the building appears to retain its earlier configuration.   <h2>The Blue Duck Today</h2> Through the National Park Service Historic Leasing program the <a href=\"https://www.islandinstitute.org/ii-solution/islesford-boatworks/\">Islesford Boatworks</a> provides summer shipbuilding classes to youth. Through its work keeping the shipbuilding skills alive in today's youth, Islesford Boatworks engages the entire community of Islesford and celebrates the important history of working waters and waterfronts in Maine island communities.  <h2>Building Architecture</h2> Architecturally, the store building is a simple structure, but changes over the years have made it difficult to determine the interior layout during its period of use as a store. Overall, the building is rectangular with a pitched roof, two chimneys, and doors and windows in all four floors. The exterior is painted clapboard on three sides and the south end and the roof are covered in wooden shingles, but those on the south elevation replaced earlier clapboards. With the exception of an additional chimney and doorway, and changes in the number and placement of the windows, the exterior of the building probably looks much as it it did in the 1850s. The most notable exception is that double doors were added in the north end of the building, which would seem to indicate some change in interior use. This change displaced a pair of windows which, in true New Englander fashion, were reused by placing them together to the west of the doors. The building shows various patches on its exterior due to its long period of consistent use <h2> </h2>",

    "bodyText": "Brown Mountain Gatehouse, and its counterpart, the Jordan Pond Gatehouse, guard the entrance to Acadia's historic carriage roads. In 1931, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. commissioned New York architect Grosvenor Atterbury in association with John Thompkins to design the elaborate gatehouses and gatekeepers' residences. Attenbury attempted in the design to recall the island's colonial heritage, choosing a highly picturesque style reminiscent of the provincial architecture of the Le Puis district in France. After their completion in 1932, Rockefeller donated both gatehouses to Acadia National Park. The gatehouses were built to control access to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/historiccarriageroads.htm\">network of carriage paths</a> Rockefeller so meticulously planned and the 'lodges' to house the respective gatekeepers. Rockefeller even funded the design and casting of bells for each gate which could signal the gatekeeper when a carriages or mounted rider wished to pass through.  <br /> <br /> Located just north of Northeast Harbor near Lower Hadlock Pond, the Brown Mountain Gate Lodge rests on a semi-octagonal foundation that reflects the shape of its monumental gate-towers. The high masonry wall bordering the front of the structure, as well as the positioning of the entrance and garage behind it, result in a nearly unbroken facade intending to draw the visitor's attention toward the gate. Built in 1932, Brown Mountain Gatehouse, the Lodge/Keeper's quarters, carriage house and unifying fence bowing away from the auto route form a quadrilateral grounds scheme. The immediate impact of the exterior is one of rich variation in texture, materials and ornament interspersed in a composition of strong horizontal and vertical design elements. The lodge is almost whimsical in the quaint introduction it provides to the near-fantasy beauty of the carriage roads. <br /> <br /> Both Brown Mountain Gatehouse and Jordan Pond Gatehouse are currently used as staff housing. Please respect the privacy of our staff and refrain from attempting to look in or access the interior of the structures. <h2>Architectural Details</h2> <h3>Exterior</h3> The overall composition of these structures is tied to a whole by the use of strong horizontal polychrome bands running the full length of the structures. The entire western facade is a continuous surface, from the gates at the north to the carriage house at the south. The three structures integrated by fences of the same materials. Atterbury used dressed rubble stone masonry from a locally-quarried granite which was laid random and interrupted by a precise string-courses of contrasting red Virginia-made brick stretchers in horizontal bands at 15 foot intervals. An additional unifying feature is the roof materials which is used on all three main structures as well as for the coping on the connecting stone and brick fences. It is a crudely made French shingle tile, similar to terra cotta, that comes in shades of brown, red and black. <br /> <br /> The gates consist of two towers enclosing the 'pecky' cypress wood gates and a covered open-air passage set into the segmental-shaped opening. The towers are built in the banded granite and brick motif and are square in plan with chamfered corners giving them eight sides. They are each crowned by a steeply pitched, eight-sided spire with a copper finial. The gabled ridge between them has the same shingle tile for its coping as do the towers for their roofs. Each tower roof has a four-sided, bayed, blind dormer above a round-arched window which is set into the masonry. These windows have prominent keystones and voiussoirs and are filled with ornamental turned-wood spindles which reappear in window openings of the other two structures. <br /> <br /> The two-and-one-half story lodge is a picturesque rending of a late-date Tudor Revival style. It is distinguished by half-timbering on its upper levels that reach up into the gable ends of a steeply pitched roof and also covers a dormered oriel window on the west facade. The predominantly vertical half-timbering is a composition of so-called pecky cypress that was burned and treated so as to appear a weathered grey. This framing is filled in with panels of softly variegated red brick laid decoratively in a primarily Flemish bond pattern.  <br /> <br /> The bellcast, gabled oriel of the west facade is flanked by hipped bay dormers. These window treatments have respectively two-and-three-light casement windows glazed in rows of decorative circular panes. Massive cypress brackets support the oriel and enclose a horizontal band of two-light casements below it. At the gable peak a pierced wood, round, floral decoration ventilates an attic.  <br /> <br /> The Lodge's entrance is oriented to the rear or eastern expanse of lawns, away from the auto route. The entrance is protected by a projecting, gabled porch with half-timbering in its substantial gable end which in turn frames a ventilating opening to an attic that is filled with turned wood spindles. The west dormers similarly reappear on the east facade. The main entrance has rectangular side and toplights glazed wit circular panes. There are original and decorative lead gutters, cachers and leaders. <br /> <br /> At either gable end of the house and chimneys, slightly inset into the main block, and one is of the banded motif which the other is of granite blocks and randomly placed bricks. They have one and three terra cotta chimney pots. The south chimney has undergone the only major structural alteration, during which an octagonal copper-roofed cupola, a weathervane and wooden wind shield were removed and the stepped stack with is projecting stone copings was built. <br /> <br /> The original design for the Gatehouse had a front facing entrance door and a bell post which were eventually incorporated into the plans for the Jordan Pond gatehouse. Rockefeller also asked landscape architect Beatrix Farrand for advice concerning the plantings around the Gatehouse and she initially advocated plantings that would screen the driveway and entrance. She later decided to use low plantings instead.   <h3>Lodge Interior</h3> The interior elements include a full basement and attic. The first story has an entrance hall and staircase to the second floor, a vast living room, a dining room, a kitchen, laundry and pantry. The second floor has four bedrooms, a bath and several closet spaces. There is one fireplace in the living room and the second chimney supports the kitchen wood stove. <br /> <br /> The carriage house has a hipped and very steeply pitched roof with a gabled dormer on the east slope presenting a \"suicide door\" with a hoisting hook suspended above it. A square cupola with a bellcast speaking spire boasts windows filled with turned and wooden spindles ventilate the loft. The rectangular structure carries through the banded granite and brick motif and on the west facade is a row of windows across which march turned wooden spindles between a long stone sill and cypress lintel.   <h3> </h3>",

It carries the Bubble Pond Carriage Road over a portion of the Jordan Pond/Eagle Lake motor road that was abandoned when that road was realigned in 1962-1964 to avoid a sharp curve. This bridge is now a relic with no function. Access to a parking lot along the shore of Bubble Pond remains.<br /> <br /> The simple rustic masonry arch bridge is constructed of unreinforced concrete clad with rough-dressed random-laid rubblestone. It is 75-feet long, 20-feet at highest, with an elliptical arch that spans 31-feet with rough-dressed radiating voussoirs. Keystones on both sides are inscribed with the 1928 construction date. Arched parapet walls are flanked by stepped wingwalls that have large projecting stone scuppers and which terminate in squared endposts.<br /> <br /> Beatrix Farrand would later make plantings recommendations to fill the spaces around the bridge as thickly as the ledge permitted. She suggested maples, oaks, birches, as well as dewberry, clematis, and sumac.<br /> <br /> As John D. Rockefeller, Jr. went about planning and funding Acadia's carriage road network, he determined that the 'Bubble Pond-Triad' carriage road should cross the new 'mountain' motor road he was also funding and designing, necessitating a bridge. He turned to New York architect William Welles Bosworth, who responded with a formal multi-centered arch bridge with open balustrade and finely-cut voussoirs. Although Mr. Rockefeller accepted the design, the NPS Assistant Director Arno Cammerer objected to it as being too formal for a national park. Bosworth prepared a second design, eliminating the open balustrade but retaining the carefully cut stone and formal voussoirs. This design was again rejected as being too 'citified.' <br /> <br /> The National Park Service then designed a more 'rustic structure' of roughly-quarried stone, making it possibly the only carriage road bridge of solid masonry construction. Although disappointed, Mr.. Rockefeller agreed to fund the construction of this design. His engineer, Paul D. Simpson, prepared the working drawings, and the bridge was constructed in 1928 by Philadelphia mason Pringle Borthwick. </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Head towards the west side of the island to visit an example of island life at Carroll Homestead, a time capsule of early settlement before Mount Desert Island became a tourist destination and Acadia National Park came into being.</p> <p>As tourism came into fashion on the island in the late 1800s, farms were sold, new houses built, outbuildings were left to collapse, and fields were reclaimed by forests. In many respects, this is the story of thousands of traditional farmsteads across northern New England. The Carroll Farm was spared this fate and shares with us what life could be like on a homestead almost 200 years ago.</p> <h3>History</h3> <p>In the late 1700s and early 1800s, settlers came to Mount Desert Island with their families to form homesteads where they would build houses, create farms and live off the land as well as the sea.</p> <p>For 92 years, three generations of Carrolls lived on this traditional New England homestead. Together, the family worked the small-scale farm to provide their needs. They combined this with working off the farm to acquire cash. The first <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-and-rachel-carroll.htm\">John Carroll</a> cleared the land, built the house and later the barn. He used his mason skills to bring in cash needed to buy items they were unable to produce on the farm. His son <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jacob-and-rebecca-carroll.htm\">Jacob Carroll</a> took over the homestead after a life at sea and continued the farming tradition. He also took up work as a mason and passed this skill on to his sons. By the early 1900s, the second <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/john-and-viola-carroll.htm\">John Carroll and his family</a> (the third generation) were living on the property. Making his living entirely as a mason, the farm was retired. The house was without modern conveniences such as running water, electricity, or gas lighting. Living outside of town became inconvenient. John had a long commute to work, and the children a long walk to school, so in 1917 the Carrolls left their ancestral home to move into town.</p> <p>It continued to be used by Carroll family relatives as a place of retreat and remembrance. A place to gather throughout the 1900s, and was finally donated to Acadia National Park in 1982.</p> <h3>Getting Around</h3> <p>Carroll Homestead is approximately 30 minutes from Hulls Cove Visitor Center.</p> <ul> <li>By car: From Hulls Cove Visitor Center, go straight at the four-way intersection at the exit of the visitor center parking lot. Continue 3 miles until signs for ME Route 233 and exit left. Turn right onto ME Route 233, turn right onto 198 when 233 dead ends. At the stop light turn left onto ME Route 102 towards Southwest Harbor. The gravel road that leads to the parking lot will be on your left and there is a sign for the Homestead.</li> <li>By bus: There is no bus stop at Carroll Homestead. When the Island Explorer is running, the bus will drop off and pick up people on ME Route 102 by the Carroll Homestead driveway. To get dropped off, pull the cord as the bus approaches. To get picked up, wave down bus; if the bus is full, you may have to walk to Echo Lake to get onto a bus.</li> </ul> <p>Take either of the two paths from the parking lot to view the homestead. You can choose between the path to the left which is a walking path through the woods, or you can walk the gravel drive up to the accessible parking area straight ahead.</p> <h3>Programming</h3> <p>Rangers open the homestead for touring on a seasonal basis. Check the park <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/calendar.htm\">calendar</a> for dates and times.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>How does this cobble beach compare to Sand Beach, where this hike started? An easy difference to spot is in the names of the beaches: one beach is made of <i>sand</i>, and one beach is made of <i>cobbles</i>. In geology, these words are used to describe the size of pieces of rocks, also known as “grain size.” Grain size, in addition to grain roundness, help tell geologists about what kind of journeys rocks have been on.<br /> <br /> At this cobble beach, we can observe the size and roundness of these cobbles to learn more about the beach. The cobbles are large, meaning that they haven’t moved very far. Because their size makes them heavy, it is difficult for waves to pick them up and take them somewhere else. The cobbles are also round, which tells us that they are being smoothed as waves carry them up and down the beach, rolling the cobbles against each other and knocking off any sharp or broken edges.<br /> <br /> If we took a dump truck of sand from Sand Beach and poured it onto this cobble beach, it would wash away very quickly! This beach is not protected by any landforms and gets hammered with waves all day. Only the cobbles remain because their larger size makes them resistant to these strong waves. Because most of Acadia’s shoreline is exposed to direct waves, there are many other cobble beaches in the park – when you encounter cobble beaches, it’s important to leave the cobbles where you find them. It helps preserve the beach for future visitors to enjoy, lets cobbles stabilize the shoreline, and protects tiny ecosystems that live in the crevices of the rocks.</p>",

A semicircular central arch, with a 39-foot span, and side arches, 21-foot spans, are outlined by radiating voussoirs.<br /> <br /> Because it affords a panoramic view of the bay, semi-circular lookouts were included on both sides of the bridge from the spandrel walls above the piers. A staircase on the upstream side provides a path down to the brook, providing a view of the bridge from below. Additional ornamental details include pierced parapets, distinctly patterned paving stones at each lookout, and coping stones with a smooth, bush-hammered finish.

Rockefeller, Jr. planned magnificent views of Frenchman Bay.<br /> <br /> The 118-foot long Gothic-arch bridge is constructed of reinforced concrete clad with quarry-faced, random-coursed ashlar granite. The 30-foot wide arch is outlined with slender radiating voussoirs and flanked by angled lookouts, and the parapet walls have regular openings below the stone coping.<br /> <br /> In 1974, the bridge had to be widened to accommodate traffic.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Leading from the Beehive towards Sand Beach, a freshwater stream approaches the beach to meet the ocean. Areas like these ones are called estuaries: where freshwater from rivers and streams mix with saltwater as it meets the ocean. When water mixes like this (freshwater + saltwater), it is sometimes known as “brackish” water. Estuarine waters are usually protected from the harsh waves of the ocean by beaches, barrier islands, or even reefs. This one is protected by Sand Beach and Old Soaker beyond it.<br /> <br /> Estuaries are important natural places. They are incredibly productive environments, giving life and habitat to many different animals. Many species of fish rely on estuaries for habitat: where they live, eat, and have offspring. Because so many fish call estuaries home, these locations also become useful areas for birds that eat the fish. Estuaries are especially important to birds during migration season when they need a place to stop, rest, and eat.<br /> <br /> Estuaries are very delicate, so be gentle as you explore this area. Keep your eye out for fish, grasses, and birds – all common to estuarine ecosystems.</p>",

    "bodyText": "In 1900, the wealthy financier J.P. (John Pierpont) Morgan purchased 117 acres, including all of Sand Beach and Great Head as a wedding gift for his oldest child and daughter Louisa Peirpont Morgan’s (1866-1946) wedding. Louisa married Herbert Satterlee (1863-1947) in New York City on November 15th, 1900. Louisa and Herbert had two daughters, Mabel born in 1901 and Eleanor born in 1905. The two daughters grew up exploring the landscape and making connections to the rockbound coast of Mount Desert Island.<br /> <br /> Construction of the Satterlee Estate buildings commenced in 1911. The Satterlees began summering at their summer estate named ‘Satterlee Field’ that very summer. The first summer for the Satterlees was certainly filled with adventure. The estate grounds and buildings provided safe shelter for the displaced crew of the shipwrecked Schooner Tay that wrecked on Old Soaker and was washed ashore onto Sand Beach, as discussed during the second stop on this hike. According to a park conducted interview with one of the estate superintendents children , Dayton Salisbury, the <i>“Staff on the estate included 2 chauffeurs,, 2 cooks, a kitchen girl, a parlor maid, a ladies maid, the housekeeper and 5 local men working on the grounds.”</i><br /> <br /> The Satterlee family usually visited for 6 weeks each summer. The family stayed in “rustic” Adirondack style cottages and the staff stayed in smaller bungalows. The estate also had a barn and cows which provided fresh dairy products, gardens for fresh vegetables, and a nursery to assist in growing assorted plants for the estate gardens designed by renowned landscape architect Beatrix Farrand. Farrand designed the estate gardens to have a natural flow that blended the plantings/gardens with the surrounding landscape. Little benches, footpaths, and bridges led the visitor throughout the gardens.<br /> <br /> The family summered at Satterlee Field between 1911 and 1946. After the Fire of ’47, discussed just a few stops ago, the youngest daughter Eleanor summered one last summer in 1948 before the daughters decided to donate the estate land to Acadia National Park, as discussed in the very first stop of this hike.",

Hours changes seasonally so check our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">Hours & Seasons</a> page prior to your arrival.<br /> <br /> Upon entering the parking lot, visitors can access information and (seasonal) Island Explorer bus stops via a covered pavilion. From the parking lot, you can enjoy your first hike in Acadia National Park up the 52 stone steps to the visitor center. There you can purchase your <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/fees.htm\">entrance pass</a>, speak with a ranger about planning your visit, use self-service maps, enjoy art from our Artist-In-Residence program, and shop at the Park Store. Visitors requiring an accessible entrance can follow signs to drive up to the rear of the building and use the accessible entrance and elevator. </p> <h2>History of the Building</h2> <p>Hulls Cove Visitor Center was originally both the park's administrative headquarters and visitor center. It was designed and construction began in 1967. Construction was completed by December of 1986. It was an example of the dual purposes administration/visitor center building type created by the National Park Service (NPS) in the mid-20th century. Funding for the building came from the Mission-66 Program, a nationwide effort to improve infrastructure in America's national parks from 1956-1966.  <br /> <br /> In a departure from the more rustic pre-World War II style of NPS architecture, Mission 66 designers embraced contemporary structural forms for the new centers as well as for ancillary buildings, in part because of the scarcity of buildings materials following WWII and changes in materials and labor. Mission 66 buildings demonstrated a new commitment by the NPS to interpret park resources and accommodate visitors and increased staffing levels. For the first time in NPS history, these buildings grouped park interpretive presentations, auditoriums, administrative offices, restrooms and other visitor services into one complex. </p> <h2>Design Features</h2> <p>Hulls Cove Visitor Center is situated on a small cleared plateau on the northeast side of Paradise Hill. It is a flat-roof, rectangular trapezoid building clad in shingles and built upon a granite ashlar first story. An original concrete and wood bridge provides access to the center's main lobby. The bridge is faced with granite stones surmounted with diagonal boards and flat handrails. The building and the approach use readily available local materials - wood and granite. The building is 65 feet in length and 22 feet in width.  <br /> <br /> In 1995, a small two-story addition expanded the visitor center to the northeast to accommodate an accessible entrance and restrooms. A secondary entrance was added at this time via a second concrete bridge supported by two columns. This provided egress from the now-removed auditorium.  <br /> <br /> Once inside the building, a large array of windows look out into what once was a beautiful view of Frenchman's Bay. Alas, the trees have grown to now block this once iconic view.  </p>",

After his death, Maria provided $75,000 to the town of Bar Harbor for the Jesup Memorial Library; the library was dedicated in 1911, in memory of her husband.

Dorr</a> and the Bar Harbor Village Improvement Association following the designation of the area as Sieur de Monts National Monument in 1916. A plaque dedicated to the Jesups can be found at the southern end of the Jesup Path, overlooking the Tarn.

A memorial plaque dedicated to Rockefeller can be found along the Ocean Path, between Otter Cliffs and the Otter Point parking area. For all that he contributed to Acadia National Park, the plaque is simple and humble-- but when you look at the “magnificent window on the seas” at this plaque’s location, perhaps this is the perfect place for it. The inscription reads as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, JR.</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">1874–1960<br /> These groves of spruce and fir, these granite ledges, this magnificent window on the seas, were given to the United States by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. He was among the first to sense the need to preserve America’s natural beauty and to set high standards of environmental quality. This quiet, dedicated conservationist gave generously of his time, wisdom and resources to help establish this park and others for the physical, cultural and spiritual benefit of the American people.</p> </blockquote>",

He gained fame in 1893 by successfully suing the U.S. government to stop the new income tax, delaying its implementation by 20 years. He was also a developer and purchased over 2,000 acres of land on the Schoodic Peninsula via the Gouldsboro Land Improvement Company. Their dream was to create a resort in the Grindstone Neck area to rival Bar Harbor. Moore built roads and trails on the peninsula.<br /> <br /> After his death, his widow Louise Leeds and his daughters donated their land to the park, on the condition that the name be changed. At the time, it was known as Lafayette National Park, and Leeds and her daughters were staunch Anglophiles. As a concession, George B. Dorr agreed to change the name to Acadia National Park.<br /> <br /> A memorial plaque for John Godfrey Moore can be found at Schoodic Point. The inscription reads as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">SCHOODIC PENINSULA IN<br /> ACADIA NATIONAL PARK<br /> DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY<br /> OF<br /> JOHN GODFREY MOORE<br /> 1848-1899<br /> A MAINE MAN WHO LOVED<br /> HIS NATIVE STATE, WHEREIN HE SPENT, WITH HIS FAMILY,<br /> SOME OF THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF HIS LIFE. HE OWNED SCHOODIC PENINSULA,<br /> BUILT THE FIRST ROAD UPON IT, AND OPENED IT TO THE PUBLIC<br /> IN THE YEAR 1897<br />  </p> </blockquote>",

    "bodyText": "Brown Mountain Gatehouse, and its counterpart, the Jordan Pond Gatehouse, guard the entrance to Acadia's historic carriage roads. In 1931, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. commissioned New York architect Grosvenor Atterbury in association with John Thompkins to design the elaborate gatehouses and gatekeepers' residences. Attenbury attempted in the design to recall the island's colonial heritage, choosing a highly picturesque style reminiscent of the provincial architecture of the Le Puis district in France. After their completion in 1932, Rockefeller donated both gatehouses to Acadia National Park. The gatehouses were built to control access to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/learn/historyculture/historiccarriageroads.htm\">network of carriage paths</a> Rockefeller so meticulously planned and the 'lodges' to house the respective gatekeepers. Rockefeller even funded the design and casting of bells for each gate which could signal the gatekeeper when a carriages or mounted rider wished to pass through. Whereas the layout of the Brown Mountain Gatehouse is octagonal, this gatehouse complex is near linear. The masonry work of both the Jordan Pond and Brown Mountain gate lodges are similar yet far from identical. While the second stories of both structures are half timbered with soft brick infill the first floor facade of the Jordan Pond Gatehouse lodge includes different building materials that give it a unique look. Although also banded in the style of the Le Puis district of France, the Jordan Pond facade includes green, seam-faced granite rather than the red brick of the Brown Mountain Gatehouse.<br /> <br /> After its completion, the Jordan Pond Gatehouse lodge was occupied first by the family of Rockefeller's chief engineer, Paul D. Simpson. <br /> <br /> The Jordan Pond Gatehouse, is located near the Jordan Pond House in the heart of Acadia's historic carriage road network. The Gatehouse, built in 1932, is a linear complex of a Carriage House connecting to the Gatekeeper's House (or \"lodge\") via an open-air passageway and a Gatehouse connected by a masonry fence. The carriage paths intersect the Park Loop Road at this point and lead to Sargent Mountain Path among others.  <br /> <br /> <em>Both the Jordan Pond Gatehouse lodge and Brown Mountain Gatehouse lodge are currently used as staff residences. Please respect the privacy of our staff and do not attempt to look in the windows or access the interior of the structures.</em><br />   <h2>Architectural Details</h2> <h3>Exterior</h3> The Gatekeeper's House is a late-date Tudor Revival structure of two-and-one-half stories in a rectangular plan with a small, gabled ell at the rear. The first story is of dressed ashlar laid randomly with a string course of cypress outlining the second story division. The second story is half-timbered with cypress which creates a narrow band on the length of the house but which on the widths sweep up grandly into the gable ends of the steeply-pitched roof. The timbers are set vertically with crossbeams and diagonal braces and are filled with a softly-variegated red Virginia brick laid in decorative patterns, predominantly Flemish bond. The cypress has been burned and treated to give the appearance of a weathered grey. <br /> <br /> The upper stores form a jetty supported by stone corbels which enclose grade level casement windows with circular panes of leaded glass. On this facade, too, are three hipped dormers with brackets and casement windows. The roof is covered with a crudely made French shingle tile, similar to terra cotta, that comes in shades of brown, red and black and which extends are to the gable end covering the peak. Set flush with the bottom edge of the tile is a horizontal band of six small windows and beneath them are centered two more longer windows. These apertures are filled with turned wood spindles which mask the ventilating louvers for the attic.  <br /> <br /> The grassy lawns at the rear of the house are thickly shaded and frame this less formally arranged elevation. An oriel projects over concrete corbels and has three-light casement windows with leaded glass circular panes. The one-and-one-half story gabled rear kitchen ell is as steeply pitches as the main room and they each sport a partially inset chimney. The stacks are of the same locally quarried, random laid ashlar as the house and all and both have decorative, triple terra cotta chimney pots with a chevron inbrication below the rim. <br /> <br /> A porch, open on two sides, is set into the corner of the house underneath the front jetty with a massive stone piers and a deep umbrage, which leads to the main entrance. The area in front of the house has been retained in a naturalistic state, crowded with shade trees and ferns. <br /> <br /> The Carriage House, a rectangular plan structure with a steeply pitched and a bellcast hipped roof, is built of dressed granite ashlar laid randomly, and has massive double leaf, strap-hinged cypress doors. A large gabled dormer dominates the front roof slope with a triangular aperture at is peak filled with turned wood spindles. Beneath, a network of two rows of holes for a birdhouse has been incorporated into the design. The rear facade had four-paned windows, and a covered passage connects the Carriage House and workshop space into the residence. This walkway also open to the rear lawns and is sheltered by a gabled superstructure covered by French shingle tiles. A small decorative cupola is perched on top with wood spindles in its window openings. The structure is supported by wood posts with span braces. <br /> <br /> Similarly constructed masonry fences, which have peaking coping stones along the ridge, lead in unbroken succession from the residence to the gatehouse. The gate towers, square in plan and imposing, are built of the same materials with the French shingle tile on their bellcast gabled roofs. narrow, tall, round-arched windows are in each tower and a wooden gate between them. <br /> <br /> Landscape architect Beatrix Farrand designed plantings that attempted to blend the structures in with their natural surroundings. To accomplish this, she recommended that vines be places on the exterior of the facade, shrubs and ferns be located near the sharp corners of the buildings, and a terraced lawn be constructed in front of the house in order to salvage trees native to the area. <h3>Interior</h3> The interior elements include, on the first floor, a living room with a corner fireplace, a foyer and Bessler staircase, a dining room with a window seat, a pantry and large kitchen. There are hardwood floors throughout the house. In the kitchen is an original wood-burning Clarion stove. The second floor comprises four bedrooms and a bath and there is also a full basement and attic.  <h3> </h3> <h3> </h3>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Jordan Pond Road Bridge (1932) is one of 17 bridges constructed along 57 miles of carriage road on Mount Desert Island between 1917 and 1940. It carries the Seal Harbor (formerly Jordan Pond) road over the Day Mountain Carriage Road to provide a greater separation and sense of seclusion for the carriage road. As such the underside was faced with stone but the deck above for the town road was not ornamented.<br /> <br /> The reinforced-concrete structure, measuring 85-feet long, and 19-feet 5-inches at its highest poing, is clad with quarry-faced ashlar granite, including the underside of the arch.<br /> <br /> The segmental arch spans 26-feet 8-inches with irregular radiating voussoirs. The parapet walls have granite capstones laid alternately vertically and horizontally, the vertical stones projecting slightly above the horizontal stones. The solid stone parapet walls are composed of both rock-face ashlar and squared, rock-face boulders. Long masonry retaining walls flank the road on either side of the bridge.<br /> <br /> Beatrix Farrand provided detailed planting recommendations, including a heavy cover of Scotch pine as well as mountain ash and white pine along the upper portions of the banks and big groups of sumac, Japanese maple, barberry, and sweetbriar rose, and various vines on the lower portions.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Joseph Allen was a member of Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservation and chairman of Seal Harbor Village Improvement Society Roads and Paths Committee. Energetic and extremely committed to the path system, Allen constructed new trails in the Seal Harbor area and made alterations to improve the system.<br /> <br /> Funding for trail work was often solicited by Allen for improvements on specific trails. For example, John D. Rockefeller Jr. donated $500 toward the improvement of the Jordan Stream Trail, which ran across his property. Allen would later comment, “An inevitable first effect of the coming of the automobile was the banishment of the horse and the desertion of foot paths and trails. Extensive motor trips over broad highway through new country became the favorite recreation, and the fascinations of speed bid fair to dominate the vacation time of the nation. But vacations are intended for the true rest and refreshment which exciting motion cannot bring. More than ever, therefore, the bridle paths through quiet woods and trails, by lakes and over mountains, are most desirable features of a vacation resort. Seal Harbor is excelled by few places in the world in the extent and charm of its roads and trails.”</p> <p>His plaque is located at the northeast end of Jordan Pond near South Bubble Trail. The inscription reads as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">LOVER OF ROCKS AND</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">HIGH PLACES</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">BUILDER OF NATURAL</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">BEAUTY</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">JOSEPH ALLEN</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">CHAIRMAN</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">SEAL HARBOR PATH COM-</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">MITTEE</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">1914–1945</p> </blockquote> <p> </p> <p> </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Gulf of Maine is an extremely productive body of water, and many creatures call it home. Part of the reason why it is so productive is because it’s so cold. Colder water can hold more oxygen, and that oxygen gives life to many marine animals like lobsters, urchins, fish, and many more. Because these waters are filled to the brim with these critters, many marine predators also come to the Gulf of Maine for the abundance of food. Predators like Ospreys, Double-crested Cormorants, seals, porpoises, and even sharks can be found in the waters around Acadia.<br /> <br /> Look out into the ocean here, about halfway across the cove: do you see a rock ledge? This rock is known as Old Soaker, the same ledge that caused the demise of the Schooner Tay. Old Soaker, along with the two headlands that surround it, all help to protect the sand on Sand Beach from the heavy waves of the Atlantic. Without protection from Old Soaker, the sand could be easily carried away from the beach by strong waves.<br /> <br /> Sand Beach is a unique beach in Maine. It is mostly composed of tiny pieces of broken shells. It is unusual to see a shell beach in an area with such cold water – shells are made of calcium carbonate, which dissolves easily in cold water. Beaches like these are much more common in warmer parts of the world like the Carolinas or Florida, where the water isn’t cold enough to rapidly dissolve shells. The shell-fragment sand of Sand Beach is a testament to how productive the waters of Maine are: the cold, oxygen-rich water produces more shelled creatures than it can dissolve, making Sand Beach possible.</p>",

This video tour will give you a sense of the life and motivations of George Bucknam Dorr, the founder of Acadia National Park who lived here on the Oldfarm estate until his death in 1944.<br /> <br /> Here are some tips for your exploration:<br /> <br /> The NPS application uses the Global Positioning System function in your device to locate you as you move around the Oldfarm Estate. Your position will be indicated by the blue dot on the map. On some days you may get erroneous GPS locations due to the heavy tree canopy above you in summer and fall, so common sense should be your first guide in your explorations! You can still use the application by looking at the map and selecting stations or just by selecting stations from the list. The stops displayed on your map correspond with numbered wooden posts and associated historic photos and short videos.<br /> <br /> Stay on the path shown on the application that starts at the parking area. This path will take you along the historic Manor House driveway but then it diverges towards Compass Harbor and turns south before reaching Dorr Point. The suggested path then ascends the historic stone stairway up to the Manor House. The stairs ascent might be too strenuous for some visitors. Use common sense. At the top of the stairs are the remains of the Manor House, and the return path to the parking lot. There are many cultural artifacts here such as building bricks and stone. All of these are protected by Federal and State law. Do not move or take any artifact. Please do not rebuild any structure. Help us keep this place in its current condition by watching out for this historic treasure and reporting any vandalism or destructive behavior you may observe. The main Acadia National Park telephone number is (207) 288-3388.<br /> <br /> Together we can protect the remains of Oldfarm.",

Come chat with a park volunteer or ranger and learn about the naval history at Schoodic Peninsula in this restored historic structure.<br /> <br /> Rockefeller Hall was constructed in 1934 for the new naval base on Schoodic Peninsula. The base, strategically located on a quiet peninsula in by the north Atlantic Ocean, focused on radio communications with Europe. Like much of the base, Rockefeller Hall was funded by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. The building was designed by Grosvenor Atterbury in a French Eclectic style and intended to be the centerpiece of the base. For several years, it served as an operation center and military housing.<br /> <br /> Today, Rockefeller Hall is one of four original base buildings at the Schoodic Education and Research Center. The research center partners with Acadia National Park to further scientific research and education. Every year, the center introduces thousands of students and park visitors to environmental science and conservation.<br /> <br /> In 2010s, Rockefeller Hall underwent restoration and safety rennovations and now operates as the Rockefeller Welcome Center.",

Come relax by the waves, or head out on a nearby trail. In summer, the free Island Explorer shuttle makes frequent stops here. Parking, however, often fills early in the morning.<br />  <br /> Stay alert when swimming! Lifeguards may be present in summer, but your safety is your responsibility. The ocean water can be shockingly cold, even in summer. Strong tides and rogue waves can surprise even experienced swimmers.<br /> <br /> Ocean Path, Beehive Loop, and Gorham Mountain Loop can all be accessed here. Sand Beach is also a spectacular spot for stargazing. In summer, check the park calendar for night sky ranger program times.

The “Tay”, already taking on water, struck the ledge you can see just off of Sand Beach called “Old Soaker”. The “Tay” quickly broke to pieces. Clinging on for dear life to the broken mast, the “Tay’s” crew waited till the tide went out so they could scramble to the safety of the sandy beach. The crew found refuge in the Satterlee Family’s summer home. A large portion of the “Tay’s” cargo, close to ninety thousand feet of spruce planks, was washed ashore by the waves. The lumber was salvaged by many local islanders as well as the Satterlee family, who built a boathouse with salvaged lumber to honor the shipwreck.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The circular shaped stone in front of you is not a remnant of an ancient civilization or a sign from alien spacefarers who once visited this place… it is an old <b><i>mill stone</i></b> also commonly known as a <b><i>grinding stone</i></b>. Long before automated machines ground grain into flour, humans for millennia turned their grain into flour with stones. You might have seen “stone ground” labels in your local grocery store aisles.<br /> <br /> The local mill would be the location one would take grain to get ground into flour. Within the mill was a built system of wooden wheels, shafts, and gears designed to harness waterpower from a water wheel or wind power from the blades of a windmill. The system of wheels, shafts, and gears were attached to the top stone and provided power to the stone. Mill stones or grinding stones were always in pairs of two. The stationary stone on the bottom was called the <b><i>bed stone</i></b><i> </i>while the stone that moved suspended above or on top of the bed stone was called the <b><i>runner stone</i></b>. There are different ways the stones were oriented depending on the era in history or the location in the world.<br /> <br /> As the runner stone turned over top of the bed stone the grain was slowly dribbled from a spout (or hopper) into the hole in the center of the runner stone. Both the runner stone and the bed stone had grooves (also referred to as furrows) cut into them. The grooves/furrows were cut and angled in a way that acted like a scissor action cutting or grinding the grain into flour. The stone surfaces were angled in a way that allowed the grain to move outward as the stones turned. The flour was caught by a wooden case surrounding the bed stone. The flour would be ground again if a different coarseness or fineness was desired.<br /> <br /> Historically, there was never a gristmill (building where grain is ground) here at the Sand Beach / Great Head area. The Satterlee estate. While we can’t confirm with 100% certainty, we know through historic newspaper articles and personal primary source diary entries that a Schooner named the Abbott wrecked on Baker’s Island in December 1896. The cargo of the Abbott consisted of 160 tons of grindstones. Many of these grindstones eventually were salvaged and brought to Mount Desert Island. Some stones found their way to local mills on the island and others found their way to the gardens and estates of the wealthy summer residents. Through these historically written clues it is a safe bet that one of those “7 foot x 14 inch” grindstones found its way onto the Satterlee estate where it was used as a bench, a flagpole base, and a conversation piece by the Satterlee family.</p>",

Louisa married Herbert Satterlee (1863-1947) in New York City on November 15th, 1900. Louisa and Herbert had two daughters, Mabel born in 1901 and Eleanor born in 1905. The two daughters grew up exploring the landscape and making connections to the rockbound coast of Mount Desert Island.<br /> <br /> The Satterlee summer excursions to the coast of Maine came to an end when Louisa died in October of 1946 and Herbert died in July of 1947. Much of the estate was burnt during the October Fire of ’47 (discussed in more detail at a later stop on this hike). The Satterlee family already had an ongoing relationship with Acadia National Park because large portions of park land already bordered Satterlee Field. The Satterlee family even allowed park visitors to explore Sand Beach. After the Fire of ’47, the Satterlee daughters Eleanor and Mabel decided to donate the land in honor of their mother Louisa so others could continue to visit this beautiful landscape for generations to come. Since then, visitors to Acadia have enjoyed the same beach, forests, mountains, and coastline they once enjoyed here in Maine.</p>",

Although similar in scenic splendor to portions of Mount Desert Island, the Schoodic Coast is a more secluded area. It is about an hour drive from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hulls-cove-visitor-center.htm\">Hulls Cove Visitor Center</a> on Mount Desert Island.<br /> <br /> After passing through the town of Winter Harbor and entering the park, you will find the Frazer Point Picnic Area, with tables, fire rings, comfort stations, and drinking water along with seacoast views of islands, coves and rocky beaches. Leaving the picnic area, the park road is one-way and parallels the western shore of the peninsula leading to Schoodic Point. There are automobile turnouts for viewing along the way. From these turnouts you can see Mount Desert Island and enjoy views of lobster boats, wheeling gulls, and forest-draped islands.  <br /> <br /> About two and one half miles from the picnic area, an unmarked trail ascends to the top (440 feet) of Schoodic Head. This is a narrow gravel road, so please exercise caution when meeting traffic. Although you can drive up the one mile road, you may choose to walk. on a clear day, from the summit, vistas of the ocean, forests, and mountains claim your attention. Returning to the main road, keep right at the intersection past the entrance to the Schoodic Institute. This is a two-way section of road. Along this windswept coast, huge granite ledges turn Atlantic Ocean waves into lofty geysers and dark-colored basaltic dikes intrude between slabs of pink granite.<br /> <br /> After leaving Schoodic point, bear right and follow the road - one-way again - until you reach Blueberry Hill Parking Area, about one mile beyond Schoodic point. If you look towards the ocean, Schoodic Island emerges. To your right is Little Moose Island and behind you and across the road is a steep slope called The Anvil. You can reach the summit of this 180 foot promontory via the trail which starts across the road from the parking lot. About two miles from Blueberry Hill parking Area, the park ends at Wonsqueak Harbor. Two miles beyond the park is the villa of Birch Harbor and the intersection of Route 186.   <h2>Area History</h2> The Schoodic Peninsula has been the traditional homelands of <a href=\"https://www.abbemuseum.org/\">the Wabanaki people</a> since time immemorial. Long before Europeans arrived, the Wabanaki traveled here on foot or in seaworthy birchbark canoes. Setting up temporary camps, they hunted, fished, gathered berries, harvested clams, and traded with other Wabanaki for generations. Colonial settlement relied upon the knowledge and guidance of Wabanaki people to succeed and they remained resilient through generations of attempted genocide. <br /> <br /> Early European colonists and settlers established farms and utilized coastal resources to survive in the harsh and isolated environment. One of those residents was Thomas Frazier, the first documented, free African-American resident of what is now known as the Schoodic Penninsula. Since 1935, the peninsula has also been home to the United States navy, when a radio station was constructed to replace a similar facility on Mount Desert Island that stood in the way of the construction of the Park Loop Road. The navy base, most recently known as Naval Security Group Activity Winter Harbor, was located on 100 acres at Schoodic Point. When the Navy announced its intention to close the base at Schoodic, the National Park Service began planning to receive the property. The transfer took place in 2002.  <h2>Home to Schoodic Institute</h2> Today, the Navy base campus has been converted into the <a href=\"https://www.schoodicinstitute.org/\">Schoodic Institute</a>, a park partner. As a National Park Service <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/rlc/index.htm\">Research Learning Center</a>, the Schoodic Institute partners with the NPS to bring science and education to the public.",

Do you notice that they have the appearance of a chocolate chip cookie, with little chunks of different rocks embedded in the larger boulder? These rocks are called the Shatter Zone in Acadia, and to geologists they’re known as a <i>volcanic breccia.</i><br /> <br /> But hang on… <i>volcanic? </i>Do you see a volcano anywhere nearby? Probably not! The volcano that made these rocks existed on Mount Desert Island 420 million years ago – it has long since cooled and become the rock that makes up most of the island. The Cadillac Granite, the pink granite seen throughout much of Acadia, represents the ancient core of that volcano. The Shatter Zone, which we are looking at now, is the perimeter of that volcano’s caldera.<br /> <br /> A caldera is a volcanic crater, formed at the mouth of a volcano after it erupts. The rocks at the edge of the Mount Desert Island volcano crumbled into the empty space left by the magma after it erupted. The magma remaining in the volcano at that time cooling, but still molten – similar in consistency to a gel. When crumbled rocks fell into it, they got stuck in the magma. Because this magma was cooling, it didn’t melt the fallen chunks of rock completely, and that’s why we can still see those rocks stuck in the magma (which is now granite) of the Shatter Zone today.<br /> <br /> Geologists today use the Shatter Zone to help trace the ancient perimeter of the volcano because rocks only fell into the caldera around its edges. Using a geologic map, you can see that the Shatter Zone is represented by the dark brown crescent on the eastern coast of MDI. By studying the Shatter Zone, geologists have found that the caldera of this volcano would have been 10 miles wide – about five times the total distance of this hike!</p>",

It carries the carriage road over the new Stanley Brook motor road as well as the Stanley Brook watercourse and the Seaside Trail. It was the last bridge designed and built by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. on the carriage road system.<br /> <br /> Designed by Charles Stoughton and completed by S.F. Ralston, Stanley Brook Bridge is one of the few bridges at which landscape architect Beatrix Farrand’s plantings can still be seen, as much of her work on the carriage roads was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1947. Planting was begun by Mr. Miller, Rockefeller's gardener at his home \"The Eyrie\" who planted densely a variety of evergreens to block out views of the numerous roads converging at this point. Farrand concentrated on the he decorative plantings directly around the bridge, employing sentinel trees (maples and ashes) at the bases of the piers to frame the arches of the structure. Trees were also used to frame the approaches to the bridge from the carriage road, and also various mainly native shrubs were planted along the road sides to enhance the setting. This planting illustrates Farrand's expert use of the contrast between the naturalistic and formalistic landscape. Visiting the site in 1934, she commented how the plantings had \"improved the whole neighborhood.\" <br /> <br /> The triple-arch structure is 180 feet long, and 23 feet at the highest point, constructed of quarry-faced, random-laid ashlar granite over a reinforced-concrete substructure. The facade has random projecting blocks, the arches have slender radiating voussoirs, and the wingwalls have projecting stone scuppers. The parapet walls slope upward toward the crown of the center arch where they form a peak, and are capped with granite capstones and pierced with narrow, beveled embrasures above each arch. The parapet walls terminate in large engaged endposts with stepped sides and peaked capstones. A lookout is incorporated into the north wall at the west end of the bridge. <br /> <br /> The bridge was designed by new York Architect Charles W. Stoughton and constructed by Rockefeller's own crews under the direction of S.F. Ralston, superintendent of his Seal Harbor estate, at the cost of $23,928.32. Mr. Rockefeller was very pleased with the completed bridge and plantings stating that it was \"interesting to look at and well built.\"</p>",

    "bodyText": "In the state of Maine, 1947 is often referred to as the “The Year Maine Burned”. Acadia National Park and Mount Desert Island were not spared during this extremely dry year that saw more than 200,000 acres burn statewide in Maine.<br /> <br /> The local fire departments first received a report of smoke rising from the cranberry bogs nearby the local dump outside Bar Harbor in the afternoon of Friday October 17<sup>th</sup>, 1947. The direct cause of the fire is unknown but by<i> </i>October 21<sup>st</sup>, strong winds fanned the flames and the blaze spread rapidly quickly getting out of control engulfing over 2,000 acres on the eastern side of Mount Desert Island.<br /> <br /> <i></i>October 23<sup>rd</sup> saw the winds shift the fire’s trajectory towards the communities of Hulls Cove and Bar Harbor.<i> </i>The fire destroyed 67 seasonal estates along Bar Harbor’s famous “Millionaires’ Row” as well as 170 permanent homes and five large hotels in the area around downtown Bar Harbor.<br /> <br /> Local fisherman from nearby communities assisted with a mass evacuation of at least 400 people to safety by boat because all the roads leading out of Bar Harbor blocked by flames.  Eventually a path through Route 3 was bulldozed allowing cars carrying 2,000 people to journey to safety off the island.<br /> <br /> The fire continued to burn until it was declared under control on October 27<sup>th</sup>. Even weeks later, after rain and snow had fallen, the fire still smoldered below ground. The fire was not pronounced completely extinguished until November 14, nearly one month after it began. In the end, 17,188 acres burned on Mount Desert Island—10,000 of those acres in Acadia National Park.<br /> <br /> The majority of the Satterlee Estate was destroyed in the fire of 1947. Eleanor Satterlee came to visit for the summer of 1948. In 1949, the decision was made by the two Satterlee daughters, Eleanor and Mabel to donate the estate, all of Sand Beach and Great Head, to the National Park Service. They did so in honor of their mother Louisa, so this land would be protected in perpetuity for future generations of visitors to explore.<br /> <br /> The lasting effects from the fire are visible today. While the national park did conduct some salvage efforts and selective plantings to prevent soil erosion, most of the island’s restoration was undertaken by nature. Wind carried seeds back to burned areas. As you drive the park loop road notice the change in vegetation types that is especially visible on the sides of the mountains. Spruce and fir that reigned before the fire have given way to sun-loving trees, such as birch and aspen. But these deciduous trees (trees with leaves) are short-lived. As they grow and begin to shade out the forest floor, they provide a nursery for the shade-loving spruce and fir (native conifers or needle bearing tree species) that may eventually reclaim the territory.<br /> <br /> Fire has an important role in nature. It clears away mature growth, opening areas to the sun-loving species that are food for wildlife. The fire of 1947 increased diversity in the composition and age structure of the park's forests. It even enhanced the scenery. Today, instead of one uniform evergreen forest, we are treated to a brilliant mix of red, yellow, and orange supplied by the new diverse deciduous forests.",

Clara Barns Martin's 1867 'Guide Book for Mount Desert Island,' mentions 'Thunder Hole or Thunder Cave, a deep chasm into which with every returning wave the water rolls and swirls, and when wind and tide conspire, the wave is thrown against the overhanging rock with a blow that makes the whole cliff shake and the air tremble as with the crash of thunder. The wind should be south of east and the side just at the point to throw the wave under the rock. Failing this, there will be disappointment.\" In the early 1900s, the local Village Improvement Associations constructed hiking paths to the site. Later, roads followed, including the Park Loop Road in the 1930s.. <br /> <br /> In 1934, the park's first ranger station was constructed on the west side of the Thunder Hold parking lot by the New Deal-era Works Progress Administration (WPA). The 26x16 foot, one-story building is set on a stone foundation and features a hipped roof and vertical board and batten siding. The interior included a ranger's room with a stone fireplace and another room that served as a store. Tow large stones flank the steps into the building that were a part of the original design. A copper strip is visible above the door frame and the chimney with terra cotta pots can be seen from the front the building. The building was one of the first at Acadia designed in the NPS Rustic Design style and was inspired by regional architectural forms. In the late 1960s the building was converted into a concessioner's gift shop. In the 1970s, the roof was reconstructed and new restrooms were constructed in 1982. <br /> <br /> The park's 195 Master Plan identified the Thunder Hole as a major developed area in the park and every subsequent master plan followed. Additional facilities were added to the site including restrooms (later removed) in 1941. In the 1960s, walkway systems were constructed including wider paths, higher retaining walls, and the addition of more handrails. <br /> <br /> The current lower walkway system was completely reconstructed again in 1992-1993 and an accessible ramp with switchback was constructed.  <br /> <br /> The Thunder Hole area is on the National Register of Historic Places for its rustic design and New Deal-era history. ",

A roof shades the deck attached to the stable. A wooden box decorated with horseshoes of different sizes rests next to a white-shingled wall. Inside the box, grooming implements can be found along with a few books about horses. Next to the box, a tall ruler shows measurements using images of human hands. Text reads: \"A horse's height is measured in hands with each hand measuring 4 inches.\" The text encourages you to measure yourself in hands.

    "bodyText": "<p>At the Wild Gardens of Acadia, you can see over 400 native plant species in thirteen sections designed to represent natural plant communities found within Acadia National Park. Habitats such as mountain, heath, seaside, coniferous forest, and nine others are represented. The gardens serve as a living field guide and educational resource to familiarize one with native vegetation. All plants are labeled and grouped by habitat. The gardens are open seasonally every morning until dusk. There is no additional fee to view the gardens; you only need your park entrance pass.   </p> <h2>History of Wild Gardens of Acadia</h2> <p>In the early 1900s, Charles W. Eliot and George B. Dorr recognized the natural beauty of Mount Desert Island and the need for its preservation. Dorr purchased the Sieur de Monts Spring area in 1909 and named it the Wild Gardens of Acadia.<br /> <br /> On July 8, 1916, Sieur de Monts National Monument was established, and at this time encompassed 6,634 acres, including four lakes and ten mountains, within a contiguous boundary. George Dorr was appointed the park’s first superintendent, and that same year formally established the Wild Gardens of Acadia Corporation to acquire land for public use and for educational study and scientific research. He placed his private holdings in the corporation which included the Sieur de Monts Spring parcel and much of the Great Meadow, with the<br /> intention of donating them to the monument at a future date. Notably, the monument’s boundary did not include the Tarn, which had been transferred to the Trustees in May of the previous year.<br /> <br /> In 1918, the Wild Gardens of Acadia was recognized by the American Society of Landscape Architects. The following year, on February 16, 1919, Sieur de Monts National Monument became Lafayette National Park. Over the years, Dorr had apparently begun surveys for a “garden approach” to the entire Sieur de Monts Spring area. This approach corresponds to a 1926 donation of a north-south linear tract of land (Tract 11-114) that was conveyed from the Wild Gardens of Acadia Corporation, Sieur de Monts Spring Company, and George Dorr to the U.S. Government on May 1, 1926.<br /> <br /> On August 11, 1930, Tracts 11-113 (120.3 acres) and 11-120 (25.7 acres) encompassing the Great Meadow and the Sieur de Monts Spring area were transferred from George Dorr and the Wild Gardens of Acadia Corporation to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Land and easements associated with the Museum property, Tract 11-121 (2.3 acres), were transferred from the Sieur de Monts Spring Company to Lafayette National Park Museum of Stone Age Antiquities on July 22, 1930. On August 12, 1930, this same land and easements, and the right for<br /> expansion, was conveyed to the U.S. Government. Nearby, Tract 12-107 (32 acres) that encompassed the Tarn was transferred from the HCTPR to the U.S. Government on July 22, 1931 (Land Ownership Record, 1944).<br /> <br /> Over time, various attempts by Dorr and others led to multiple plans for paths and gardens in this area. In 1961, Superintendent Harold A. Hubler offered space to the Bar Harbor Garden Club to develop an exhibition garden dedicated to the display and propagation of the island’s native wild flowers. The gardens and their winding gravel paths were laid out just north of the spring building [Nature Center] amongst “a tangle of maples and blackberries” damaged in the 1947 fire. The project gestured to the many wild gardens plans envisioned by George Dorr. As part of the arrangement, the park agreed to maintain the irrigation system and provide supplies. In 1985, the Wild Gardens of Acadia was acknowledged as a “Significant Contribution to Horticulture” by the Garden Club of America.<br /> <br /> In 2010, the Wild Gardens of Acadia became an official committee of Friends of Acadia and formalized this new standing through a partnership with Friends of Acadia and Acadia National Park—ensuring continued success and support from the park as an educational resource. The Wild Gardens of Acadia committee received the park's Partnership Award in 2011 in recognition of the “Wild Gardens of Acadia Volunteers for 50 years of devoted stewardship” from the National Park Service.</p>",

Ernest Dane was a Massachusettes financier, philanthropist and Harvard University graduate. In 1909 he bought an estate in neighboring Seal Harbor. Helen Dane donated Wildwood Farm to the National Park Service. All of the structures except the barn were demolished by the park in 1958. <br /> <br /> But the name \"Wildwood\" was associated with the prior owners of the  farm of W. E. Hadlock and at least two prior owners. William E. Hadlock was a Lieutentant Colonel with the 28th Maine Infantry during the Civil War and was also a resident of Islesford on Little Cranberry Island. Hadlock had purchased the farm from the Jordan brothers (George an John of Jordan Pond and Jordan Stream). </p>",

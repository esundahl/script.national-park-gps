I found an old sandal, much fragmentary basketwork, rope, twine, and many corn cobs. They are of the small variety, and I found one small piece of obsidian....

    "audioDescription": "Beat the Heat Imagine calling the Sonoran Desert home - a place with limited water and summer temperatures over 110 degrees F ( 43 degrees C). How would you acclimate? The desert is home to various animals, who have adapted to overcome these challenges. To stay properly hydrated, animals will stay close to a water source, store water in fat reserves, or obtain water from the food they eat. Riparian areas, where there is a year-round water supply, are common areas to see desert wildlife. To maintain a comfortable body temperature, some animals are nocturnal, meaning they are active at night when air temperatures are cooler. Other animals are crepuscular, meaning they are active during dawn and dusk. During the day, animals will either burrow underground or rest in the shade. How have you adapted to the climate where you live? (Image of turkey vulture.) Turkey vulture, Catharteds aura, will urinate on its legs to keep cool. (Image of javelina.) Javelina, Pecari tajacu, rest in the shade during the day. (Image of kangaroo rat.) Kangaroo rats, Dipodomy meriiami, manufacture their water metabolically by eating dry seeds. They do not drink water. (Image of Gila monster.) Gila monster, Heloderma suspectum, stores water in fat reserves in its tail. (Image of tarantula.) Tarantula, Aphonpelma chalodes, burrows underground. (Image of jackrabbit.) Jackrabbit, Lepus californicus, can release heat from their big ears. (Image of mule deer.) Mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus, stay near water and are crepuscular. Seasonal Flights Birds, like other desert animals, have adapted to living in the Sonoran Desert. Some birds are year-round residents and depend on the riparian area and desert plants as a means for survival. Other birds are migratory and are only seen during certain parts of the year. Many migratory birds stop in the Tonto Basin during their flight due to the availability of water. (Image of Gila woodpecker.) Gila woodpecker, Melanerpes urophyialis, pecks a hole in the Saguaro cactus to build a cool, damp nest. (Image of cactus wren.) Camphlohynchus bruunneicalillus, builds its nest in a cactus to protect its young. (Image of hooded oriole.) Hooded oriole, Icterus cucullatus, migrates to preferred temperatures. (Image of Gambel's quail). Gambel's quail, Callipepla gambelii, changes food choices based on the season and obtains water from food.",

    "audioDescription": "Without medal, rubber, or plastic, what would you make your shoes out of? The people of the Tonto Basin utilized many different native plants grown in the wild for clothing, sandals, mats, and everyday tools. Many of the plants provide food, medicine, and materials for shelter. Every plant had a role in the Salado way of life. (Image of jojoba plant.) Some Native Americans used the jojoba bush to cure both skin rashes with the oil of the nut and stomach ailments by boiling the leaves into tea. (Image of jojoba beans.) (Image of Saguaro cactus spines). The Saguaro cactus has many useful parts. Ribs from dead saguaros were used in the constructions of cliff dwelling roofs, spines were used as needles, and the sweet fruit provided a summer treat.",

Some plants, like cacti and succulents, have extensive shallow root systems and are able to store substantial amounts of water to prepare for the dry seasons. Desert plants often have small leaves or waxy skin that reduces the amount of water lost through transpiration. Plants will grow on different hillsides based on the amount of sunlight available. More sunlight means higher temperatures, which increases water lost from the plants through their leaves. Sunlight also affects the temperature and amount of moisture in the soil.

What differences do see? The hillside on your left receives more sunlight, resulting in warmer soil with little moisture. The hillside on your right receives less sunlight, resulting in cooler soil with a higher moisture content. Story in the Rings (Image of wooden beam built into clay.) Dendrochronology is the science of tree ring dating. Archeologists can determine the age of an ancient site by taking a core sample from its wood beams.

Cotton, amaranth, corn, beans, and squash were introduced into the American Southwest from Mexico hundreds of years ago. In the 1300's, the Salado people in this area continued sowing fields in the Tonto Basin and building canals along the Salt River. Corn, beans, and squash, known as the three sisters, became their primary source of food. The three sisters were commonly grown together, because of the benefits each one provided. In addition, cotton provided material to weave, amaranth was used as a dye for cloth, and both provided a food source during droughts. (Image of cotton, amaranth, corn, beans, and squash together.) Cultivated gardens usually contained cotton, amaranth, corn, beans, and squash. Traditionally, they were planted together in sections rather than in separate fields. Corn provides a structure for the beans to grow around. (Image of corn stalk at top of triangle diagram.) Squash provides shade, preventing the loss of soil moisture. It also prevents weeds from growing. (Image of squash plant in lower right position of triangle diagram.) Beans provide nitrates for the soil to ensure future years of soil fertility.

These fragile walls are 700 years old.<br /> <br /> <em>(Image of prohibition sign depicting a dog paw print.)</em><br /> Keep your pets outside the dwelling. Pets leave behind scents that attract other animals.<br /> <br /> <em>(Image of prohibition sign depicting food and drink.)</em><br /> Eat outside of the dwelling. Food attracts rodents that dig under the walls.<br /> <br /> From the rocks to the plants, everything must stay where you find it. Every object helps to tell the story of the Monument. It is unlawful to take or deface any object from a National Park Service site. (36 CFR 2.1).</p> <h4>Angeline Mitchell </h4> <p><em>(Image of Angeline Mitchell.)</em><br /> Angeline Mitchell, the first school teacher in the Tonto Basin Area, is accredited with the first written record of this cliff dwelling in the year 1880. She describes in her journal the magnificent structures she and her students explored, noting the construction style of the dwellings, and imagining the lives of the ancient people who called this place home.<br /> <br /> \"It seems so strange to be chatting and laughing so gaily in a house built unknown centuries ago by people unlike us in appearance but who had known joy and grief, pleasure and pain same as our race of today who knows them, and who had laughed, cried, sung, dance, married, & died, mourned or rejoiced away in this once, populous town, or castle, or whatever one would call it!\" - December 12, 1880.</p>",

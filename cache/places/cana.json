    "bodyText": "Eldora was named for early residents, Ellen and Dora Pitzer the daughters of George Pitzer. Settlers came as treasure hunters, having purchased maps to hidden riches. Others came as carpenters, fishermen, beekeepers, and farmers. These hardy folks were met with harsh environments, lack of fresh water, mosquitos and summer heat.<br /> <br /> All depended on the shallow draft steamboats that served the inland waterways for transportation of goods and people. It played an important role in Florida’s interior development before roads and rail lines were built. When the railroad came to Edgewater the Eldora economy was transformed. The little town was no longer on the main trade route.<br /> <br /> Two years of killing frost in the 1890’s wiped out most of the citrus, causing residents to leave. By 1900 nearly all business on the island had ended. Some families stayed and made the turn from a farming community to a resort area for visitors seeking refuge from cold northern winters. ",
    "audioDescription": "The Eldora House is one of the only homes remaining from this once thriving community of Eldora. The home is a two story wooden structure with a third floor attic that has a widows peek look out at the top. The western facing front door opens up to the Mosquito Lagoon which as that time was the primary method of travel in the late 1800's to early 1900's. The home is surrounded by scrub oak trees and palms trees. Mangrove islands are locate close by in the lagoon. Birds chirping, wind blowing through the trees, waves crashing on the beach and boats motoring by may be heard here.",

    "bodyText": "The first A.M.E. church (African Methodist Episcopal Church) was one of the oldest structures, built in 1885 by the settlers of Nicodemus who held a deep connection to the church and religion. The congregation built the church using the limestone that was in the area as wood was hard to come by in the grasslands of western Kansas The church was occupied by two different congregations over the years, Mount Pleasant congregation worshiped in the building from 1885-1897. The A.M.E. domination worshiped in the church from 1910-1947 eventually the doors of the church closed due to declining membership. Remaining A.M.E members joined the 1st Baptist Church congregation. <b> </b><br /> <br /> The A.M.E. church received major restoration, the project entailed restoring the floors, walls, ceiling, and altar. As of 2021 the church is open for visitation with various exhibits and artifacts on display. ",
    "audioDescription": "The A.M.E church is a one room building 30 by 100 feet with a steep shingle roof. Stucco is plastered on outside of the limestone structure. On the front face of the church in large letters is A.M.E Church 1885. Through the double doors is a wooden floor with limestone hours. In the back of the church is a wooden altar. Small windows on the southern side of buildings with 3 metal stars placed above the windows. Outside the building is an interpretive wayside. Written on the way side. \" Leaning On The Lord The harsh Kansas prairie inspired the Nicodemus AME (African Methodist Episcopal) congregation even more to their faith. Rev Jerry Meyers and the five others organized the church in 1879. Members first met in dug outs and then in the First Baptist Church, Community Leader Rev. Meyers led the organization of the first school. 1885 Rev Charles brown and the forty members of the congregation raised funds for their own wooden Frame building ST. Paul’s AME Church. Fire destroyed the original Church Building in 1896. The congregation preserved and in 1010 They added the front foyer to the buildings at that time and the date 1885 was set over the door to commemorate Rev. Brown and the congregation’s first structure.\"",

    "bodyText": "The First Baptist Church has a unique history in Nicodemus. Church/religion was very important for the settlers of Nicodemus as the town was settled by several Preachers. The First Baptist Church was established in 1878, in the beginning the Nicodemus Colony members attended church services in a dugout. Members of the church when wanting to be baptized were baptized in a creek located on Thomas Johnson's Homestead north of town. Thomas Johnson was a deacon of the church and arrived with the first colony in September 17, 1877.  Eventually the congregation was established enough to build a small structured church. As the town grew the church grew and the congregation needed a larger building. A larger building was built in 1907 and the older generations tell the story how the larger church building was built around the smaller building and the smaller building was demolished piece by piece and removed out the door and windows of the newer church building. The congregation used that method so that they could continue to hold church services while the new church building was being built.The First Baptist Church was the first building in Nicodemus to receive electricity in early 1950. The congregation built a newer building to the North of the church in the 1970's. Currently, Nicodemus First Baptist Church is still in full operation, the church members meet Wednesday night for bible study and Sunday mornings for teachings.",
    "audioDescription": "Description of Baptist Church - The First Baptist Church sits on a 1/4 acre of open space, the square building is approximately 75-100 feet in height, it has a triangle pitched roof with wood shingles. The building has four windows that are all towards the front of the building. Inside the historic church it is a wide open space with the altar and pulpit towards the right of the church. The ceiling of the church is covered in a decorated tin material. Outside the Baptist Church is an interpretive wayside. Written on the way side. \"Sunday school prayer meetings gospel, singing, spirited preaching, church suppers and special events all graced the sanctuary of the First Baptist Church. Churches are the cornerstone of black communities throughout the US. Before Emancipation, restrictive laws often prohibited blacks from gathering in larger number except in churches. Rev. Samuel Roundtree, one of the five Nicodemus organizers and promoters recruited homesteaders from Baptist churches in Central Kentucky. Soon after arriving in the fall of 1877 Rev. SIlias Lee organized the Nicodemus First Baptist Church. At first the congregation worshipped in a dugout at Tom Johnson’s homestead north of town. Later they worshiped in a large e sod structure at this location. 1880 they built a large limestone church on the main street of the growing town. 1907 the Congregation substantially enlarged the church and the front entrance moved to the side of the building. The original church was incorporated within the new one.\"",

    "bodyText": "Nicodemus is the longest-lasting black homesteader colony in America.<br /> <br /> The history of Nicodemus starts at the end of the Civil War. Many former enslaved people began moving out of the south to make a living farming their own land. In 1877, six black entrepreneurs in Topeka, Kansas joined with a white developer to form the Nicodemus Town Company. They wanted to establish an all-black community utilizing the Town site Preemption Act of 1844 and the Homestead Act of 1862. The group selected a site in north-central Kansas in the Solomon River valley.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The first group of settlers arrived from Topeka. The company then recruited approximately 300 migrants from Kentucky. Many of these settlers left soon after they saw what was available in the town of Nicodemus. Within two years, 500 to 700 people had migrated to Nicodemus primarily from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> By 1879, the town had a general store, hotel, churches, livery stables, post office, and a real estate office. Some of the early structures including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/zachary-t-fletcher.htm\">Z. T. Fletcher's</a> general store began as dugouts or sod buildings. Nicodemus residents established Graham County’s first public school. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/william-kirtley.htm\">William Kirtley</a> and Francis Fletcher were two citizens who spearheaded the educating the community’s children. Town leaders gained political prominence in Graham County and Kansas politics.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The most important event in the town was Emancipation Day. It is still celebrated in late July with speeches, bands, games, sports, and food. Today this celebration is called Homecoming.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Many of the settlers filed homestead claims. By 1899 they had received 114 homestead patents, making them owners of 18,126 acres. The economic lifeblood of the community was farming the homesteads.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> By the mid-1880s, Nicodemus was a moderately prosperous settlement. Enjoying the highs when harvests were good but suffering lows when hit by bad weather or low prices. The population stabilized at around 300.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Two factors loomed large for the town’s future: obtaining a railroad line and becoming the county seat. Neither transpired, and many merchants left for nearby Bogue, the railhead. But while the town of Nicodemus declined after 1888, the farmers persevered.<br /> <br /> Nicodemus provided safety from the violence experienced by many in the South. It gave residents the opportunity to own land, build farms and a community, educate their children, and govern their own affairs.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> Nicodemus still stands as a small village and is designated as a National Historic Site of the National Parks Service.<br /> <br /> Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/home/black-homesteading-in-america.htm\">Black Homesteading in America</a>.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Fleeing from new forms of oppression that were emerging in the post-Reconstruction Era South, a group of African American settlers established the community of Nicodemus on the windswept plains of Kansas in 1877. Here they began turning the dense sod, building homes and businesses, and forging new lives for themselves.<br /> <br /> Established as an all black community, the founders of Nicodemus envisioned a town built on the ideals of independence and self-determination. The community experienced rapid social and economic growth in the early years and many speculated that Nicodemus would become a major stop for the railroad. It became clear by 1888, however, that the railroad and the predicted economic boom would not come. This did not mark the end of the great experiment that was Nicodemus, however. Although the population of the town itself dwindled to only a few dozen souls, many African American families stayed in the area, settling on farms in the surrounding township. From this time onward Nicodemus became a community of primarily black farm families. This living community is the only remaining all black town west of the Mississippi River that was settled in the 1800s on the western plains by former slaves.<br /> <br /> The U.S. Congress, recognizing the importance of Nicodemus' contribution to America's history, enacted legislation establishing Nicodemus National Historic Site as a unit of the National Park Service in November 1996. The legislation directs the NPS to cooperate with the people of Nicodemus to preserve its five remaining historic structures - First Baptist Church, African Methodist Episcopal Church, St. Francis Hotel, the First District School, and Nicodemus Township Hall - and keep alive the memory of the many roles African Americans played throughout the American West.<br /> <br /> Nicodemus National Historic Site preserves, protects, and interprets the only remaining western town established by African Americans during the Reconstruction Era following the Civil War. The town of Nicodemus is symbolic of the pioneer spirit of African Americans who dared to leave the only region they had been familiar with to seek personal freedom and the opportunity to develop their talents and capabilities. The site was named for a legendary African-American slave who purchased his freedom.</p>",

Another remembered, but unmarked grave is that of Amanuel Napue, son-in-law of Reverend John Samuels. According to descendants’ oral histories, famous scout and Wild West showman Buffalo Bill Cody shot Amanuel in the leg. The wound resulted in gangrene that led to his death. His burial was one of the earliest in the cemetery.",

In 1879 the town established the first organized school in the country with the title \"School District No. 1.\" Many different structures were used a schoolhouses such as sod dug outs, and the Saint Francis hotel. Due to many first settlers being born into slavery a large importance was put upon education especially reading and writing. Within a few years many settler's were literate with two news papers being printed within the town. The current school house was built in 1918 before closing in the 1960s due low enrollment numbers. The building was purchased by the American Legion in 1983. ",

    "bodyText": "The Saint Francis Hotel and private Switzer Family Residence was used for a variety of purposes throughout the Nicodemus history. The original owners were Zachary and Jenny Fletcher. The two bed room hotel was also used as the first post office, schoolhouse, general store and stage coach station. Later the hotel was used by the Switzer family as a family residence.<br /> <br /> The great plains and grasslands of Kansas lacks an easily accessible source of wood for building which lead to the hotel being made of limestone bricks. These lime stone bricks can viewed on the west side of the structure where the stucco has fallen away. Each brick is over twenty pounds and had to be hauled from quarries twenty miles away by Stockton, Kansas. <br /> <br /> Former Green Bay Packers player Veryl Switizer was raised in the residence in 1930s and 40s. Veryl later became community leader in preserving Nicodemus' historic buildings like the one he grew up in. Ora Switizer (1902-2009) who is considered the matriarch of Nicodemus lived and raised her family within the Saint Francis hotel. Today many Nicodemus residents remember Ora telling stories of her visiting dug outs as a young girl and watching the Nicodemus baseball team, the Nicodemus Blues.   <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The Saint Francis Hotel is a two-story building with a front porch and several small windows. The size is approximately 50 feet (15 meters) and 30 feet (9 meters long) The second floor has a slanted roof with a boarded window. The western side of the building has exposed limestone bricks that are bowing outward. Next to the Saint Francis hotel is an interpretive wayside. Written on the wayside: Eager for the word from loved ones back home people gathered at the Saint Francis Hotel when the mail wagon arrived. The right upright section of the buildings was the original limestone ST. Francis Hotel, Nicodemus’ first stone building along the main street. Civil War calvary veteran Zachary T. Fletcher and his wife Jenny came from Kentucky with the first Nicodemus settlers. Initially they were homesteading a few miles west of town. Then in 1881 hopeful that a railroad would promote business Fletcher and his brother Thomas built this hotel. The St. Francis was often full. Lodging for the homesteaders and travelers was hard to find. Jenny Fletcher prepared hot meals for hotel guests. She also ran a millinery (hat) shop and later served as postmaster.",

The location of the celebration was then changed to the Scruggs Grove. Beginning in the early 1930s, the Celebration transitioned to the townsite and the new township hall. In 1951, descendants celebrated for the last time in Scruggs Grove. Organizers eventually changed the name from Emancipation Day to Emancipation/Homecoming Celebration, which is still used today. The celebration now occurs the last weekend in July nearest to August 1st. In 2020, due to the Covid pandemic, planners hosted the first virtual Emancipation/Homecoming Celebration. In 1983, Mary Elizabeth Gage spoke for all descendants, saying, “Something we looked forward to from one year to the next. I think we were as anxious about the Emancipation Celebration affair…as we were about Christmas.”",

    "bodyText": "Township Hall is a magnificent limestone building that was built in 1939. The bricks were all hand sawn and it took over two years to complete the building. After it was built the Township Hall acted as the seat of government for the town of Nicodemus. In this building the people of Nicodemus held their town council meetings, elections, and other town events.<br /> Having been denied self governance under slavery and later in the post-reconstruction era, this building symbolizes the freedom of the people of Nicodemus to choose their own representatives and let their voice be heard.<br /> Today the Township Hall acts as the defacto visitor center where visitors can learn all about Nicodemus",

    "bodyText": "You are no longer in the Nicodemus Township. You are in Wildhorse Township. The last of the three large groups that migrated west to Kansas to settle at Nicodemus arrived in spring of 1879. Earlier settlers homesteaded land in and around Nicodemus, compelling these newcomers to locate farther from town. Some of the homesteaders settled 4 miles south of here and called their area of Wildhorse Township Kebar after the local post office. This area had a cemetery and school but not a church. However, Reverend John Samuels who organized the group that settled here was an ordained Christian minister and held services in his home for family members. Rev. Samuels, his family, and others arrived in prairie schooners rather than by train from Leavenworth. Napue, Samuels, Craig, Sadler, Garland, Hall, and Travis are common family names of those who resided in this region that teemed with native grasses and natural springs. Area explorers can still view remnants of the Napue Homesteads, one directly across from the other on a hill 4 miles south on Road 360, south of the Samuel cemetery.",

After milions of years the sand turned into sandstone. With more time and pressure the sandstone was then squished and cooked into quartzite. Look at the sediment building up on the ground next to the sign. Do you think the rocks could turn back into sand? How? As you keep hiking up the trail feel the different textures of the rocks.",

It marks the start of what author Henry David Thoreau called the \"Great Beach,\" an uninterrupted sandy coastline stretching north for over 20 miles. Coast Guard is a prime swimming beach during the summer season.<br /> <br /> From Memorial Day through mid-September, the primary parking area for this beach is at Little Creek, located a short distance west of the beach on Nauset Road. An open- air shuttle provides transportation to the beach. During the summer, parking at the small lot on the beach is restricted to local residents and vehicles displaying handicap placards. There is a seasonal pet prohibition on the south side of the beach to allow for nesting and migrating shorebirds.</p> <p>Coast Guard Beach is named for the old white Coast Guard building that still stands on the dune above the beach. Nesting and migrating shorebirds share the sand with beachgoers, and seals and sharks are at home in the waters just offshore.</p>",

Today, Fort Hill is maintained as an open grass field as it would have looked in the mid to late 1800s when Captain Edward Penniman owned the land as a farm. There is a one-mile loop trail around the open field with two parking lots. The upper parking lot overlooks Nauset Marsh, a grassy, open marsh land that changes with the tides. There are some log stairs and slopes along the one-mile trail. This is a great habitat for birds with many marshy bushes surrounding the landscape.",

Head of the Meadow Beach in North Truro has the distinction of being located at the \"wrist\" of the Cape, where the landform just begins to curl back toward the mainland US.<br /> <br /> This location is a place of dynamic shifting sands, with bars often forming off the main beach on which herds of seals lounge at low tide. The broad sandy beach offers excellent shorebird nesting habitat, particularly for the Federally-threated piping plover. As a result, during much of the summer season, the beach is closed to pets.<br /> <br /> The wreck of the <em>Frances</em>, which sank in a December gale in 1872, may still be seen here at low tide. United States Life Saving Service men dragged a whaleboat from the bay across the Cape to the outer beach and rescued all aboard. The captain, who died several days later from the effects of exposure, is buried in Truro.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Highland Light Station, also known as Cape Cod Light, is located on Outer Cape Cod within Cape Cod National Seashore in North Truro. Commissioned by George Washington and established in 1797 as the 20th light station in the United States, the original 45-foot tall wooden tower and keeper's dwelling were built more than 500 feet from the edge of a 125-foot-tall clay cliff. A new brick lighthouse was erected near the original tower in 1831. The present 66-foot-tall brick light tower, keeper's house, and generator shed replaced the previous structures in 1857. An enclosed walkway connects the tower and the one-and-one-half-story, L-shaped, Queen-Anne-style keeper's dwelling.</p> <p>Erosion of the steep cliff throughout the years brought the present light station around 100 feet from the cliff's edge by the early 1990s. Using funds raised by the Truro Historical Society combined with state and Federal grants, Highland Light Station was successfully moved 450 feet back to safer ground. After the 18-day move, the light was relit on November 3, 1996, and is an active aid to navigation. Today, the keeper's house features a gift shop and museum exhibits and a dedicated staff provides tours of the tower.</p> <p>The naturalist and author Henry David Thoreau visited Highland Light several times in the 1850s. Thoreau found the lighthouse \"a neat building, in apple pie order.\"</p> <p>In 1864, Thoreau wrote an essay for Atlantic Monthly on the history of the Highland Light. In this excerpt, he describes the power of the Light:</p> <p><em>\"The keeper entertained us handsomely in his solitary little ocean house. He was a man of singular patience and intelligence, who, when our queries struck him, rang as clear as a bell in response. The light-house lamp a few feet distant shone full into my chamber, and made it bright as day, so I knew exactly how the Highland Light bore all that night, and I was in no danger of being wrecked... I thought as I lay there, half-awake and half-asleep, looking upward through the window at the lights above my head, how many sleepless eyes from far out on the ocean stream -- mariners of all nations spinning their yarns through the various watches of the night -- were directed toward my couch.\"</em></p>",

    "bodyText": "<h3>The Birth of an Idea</h3> <p>The experiments of Heinrich Hertz inspired the idea. This German physicist first demonstrated the existence of electric and magnetic waves, and with this revelation young Guglielmo Marconi began dreaming of a way to send messages from transmitter to receiver without the aid of wires. In 1894 Marconi retreated to a top floor laboratory of his family’s Villa Grifone near Bologna, Italy, and at the age of twenty began his experiments in earnest. At first, Marconi used homemade equipment, testing and repeatedly modifying it, each time stretching to greater limits the distance that signals could be received from a transmitter. First it was 30 feet. Then it was one mile. Then it was twenty and fifty miles. By 1901, Marconi achieved a range of 200 miles. Wireless telegraphy was suddenly the rage of Europe – and then of America.<br /> <br /> On December 12, 1901 in St. John’s, Newfoundland, Marconi raised a kite with an antenna dangling from it. He sought to prove that radio waves could cross the Atlantic. Through that hanging wire he heard the anticipated signal from across the ocean. The first transatlantic signal from England had been detected.</p> <h3>Spanning the Ocean</h3> <p>For Marconi the ‘great thing’ was to transmit wireless signals across the Atlantic. He built stations at Poldhu, England, Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and South Wellfleet, Massachusetts. At this stage of wireless technology relatively long electromagnetic waves were used as signals. Transmitting great distances, therefore, required great sensitivity of receivers and tremendous power. Originally, huge rings of masts were installed to support the needed antennas. When storms destroyed them, they were replaced by sets of four wooden towers, 210 feet in height. Power requirements were tremendous. Keroseneburning engines produced 2,200 volts. When fed to a Tesla transformer, the voltage was stepped up to 25,000 volts – the energy needed to transmit longwave signals so far. It was from the Glace Bay station that the first successful two-way transatlantic wireless test message was sent on December 17, 1902.</p> <h3>Impacting Lives</h3> <p>January 18, 1903 the first public two-way wireless communication between Europe and America occurred. With elation, communiques from President Theodore Roosevelt and King Edward VII were translated into international Morse code at the South Wellfleet and English stations, respectively, and were broadcast.<br /> <br /> Ocean-going vessels quickly adopted Marconi apparatus to receive news broadcasts, and soon ship-to-shore transmittals were a major operation. Business and social messages could be sent for fifty cents a word. The South Wellfleet station became the lead North American facility for this function. The station’s effectiveness was limited however, so broadcasts were made between 10 pm and 2 am when atmospheric conditions were best.<br /> <br /> This brought little enthusiasm from local residents, who endured the sounds of the crashing spark from the great three-foot rotor supplied with 30,000 watts. The sound of the spark could be heard four miles downwind from the station. Eventually, the novelty of wireless telegraphy waned. However, the need for communication at sea remained high. Effective communication resulted in numerous sea rescues, culminating in the Carpathia&#’;s Wellfleet transmitter continued in commercial use. Skilled telegraphers sent out messages at the rate of 17 words a minute, and station CC (Cape Cod) served in effect as the first “Voice of America.”</p> <h3>The End of an Era</h3> <p>The demise of the South sparkgap station was inevitable. The sea cliff was eroding three feet each year, threatening the eastern-most towers with collapse. The station was closed in 1917 by the Navy to ensure security and news censorship during World War I. New inventions were making spark-gap transmission obsolete. The station was never reopened and in 1920 it was scrapped. The barn-red towers were dismantled, useful equipment was salvaged, and the buildings, once filled with the excitement and sounds of communication, were abandoned. Old CC was replaced by Wellfleet in Chatham, and it served as the most heavily used ship-to-shore radio station on the East Coast until its closure in 1993.</p> <h3>A Changed World</h3> <p>The early 20th century was an era of new achievements and new horizons. Wireless communication affected the world in many ways. It heightened interest in events beyond the bounds of daily contact. It affected national unity. It raised new possibilities of what could be accomplished. It brought new efficiency to business — and to warfare. WCC spent his life researching communications electronics, and his work yielded many improvements in wireless. Most significant, however, was the foundation he created for developments in radio, radar, microwaves and cellular communication. Upon his death, all wireless around the world was temporarily silenced in his honor. No one had ever received such recognition, and no one has received it since.</p> <h3>A Century Later</h3> <p>In the early 21st century we look back at a remarkable sequence of events. Communications have evolved from the speed of horse and rail to the speed of light and electricity. Most of the former South Marconi site is gone now, eroded by the relentless pounding of the Atlantic Ocean. The surrounding area is preserved as part of Cape Cod National Seashore. Though few reminders of the site remain, one can still stand on an Atlantic cliff on a winter day in South Wellfleet, Massachusetts and reflect on the event that sparked the birth of global wireless communication.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Penniman House was built at the end of the Victorian Age and styled after the French Second Empire Period (1855-1870). The house was designed by an unknown architect, built by local artisans using the finest available materials, and sited on land purchased from Captain Penniman’s father.<br /> <br /> Completed in 1868 for the family’s use while the Captain continued his whaling career, the house included every known comfort and many innovative ideas. The foundation was laid on the existing ground, the basement walls built up, and fill brought in to raise the surrounding land by eight feet. This provided excellent drainage, ensuring a dry basement, and raised the windows of the cupola high enough for the Captain to observe the ships passing in both Cape Cod Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.<br /> <br /> The first floor contains a parlor, sitting room, dining room, kitchen and pantry. A center hall divides these rooms and contains the stairs to the second floor. A rear door gives access to the kitchen and the back stairs.<br /> <br /> Upstairs, four bedrooms are separated by a center hall. A small bathroom and stairs to the attic and cupola are at the rear.<br /> <br /> Two chimneys served the wood/coal stoves in the eight rooms. By 1897, a coal-fired furnace was installed in the basement, with pipes running to the parlor, sitting room and dining room. Floor grills are still visible in each of the rooms. The stoves continued to be used as supplementary heat in the spring and fall. About 1915, all the stoves except the kitchen range were removed, and the three-pipe furnace was replaced by a central coal-fired warm air furnace in the basement with a floor grill in the center hall. By 1940, the coal furnace was replaced by the existing oil furnace.<br /> <br /> A novel water collection system supplied the kitchen and bathroom. Drinking water came from a deep well in the rear yard. This house had the first kitchen and bath with indoor plumbing in Eastham and the first indoor flush toilet in town.<br /> <br /> Carpeting, stained glass windows, fine woodwork, running water and an efficient heating system made it one of the finest homes in town.<br />  <br /> The Penniman family occupied this fine home for nearly one hundred years, except for when the captain was at sea or when Mrs. Penniman took one or another of the children along on one of the whaling voyages.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Penniman’s family occupied three homes adjacent to the Penniman house. Her parents’ home was located where the parking lot is today. Sylvanus Knowles owned the house across the road from the Penniman house, and Seth Knowles had the big house at the bend in the road where the road ascends Fort Hill. The Knowles family farmed the land between Fort Hill and Skiff Hill to the north. Some of this land was originally given to Reverend Treat, the first minister in Eastham, and before that, had a long history of Native American use.<br /> <br /> After the Captain’s death in 1913, Mrs. Penniman and their daughter, Betsey, continued to live in the home. Mrs. Penniman’s died in 1921. Betsey Penniman, who never married, stayed around and raised her niece, Irma. Upon Betsey’s death in 1957, the home was left to Irma Penniman Broun. Irma and her husband sold the house with twelve acres to the National Park Service in 1963 when the Cape Cod National Seashore was formed.<br /> <br /> After the sons, Eugene and Edward, had completed their careers, they retired to the home in Eastham until they died. All are buried in Evergreen Cemetery, Eastham.</p> <h3>Architecture</h3> <p>The Penniman House was built by Captain and Mrs. Edward Penniman in 1868. The most conclusive documentation for this date of construction is the entries in Captain Edward Penniman’s account book for the expenses he incurred building the house from June 17 through December 8, 1868. Original drawings and specifications for the house also exist; unfortunately, they bear neither the signature of the architect nor a date. The last two pages of the specifications, where the date and name of the architect probably were written, have been lost.<br /> <br /> The Penniman House is a 2.5 story, wood-frame structure with a mansard roof. The mansard roof is the characteristic feature of French Second Empire style architecture in mid-19th century America.<br /> <br /> Although the architect of the Penniman House remains unknown, it seems likely that a Boston architect prepared these drawings and specifications. The theory that the plans for the house were either brought by the Captain from France, or ordered by him directly from France, is not supporte by any evidence. There are no records of Captain Edward Penniman ever traveling to France. From September 11, 1864, to April 2, 1868-the years immediately preceding the building of the house-Penniman served as Captain of the Minerva, and was on a whaling voyage around the world.<br /> <br /> The master builder of the Penniman House was Nathaniel Nickerson. His name is written on the back of one of the original drawings of the house, suggesting that they were the drawings and specifications from which he worked. Nathaniel Nickerson was also the most highly paid of the men who worked on the construction of the house.</p> <h3>Setting</h3> <p>The property that Captain Penniman purchased from his father in 1867 consisted of approximately twelve acres of land, on which were located a dwelling house, two barns, and several outbuildings.<br /> <br /> By 1880, however, all of the pre-1867 structures had disappeared. The earliest photograph of the property shows only the present house and the mansard-roofed barn built by the Pennimans in 1880. The old house, barn, and woodhouse thus must have been taken down between 1878 and 1880.<br /> <br /> Soon after the barn was built, a greenhouse was constructed along the north wall of the courtyard. It was a rectangular structure of wood and glass that extended along the full length of the courtyard’s north stone wall. With the building of this greenhouse, Captain Penniman appears to have completed his master plan for the property; all of the old buildings had been demolished and three new structures erected.<br /> <br /> In the 1920’s, the greenhouse was destroyed in a hurricane; it was not rebuilt. With this exception, the property retains its late 19th-century site plan.</p> <h3>Interior</h3> <p>The interior layout consists of four rooms on the first floor, two on each side of a central hall, four bedrooms and a bathroom on the second floor, a finished bedroom in the attic, and a cupola above. The interior woodwork and finishes are ornate and of high quality. Windows in the southwest parlor, northwest parlor, and dining room have molded, recessed panels below them extending from window apron to baseboard. The front stair has a handsome mahogany newel, handrail, and turned balusters. Doors on both the first and second stories have fine, hand painted grained finishes. The northwest parlor retains the design scheme applied when the flocked wallpaper and ceiling paper were hung in 1885.<br /> <br /> The house was built with interior plumbing. The kitchen contained two sinks, and a full bath was located on the second story. Water was supplied to this system by two cisterns, one located in the attic and the other underground at the northeast corner of the house. The kitchen retains its original marble sink and cabinet. The original heat source for the house was eight wood or coal stoves. They stood in front of the marble mantles in each of the rooms, and were piped directly into the two chimneys. In the 1890’s, a three-pipe, coal-fired furnace was installed to supplement the stoves. Floor grills are still visible in the parlor, sitting room and dining room. In the early 1900’s, the furnace and all the stoves (except the kitchen range) were replaced by a central coal-fired warm air furnace with a floor grill in the center hall. Later, the coal furnace was replaced by the existing oil furnace.<br /> <br /> When first built, the house was lighted with kerosene lamps. Electricity was introduced in the 1930s, but most of it was removed when the house was restored.<br /> <br /> In the 1980’s, the National Park Service installed reproduction wallpaper based on original designs documented by photographs and physical remainders. A collection of some one hundred glass plate negatives of turn-of-the-century scenes of the house and family serve to allow visitors to the house to envision how rooms were furnished and life was lived in the Penniman family days.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>An 1836 petition by Eastham residents concerned about loved ones at sea caused the Boston Marine Society to recommend to the United States Congress the construction of the Nauset Lights. Congress granted $10,000, and the contract was awarded to Winslow Lewis, the lowest bidder at $6549.</p> <p>Three 15-foot high masonry towers were built. The lights soon gained the nickname “The Three Sisters” because from sea they looked like women in white dresses with black hats.</p> <p>Cape Cod shores change quickly. The National Lighthouse Board ordered three new moveable wooden towers to be built thirty feet inland from the original masonry ones.</p> <p>The new towers stood twenty-two feet tall; the lantern housing added an additional seven feet. The old towers were allowed to fall into the Atlantic.</p> <p>Advances in technology, the continuing erosion of Nauset cliffs, and the cost of maintaining three lights, prompted a major change at the Nauset Light station.</p> <p>In 1911, the center tower was moved away from the cliff edge and attached to the 1875 keeper’s house. The other two towers were set aside until a decision could be reached about their future.</p> <p>The fourth-order Fresnel lens in the remaining tower was now mounted on a ball bearing revolver, making the light flash three times every ten seconds.</p> <p>The decommissioned two sisters were sold at a public auction to Helen M. Cummings for $3.50! The Cummings family first moved them to a site near the old French Cable station, before making some repairs.</p> <p>In 1920, the towers were moved onto Cable Road, and adjoined with a room. The “Twin Lights Cottage” was subsequently used as a summer cottage and a dance studio, until the towers were sold to the National Park Service in 1965.</p> <p>After many years of service, the center tower fell into disrepair. The Lighthouse Bureau decided to replace it with one of the former Chatham “twin lights” that was no longer in use. This iron and brick tower was moved, repainted and stands today as the latest in a lineage of Nauset Lights.</p> <p>Once decommissioned, the last of the Three Sisters towers was sold to Albert Hall, who turned it into a cottage.</p> <p>The National Park Service purchased the center tower in 1975 with a plan to reunite it with the other two towers. The three are placed in their original orientation on a plot of land on Cable Road.</p> <p>Restoration took place through the 1980s, and the site opened for its first public tour in 1989.</p> <p>Today one can visit the Sisters and marvel at the remarkable journey that brought them their location on Cable Road in Eastham.</p>",

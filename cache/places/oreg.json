Often, emigrants would spend several days here, waiting for the swollen waters of the river to drop to levels that were safe for fording. They found the area picturesque, with the spring originating in an unusual rock formation and falling over a rock ledge into a pool below.<br /> <br /> Emigrants carved their names in the rocks surrounding the spring, and many of these carvings are still visible. The ill-fated Donner Party camped here in 1846 and gave the spring its name. It was also the location of the Donner Party's first recorded death, Sarah H. Keyes, who died from consumption.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>Edwin Bryant, traveling with the ill-fated Donner-Reed Party, wrote a detailed description of the spring on May 27, 1846:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We found a large spring of water, as cold and pure as if it had just been melted from ice. It gushed from a ledge of rocks, which composes the bank of the stream, and falling some ten feet, its waters are received into a basin. . . . A shelving rock projects over this basin, from which falls a beautiful cascade of water, some ten or twelve feet. The whole is buried in a variety of shrubbery of the richest verdure. . . . Altogether it is one of the most romantic spots I ever saw. . . . We named this the 'Alcove Spring' and future travelers will find the name graven on the rocks, and on the trunks of the trees surrounding it.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(6 miles South of Marysville on the East River Road)</p> <p>Today, the spring is part of a 300 acre park. To reach it, follow the quarter mile, easy trail that starts at the parking lot. The park also contains several other hiking trails. </p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.visitmarysvilleks.org/attraction/alcove-spring/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/alcove-spring-exhibits-audio-description.htm\">Exhibit Audio Description available</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Alcove Spring. 367 words<br /><br />As you enter this gravel parking area from the road, a brown sign to the left reads, \"Alcove Spring Park, Independence Crossing, Oregon and California National Historic Trails.\" On the right side of the parking area is a lean-to structure with stone foundations and wood-shingle siding. Past the lean-to, a foot trail leads down the wooded slope. A sign tells us the path leads to Alcove Spring. To the left of the path a stone marker reads, \"Oregon Trail Memorial Garden dedicated to Gregory M. Franzwa, 1926 to 2009. Friend of Alcove Spring.\"<br /><br />Inside the lean-to are several informational panels, a map of the area showing the various hiking trails, a register for guests to sign and a donation box. One sign tells us, \"Alcove Spring Park consists of more than 200 acres of native prairie and timber land maintained for the preservation of this historic camping ground on the Oregon-California trail and for the enjoyment of our visitors. The park is owned and maintained by the Alcove Spring Preservation Society. Visitors are encouraged to take the short walk up to Alcove Spring and Naomi Pike Falls, and to follow the walking trails across the rest of the park area.\"<br /><br />Another sign discusses well-known travelers believed to have camped here, including the Bidwell-Bartelson party, the missionaries Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, John Charles Fremont and Kit Carson, and the Donner-Reed party.<br /><br />Another sign tells us that this area was part of the tall-grass prairie with Big Bluestem, Indiangrass and Switchgrass which grow up to 7 feet tall. Also, the Alcove Spring property was privately owned until 1993 when it was purchased by the Alcove Spring Historical Trust. It is on the National Register of Historic Places and a certified Historic Site on the Oregon National Historic Trail.<br /><br />Another sign discusses the hiking trails and tells us that across the road is a marker to honor Sarah Keynes, who died here. Just past the marker in the meadow are wagon swales. A few hundred south of the parking lot and across the road is an overlook of a field where a faint trace of the old river channel of the Big Blue River is visible.",

    "audioDescription": "Alcove Spring Swales. 337 words<br /><br />On the other side of the road from the parking lot at Alcove Spring, a path leads through an opening in a split rail fence and veers slightly to the right across a grassy area dotted with trees. The path crosses several noticeable swales then up a short bank with irregular stone steps. At the top of the slope is a large stone marked placed by the Daughters of the American Revolution to honor Sarah Handley Keyes who died at this campground.<br /><br />The path leads past the marker to a stone bench and two wayside signs. A few yards to the left of the signs are two more, clearly visible swales, going down the slope to the left to be lost to sight in the trees. A small brown sign in between the swales reads, \"National Historic Trails, Original Route.\" Arrows pointing to the left read, \"Oregon City, Oregon, 1853 and Sacramento, California, 1821 miles.\" An arrow pointing to the right reads, \"Independence Missouri, 179 miles.\" In that direction, up the slope is a grassy meadow.<br /><br />The left-hand wayside is titled \"The 1840s American Dream.\" It tells us that 100 members of the Donner and Reed wagon train waited here for several days for the heavily flooded Big Blue River to subside. While they camped, Sarah Keyes, James Reed's mother-in-law, whose health had been failing, died on May 29, 1846. She was buried and a large gray stone fashioned into a tombstone.<br /><br />The other wayside sign is titled \"A Quiet and Restful Place.\" It tells us that many wagon trains left Missouri in mid-April to mid-May in order to cross the high western mountains before snow arrived. This meant dealing with rivers and streams flooded from heavy spring thunderstorms. Nearly a hundred emigrant wagons crowded this meadow for several days in May 1846 waiting to ford. Emigrants found Alcove Spring a place with good drinking water, timber for building fires, forage for livestock and wild game to subsidize their food supply.",

Waddell who joined Majors in an attempt to gain a government contract to supply western forts.<a href=\"#2\">[2]</a> Already an experienced Santa Fe Trail dealer, Majors had the knowledge and equipment, while Russell and Waddell had the capital, to secure the government contract. For a short time, the company had a “virtual monopoly of the army freighting business in the west and southwest.”<a href=\"#3\">[3]</a> <br /> <br /> The 300-acre farmstead was dissected by the westernmost US border, making part of the property outside US jurisdiction and, thus, untaxable. The company’s barns, mule sheds, grazing lands, wagon and blacksmith shops, and other business-related entities were located on the portion of property located in the Kansas Territory.<a href=\"#4\">[4]</a> A caravan camp was used to load the heavy freight wagons which would travel the trails.<a href=\"#5\">[5]</a> <br /> <br /> The home was built in 1856, most likely using the labor of enslaved people.<a href=\"#6\">[6]</a>  The “T” shaped floorplan with recessed front porch makes it a unique iteration of the Greek revival style in Kansas City.<a href=\"#7\">[7]</a>  Today, it is one of the oldest buildings in Kansas City, as one of only 4 pre-Civil War buildings left standing.<a href=\"#8\">[8]</a> Though the house remains, many of the other original structures are gone and the land has been divided into distinct plots.

Johnston, Majors’s great grand-daughter, travelled to visit her ancestral home and found the house abandoned. She bought the house in 1932 and, for the next forty years, worked to preserve the property. In 1984 the Alexanders Majors House Museum was opened to the public for tours and events. In 2010 the house partnered with the John Wornall House and Museum to create one nonprofit dedicated to preserving both properties.  </p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(8201 State Line Road (east side of road near 85th Street), Kansas City)<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.wornallmajors.org/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <br /> <br />   <div> <p id=\"ftn1\"><em><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Marc Simmons, Following the Santa Fe Trail: A Guide for Modern Travelers (Santa Fe, NM: Ancient City Press, 1984), p. 61.</em></p> <p><em><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Martha Kusiak, “Alexander Majors House,” National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination Form.

    "audioDescription": "Ash Hollow State Historical Park. 322 words<br /><br />The parking lot for the visitor center at the Ash Hollow State Historical Park sits on top of a hill. From here you can look out over the surrounding rolling terrain. The countryside is covered primarily with low vegetation - grasses and meadow plants. Dark green conifers are scattered across the landscape with an occasional grove of deciduous trees.<br /><br />A median sits in the middle of the parking lot with a Nebraska Historical Marker. The sign reads, \"Ash Hollow was famous on the Oregon Trail. A branch of the trail ran northwestward from the Lower California Crossing of the South Platte River a few miles west of Brule and descended here into the North Platte Valley. The hollow, named for a growth of ash trees, was entered by Windlass Hill to the south. Wagons had to eased down its steep slope by ropes.<br /><br />\"Ash Hollow with its water, wood and grass was a welcome relief after the arduous trip from the South Platte and the travelers usually stopped for a period of rest and refitting. An abandoned trappers cabin served as an unofficial post office where letters were deposited to be carried to the â€˜States' by eastbound travelers. The graves of Rachel Pattison and other emigrants are in the nearby cemetery.<br /><br />\"In 1855 a significant fight, commonly called the Battle of Ash Hollow, occurred at Blue Water Creek northwest of here. General Harney's forces sent out to chastise the Indians after the Grattan Massacre of 1854 here attacked Little Thunder's band of Brule Sioux while the Indians were attempting to parley, killed a large number and captured the rest of the band.\"<br /><br />The visitor center is a one-story building set lower than the level of the parking lot. The sidewalk slopes down to the door. The building has vertical, beige-colored siding with tan accents. Restrooms are located along the outside wall to the right of the entrance.",

    "audioDescription": "Ash Hollow State Park- Windlass Hill Area. 400 words<br /><br />Where the entrance road to Windlass Hill turns off the highway is a turnout with access to a reconstructed sod house. From the road, a pass through the fence leads across a small pasture and through a gate shaped like a wheel to the house itself. The house, although open to visitors, is deteriorating and there is loose debris on the floor. To the left of the house is a Nebraska Historical Marker in the middle of a group of large, roughly shaped stones. The sign tells us that the stones are the remains of the homestead dwelling of Reverend Dennis B. Clary. Using a horse-drawn cart, he hauled stone to this site for a two-room house. For years, it marked the location of Windlass Hill. The area around the house was used by early travelers to repair damages caused by the hazardous trip down Windlass Hill.<br /><br />From the parking lot a sidewalk leads around to the left along the base of the hill through tall bushy junipers. Standing where it curves to the left, several rutted trails can easily be seen coming down the hill to the west. From that point, just behind you another sidewalk leads to a stylized wagon made of two parallel stone walls topped with metal arches. There may be a lip at the top of the concrete ramp leading up into the structure. On one side are two large information signs. The one on the left is titled \"Rough Going.\" It tells us that many stories are built around the idea that wagons were let down this hill using a windlass or, perhaps, a snubbing post. No historical or archeological evidence has been found for the use of such a device. At the lower left corner of this sign is a model of a rough-lock wagon brake. Feel free to touch. By hooking this through the spokes, it slowed the wagon by making the wheels drag on the ground.<br /><br />The other sign is called \"Wagons in the West.\" It has line drawings of several wagon styles. The Conestoga was a heavy freight wagon, not much used on the Oregon Trail. Another style was the six-mule Army wagon. Another drawing shows a smaller covered wagon pulled by a team of 6 oxen commonly used by the emigrants. The wagons all have similar shapes.",

Just beyond the sign and junction is a fee parking lot and portable toilet (in season). The Barlow Road crosses the parking lot. Through the opening of the trees on the uphill side of the lot, the Barlow Road segment of the Oregon National Historic Trail intersects the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, a long-distance hiking trail extending between Canada and Mexico. To reach the trailhead to the Pioneer Woman’s Grave, turn toward the downhill side of the lot and walk through a large opening in the trees. A sign shows the way.

Also, in a letter to his sister, William Glasgow, a Santa Fe trader, stayed overnight with the Barnes in 1846. A few days later a Susan Magoffin and her maid also stayed overnight with the Barnes Family.

    "audioDescription": "Bedlam Ruts. 363 words<br /><br />From the parking lot, a path leads up a slight slope through scrubby pastureland. The path is fairly smooth, although it is dirt with fine gravel mixed in. Along with mixed grasses and yucca plants, there are tiny prickly pear cacti with flat, rounded pads covered with spines. The path ends at the top of the rise where a small fenced enclosure protects a small sign. Large logs on either side of the path here serve as benches. On the far side of the fenced enclosure, a swale crosses from right to left, about 10 feet wide and perhaps 3 feet deep. Feel free to move past the fence on the left side and into the swale.<br /><br />The sign is titled, \"The Journey West Continues.\" Text reads, \"'We proceeded westward from Fort Laramie and encamped outside the boundaries of Uncle Sam.' So wrote Dr. J.S. Shepard in 1851 as he began the second leg of his journey west. â€˜To leave Fort Laramie was to cast off all ties with civilization. It was an alien land,' he noted.<br /><br />\"The emigrants' elation at reaching the civilization of the fort after 650 miles of monotonous, difficult overland travel was soon tempered by the realization that even more troublesome trail conditions lay ahead over the final two-thirds of the journey. â€˜Here comes the ascent to the Rocky Mountains,' wrote an apprehensive Cornelius Conway at mid-century.<br /><br />\"To lighten their loads many travelers cast off thousands of dollars worth of food and equipment. This was especially true of the â€˜49ers' who, in their haste to reach the gold fields often invested little effort in planning their trip. Joseph Berrien reached Fort Laramie early, May 30, 1849, yet still referred to it as â€˜Camp Sacrifice' because of the large quantities of abandoned gear and foodstuffs he saw nearby.<br /><br />\"Between 1849 and 1854 an annual average of some 31,000 overlanders passed through or near the fort on their journey to Oregon, California, or Utah. Most passed on a trail marked by the ruts before you. Wagon travel near the Platte River, just to the north, was difficult due to seasonal high water and progressively more difficult terrain.\"",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Bessemer Bend National Historic Site</b> , also known as Red Buttes Crossing, is one of the places where travelers forded the North Platte River, then 300 yards wide, for the last time and started the push toward the Sweetwater River. This crossing was used mostly in the early years of the emigration. After 1847, ferries were available between Casper and Glenrock (Deer Creek). The Red Buttes Pony Express station and an Overland Stage station also were located in this vicinity. Wayside exhibits along a short interpretive trail at this Bureau of Land Management site tell the story. While visiting the site, look towards the east to see the Red Buttes, the noted emigrant-era landmark that gave the crossing its name.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(south of Casper, Wyoming)<br /> <strong>Directions </strong><br /> Travel 8.1 miles south of Casper from CY Ave./Wyoming Blvd. intersection on WYO-220, turn right and take the Bessemer Bend Road west for 2.1 miles to the bridge.<br /> <br /> <strong>Available Facilities </strong><br /> There is a Bureau of Land Management interpretive site at the crossing.

    "audioDescription": "Bessemer Bend National Historic Site. <br /><br />From the road, the access road makes a teardrop shaped loop running parallel to the river. Parking is at the far end of the loop. In the middle of the loop at that end is a stone monument, a tall slab with a rounded top. There is a metal plaque mounted there with a worn relief carving of a covered wagon and ox-team. Below the plaque engraved lettering reads, \"Red Buttes of Oregon Trail fame where westward travelers left the North Platte River. A tribute to pioneer emigrants from Casper Literary Club, 1930.\" Looking beyond the monument you can see a low butte with its red sides clearly visible.<br /><br />From the parking area, a paved trail leads down toward the nearby river, curves around to the left, and loops back to the parking area. This smooth walkway provides excellent views of the now placid river with more buttes visible on the other side. At various points along the walk are wayside signs covering a variety of topics such as the history of nearby Bessemer town, now gone; what trail emigrant might have seen here; early ranching in the area; and early scientific field explorations.<br /><br />At the end of the looping trail furthest from the river is a covered picnic pavilion and a restroom building.",

As you mount the slope, small white posts on your left mark the path of the Oregon Trail.

In order to leave Grande Ronde Valley and continue on the Trail, emigrants faced a nearly 1000 ft. climb up steep valley walls. Teams of oxen had to be combined in order to pull the wagons up this rise. The area now known as Birnie Park provided a perfect location to do this.<br /> <br /> From the interpretive sign at the park:</p> <p>\"Having endured miles of alkali and sage, the Oregon Trail Pioneers paused at the summit near Ladd Canyon to admire the breathtaking oasis of the Grande Ronde Valley. The trail down the hill was also breathtaking. With chains, the emigrants rough-locked the rear wheels of their wagons, then skidded and bounced wide-eyed to the valley floor.<br /> <br /> On this site, many emigrants pulled off the Oregon Trail (present-day B Avenue) for a night of well-earned rest. They often found Indians from the Nez Perce of Cayuse tribes awaiting their arrival; not in ambush, as many feared, but with friendly greetings and an eagerness to trade. The farmers cast appraising eye at the waving stand of head-high grass and were tempted to linger. But provisions were short, the season was late. Still ahead lay the Blue Mountains and the chance of early snows. Daybreak found the oxen yoked for the grueling climb out of the valley.<br /> <br /> Many of the Oregon Trail emigrants carried fond memories of this lush valley. By the late 1850s, the good land in the Willamette had been claimed and a reverse migration began. Autumn of 1861 saw a small a group of families and single men building cabins in the Mt.

    "audioDescription": "This city park has smooth lawns with an Oregon Trail-themed children's playground and restrooms on one side and on the other, a paved looping path with interpretive signage and decorative pillars. One sign shows a map of the trail route from Ladd Hill in the south past this park in La Grande to the Grande Ronde River. <br /><br />Another sign reads, \"Having endured miles of alkali and sage, the Oregon Trail Pioneers paused at the summit near Ladd Canyon to admire the breathtaking oasis of the Grande Ronde Valley. The trail down the hill was also breathtaking. With chains, the emigrants rough-locked the rear wheels of their wagons, then skidded and bounced wide-eyed to the valley floor.\"<br /><br />Another sign reads, \"On this site, many emigrants pulled off the Oregon Trail (present-day B Avenue) for a night of well-earned rest. They often found Indians from the Nez Perce of Cayuse tribes awaiting their arrival; not in ambush, as many feared, but with friendly greetings and an eagerness to trade.\"<br /><br />A fourth sign reads, \"The farmers cast appraising eye at the waving stand of head-high grass and were tempted to linger. But provisions were short, the season was late. Still ahead lay the Blue Mountains and the chance of early snows. Daybreak found the oxen yoked for the grueling climb out of the valley.\"<br /><br />One last sign reads, \"Many of the Oregon Trail emigrants carried fond memories of this lush valley. By the late 1850s, the good land in the Willamette had been claimed and a reverse migration began. Autumn of 1861 saw a small a group of families and single men building cabins in the Mt. Glen area of the valley. The following spring, Ben and Frances Brown, S.M. Black and William Chaffin staked out claims along the trail. Brown's cabin stood a few blocks west of here, near the southeast corner of C and Cedar streets. The village that grew around it, first called Brown's Town, was later renamed La Grande.\"",

    "bodyText": "<p>Burnt Ranch, known historically as South Pass Station and Last or Ninth Crossing of the Sweetwater River, is located at the center of the South Pass landscape of Wyoming on the shared corridor of the Oregon, California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express National Historic Trails. The Lander Cutoff, a government wagon road explored and developed in 1857-1860 by topographical engineer Frederick W. Lander, diverged from the primary route of the California Trail at present-day Burnt Ranch, following older paths used by American Indians and trappers of the fur trade. Western historian Will Bagley estimates that more than 100,000 overland emigrants crossed this region by way of the Lander Cutoff. The graves of two known overland emigrants (Joseph Barnett, d. 1844, and Charles H. Miller, d. 1859) and as many as six unidentified burials of the trails era are located on the ranch. Many more emigrant graves are believed to exist at and around the site.<br /> <br /> During the 1800s, this location was the site of extensive Shoshone Indian villages; trading post, stagecoach, mail, and telegraph operations; a military outpost; emigrant and military encampments; and armed conflicts between the US Army and the Sioux and Cheyenne. In fact, Burnt Ranch takes its name from the burning of a stage station at Ninth Crossing during the Utah War in 1857, and by Sioux warriors in 1866 and 1868. It has been the headquarters of cattle ranching operations since the 1880s and remains so today.<br /> <br /> Trail remnants and historical remains of the developments and activities at Burnt Ranch have been determined to be nationally significant and eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Located approximately 8 miles SE South Pass City, Wyoming)<br /> <strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> No cell service.  Poor roads.  Prior Planning with an organized group is a must.<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "audioDescription": "California Hill. 304 words<br /><br />Along the side of the road is a Nebraska Historical Marker metal sign. It reads, \"California Hill. The large hill to the north, which became known as 'California Hill,' was climbed by thousands of covered wagon emigrants heading west between 1841 and 1860. Many were bound for Oregon. California became the destination of a majority of travelers after gold was discovered there in 1848.<br /><br />\"The most important crossing of the South Platte River during this period was south and a little east of here. After fording the river and ascending California Hill, the emigrants traveled northwesterly to the North Platte River via Ash Hollow. The terrain restricted the route wagons could take up the hill, causing deep ruts still visible about two-thirds of a mile north-northwest of this marker.<br /><br />\"Before 1867 as many as half a million emigrants passed through what became Keith County. The natural migration corridor from Fort Kearny to Fort Laramie became known as 'The Great Platte River Road.' California Hill was donated to the Oregon-California Trails Association by Malcolm E. Smith, Jr., in memory of trail historian Irene D. Paden, and by the association to the Nebraska State Historical Society.\"<br /><br />Just past the marker a narrow dirt road leads to the right up a hill, pastures spreading on the rolling hills as far as the eye can see. The road is marked as \"Minimum Maintenance\" and may be too rough for most cars. Hiking up the road, it is possible to see gentle troughs leading up along the right side. Up near the top of the hill, a fence walk-through on the left side with attached logos for the Oregon Trail and the California Trail leads into the pasture. Please note, livestock and equipment may be present. Swales in the pasture are very difficult to discern.",

Although an obstacle to navigation, the falls created the region's greatest fishing site. For more than 10,000 years Sahaptin and Chinookan peoples lined the shore and braved the currents to plunge dipnets into massive runs of fish. Consistent winds enabled the Indians to wind-dry their catch. They filleted fish and hung them in plank-covered drying sheds. The Indians pounded the dried fish wrapped it in fish skins, packed it in baskets and raised these into stacks covered with matting. â€˜Thus preserved,' wrote Clark, â€˜those fish may be kept sound and sweet several years.'\"",

This natural feature was a \"grand and splendid object\" to emigrants who had never seen the geology of the American West. As they traveled alongside the North Platte River, they peered eagerly ahead for their first view of the rock. As such, it was mentioned in more emigrant diaries than any other landmark on the Oregon Trail!</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>On June 27, 1849, Elisha Perkins was humbled and awed by his visit to this remarkable curiosity when me wrote,</p> <blockquote> <p>\". . . camped opposite to & about 1 mile from Chimney Rock. I had some curiosity to see this . . . Imagine a pyramid standing alone though surrounded by rocky precipices some 150 feet high & at its base 20 feet through . . . No conception can be formed of the magnitude of this grand work of nature until you stand at its base & look up. If a man does not feel like an insect then I don't know when he should.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (1.5 miles south of Highway 92 on Chimney Rock Road near Bayard, Nebraska)</p> <p>The Nebraska State Historical Society now manages Chimney Rock as part of a historic site. Viewing the rock is available from several places, including from the site's visitor center. This center houses a museum with interpretive and interactive exhibits about this natural feature and the emigrant trails. It also contains a small theater with a video presentation about the great migration West and a bookstore.

Two wings stair-step off the right side and a longer, flatter wing extends to the left. The entrance is reached by moving under an open wooden-truss supported by six sandstone pillars, three on each side. A small sign at the edge of the sidewalk warns of rattlesnakes in the area. Please stay on sidewalks.<br /><br />Entering through the double doors you will be in an open hallway that extends to the rear of the building where another set of doors exits to a patio with seating. The information desk is about halfway down the 40-foot hallway on your left. The gift shop may be found by turning to the left just before you reach the desk. An exhibit area is found on the right side of the hallway.<br /><br />Chimney Rock itself is behind on the far side of fenced pasture land where cattle may be grazing. Towering over the surrounding landscape, it may be easily seen both from the parking lot and from the patio behind the visitor center. The formation is shaped like a large cone, wide at its base, and topped with a narrow finger of rock projecting upwards like a steeple.",

The space between them is covered with a flat roof, forming a large lobby that runs the length of the building.<br /><br />To the right of the entrance walkway is a landscape border filled with native plants. Flat stones with raised lettering identify many of the plants here, including choke cherry, mock orange, arrow-leaf balsamroot gray rabbit brush, snowberry and ponderosa pine. A nearby wayside sign tells us about the historic Columbia River Highway, the first scenic highway in the United States. Bypassed by Interstate Highway 84, sections of the old road are now preserved and open to automobile, foot and/or bicycle traffic. Further to the right of the museum, a paved walk winds through the grounds past historic structures and a wagon.<br /><br />On the left side of the entrance walk is a stone wall. Triangular in cross section, it is about 5 feet tall near the parking area, reducing to half that as the walk slopes up to the front doors. The wall forms a fountain, water pouring out from a slot running the length of the wall at the top and cascading down the rough sides into a trough at the bottom.<br /><br />The entrance leads into the long, high lobby area extending the length of the building, with rough stone walls on either side topped by a row of clerestory windows under the roofline. Large support pillars made of natural wood run along each wall. The back wall is solid windows, filling the space with natural light. The floor is covered with smooth, dark-colored tiles.<br /><br />The information desk is to your left as you enter.",

At the edge of the gravel pullout is a Nebraska Historical Marker that reads, \"Courthouse and Jail Rocks are two of the most famous landmarks of westward migration. Nearby passed the Oregon-California Trail, the Mormon Trail, the Pony Express Trail, and the Sidney-Deadwood Trail. The rocks were vanguards of unforgettable scenic wonders that travelers would encounter farther west, including Chimney Rock's curious spire and the rugged heights of Scott's Bluffs.<br /><br />\"Hundreds of overland emigrants mentioned Courthouse Rock in their diaries. Often called a 'castle' or 'solitary tower,' the name Courthouse was first used in 1837. One 1845 traveler described the rock as â€˜resembling the ruins of an old castle [which] rises abruptly from the plain... It is difficult to look upon it and not believe that art had something to do with its construction. The voyagers have called it the Courthouse; but it looks infinitely more like the Capitol.'<br /><br />\"Courthouse and Jail Rocks, rising some 400 feet above the North Platte Valley, are erosional remnants composed of clay, sandstone, and volcanic ash. The rocks are listed in the National Register of Historic Places and in the Nebraska Natural Areas Register.\"<br /><br />Looking westward, past the sign, the two formations can be seen rising out of the surrounding pasture land. Courthouse Rock, on the right, is larger, looming over the prairie like a squat cylinder with a smaller circular layer sitting on top. Jail Rock, on the left, is the same height but only about one-third as wide. It is also cylindrical, but has more sloping sides.",

    "bodyText": "<figure> <h2>History</h2> <h3>A Safer Alternative</h3> </figure> <p>The Oregon Trail followed the course of the Snake River, about 100 miles south of the monument. In 1852, John Jeffrey began promoting a spur trail which traced traditional Shoshone migration routes. He wanted to generate business for his ferry at the mouth of the Blackfoot River. Although the cutoff received some use from 1852-1854, it was not until a decade later that a large percentage of Oregon Trail traffic chose the route.</p> <p>In 1862, an emigrant party asked guide Tim Goodale to lead them west from Fort Hall on the cutoff pioneered by Jeffrey. They hoped the alternate trail would enable them to reach the Salmon River gold fields more directly. Goodale succeeded in leading a group of 1,095 people, 338 wagons, and 2,900 head of stock safely from Fort Hall to Boise. It took this enormous wagon train -- the largest to travel any section of the Oregon Trail -- over 3 hours to get into or out of camp.</p> <p>By 1862, the Northern Shoshone and Bannock tribes were beginning to resist the intrusion of emigrants into their homeland. Skirmishes occurred between the Shoshone and emigrants near <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/massacre-rocks-state-park.htm\">Massacre Rocks State Park</a>. The growing hostility along the trail resulted in increased demand for a safe alternative. In 1863, seven out of every ten wagons en route from Fort Hall to Boise took Goodale's Cutoff instead of the main Oregon Trail.</p> <h3>Skirting the Lava Flows</h3> <p><br /> The 230-mile spur headed north from Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte, a conspicuous landmark on the Snake River Plain. From there it passed near the present-day town of Arco, wound through the northern part of Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, went southwest to Camas Prairie, and ended at Fort Boise. This journey typically took two to three weeks.</p> <p>Goodale's Cutoff took its toll on the travelers and their wagons. The rugged lava restricted travel to one lane, so progress was slow.</p> <p>The path along the edge of the lava flows was circuitous. The emigrants typically passed through in late July, the hottest part of the summer. Wood dried out in the desert air and shrank, causing wheels and boxes to come apart. Pioneers wrote of finding pieces of broken wagons littering the trail.</p> <p>For nearly 50 years, westward-bound pioneers used Goodale's Cutoff. Later, miners moving ore to railroad depots and stagecoaches carrying passengers to the towns of southern Idaho took the route. But the advent of the railroad and automobile led to the demise of Goodale's Cutoff as a wagon route. Today those driving US-20, which follows sections of the route, need not concern themselves with survival and can take time to appreciate the unique beauty of the harsh landscape.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location: </strong>Goodale's Cutoff is visible at many points along Highway 20/26/93 between Arco and Carey.</p>   <ul> <li>The route winds through the northern end of the monument out of sight of the road and intersects the highway 3.5 miles west of the visitor center. From that point on, watch for the dirt road as it follows the edge of the lava flows north of the highway.</li> <li>The cutoff is particularly easy to pick out 5.7 miles west of the visitor center, where the road drops down a steep incline. Look to the slope north of the road, where several earlier routes through this notch are visible. The highest road is Goodale's Cutoff.</li> <li>At Lava Lake, 11.3 miles west of the visitor center, there is a historical marker which describes Goodale's Cutoff.</li> </ul> <p>Goodale's Cutoff is not accessible by car within Craters of the Moon. Check at the visitor center for more information on where to see the trail.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/crmo/index.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Metal lettering on the front reads, \"Oregon Trail.\" An asphalt path leads up to the kiosk past a sign that says \"Victor G. Atiyeh Deschutes River Recreation Area.\" Inside the kiosk are seven graphic panels. The first one is titled \"Pathway to the Garden of the World\" and shows a map of the entire Oregon Trail. It also has a smaller map showing the routes of the trail from this area at the Deschutes River crossing all the way west to Oregon City and Fort Vancouver. The trail splits at The Dalles, with one route following the Columbia River and the other going south around the mountains.<br /><br />The other signs cover such topics as the Indians of the Deschutes, crossing the Deschutes River where casualties were common, and climbing the hill immediately to the west, which some described as almost insurmountable. One sign reads in part, \"The Deschutes River drains the eastern slopes of the Cascade range and flows from Central Oregon to the Columbia River. Here, near its confluence with the Columbia, the Deschutes flows through a chasm that Riley Root, emigrant of 1848, compared to â€˜the valley of Sinbad the sailor.' Oregon Trail emigrants usually arrived at this site in the late afternoon, and after a perilous river crossing they ascended the hill immediately to the west, camping at the summit.\"<br /><br />On the other side of the entrance drive, to the west, is a wide, smooth lawn which leads down to the edge of the river with views of the grass and sagebrush covered hill on the far side. The lawn is dotted with large deciduous trees and picnic tables. An RV camping area lies to the right.",

On your right a granite ridge extends across the view. Near the right end a deep, broken-V-shaped notch can be seen, slightly wider than it is deep. The left side of the notch slants steeply toward the unseen river below. The right side of the notch descends vertically about halfway through the ridge, then slopes to the left. Text on a wayside sign tells us that the notch is called Devil's Gate, a 370-foot high, 1,500 feet-long fissure carved over the centuries by the Sweetwater River.<br /><br />To the right of the notch, the granite slopes down gradually to a pass where a small road winds its way.<br /><br />A half dozen wayside signs are spaced along the paved walkway. They cover topics such as the trails that passed this way, and local landmarks such as Martin's Cove, where Mormon emigrants sheltered from a winter storm, and Sun Ranch. One sign, titled \"A Tribute to Hardship,\" discusses the deaths along the trail, many caused by cholera. It mentions that up on this ridge, safe from the wagon trails below, are over 20 known American Indian and emigrant graves.",

    "audioDescription": "The land here is flat, covered with grasses and low prairie vegetation. In the distance, there are some crop fields. A wide asphalt sidewalk leads from the parking area to a simple, 4-post pavilion covered with a roof of wood shingles. There are three wayside signs in the pavilion. One of the signs is titled \"A Day's Journey\" and consists of passages from diaries and journals of the emigrants. <br /><br />The middle sign reads in part, \"Descending the Blue Mountains, early Oregon Trail emigrants traveled down the Umatilla River to the Columbia, before proceeding on their westward journey. By 1848, travelers began using a cut-off, a good road that forked to the left at a crossing on the Umatilla. The new road stayed far south of the Columbia River. Here, emigrants prepared for a dusty, windy and hot drive west over sandy uplands to Butter Creek and Well Springs. In 1851, the Utilla Indian Agency was constructed at the Umatilla crossing on the left hand emigrant road.\"<br /><br />The final sign talks about the people of the plateau. It reads in part, \"Thousands of years ago, people came to the land. In time, they became the people of twenty thousand horses - the Umatilla, Cayuse, and Walla Walla nations of the Columbia River plateau. The people fished for salmon and eel, hunted elk and antelope, gathered roots and huckleberries and traded with neighbors. They knew the shape of the land and the paths to follow east and west. In 1843, wagons came traveling over ancient trails of Indian people. A flood of westering emigrants crossed the Blue Mountains, descended the Umatilla valley and passed over uplands of the Columbia River. The Indian people traded salmon, fresh vegetables and horses in exchange for emigrant cattle and clothing.\"<br /><br />From the pavilion a path leads to the right, following along a fence to a gate. From here a small sign tells us that at the end of the half-mile asphalt path, which heads straight out into the field, are Oregon Trail wagon ruts.",

During their stay here they would scout out this piece of the Willamette Valley, file their claim at the Government Land Office and resupply in Oregon City at places like Pettygrove's Red Store or Governor Abernathy's Mercantile. Beginning in 1846, two-thirds of Oregon Trail emigrants took Sam Barlow's Mount Hood Toll Road, which ended right here at Abernathy Green.\"",

A covered wagon sits on either side of the entrance from the highway. As the drive curves to the left, a kiosk made of vertical planking stained dark brown sits on the right. Inside there are seven signs. One titled, \"Pathway to the â€˜Garden of the World,'\" has a map of the segment of the trail from Keeney Pass up past the Flagstaff Hill Interpretive Center. One has an illustration of American Indians using spears to catch fish. The panel reads, \"Hook, Line and Fishtrap. Rivers and creeks along the Oregon Trail supplied emigrants with both food and water, and the Snake River was no exception. Although some emigrants employed hook and line, most found it easier to trade for fish with local Indians. Long before the arrival of emigrants, local Indians had perfected techniques for harvesting the bountiful Snake River salmon.\"<br /><br />One sign, titled \"Eastbound Lane Opens,\" tells us that after gold was discovered in Idaho in the 1860s, emigrants often met prospectors heading back eastward.<br /><br />Other signs here are titled \"Lost Lucy,\" \"Farewell Snake River,\" \"Respite for the Weary,\" and \"The Cattle is Dying.\"<br /><br />Outside the kiosk to the right a large wooden sign reads, \"Historic Oregon Trail. Farewell Bend. The last camp on the weary journey across the Snake River plains. Here the Oregon Trail left the Snake River and wound overland to the Columbia. Here camped Wilson Price Hunt, December 23, 1811; captain Bonneville, January 10, 1834; Nathaniel J. Wyeth, August 25, 1834; Lieutenant John C. Fremont, October 13, 1843.\"",

Faded wayside signs identify the various structures.<br /><br />To the left of the blacksmith/carpenter shop is a reconstructed fort surrounded by a palisade made of upright logs set in the ground topped with sharpened ends. Just to the rear and slightly to the left of the blacksmith/carpenter shop is another wagon, this one without any covering. A sidewalk to the left of the shop leads back towards the parking lot. Along this sidewalk is a tall metal sign which is a Nebraska Historical Marker. The sign outlines the history of Fort Kearny from the first post established in 1848, through its service as a waystation along the Oregon and California Trails and home station for the Pony Express, until it was discontinued as a military post in 1871, two years after the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. The site is on the National Register of Historic Places.",

    "audioDescription": "Fort Laramie National Historic Site. 394 words<br /><br />From the parking lot, a long sidewalk winds north towards the middle of the fort area to the visitor. On either side are some buildings that have been restored and others that exist only as foundations or ruins. Most of the structures are of concrete or adobe and tan in color with gray shingle roofs. Other buildings are wood frame and painted white.<br /><br />Along the sidewalk are a couple of wayside signs with information about the park and the surrounding area. About halfway to the visitor center is a tall stone monument with multiple plaques on its sides commemorating the Pony Express and Transcontinental Telegraph and identifying Fort Laramie as being on the National Register of Historic Places. On front a stone marker reads, \"Fort Laramie, a military post on the Oregon Trail, June 16, 1849 to March 2, 1890. This monument is erected by the state of Wyoming and a few interested residents, 1913.\"<br /><br />The walkway then crosses a dirt road and continues on over the lawn, crossing a shallow ditch over a short wooded bridge. A small sign in front of the visitor center building reads, \"Commissary Storehouse. This building was completed in 1884. It was built as a commissary storage facility. As such, it would have been primarily divided into two large storerooms: one for meat and one for flour, rice and beans. Three or four smaller rooms would have been used as offices, an â€˜issue room' and a storage room for canned goods. This building also had a partial cellar with a trap door for use with a hand-operated elevator. Rations and other official army food items were issued from this building. A commissary officer and sergeant ran the operation.\"<br /><br />The entrance is located about 30 feet from the right end of the building. The small wooden porch in front of the door may be reached by a set of 5 stairs on the right side or by a ramp that zig-zags up on the left side. At the right end of the building a small sign indicates that restrooms are located in the rear of the building.<br /><br />As you enter the building, the information desk is straight ahead of you against the opposite wall.

    "bodyText": "A grouping of historical markers commemorate Fort Mitchell, which was constructed in 1864 to protect emigrants traveling along the Oregon/California Trails from attacks by Native American groups. The actual fort was located south of the markers on private property along the North Platte River. Please respect private property by viewing the site from the pullout.   <h3>Forgotten Outpost</h3> <p>During America’s westward expansion, the United States Army established hundreds of small outposts throughout the frontier to protect settlers, maintain communication with the West Coast, and serve as staging areas for military campaigns. Some of these posts have become an integral part of American history, such as Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley in Kansas and Fort Laramie in Wyoming. Most served less conspicuously and then faded into obscurity. One such outpost was Nebraska Territory’s Fort Mitchell.</p> <h3>Protecting the West</h3> <p>The American Civil War brought a new significance to the western territories. The great overland roads such as Santa Fe, Oregon and California Trails continued to carry vast numbers of emigrants and tons of freight. Western gold fields were producing ore that helped finance the Federal government’s war effort, and the newly erected transcontinental telegraph lines helped bind westerners to the Union. But eastern battlefields drained regular Army soldiers from the frontier and left vital western territories unprotected.To provide a military presence in the West, the Federal government sent a few state raised volunteer cavalry regiments to garrison forts that had been vacated by the regulars. Among these volunteers were the 11th Ohio Cavalry, under the command of Colonel William O. Collins, who arrived in Nebraska territory in 1862. After marching west to Fort Laramie, they were immediately assigned the task of patrolling, escorting freight wagons and stage coaches, and maintaining the telegraph lines along the Oregon Trail in central Wyoming. Eventually, other units from Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas joined the Ohioans on the frontier.</p> <h3>Fight to Control the Plains</h3> <p>Traffic over the roads continued unabated until early August 1864, when the plains erupted in an Indian war that pitted the volunteer soldiers against Sioux, Arapaho, and Southern Cheyenne warriors. Determined to drive the Americans from their lands, plains warriors swept out of Kansas and attacked homesteaders, stage stations and freight caravans all along the Platte River. For several weeks, all traffic and communications over the Oregon Trail came to a halt. In response to these depredations, several military expeditions sought out the warring tribes, but failed to bring them into battle. This led Brigadier General Robert Mitchell to work to assure that the overland roads would never again be at the mercy of a hostile enemy.</p> <h3>A New Strategy</h3> <p>The general planned to fortify each stage station along the Oregon Trail and detail troops to protect them. He also decided to build two new forts at strategic sites along the Platte River. To help defend the road that branched off the Oregon Trail and followed the South Platte to Denver, the first post was built near Julesburg, Colorado. For the first year of its existence, this post was known as Fort Rankin, and had a garrison of soldiers from the 7th Iowa Cavalry. It proved its value by withstanding two Indian assaults in the early weeks of 1865, and later served to protect workers during the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad. The second post was placed along the North Platte River near Scotts Bluff. Official records documenting Fort Mitchell’s history are meager, but construction had begun by September 1, 1864, the date General Mitchell visited the site. The general’s aide-de-camp noted that the men of the 11th Ohio’s Company F were hard at work building the sod structure. Captain Jacob Shuman, the first commander of the as yet unnamed post, gave General Mitchell a tour of the site and described his plans for a sod stockade he hoped to have finished before winter set in. By the end of October, most of the work had been completed and the post was named for the general who had ordered its construction.</p> <h3>Conflict Grows</h3> <p>Hostilities on the plains intensified after November 29, 1864, when Colorado volunteer soldiers killed several hundred Cheyenne and Arapahos at Sand Creek, Colorado. Rather than bringing an end to the conflict, the massacre at Sand Creek resulted in renewed warfare and bloodshed. Convinced that the southern plains were no longer safe, several Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho bands began to move north to spend the winter in the remote Powder River region of Wyoming. However, enroute they encountered military forces stationed along the overland roads. First, they crossed paths with the 7th Iowa Cavalry at Fort Rankin. On February 2, 1865, the Indians stripped the post of anything useful. Two days later, they attacked a fortified telegraph station at Mud Springs, Nebraska. The Indians failed to cut the telegraph wires, allowing the 11 desperate soldiers at the tiny outpost to signal Fort Laramie for help. The first cavalrymen to respond came from Fort Mitchell. The siege continued until February 5th, when additional support arrived from Fort Laramie. After some additional skirmishing, the Indian bands crossed the frozen North Platte River and continued northwest.</p> <h3>Seeking Peace</h3> <p>The spring of 1865 saw a short-lived attempt at peace on the frontier. Tired of warfare, the Brule Sioux came in to Fort Laramie and asked to be allowed to live in peace near that post. The Army welcomed the gesture, but was unwilling to support the Indians with rations this far west, and decided to move the band to Fort Kearny in central Nebraska. The wary Sioux were allowed to keep their weapons for the journey, while the cavalry escort was not issued ammunition in hopes of avoiding confrontation. Distrust and fear of being moved near their enemies, the Pawnee, led the Brules to flee just three days into the journey. While trying to prompt the Indians into striking camp, the commander of the escort was shot. A skirmish ensued, and reinforcements were sent for from Fort Mitchell. Before relief arrived, the Sioux escaped by crossing the North Platte River and the outnumbered soldiers did not pursue.</p> <h3>Life at the Fort</h3> <p>For the next two years, Fort Mitchell continued to serve as a reassuring force to travelers on the Oregon Trail. Hundreds of freight wagons, emigrant trains and stage coaches passed Fort Mitchell. Detachments from the fort safely escorted them all, despite the fact that the post’s garrison never exceeded 100 men. Conditions at Fort Mitchell were crude and demanding. Endless hours of patrol and escort duty were interrupted only by the constant maintenance of the fort’s sod walls and corrals. Poor sanitary conditions and a monotonous diet of hardtack and salt pork added to the soldier’s hardships. Despite the poor living conditions, only one man is known to have died at Fort Mitchell. Following the end of the Civil War, regular army soldiers returned to the West, and one company of the 18th Infantry was stationed at Fort Mitchell. These foot soldiers were helpless against highly mobile Indian warriors, and once suffered the indignity of having 112 mules stolen from a freight train camped within sight of the fort.</p> <h3>Fading into Obscurity</h3> <p>No official record of the post’s abandonment exists, but Margaret Carrington, wife of Col Henry Carrington, made one of the last accounts of Fort Mitchell as an active military post. The Carringtons stopped at the site in June 1866, and described it as follows: “This is a sub-post of Fort Laramie of peculiar style and compactness. The walls of the quarters are also the outlines of the fort itself, and the four sides of the rectangle are respectively the quarters of offices, soldiers, horses and the warehouse of supplies”. Soon after, Fort Mitchell faded into obscurity. The sod walls quickly deteriorated, and wind and rain removed all signs that the post ever existed. Today, plows turn up occasional reminders of Fort Mitchell in the form of rusted metal artifacts. Although no physical indications of the post remain, nearby Mitchell Pass preserves the name and serves as a reminder that for three years, Fort Mitchell stood guard along the Oregon Trail during an important period in American history.</p>",

It is a long, one-story building with vertical siding painted pale, mint green. The peaked roof is covered with gray shingles. A covered, cement porch, reached by a set of 4 steps from the end closest to the parking lot, runs the length of the building in front. The entrance is towards the far end, covered by a section of the roof that extends over a ramped approach. There is a bench on the right side of this area.<br /><br />The entrance is flanked on both sides by floor-to-ceiling windows. There are two glass doors. Once inside, the information desk runs along the right-hand wall, with an entrance to the theater behind it. The gift shop area is to the left. The lobby is full of light from the windows in front as well as windows that line the back wall and look out over the grounds beyond.",

A grassroots network of willing partners, volunteers, and locations serve as the Freedom’s Frontier Board of Trustees, the coordinating entity for the heritage area.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{245}\" paraid=\"8\">Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area has a distinct landscape of rivers, hills, valleys, soils, and vegetation. In the 1800s, before the nation expanded across the continent, the western border of Missouri was the American frontier. To its west, Kansas was known as a permanent Indian Territory for both the Plains Indians and other tribes who were forcibly sent to the region following decades of land disputes. Since river travel ended at the Kansas border, this area became a major jumping-off point for pioneers heading west on extensive networks of trails. Traders, miners, and emigrants secured necessities and purchased provisions, and prepared for long overland treks.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{20aaccb0-78af-490f-b07a-e87ad053f6dd}{251}\" paraid=\"9\">In 1854, political tensions between Missouri and Kansas resulted in a violent border war as the Kansas territory sought statehood and debated the legality of slavery. At the time, Missouri was a slave state, and the issue of Kansas entering the Union as a potential “free state” ignited years of turmoil. The violent conflict between slavery proponents and abolitionists in the war known as “Bleeding Kansas” (or “Border War”) focused national attention on Kansas sovereignty and territorial law. This was one of the nation's most widely debated political crises in the years leading up to the Civil War. The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed in 1854 left the territory's future status in the hands of settlers. The struggle for freedom was at the forefront of the Border War, and in the Civil War that followed. Although the Fugitive Slave Law made assisting runaway slaves a hanging offense in Kansas Territory, abolitionists continued to help slaves escaping from Missouri by the Underground Railroad.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{16}\" paraid=\"10\">After the Civil War, hundreds of African Americans came to settle in Kansas as part of the \"Exoduster Movement\" in the 1870s. Through the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, African Americans in both states continued the struggle for freedom from inequality and segregation during the Jim Crow and Civil Rights eras. One of the heritage area’s most well-known civil rights stories is found in the landmark Supreme Court case known as Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas which ended legal racial segregation in public schools in 1954. Today, Freedom’s Frontier National Heritage Area continues to advocate for equal freedoms for all Americans.  Visit, explore and learn about the nation’s enduring legacy and struggle for freedom through the shared stories of courage, conflict, and hope for reconciliation as told across their broad landscape.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{dd497a1e-4f6b-4c03-842d-02aa3f6018f3}{69}\"

In the middle is a pavilion with a metal roof supported by four posts, covering three large signs. Behind the pavilion, against the wall is a metal bench. At the right side of the paved area a sidewalk makes a looping path about 100 yards long in total through meadow-like vegetation. At the far end of the loop are 4 more signs, two at each corner, and another metal bench.<br /><br />The signs under the pavilion discuss nearby trail sites to the east, north-east and west, some of which are included in this app for the Oregon Trail.<br /><br />The signs along the looping sidewalk cover other topics. One titled \"Eye of the Needle\" reads in part, \"The historic junction of three great western frontier trails - the Santa Fe Trail, the Oregon Trail and the California Trail - is located approximately one-half mile to the north. To the southwest lay the Santa Fe Trail and to the northwest was the road to Oregon and California...Between the late 1830s and the early 1850s, as many as 200,000 emigrants may have passed through this gateway in order to start a new life in the Oregon Territory or to take a chance seeking their fortune in the gold fields of California. During this same period, thousands of freighters loaded with commodities were also rumbling through this junction heading to and from the markets at Santa Fe.\"<br /><br />Another sign titled \"Following Their Dreams\" discusses the various types of travelers who followed these trails. A third sign, titled \"Apprehension and Conflict,\" discusses the impact the large numbers of travelers had on the Indian Nations who lived in the Great Plains Region west of the Missouri River. The final sign is titled \"From Prairie Schooners to Locomotives\" and covers the decline of the trails as railroad lines spread and the transcontinental railroad was completed.",

    "audioDescription": "Geyser Park. 449 words<br /><br />The geyser area is surrounded by a low stone wall, about 3 feet high. On the other side is a long, low mound of pumpkin orange rock. On the left side of the mound, a grey and tan rocky ridge rises to form a small hill. About half way up the slope is a wooden viewing platform. Near the edge of the parking lot past the left end of the wall is a tall, three panel sign which discusses the National Byways in Idaho, the springs of Soda Springs and the geyser itself. Even further to the left is a wayside sign that talks about the Oregon Trail in Caribou County.<br /><br />Starting from either sign, a paved trail zigzags up the low hill on the left and ends at the viewing platform above. Although paved for most of the way, as you approach the platform, it becomes narrow and turns into a rock and dirt path. There is a bench on the viewing platform along with another wayside sign. The platform looks over the geyser area itself, an expanse of barren gray and orange rock.<br /><br />Text on the sign reads, \"Many Oregon and California bound emigrants mention seeing ten to twelve foot high white mounds and cones in their diaries and journals while passing through the Soda Springs area in the mid-1800s. Often, one of the first natural curiosities that they encountered was Pyramid Spring.<br /><br />\"In 1937, several businessmen attempted to find and divert hot water from Pyramid Spring to develop a commercial bathhouse and health resort. On November 28th, at a depth of 35 feet, their hopes and dreams seemed within reach. The drilling rig struck a gas chamber, and shortly after drilling ceased for the day, hot water began gushing upward more than forty feet. The next day, after the 3500 pound bit was removed, the ground shook as if it were about to split open and a roaring gusher of more than 70 feet streamed upward from the valve. After several days, the hissing hot water began to cool and become laden with mineral content (hard water), rendering it undesirable for use as a bathhouse. Two weeks later, the drilling riggers were able to finally cap the gusher.<br /><br />\"The hordes of tourists that businessmen anticipated never came. But the geyser did attract attention. Within weeks, the Secretary of the Interior sent a telegram to Soda Springs asking the City to turn off the geyser because â€˜it is throwing the world famous Old Faithful Geyser off schedule.' Today, Soda Springs' Captive Geyser has a timer on the valve that permits it to erupt every hour on the hour throughout the year.\"",

There is an informational kiosk to the left of the restroom building. To reach it from the parking lot, go down the wide sidewalk, passing vending machines and a large welcome sign on your right.<br /><br />The kiosk is open-sided, made of vertical wood planking stained reddish-brown with a flat roof overhead. Inside are two alcoves, one on the left and one straight ahead, both with three graphic panels. Another section is to the right as you enter and contains a seventh panel.<br /><br />Starting at the left and moving in a clockwise direction the first panel reads in part, \"The Grande Ronde Valley was known to local Indians as Cop Copi, for its abundant cottonwood trees, and it received its current name in the 1820s from French-Canadian fur trappers for its shape - a great circle. Oregon Trail emigrants entered this valley after traveling through what Riley Root in 1848 called â€˜one thousand miles of naked rocks,' and for many along with Lucia Loraine Williams in 1851, â€˜It resembled an enchanted valley.' Most emigrants recognized the valley's beauty.\"<br /><br />The next sign tells us that emigrants crested the mountains east of the valley after an arduous trek and the descent to the valley floor from Ladd Hill was no mean feat. Absalom B. Harden described his descent in 1847 as \"a very steep long hill and powerful rocky.\"<br /><br />The next sign reads in part, \"Emigrants descended Ladd Hill, traveled along the southern perimeter of the Grand Ronde Valley and often camped at the base of Table Mountain. At the site of today's Birney Park, emigrants rested, traded with Indians and let the cattle rest before entering the Blue Mountains.\"<br /><br />Ladd Hill can be seen from the rest stop, a rounded summit with a long slope stretching down to the highway. Faint swales can be seen descending the hill.<br /><br />Signs in the next alcove talk about the emigrants' relationship with Indian tribes from the area including the Nez Perce, Cayuse, Walla Walla and Umatilla tribes. The emigrants were impressed with the Indians' life style and the Indians were eager to trade. The last sign here tells us that although emigrants were always wary of Indians, they often considered white speculators who set themselves up as guides to be dishonest.<br /><br />The last sign is titled \"Pathway to the Garden of the World\" and has a map of the entire Oregon Trail. It also shows a more detailed map of this section of the trail from Flagstaff Hill up to the Whitman Mission near Walla Walla Washington.",

From the parking area, a wooden path leads to an overlook on the edge of the bluff above the river. Here the river makes a sharp bend away from us, faced by steep bluffs on this side and flat farmland on the other. Signs at the lookout discuss the ancient lakes in this area and the fossils found as the sides of the bluff have eroded.<br /><br />Across the road from the parking area are more signs with a view down into a long canyon parallel to the river where the wagons would have traveled. A gravel trail leads from here down to the canyon floor. The signs explain the hiking trail leading off to the left which leads up the canyon to the right and discuss the Native American tribes from this area.<br /><br />Farther up the road is the Oregon Trail Overlook where a gravel path leads to the head of the trail that comes up the canyon. Here there are expansive views of the barren and rugged landscape with glimpses of the river far to the left.",

On a knoll a short distance from the river, Marshall built his base of operations. He then constructed a rope ferry across the river and charged up to $5.00 per wagon to use it. The ferry was very popular- at times, thousands of emigrants would be camped here, waiting for days for their turn to cross.

    "audioDescription": "Historic Trails Park (Marshall's Ferry). 390 words<br /><br />This small park has a dirt road that runs in a loop around a central grassy area with several large trees. At the front of this area is a large stone sign that reads, \"Historic Trails Park.\" On the left end of the sign is a metal plaque with \"Marshall Ferry\" in raised lettering and a relief carving of a ferry boat. On the other end of the sign is another plaque recognizing donors to the park. At the far end of the loop, on the right side of the road are more stone markers and a replica ferry boat. All of the stone markers have metal plaques with raised lettering. The first one, which is on the right side of the ferry replica, tells us the history of the site.<br /><br />The ferry boat is a low platform built of wood with short, hinged ramps leading up either end. The other sides are edged with a simple wood railing. On the far side is mounted a large wheel which controls a heavy rope. The rope loops from the wheel to either end of the ferry then out to a sliding pully which runs on a rope running parallel to the ferry and tied to trees on either end.<br /><br />To the left of the ferry is another stone marker which discusses the rope ferry and how it worked. Travelers paid up to $5 per wagon and 25 cents per head of livestock. The original ferry was located 1200 feet northwest of here from 1851 until 1864 when a bridge was built.<br /><br />Further to the left is a semi-circular pavement edged with 7 large stone markers. The plaque on the largest one in the center has a map of the western United States with the routes of a variety of trails fanning out from the Kansas-Missouri border, listed as California NHT, Oregon NHT, St. Joe Road, Military Road, Mormon NHT, Pony Express NHT, Overland Stage and Otoe-Missouria.<br /><br />The three markers to the right of center have plaques that discuss the Founders - Frank Marshall who established a trading post and ferry here - and the Otoe-Missouria Trail, the California trail, the Overland Stage and the Oregon Trail. On the left of center the markers cover the Pony Express, the Military Road, the Mormon Trail, St. Joe Road and Alcove Spring.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Hollenberg ranch house was built on Cottonwood Creek about 1857 by Gerat H. Hollenberg to capitalize on the Oregon-California emigrant trade that passed his door. In addition to living quarters for the Hollenberg family, the building served as a neighborhood grocery store, a tavern, and an unofficial post-office. Emigrants were able to obtain provisions at the ranch. Three years later, it became a Pony Express home station and later a stage station.<br /> <br /> Dr. C.M. Clark reached Cottonwood Creek in 1860 and found \"a small stream which is dry during the summer months. The approach to it is winding and steep, and as the bed of the stream contains several large stones at the ford, some care is necessary in driving. There are two good springs here, but no wood. The Stage Company have a station here, and there is also one or two other buildings.\"</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(2889 23rd Rd, Hanover, KS 66945)</p> <p>The original building still stands.

Had jack rabbit for supper. They dress 7 lb. sometimes and I tell you they are big ones, almost twice as big as ordinary rabbits. You ought to hear the prairie roosters. This is the pairing season, and they strut around and keep up a constant humming, and you can hear them 1/4 mile, and farther if the wind is right.

    "audioDescription": "Homestead National Historical Park. 418 words<br /><br />The visitor center here at Homestead is reached by a broad sidewalk that runs parallel to the right side of the parking lot. Looking down the sidewalk we see the one-story, red-brick building. The front of the lobby area on the right is all glass. The flat roof slants up gradually to the right side, then slopes up steeply to a point at the right rear of the building. White lettering on the wall to the left of the entrance reads, \"Homestead National Historical Park, Heritage Center.\"<br /><br />To the right of the entrance, a textured cement wall stained an earthen-tan color extends towards us along the sidewalk. On the other side of the sidewalk are several benches. <br /><br />To the left of the building a sidewalk winds out to a one-room log cabin and displays of old farm equipment.<br /><br />Before reaching the end of the wall are several signs. One covers park regulations. Another tells us that a cell phone audio tour is available by dialing 402-715-9527. A third sign is titled \"Walk in Their Shoes\" and shows a black white photograph of a man following a plow pulled by a team of mules. It reads, \"What was it like to be a homesteader? To get an idea, take a walk. The flags around the parking lot enclose an acre. It may not seem huge. But plowing an acre meant walking about 10 miles. Over uneven soil. Driving a team of oxen. In sun or rain. Walk that acre. Then multiply it by 160, the size of a typical homestead.\"<br /><br />As you reach the end of the wall, another wayside sign shows a map of the United States with all the homestead states identified. The only states without homesteading were those on the eastern seaboard, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas and Hawaii. Text on the sign tells us that the Homestead Act of 1862 offered people 160 acres of free land if they were willing to live on it, farm it and build a home. The map shows the 30 homesteading states in which the government gave away 270 million acres.<br /><br />Metal cutouts of the 30 homestead states are mounted on the wall, each with a square cutout that represents the proportion of homestead land in that state. Feel free to touch.<br /><br />As you enter the center, there is a sign-in book at the right side of the foyer. Inside, the information desk is to your left and the gift shop is to your right.",

A low hill rises in the background. Near the edge of the paved parking lot is a log roof, painted dark red and supported by square stone pillars which covers the spring itself. An arch on top of the structure has letters made of small wood logs which read, \"Hooper Spring.\"<br /><br />A wayside sign at the edge of the parking lot reads, in part, \"Hooper Springs echoes the legend and lore of the Oregon Trail with numerous diary entries about the site. The springs have long been a tourist attraction and a popular destination. Soda water from these springs was marketed after rail service reached this resort area in 1882. In 1936, the original Hooper Springs was surrounded with a concrete and stone walkway. It was soon covered with a stone and log pavilion. The Works Progress Administration assisted with the beautification of the springs and adjacent park. Although not a favorite to some tastes, the water is palatable. Many visitors consume it straight, or make punch or lemonade from this effervescent sparkling spring water.\"<br /><br />The spring may be reached by a set of four, uneven stone steps on either side of the pavilion which leads down to the level of the water. The oval pool is surrounded by a cement walk and a stone bench along the walls, except at the left end where the water exits in a stream. The water itself is clear so that the stones at the bottom are visible. The water bubbles, putting ripples all across the surface. Feel free to touch and even taste the water.<br /><br />On the far side of the pavilion an arched wooden footbridge crosses the small stream leading to a grassy picnic area beyond. Further back is a children's playground and some outbuildings. Restrooms are housed in a separate building to the far right of the property.",

    "audioDescription": "Independence Rock State Historic Site. 408 words<br /><br />Parking for Independence Rock is at a rest area on the side of the highway. The large gray granite mound can be seen across the rangeland surrounding it. Cement sidewalks lead past the restroom and other buildings to a large stone marker with a metal relief sculpture of a wagon and ox team. Feel free to stop and touch. From there, the entrance to the fields around Independence Rock is just across a paved access drive.<br /><br />The covered entrance is made of tan brickwork, with metal fencing on the back side. There are a couple of wayside signs here that show a map of the trails that encircle the rock and that ask visitors to be respectful of the area. There is also a warning that rattlesnakes live in this area.<br /><br />To reach the rock itself, proceed through the pass-through in the fence and follow the cement side walk across the grassy prairieland. Other signs along the walk describe the Sweetwater River Valley, discuss the geology of the granite outcrops in the valley, and provide information on the historic trails that passed this way, naming the rock, hardships along the trail, history of the area in the last 150 years, and the signatures that were carved in the rock. From the signs, we learn that this mass of granite is 700 feet wide, 1,900 feet long and 136 feet high.<br /><br />Swales from the wagon ruts can also be seen through the pasture, the most prominent one being crossed by a wooden foot bridge.<br /><br />The sidewalk ends at a metal gate close to the base of the rock. Once through the gate there are benches along the fence to the left. The sidewalk continues up to the base of the rock itself then continues in either direction around the base. The cement will change to gravel and then to dirt if you continue to follow the trail. From the path around the rock it is easy to feel the rock or even to climb the steep slope; however there are no fixed paths to the top of the rock. At the end of the rock to the left there is one section that is protected by a metal fence. Here there are carvings in the stone and a group of metal memorial plaques and other markers, including one that identifies the rock as being \"Wyoming Place number 1 on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",

    "audioDescription": "The gravel parking lot is nestled between two low ridges of land, rising slightly ahead of you as the car pulls in. The ground is covered with tall grasses, rising up to knee-level. Here and there is a sagebrush bush.<br /><br />To the left of the parking is a metal roofed pavilion with two wayside signs mounted on stone bases. One sign titled \"In Search of a Dream,\" shows the map of the whole Oregon Trail. The other one asks you to imagine a day's journey, traveling through here from the Snake River to the Malheur River. To the right of the pavilion another sign talks about the first people of the land, the Indians who called this area home.<br /><br />From the pavilion a gravel path leads up the gently rising valley between the ridges to another group of signs. A bench is also located here. Three signs grouped in the middle are titled, \"Hazards and Hardships,\" \"Day after Day,\" and \"Under the Wagon Cover.\" A fourth sign sits on the left side next to a dirt trail that leads over towards the ridge and then turns right to follow along the base of the ridge. The sign has a map of that footpath which leads up to a viewpoint on the top of the ridge. Immediately past the sign, the path crosses two parallel depressions which, as the sign explains, mark the wagon wheels and footsteps of over 50,000 pioneers.<br /><br />Walking out on the dirt path, it is easy to detect the ruts as the path goes down, then up, then down again. Looking in either direction from the path the ruts are clearly visible as they wind from the valley floor up to the end of the ridges. An official post marker stands in one of the ruts, labeled \"Oregon Trail.\"",

The Indians were then informed...the presents that they were to receive were given them because they had been friendly to the white men, and recommended that their friendship should continue. Col Landers then addressed the emigrants, telling them to treat the Indians kindly, and live in peace together.\"<br /> -Albert Bierstadt, July 5, 1859</p> </blockquote> <p> <br /> The end of the Lander Road's construction between Burnt Ranch, Wyoming, and Fort Hall, Idaho did not mean the end of the project. One item still had to be done- negotiate with the Native American Tribes whose land it was built on for the right of way. In 1859, Lander brought wagon loads of goods to give to the Shoshone, Bannock, and other Tribes in exchange for the privilege of crossing their land peacefully. On July 3, at the Green River crossing in what is today Wyoming, a celebration was held to disperse gifts to the Shoshone and to celebrate the 4th of July. The peaceful, festive celebration was attended by about 800 Shoshone, 300 emigrants (who happened to be in the area), and the soldiers and cavalrymen of Lander's command that were traveling with him.<br />  <br /> A feast was had, gifts were handed out, and speeches were made. Lander spoke directly to the Shoshone and then to the emigrants (partially quoted above). Contrary to the expected views at that time, Lander instructed the emigrants to have their interactions with the local Native Americans be cautious. They should treat the Native Americans kindly and to live in peace with them. The celebration extended into the night and concluded the following day.<br />  <br /> Several Additional celebrations and gatherings were held throughout the year with the same purpose of distributing gifts to Native Americans and negotiating with them to cross their land peacefully. In terms of Lander obtaining the needed right-of-way agreements, the negotiations were successful, concluding the first US government-sponsored trail section for the Oregon and the California Trails.<br /> <br /> <strong>Image Credit</strong><br /> 1.

    "bodyText": "<p>In the mid-1800s, over 250,000 people followed the California Trail to California's gold mines and croplands. Most had to walk the entire 2,000-mile trip. Would you do this? More than once? Travelers in the 1800s said “yes” to both! The California Trail was their version of today's interstate highway -- a route that could be traveled repeatedly and in both directions.<br />  <br /> Similar to interstate highways, new parts of the California Trail were created to help travelers. The first US government sponsored section was the Lander Road in 1858. John Lane used this road for the first time in 1859, during his fifth(!) trip on the Oregon and the California Trails. He was the captain of a wagon train that departed Iowa for Oregon. Sadly, he did not complete the trip. On July 18, on a nearby ridge off of the Lander Road, Lane died from a cholera-like illness.<br />  <br /> With limited supplies, and limited time before winter's arrival, most trailside burials were quick- simply prayers said over a hastily dug grave. However, the beloved Lane received a unique honor -- a funeral! There was a customary viewing of the body, hymns, prayers, and a funeral procession. Finally, a headstone made by a wagon train member was placed at the grave. After the day-long event was over, the wagon train returned to the Trail and its journey to Oregon.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Lane's Grave, Caribou County, Idaho, 17 miles west of Freedom, Wyoming)</p> <p> Today, little has changed at the grave of John Lane since he was buried. The headstone and footstone still remain, it is only accessible by a dirt and gravel road, there are no public services, and very few structures or homes are visible from the grave. The site is a rare opportunity to experience, as close a possible, what traveling the California Trail in the 1850s was like.<br /> <br /> <strong>NOTE:</strong> if you go, it is important to know that, currently, there are no directional signs to the site, nor are there any signs marking/ identifying the parking area for the site.<br /> <br /> <strong>The grave itself is on private land.</strong> Visitors are welcome to view it; however, it does require calling the land owner when you arrive as there is a locked gate across the road to Lane's Grave.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Laurel Hill was once the site of the most difficult descent on the Oregon Trail. Laurel Hill Chute descends off the southern slopes of Mount Hood and the hill was a series of three steep declines. <br /> <br /> For the descent of Laurel Hill, immigrants locked their wagon wheels and dragged huge logs under their wagons to slow their slide down the 60-percent grade. The repeated scraping of wheels and logs down the mountainside created a rocky “chute” that gradually grew impassable with use, forcing immigrants to find another place to lower their wagons. Several chutes were created in this area.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Highway 26, near Government Camp, Oregon)<br /> <br /> Begin your visit at the large wooden informational sign at the north end of the pullout. A path (<strong>Laurel Hill Chute Trail 795A</strong>) climbs about 60 stone steps through the woods and up the hill to another segment of the historic Old Mt. Hood Loop Highway. At the top of the steps, turn right and walk along the macadam about 100 yards to the interpretive sign on your left. Here you are standing at the midpoint of a possible wagon descent chute. Above you the chute is heavily eroded. Now turn and look below the road. The original chute continued down to the flat area at the tree line. <br /> <br /> From the edge of the road, the descent is about as steep as any other route down the face of Laurel Hill would have been in covered-wagon days. (Visitors are advised against using the narrow, steep trail next to the chute.) About another 100 yards past the chute, a footpath (<strong>Laurel Hill Chute Trail 795A</strong>) climbs 150 feet up a series of switchbacks to the top of the wagon chute, where visitors will find another interpretive sign and an impressive view of the descent.

    "audioDescription": "Lone Elm Campground. 434 words<br /><br />As the road enters this city park, there is a large sign on the right that reads in part, \"Lone Elm is one of the most historic and important frontier trail camp sites in America and was used as a campground and rendezvous point for all three of our nation's great western roads to the frontier - the Santa Fe, Oregon and California Trails...<br /><br />\"Lone Elm was first known as Round Grove...By the mid-18402 this campground became known as Lone Elm because the original grove had been reduced to just one huge elm tree...By the end of the 1840s, the great old lone elm tree was gone, used up for firewood.<br /><br />\"Newton Ainsworth was the first owner of this property in post-trail days, developing a successful farm here. He was a tireless advocate of Lone Elm and its location on his farm. He also was instrumental in the placement of the Daughters of the American Revolution Santa Fe Trail marker in 1906. This marker still graces the same spot today on the northwest corner of Lone Elm Park.\"<br /><br />Past the sign, the entrance road curves to the left past a large relief sculpture of a covered wagon and team of 4 oxen set well back from the left side of the road. A stone marker in front tells us that the sculpture is \"Trails West\" by Eldon Tefft originally commissioned in 1994 and placed at the Kansas Visitor Center. In 2003 it was restored and erected here.<br /><br />The road then proceeds around to a parking area in front of a large covered picnic pavilion. The pavilion is made of large wood posts and beams set on stone foundations and has a large stone fireplace and chimney.<br /><br />To the left of the pavilion is a paved patio with 4 wayside signs on the edge and, in the middle, a metal grill covering a hand-dug well. A small sign reads, \"Kansas Heritage Feature - Hand-dug well. This well supported early agriculture by providing water for livestock, crops and people. The well was likely constructed in the late 1800s and remained in use throughout the 1900s. The well is 15 feet in total depth.\" Water may be seen below through the grill.<br /><br />The wayside signs discuss the Santa Fe Trail and the Oregon and California Trails, all three of which passed this way; the use of the land here as a campground along this branch of Cedar Creek; the travelers that passed through, both famous and infamous; and the history of the campground as it turned into a farm and then to a park.",

The land is covered with sagebrush prairie as far as the eye can see, dotted here and there with junipers and other small trees. Large black boulders top the ridge next to the parking lot. A large sign at the edge of the parking lot is titled \"Sagebrush, symbol of the West.\" It reads, \"Of all the habitats in the West, the sagebrush high desert has fared the worst! The shrub-steppe is home to over 200 kinds of birds and 30 kinds of mammals. Big sagebrush is a highly nutritious and digestible food source containing four times the protein of other range vegetation in the winter for big game animals such as mule deer, elk and antelope. Sagebrush also provides cover for mule deer and pronghorn fawns, elk calves, nesting birds, grouse broods, and pygmy rabbits. Over 90% of the sagebrush sea that once covered much of the American West has been converted to cropland, grassland, or urban development. Several wildlife species use sagebrush for critical food, nest, rest, escape. Some species, such as sage grouse, are wholly dependent on sagebrush habitat for survival.\"<br /><br />From the end of the parking lot, a paved walkway leads down a slight slope to the visitor center, a flat, one-story building, with rough stone work on the right and vertical tan-colored siding on the left. An opening leads to a covered patio that runs along the left side of the building. The entrance is directly ahead of you. As you enter the information desk is ahead and slightly to the left.<br /><br />Outside on the wood-floored patio, there is a series of signs along the railing that forms a long map of the Oregon Trail.",

In between is a large gray sign that reads, \"McLoughlin House Site, a unit of Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.\" The house on the left has a small sign over the front door that tells us this is the McLoughlin House, Georgian style, 1846. It is a two story, white-frame house with a hip roof, with all sides slanting down to the walls, covered with gray shingles and two chimney stacks, one at either end. The plain front has a dark door in the exact center flanked by two paned windows on either side. The second story has five paned windows. The side sidewalk leads to a flagstone covered porch area with two steps. In front of trimmed bushes along the left front is a large boulder with a metal plaque that reads, \"National Historic Site, McLoughlin Hose. In the city he founded in this house he built, lived Dr. John McLoughlin, 1846-57. He won enduring fame or his generous and humane aid to early American settlers in the Oregon country, as chief factor and superintendent of the Hudson's Bay Company in this territory, 1824-45. In 1850, Dr. McLoughlin presented this park to Oregon City. In 1851 he became a citizen of the United States. His house, which originally stood closer to the river, was removed to this location in 1909.\"<br /><br />The house on the right is much smaller. The roof slants down in front and extends to cover the low porch that runs across the front, supported by four white posts. The wood siding is painted a soft yellow with white trim surrounding the door and the two paned windows on either side. Neatly clipped hedge line the front walk and the small square lawn on either side of the walk. A small sign post in front reads, \"National Historic Site, Welcome. Barclay House, 1850.\" A metal plaque in a stone marker reads, \"Dr. Forbes Barclay, 1812-1873. Dr. Forbes Barclay left Scotland in 1839 for Fort Vancouver, Washington, where he became chief physician for Hudson's Bay Company. He moved to Oregon City in 1850 where he practiced medicine for many years. He was one of Oregon City's early mayors councilman for 9 years, coroner for 18 years, and superintendent of the first public school for 15 years.\"<br /><br />In between the two houses, at the back of the property, is a small grave plot surrounded by a wrought iron fence. The double grave is covered with green ivy. The gray granite headstone has two white marble arched stones embedded in it, the engraving much worn. The one on the left reads, Margaret McLoughlin and the one on the right reads Dr. John McLoughlin.",

    "audioDescription": "Minor Park. 459 words<br /><br />If you stand at the rear of the small parking lot with your back to the street, a sidewalk leads 25 yards to the left, gently curving to the right around a large tree. A wayside sign sits at the end of the sidewalk. Ahead of you is a broad, grassy lawn dotted with scattered trees ending at an overgrown meadow. Several swales can be seen crossing that lawn from right to left, coming up the gentle slope to the river about a quarter of a mile to the left. Feel free to walk across the lawn and over the swales. The first one is about 12 yards from the end of the sidewalk. The largest one is 100 yards away at the edge of the meadow. That one is 20 yards wide and five feet deep. Standing in that swale is a granite marker commemorating the Santa Fe Trail, erected by the Daughters of the American Revolution.<br /><br />The wayside sign is titled, \"Trail Hazards.\" An illustration shows a large covered wagon with a team of six oxen stopped on a muddy trail, a river visible in the distance behind them. The wagon sits tilted toward the rear right corner, where one wheel has been removed as two men work on repairs. The caption reads, \"Crossing the Big Blue river before a bridge was built in 1859 was hard on people, animals and equipment. Before crossing, wagon travelers might camp while waiting for others to cross or for swollen waters to recede. Once across, they had to stop to dry out and rearrange their loads. And with the jostling and wrenching by swift currents their wagons often needed repairs.\"<br /><br />Main text on the panel reads, \"From the late 1830s and into the 1860s, thousands of traders, emigrants and gold prospectors passed this way. After crossing the Big Blue River, covered wagons struggled up this hill due to the mud left behind from torrential spring downpours. Over the years, thousands of wagon wheels and hooves churned the earth and rain washed away the loose soil, creating the swales before you.<br /><br />Lumbering freight wagons heading for Santa Fe carried tons of trade goods, such as bolts of fabric and boxes of tools and cookware. On a return trip a trader might transport wool, mules, coins, silver bars or gold dust as payment for goods. Emigrants and gold prospectors also passed by here on their way to Oregon or California. Pulled by oxen or mules, their wagons carried enough food and other necessities to last several months.\"<br /><br />A small map on the right side shows the three trails that passed this way: the Oregon and California trails heading northwest and the Santa Fe Trail heading southwest.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Mitchell Pass is a gap between Scotts Bluff and South Bluff. In 1850, a wagon road was built through what was then called \"Devil's Gap\", and it became the primary route for emigrants (pioneers heading west), soldiers, Pony Express riders and the Transcontinental telegraph. Prior to 1851, emigrants would have used <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/robidoux-pass.htm\">Robidoux Pass</a> to bypass Scotts Bluff. <br /> <br /> In 1851, William Lobenstine wrote in his journal:</p> <p><em>\"The rock itself is separated nearly at it's middle, having a pass here fifty to sixty feet wide, ascending at both sides perpendicular to a height of three to four hundred feet.</em></p> <p><em>The passage through here was only made possible in 1851 and is now preferred by nearly all emigrants, cutting off a piece of eight miles from the old road.\"</em></p> <p>Mitchell Pass was named for nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/fort-mitchell-site.htm\">Fort Mitchell</a>, which was named after United States Brigadier General Robert B. Mitchell. <br /> <br /> Today, visitors to Scotts Bluff National Monument can walk through Mitchell Pass on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/oregon-trail-pathway.htm\">Oregon Trail Pathway</a>, a half-mile long hiking trail. </p>",

His wagons became the best known on the western trails. <br /> <br /> Murphy’s wagons consisted of wheels, running gear, a box and a cover. They were usually nine feet high with a twelve foot long bed. The bed of a Murphy wagon had a straight box, unlike its more famous counterpart, the Conestoga, which had a curved box. A Murphy could comfortably haul between 1,800 to 2,200 pounds. Straying too far from these specifications risked serious problems.<br /> <br /> Oxen were most often used for pulling this type of wagon. It required two yoke of oxen, a yoke consisting of two oxen. A spare yoke often trailed behind so the livestock could be rotated and rested. <br /> <br /> For those who preferred mules, an equivalent number of yoke could have been used in place of oxen.  Horses were rarely if ever used. They lacked the strength and endurance needed to pull a wagon 2,000 miles. They also required costly supplemental feed. <br /> <br /> The Murphy wagon at Scotts Bluff was purchased from the Dewitts Buggy Works Company in 1979 and donated to the Monument by the Oregon Trail Museum Association.",

He stands, a horse's head drooping to his right, with right hand raised to shade his eyes as he gazes into the distance.<br /><br />The main entrance is at the rear of the courtyard through double doors in the older, brick part of the building.

A tall state historical sign stands in the gravel area, reading in part \"Beginning in 1843, thousands of Oregon Trail emigrants trekked through this region toward new lives in the West. This epic journey indelibly etched the landscape with wagon ruts, such as those near by. When Henry Griffin, a prospector from California, discovered gold eight miles southwest of present-day Baker City in 1861, the emigration pattern changed radically. Eastern Oregon quickly became a destination for gold-seekers and settlers-many arrived from the Willamette Valley reversing their initial journey along the Oregon Trail to settle in this area.\"<br /><br />A small metal gate and pass-through jog in the fence leads to a short dirt path through the sagebrush. At the start of the path, a wayside sign reads in part, \"Of the 2170 miles of the Oregon Trail, approximately 300 miles of ruts remain. Swales created by thousands of wagon wheels and the trampling of draft animals are deep in some areas, shallow in other places. Much of the trail has disappeared due to natural erosion, and development of farms, highways, cities and towns. In some places, the Oregon Trail, or Emigrant Road as it was generally called in the 19th century, was later used by automobiles.<br /><br />\"The Oregon Trail route followed the easiest grades wherever possible. Here, the trail came from the southeast across Virtue Flat. It headed northwest towards Baker Valley and the divide in the low hills to the north. In any place where level open ground permitted, wagons spread out rather than follow single file. There are three sets of ruts through this segment, however the second and third set are very faint.<br /><br />\"It is permissible to walk in the trail ruts on public land, but please help preserve the trail for others to see by avoiding any activity that might erode or damage ruts. If following trail rut traces, please get permission before crossing from public land to private land. Close any gates you open and pack out litter.\"<br /><br />The path leads to a section of easily discernable parallel ruts extending to the right and the left.",

    "audioDescription": "National Historic Trails Interpretive Center. 322 words<br /><br />Seen from the parking lot, the building is a low, one-story, circular structure, almost blending in with the prairie vegetation surrounding it. A series of shiny, royal-blue wall segments stair-step out from the center of the building and extend to the left. The sidewalk leads to the left, then curves back to the right, around the blue wall to reach the front of the building. Along the left edge of the sidewalk are four tall panels, one for each of the trails commemorated here: the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, the Pony Express Trail and the Mormon Trail, each associated with a different color, which is then echoed in bricks placed in the sidewalk along with flat stones engraved with quotes from emigrants.<br /><br />At the front of the building, a large triangular patio extends to the left, dotted with stone benches. To reach the entrance, follow the rough stone wall on the right side of the walkway. This wall then becomes a tunnel, with a dark green wall on the left and topped with a covering supported by semi-circular metal beams, echoing the shape of a covered wagon. Spaced randomly in the stone wall are larger stones with images of prominent geographical features along the trails, such as Chimney Rock, Natural Bridge, Laramie Peak and Fort Laramie.<br /><br />Entering the front doors brings you into a large, open lobby space. In the middle of this space is a welcome kiosk with a map of the facility. The exhibit space may be reached through an opening in the wall beyond the kiosk or by following the curving hallway to the right. Restrooms are also along the right-hand hallway.<br /><br />The information desk is off to the left of the kiosk. From the desk, the gift shop will be to your left. To your right at that point is stone wall with names of donors carved into the blocks.",

    "bodyText": "<p>When William Becknell and his party made their consequential first trip on the Santa Fe Trail, it is likely that they passed through the New Santa Fe area, and perhaps crossed the ruts that are still visible in the New Santa Fe Cemetery. Located at the westernmost border of the US, New Santa Fe (now part of Kansas City, MO) was a gateway to the adventure and challenges of trail travel.Thus, the area was a significant transition point on the trail. It was a place for outfitting and loading for travel west. It was also a place where goods and silver from Santa Fe could be unloaded and distributed. <br /> <br /> When emigrant traffic began to grow in the 1840’s, trails to Oregon and California shared this path with the Santa Fe Trail. Thus, these trail swales saw not only heavy commercial traffic, but significant emigration traffic. Because it was, for several years, the last stop in the US, it was an important milestone for those leaving behind what they knew for a chance at a new life. After the discovery of gold in 1848, many “49ers” also used this path on their way to find wealth in the gold fields. <br /> <br /> By the late 1840’s, a stage stop on this route called “New Santa Fe” offered several amenities: a post office, two general stores, an inn, a shoe shop, drugstore, blacksmith, and saloon. Seeing the success of the area, Dabney Lipscomb platted the town of New Santa Fe in 1851. Conflict on the Missouri-Kansas border in 1860 prior to the Civil War disrupted traffic on the trail and led to a decline in the town. <br /> <br /> By the time the New Santa Fe Cemetery was designated as a burial ground in 1880, trail traffic had dissipated, but the ruts may have still served as a road for cemetery visitors. Though the cemetery post-dates significant trail traffic, it helped protect the ruts from the fate faced by most in the area. As Kansas City grew, the town of New Santa Fe was dismantled and replaced by modern development. The swales in the cemetery are a unique historical remnant amongst the surrounding urban environment.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (122nd Street and State Line Road, Kansas City, MO)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> The New Santa Fe Cemetery now sits in the heart of a residential neighborhood developed in the 1980’s. Spanning the cemetery’s entrance is a delicate metal sign that reads “New Santa Fe.” A historical marker and an informational exhibit sit on either side of the entrance and explain the history and importance of New Santa Fe and the trail ruts. The ruts are met on both sides by burial plots intentionally spaced to leave the ruts undisturbed. The ruts are visible as depressions in the grassy land. The cemetery also features mature trees, and weathered gravestones from the late 1800’s.  </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/safe/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"http://www.newsantafe.org/\">More site information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elte/index.htm\">Santa Fe National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail </a></h2> <p> </p>",

    "audioDescription": "North Platte River Crossing. 431 words<br /><br />This historic bridge lies just east of the modern highway bridge. This one-lane bridge has three spans, each a low arch about 15 feet high, made of iron, now rusty-brown in color. There are \"I\" beam piers at the beginning and end of each arch. The flooring is formed by broad planking, now a weathered gray. The bridge is much longer than the current width of the river. Only the northern span still has water underneath.<br /><br />At the southern end of the bridge, at the edge of the dirt parking lot, is a wayside sign titled, \"Spanning a Century: End of an Era.\" A historic photograph on the sign shows the bridge in 1877 when the water stretched from end to end of the bridge. Text reads in part, \"Once broad and turbulent, the North Platte River posed a formidable obstacle to 19th century travelers. High water made it nearly impossible to cross the river for several month each year. The crossing became less dangerous by 1850 when ferry service was established to meet the growing volume of military and emigrant traffic.\" It goes on to tell us that after the Great Sioux Reservation was established in 1868, huge amount of supplies were needed to be transported to supply the Indian agencies, leading Congress to fund construction of a bridge. Text at the bottom of the sign reads, \"The King Iron Bridge Company built bridges with speed and efficiency by standardizing the manufacturing process and maintaining stockpiles of prefabricated parts. The triple-span Fort Laramie Bridge was constructed between August 1875 and February 1876 for $15,000. Rubble-filled log ice breakers protect the unique I-beam piers supporting the bridge. Spanning 400 feet, this bridge is the best-preserved King paten tubular bowstring iron bridge still in existence.\"<br /><br />To the right of the bridge, a trail leads down to the water's edge, then proceeds eastward along the bank. Another wayside sign by the river tells of initial skirmishes between the military and the Lakota Sioux, the beginnings of the Northern Plains Indian wars, which finally ended in 1890 at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.<br /><br />At the northern end of the bridge are 2 markers. One identifies the bridge as a Wyoming Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The other marker, protected by a metal rail fence, reads, \"Old Army Bridge over the Platte River, erected in 1875. This bridge was a vital link between Cheyenne, Fort Laramie and the military outposts, Indian agencies and gold fields of the Black Hills Dakota Regions. Placed by the Historical Landmark Commission of Wyoming, July 1951.\"",

    "audioDescription": "O'Fallon's Bluff at Sutherland Rest Area. 365 words<br /><br />From the parking area at this rest stop, a sidewalk leads around the rest room building on the right side, loops behind it, then turns right, away from the building, out to where swales can be seen running roughly parallel to the highway. About halfway out a small loop to the left passes a low brick wall with a sign on top. The metal sign, which has raised lettering, is titled \"The Great Platte River Road.\" It reads in part, \"This is the Platte River Valley, Americas great road west. It provided a natural pathway for westward expansion across the continent during the nineteenth century. Here passed the Oregon Trail, following the South Platte River along much the same route as the highway over which you now travel. Beginning in 1841, nearly 250,000 travelers crossed the plains to Oregon and California over this important overland route. Here at O'Fallon's Bluffs, the wagon trains faced one of the most difficult and dangerous spots on the trail. The Platte River cut directly against the bluff, making it necessary to travel the narrow roadway over O'Fallon's Bluffs.\"<br /><br /> A stone bench is on a low wall at the right side of this loop. <br /><br />At the far end of the sidewalk is another sign with raised lettering. This one is titled, \"Crossing the Overland Trail.\" It reads in part, \"Beneath this platform, evidence of the great westward migration still remains. These shallow depressions were once deep ruts created by thousands of hooves, shoes and wheels. The Overland Trail is often visualized as a single, well-defined roadway. However, except in narrow spots such as this, the actual route through the Platte Valley during any given year varied considerably, depending upon such factors as soil conditions and the availability of grass for the animals.\"<br /><br />Looking both right and left from this sign you can see shallow swales coming up the slope from the left. Large iron wagon-wheel shapes have been mounted in several places to clearly mark the shallow depressions in the grassy slope. Two sets of four wheels are off to your left and two more sets are off to the right.",

    "bodyText": "<p>In 1800, America's western border reached only as far as the Mississippi River. Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 the country nearly doubled in size and pushed its western edge past the Rocky Mountains. Yet the wilderness known as Oregon Country (which included present-day Oregon, Washington and part of Idaho) still belonged to the British, a fact that made many Americans eager to settle the region and claim it for the United States.</p> <p>American Indians had traversed this country for many years, but for European Americans it was unknown territory. Lewis and Clark's secretly funded expedition in 1803 was part of a U.S. Government plan to open Oregon Country to settlement. However, the hazardous route blazed by this party was not feasible for families traveling by wagon. An easier trail was needed.</p>   <p>Robert Stuart of the Astorians (a group of fur traders who established Fort Astoria on the Columbia River in western Oregon) became the first white man to use what later became known as the Oregon Trail. Stuart's 2,000-mile journey from Fort Astoria to St. Louis in 1810 took 10 months to complete; still, it was a much less rugged trail than Lewis and Clark's route.</p> <p>It wasn't until 1836 that the first wagons were used on the trek from Missouri to Oregon. A missionary party headed by Marcus and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/learn/historyculture/narcissa-whitman.htm\">Narcissa Whitman</a> bravely set out to reach the Willamette Valley. Though the Whitmans were forced to abandon their wagons 200 miles short of Oregon, they proved that families could go west by wheeled travel.</p> <p>In the spring of 1843, a wagon train of nearly 1,000 people organized at Independence, Missouri with plans to reach Oregon Country. Amidst an overwhelming chorus of naysayers who doubted their success, the so-called \"Great Migration\" made it safely to Oregon. Crucial to their success was the use of South Pass, a 12-mile wide valley that was virtually the sole place between the plains and Oregon where wagons could cross the formidable Rocky Mountains.</p> <p>By 1846, thousands of emigrants who were drawn west by cheap land, patriotism or the promise of a better life found their way to Oregon Country. With so many Americans settling the region, it became obvious to the British that Oregon was no longer theirs. They ceded Oregon Country to the United States that year.</p> <p><br /> <strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2>",

On the far side of the fence, the land falls away down into a valley filled with houses. At the left end of the parking lot is a cement patio with wooden benches surrounding small trees. Just beyond is a small building with restrooms. Along the fence at the edge of the patio are two wayside signs. One sign has a map of the public footpaths that go in either direction from here and which follow alongside some of the original ruts of the Oregon trail. Text on the other sign explains that the \"land itself is much the same as in 1851: Table Rock, mounding up from the valley floor; the Boise River, described by on Oregon Trail traveler as a stream â€˜which is as clear and fine as a mountain torrent which it is of the finest kind'; and the three plateaus south of the river. Only steps away are original ruts of the Oregon Trail, fanning out across the plain. The Kelton Ramp, three-quarters of a mile from here is whittled from solid rock. A marvel of Civil War engineering and ingenuity.\"<br /><br />Behind the building is an opening in the fence where a gravel path heads down a slight slope and leads to two parallel gravel paths extending to the right and the left. In between these two paths is a stretch of sagebrush-covered ground where there is a track with twin ruts, clearly marking the location of the wagon trail. A small sign tells us \"These are the actual wagon ruts of the Oregon Trail. Please preserve this historic footprint from the past by staying only on designated, maintained trails. Thank you for your cooperation. These ruts were etched in the ground from 1843 to 1867.\"",

The main, half-mile loops leads out to the Oregon Trail remnants, follows it for a short distance, then loops back.

    "audioDescription": "At the side of the entrance road is a wayside sign titled \"Ruts, Swales and Traces.\" A shallow depression can be seen extending away on either side of the road at this point. Narrow white posts, labeled \"California Trail\" and \"Oregon Trail\" are widely spaced along the swale.<br /><br />Text on the sign reads, \"As many as 350,000 people and tens of thousands of covered wagons traveled the Oregon Trail between 1840 and 1870. Countless feet, hooves, and iron-rimmed wheels cut and compacted the ground, leaving lasting traces still visible on many western landscapes.<br /><br />Migrants preferred sturdy farm wagons, roughly half the size of a Conestoga to carry what possessions and supplies would fit. The wagon box was about four feet wide, three feet deep and 10 to 12 feet long. The covered box sat over two pairs of wheels of different sizes: front wheels about 44 inches in diameter, and rear wheels about 50 inches in diameter.<br /><br />The narrow iron rims on the wheels, pressed into the earth by the weight of the wagon and its 1600 to 1800 pound load, left a visible legacy across the landscape. In places, faint two-track depressions provide evidence where wagons once rolled across mostly level ground.<br /><br />Elsewhere are deeper depression with sloping sides, called swales. Swales are often found on slopes and at the crests of hills, where the oxen dug in their hooves and strained to pull their heavy load. In wide open places, visitors to the old Oregon Trail might see two, three or more side-by-side lines of depressions, swales, ruts, tracks or scars. These multiple traces were created wherever wagons could spread out across the landscape to pass other parties or just to escape the choking dust kicked up by those ahead.\"<br /><br />More text on the right reads, \"The best wheels were made of well-seasoned, durable hardwoods such as white oak or Osage orange. The wooden rim, or â€˜felloes,' could be made by steaming and bending wood to form a circle. The wheelwright selected an iron hoop somewhat smaller than the wooden wheel and heated it at a forge. As it heated, the hoop expanded. The hot band of iron was hammered snugly around the rim and set aside to cool and shrink. The powerful grip of the finished iron tire held the wheel securely together and protected it from rocks, grinding sand, and other hazards of the road.\"<br /><br />Past the sign and the swale, the road leads to a parking lot at the edge of the river. There is a small boat launch, picnic tables and pavilions, a restroom and children's playground. The river here is smooth and broad with low hills rising on the far side behind grassy rangeland.",

    "audioDescription": "The sandy dirt parking area sits in the middle of this grassy park. Between the parking lot and the highway is a berm topped by a covered wagon with a pair of replica oxen, slightly smaller than life size. A short sidewalk leads from the parking area to the base of the berm where there are four wayside signs and a metal box on a post which holds a sign-in register. As you face the berm from the parking area, the dirt road makes a small loop to your right around a flagpole. To the right of the loop is a small picnic pavilion. Past the lop, near the edge of a wooded area in a white building with restrooms, women to the left and men to the right.<br /><br />Behind you is another wayside sign in front of small plots of vegetation. The sign is almost illegible, but it tells us that the plantings represent native prairie vegetation including wild flowers, western wheat grass, side oats gama little blue stem, switch grass, big blue stem and indian grass.<br /><br />Near the entrance from the highway is a large wagon wheel with letters that read Oregon Trail Park. On the right as you enter is a small sign that reads, \"Scott Spring. The reservoir before you taps into the famous Scott Spring. The original outlet emanates from the base of a steep rock hill to the east. The refreshing water of Scott Spring offered abundant drinking water to many travelers on the Oregon Trail and became an inviting camp site on their long journey. The spring currently waters livestock and feeds Rock Creek just as it did so many years ago.\"<br /><br />The first two waysides near the left end of the berm are titled The Long Journey and One Step at a Time. The next one is titled, \"The Wagon and Team - Supplies Needed.\" It tells us that a typical wagon and cover would cost $185. It also tells us that oxen were often preferred over mules because they were much gentler, steadier and in case of dire need could be eaten. Supplies included 1060 pounds of flour, 700 pounds of bacon, 150 pounds of sugar and 75 pounds of rice. One wagon could hold up to 2400 pounds.<br /><br />The last sign, titled Route of the Oregon Trail, tells us that of the 300,000 or so emigrants who followed the trails, about 30,000 died along the way. A nearby monument marks the grave of a child at the Scott Spring campsite and other graves have been found in the woods.",

Before 1851, pioneers used Robidoux Pass since the badlands between the river and the bluff made travel impossible. Nine miles south of Scotts Bluff, the pass offered a spring and a trading post operated by the Robidoux brothers.</p>   <p>In 1851, Mitchell Pass was opened and became the main route for the emigrants (pioneers heading west).<br /> <br /> In 1851, William Lobenstine wrote in his journal:</p> <p><em>\"The rock itself is separated nearly at it's middle, having a pass here fifty to sixty feet wide, ascending at both sides perpendicular to a height of three to four hundred feet.</em></p> <p><em>The passage through here was only made possible in 1851 and is now preferred by nearly all emigrants, cutting off a piece of eight miles from the old road.\"</em></p> <p>Mitchell Pass, known during the 1850's as \"Devil's Gap\" became the principle route of the military, pony express and the telegraph. Mitchell Pass was named after United States Brigadier General Robert B. Mitchell.</p> <p>The covered wagons in front of the Scotts Bluff National Monument administrative building mark the start of the Oregon Trail Pathway. The smaller Studebaker and Murphy wagons were the mode of transportation for families. The larger Conestoga wagon was not often used on the Oregon Trail, but was used to haul freight. Living history demonstrations occur at the Murphy wagon during the summer.</p> <p>When the trail surface changes from asphalt to dirt, you are walking \"on\" the actual Oregon Trail. Today, after over 150 years of erosion of the soft rocks, individual wheel ruts are not visible. What is visible is called a \"swale,\" which is a deep roadbed that was created by wagons traveling single file through Mitchell Pass.</p> <p>After crossing Mitchell Pass, the trail becomes paved again, and the Oregon Trail's path is marked by wooden posts in the trail's center. Near the end of the hiking trail is the site where William Henry Jackson camped and sketched while working as a bullwhacker on a wagon train in 1866.</p>",

The sign in the middle shows a map of the site here with a trail that starts at your right as you face the signs, winds up to the top of the ridge where four-foot deep tracks wagon tracks are preserved in the soft sandstone, then loops back to the far side of the parking lot. It tells us that this site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975.<br /><br />The paved sidewalk passes several wayside signs as it winds up the hillside. There are also several benches along the way. As you get close to the top, the walkway changes to a series of broad shallow steps.<br /><br />The signs along the way up cover such topics as the U.S. Army's role in protecting the Oregon Trail in Wyoming from 1842 to 1870, the four forts and numerous military stations and camps, and excerpts from writings by the soldiers themselves.<br /><br />Close to the top of the hill is a large stone monument with a metal plaque that reads, \"Oregon Trail Ruts has been designated a Registered National Historic Landmark under the provision of the Historic Sites Act of August 31, 1935. This site possesses exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States. U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, 1966.\"<br /><br />The sidewalk opens to a circular area at the top of the hill with a low curb along the left side. To reach the ruts themselves, turn left at the start of the curb and cross the rough sandstone about 15 feet. The ruts form a deep trough in the grey stone, especially towards the left, where the sides of the trough reach four feet in height. Feel free to walk along the ruts and touch the steep sides.<br /><br />At the left end of the paved area is a large brown, state historical sign that discusses the different classes of peoples who used the trail. Along the right side of the paved area are two benches and more wayside signs which discuss the trail and the soldiers' stories. On beyond, the sidewalk makes a long, more gradual, switchback descent back to the parking lot, passing another section of deeply rutted rock outcropping on the way.",

The wheels of countless wagons and stagecoaches gouged deep, trough-like swales and cuts in the banks where they crossed the stream. Look for two older crossing points that have caved in and one closer to the road that remains in excellent condition.

Going left, it leads to a semicircular area bounded by a low stone wall with a wayside sign, titled \"Prairie Highway.\" An illustration shows a large covered wagon pulled by oxen. The sign reads in part, \"Over 100 years ago, the gentle grassy depression in front of you was one of the most important highways in North America. Here, you'd see wagon trains on the Santa Fe Trail winding through a rolling landscape covered with thick, waist-high prairie grasses. Imagine thousands of trade wagons rumbling and creaking back and forth between Missouri and New Mexico. Wagons - and the hooves of the oxen and mules that pulled them - wore this road into the earth. By the 1840s, emigrants bound for Oregon and California Trails wore it even deeper. Here, the prairie is gone. Wind and rain have smoothed the rough dirt road into a gentle swale - a subtle reminder of a once-great highway.\"<br /><br />By moving around the stone wall and walking out onto the grassy lawn you may be able to feel the swale that crosses from left to right, although it is very shallow. About 40 feet out, on the other side of the swale, is a cement post with a small marker for the Santa Fe Trail.",

Gilliard laid out the Ash Hollow Cemetery sometime in the late 1880s around the grave of Rachel Pattison whose grave was left clearly marked and dated at the time of her death along the Oregon Trail in 1849.\"<br /><br />About halfway up the hill, the sidewalk turns to the right. When it ends, the grave of Rachel Pattison is on your left. A flat gray stone marker covers her grave, carved letters reading \"in memory of Rachel Pattison.\" At the head of the grave, a tall cement marker, decorated with rounded river rocks, has a glass front covering a niche which holds her original gravestone. The small white tombstone has rough carving that reads, \"1849, Rachel E. Pattison, age 18, June 19, 1849.\"<br /><br />To the left of the marker a metal sign on a short pole tells the story of the Pattison party. It reads in part, \"'Rachel taken sick in the morning, died in the night.' ... Thus did 23-year-old Nathan Pattison record the death of his wife of two months. Nathan and Rachel were married April 3, 1849, in Randolph County, Illinois. They left their homes near Sparta just one week later to take the trail to Oregon. Their company consisted primarily of Nathan's immediate family: his parents, William and Mary; five brothers; and Williams' aunt, Charlotte Irwin. Nathan's brother James was accompanied by his wife Jane and their infant son.\"<br /><br />A stone marker on the other side of the grave reads, \"Oregon Trail marked by the State of Nebraska, 1913. Trail, 65 feet east. Old spring, 2,550 feet south. Ash Hollow Battlefield about nine miles northwest on Blue Creek.\"<br /><br />Another small metal sign further to the left discusses evidence for the presence of two more early graves. Diarists of 1852 describe three \"old graves,\" meaning graves from a previous year, here at this location. There is evidence that Josiah Keeran, died June 1849, and Daniel Sanford Johnson, died May 1850, were buried close to Rachel's grave.",

Among the over 350,000 emigrants that went through Rattlesnake pass between 1840 and 1870, was Frederick Richard Fulkerson. 18 year old Frederick was following the Trail to Oregon with his family. While crossing the Platte River, he became chilled and exhausted when he swam the river in an effort to keep the families stock animals from being carried downstream. Frederick passed away several weeks later while the Fulkersons where camped at Rattlesnake Pass.

    "audioDescription": "Rattlesnake Pass. 250 words<br /><br />A narrow, abandoned, broken paved road goes through the pass here south of Devil's Gate, curving around the end of a granite ridge on the north side. Some of the boulders are close to the edge of the road and emigrant inscriptions can be seen carved in the rock. On the south side of the road is a pioneer grave enclosed by a metal fence. One large stone sits at the end with carvings on it and the grave itself is piled with stones. At the west end of the enclosure is a wooden post with a crosspiece, forming a rough cross. At the other end a sign tells us that the grave of Frederick Richard Fulkerson was noted by forty-niner J.G. Bluff on July 26, 1849, as he traveled through what he termed \"Pass of the Rattlesnake Mountain to the left of Devil's Gate.\" The survival of the large granite boulder used as the Fulkerson headstone and the sketch made by Bluff allows us to locate this grave precisely. It goes on to tell us that the current carving on the boulder, which reads, T.P. Baker, 1864, is believed to be the graffiti of a passing traveler. Baker, whoever he was, left another, nearly identical, inscription on a rock face a half-mile farther on at the bank of the river.<br /><br />Looking both ways through the pass from the graveside, you can see the narrow, white post markers indicating the historic trace of the Oregon Trail.",

    "audioDescription": "Register Cliff Historic Site. 433 words<br /><br />The parking lot here sits parallel to the cliff, which stands about 30 feet high and extends in both directions. The vertical cliff face has clear horizontal layers, some thick and a couple in pinkish tan very thin. In places the mud nests of cliff swallows are clustered. <br /><br />A gravel path runs along the foot of the cliff. Going right, it leads past a pioneer cemetery surround by a stone wall topped with the palings. Old broken gravestones can be seen through the fence. At the far end of the cemetery is a small building housing restrooms. <br /><br />To the left, the path extends to the end of the cliff and then follows as it curves away from us. At the point where the path reaches the far end of the parking lot, there is a large brown sign discussing the cliff markings on the left. It tells us that, although now eroded, dates as early as 1829 and even one from 1797, were once visible and judged to be authentic. At one time Indian pictographs and petroglyphs were also visible.<br /><br />A few yards farther on the right side of the path is a covered kiosk with three large signs. They are titled \"Trail Register,\" \"Register Cliff State Historic Site,\" and \"Homesteaders.\" The last sign explains that a short tunnel blasted out of the base of the cliff, visible to the right of the sign with its entrance protected by a fence, was used as a root cellar by local settlers.<br /><br />Close by is a stone slab monument with two metal plaques on its face. The one on top, about 3 feet up, is circular with a relief carving of a covered wagon and a team of oxen and reads, \"Oregon Trail Memorial.\" Feel free to touch. Below that is another plaque which reads, \"Dedicated to the pioneers of Wyoming. Register Cliff, acquired by the State of Wyoming through gift of the Henry Frederick family, 1932.\"<br /><br />Farther down the path, where the cliff face begins to curve away from you, a side path leads closer to the base of the cliff to a chain-link fence which protects this section of the cliff. Here are some of the oldest carvings, both large and small. Dates easily seen range from 1852 and 1859 to 1928. From this area, a narrow rock trail leads back closer to the cliff base up a small rise to a small lookout with a bench.<br /><br />The main path continues around the end of the cliff where additional carvings, still protected by the metal fencing, can be seen.",

The fifth and final tollgate on the turnpike operated here from 1883 to 1915. Interpretive signs tell the story. Nearby, a replica gate stands between two maple trees, which are believed to have been planted by one of the last tollgate keepers.</p> <blockquote> <p>Lottie Maybe Morris recalled in 1900: \"Night of the second day brought us to the old Barlow Tollgate. It looked like any farm gate... But it was locked and there was no way around it, Thick logs and brush barricaded it on both sides. We paid 25 cents to pass through. It was even a social occasion to meet the toll man, as we had not seen anyone since leaving Cherryville.”</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Highway 26, near Rhododendron, Oregon)<br /> <br /> The site is about 5 miles west of the Laurel Hill pullout.

    "audioDescription": "A small parking lot, 5 - 10 cars, located off the busy Highway 26 in a temperate rainforest. The parking lot consists of gravel and down woody material. It is surrounded by tall conifer and broadleaf trees, all covered in thick green moss. On the east side of the parking lot, adjacent to the highway, is walking path. Along the walking path is an upright exhibit panel describing the replica gate and the history of the site. Continuing along the path reaches an open split-rail, wooden gate. The wood is starting to decay, appearing weathered grayish-brown, and covered in thick green moss. The gate hangs open on the right, or west side of the path. On either side of the path is a short section of wooden split-rain fence, appearance similar to the gate. On the right side of the gate, preventing it from opening any further, is a large, approximately two feet wide, maple tree. The tree truck is covered in thick green moss. The sounds of the nearby river are occasionally drowned out by the cars that rush by on Highway 26.",

    "bodyText": "<h2>History of Robidoux Pass</h2> <p>The earliest travelers to use Robidoux Pass were probably trappers, traders and missionaries who took their pack trains up the North Platte River to the Rocky Mountains in the 1820’s. In 1830, wagons of fur trading cavavans were the first to use the pass and reach the Rocky Mountains, showing the way for the thousands of emigrant wagons to follow. The first wagon train through the pass was the Bidwell-Bartleson Party in 1841. Despite its water and wood, overland travelers were never satisfied with Robidoux Pass because it took them so far away from the North Platte River. A second gap in the bluffs, today called “Mitchell Pass”, skirted the base of the highest promontory and lay closer to the river. Historian Merrill Mathes noted, <em>“Up to and including 1850, the Robidoux Pass route was used almost exclusively by the successive waves of fur traders, missionary parties, soldiers and emigrants. In the year 1851, travel was about equally divided between the two routes. From 1852 onward, Mitchell Pass was heavily favored, although Robidoux Pass was occasionally used.”</em></p> <h3>Who was Robidoux?</h3> <p>Although all the facts are not fully established, it appears that he was Joseph E. Robidoux, oldest son of the Joseph Robidoux who founded St. Joseph, MO. The other “Frenchman” seen there was his uncle, Antoine Robidoux, who earlier achieved pioneering fame in Utah and California. The younger Joseph may well have been the Robidoux who led the first American Fur Company contingent by Scotts Bluff in 1830.</p> <h3>Old Robidoux Pass</h3> <p>Robidoux Pass is a gap passing through the Wildcat Hills about 9 miles west of Gering, Nebraska. The Pass was the route of the Oregon/California Trail from 1841 through 1850. After 1850, the route passed through Mitchell Pass at Scotts Bluff National Monument. Robidoux Pass has an elevation of 4,554 feet.To use Robidoux Pass, travelers had to swing south away from the North Platte River and proceed nearly 30 miles before they rejoined the river near Horse Creek. Fortunately, springs and nearby cedar trees in the pass provided water and wood for their journey.</p> <h3>Robidoux Trading Posts</h3> <p>The trading post at Robidoux Pass was established by either Joseph or Antoine Robidoux. Traders at this post exchanged goods with Indians for beaver skins and buffalo hides. The post also held a temporary monopoly in providing provisions and services to overland travelers and had a blacksmith shop on site that offered emigrants an opportunity to make repairs to trail-damaged wagons and tend footsore oxen and mules. <br /> <br /> There was a second Robidoux Trading Post located in Carter Canyon. It was inhabited by Antonie Robidoux, his Native American wife, and their 5 children. Other trading posts are known to have existed near the pass at the same time as the Robidoux Trading Post. One such trading post was owned by the American Fur Company. Following the opening of Mitchell Pass in 1851, which provided a shorter trail, Robidoux Pass and the trading posts fell into disuse.</p> <h3>What became of Joseph Robidoux?</h3> <p>Joseph E. Robidoux was reported to have died accidentally at Scotts Bluff, but no grave has been identified. There is evidence that he returned to the Great Nemaha Indian Agency in northern Kansas in the late 1850’s and died in obscurity. It is also thought that Antoine Robidoux died in 1860 in St. Louis, Missouri.</p> <h3>Robidoux Pass Today</h3> <p>Today, none of the historic buildings remain at Robidoux Pass. White posts mark the original route of the emigrant trail. Early accounts of the trip through this area note several burials at the site, two of which can still be seen today, including the “Dunn” grave, one of only 7 marked burial sites along the Oregon Trail. Tools, wagon implements, bullets, and other materials have also been found in this area. After the Mitchell Pass route was improved, the Robidoux Pass route faded into obscurity; it was too far out of the way and too far from the water source of the North Platte River.</p> <h3>How To Get There</h3> <p>Today, Robidoux Pass lies on private property, but is still accessible by the general public who are encouraged to respect the wishes and rights of the owners. A gravel road one mile south of the intersection of Five Rocks Road and Old Oregon Trail leads to the site of the old trading post described by a historical marker.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "The entrance drive makes a loop on the top of this steep bluff, enclosed by a stone wall on the right and a wood-and-wire fence on the left. The river lies below, stretching out in the gorge that extends in both directions. A town nestles along the banks at the base of the bluff on the far side. Looking over the wall to the right, we see the narrow road making hairpin turns as it winds up the side of the bluff through mixed woodlands. Looking straight down from the end, we see the interstate highway passing far below.<br /><br />The middle of the looping drive has gravel walks through low plantings of grasses. A metal sign on a large gray boulder tells us the \"Rowena Crest Native Planting was dedicated June 1991 in memory of Robert G.H. Ellis, Jr, conservationist. This area has been restored with plants native to the locale.\" A bench sits in the middle.<br /><br />There are two wayside signs along the stone wall. The one on the right talks about the looping road below. It reads in part, \"Gazing down upon the graceful, winding Historic Columbia River Highway, it is easy to forget how challenging its construction was in the early 20th century. One of the first modern paved thoroughfares in the Pacific Northwest, it traversed a rugged landscape from water level to breathtaking heights above the river. Despite the extreme terrain, engineer John A. Elliott determined that the Highway's eastern section should be built in concert with the gentle turns and grade of its western end as designed by Samuel C. Lancaster. Here, echoing the loops at Crown Point and Hood River, the road climbs a rise, encircles this overlook, and then loops downward in graceful, sweeping S-turns along the cliff face.\"<br /><br />The other sign reads \"Volcanism, uplift, erosion and human endeavor have indelibly etched the Columbia River Gorge. But cataclysmic floods during the last Ice Age (12,000 to 15,000 years ago) affected the landscape before you more than any other terrestrial force, creating these scablands called the Rowen Plateau. As a massive ice sheet advanced from Canada, it dammed rivers with up to 2,000 feet of glacial ice creating huge lakes across Idaho and Montana. The largest of these, 3,000 square mile glacial Lake Missoula, held over 500 cubic miles of water - half the volume of Lake Michigan. When rising waters undermined these ice dams, tremendous floods swept across the land and down the Columbia River. Torrents of water and ice raged downstream as many as 100 times, scouring away soils at elevations up to 1,000 feet.\"",

The marker reads, \"Santa Fe Trail, 1821 - 1872, Marker by the Daughters of the American Revolution and the State of Missouri, 1909.\"<br /><br />Slightly to the right of that, a large stone sign, place perpendicular to the street reads, \"Santa Fe National Historic Trail, Schumacher Park.\" Below that are the three logos for the trails, each shaped like a rounded, equilateral triangle. The one for the Santa Fe Trail shows a covered wagon pulled by a team of 6 oxen. The one for the Oregon Trail shows just a covered wagon. The one for the California Trail shows a yoke for oxen with the curved top bar and two \"U\"-shaped extensions below.<br /><br />To the left of the fenced area a broad, cement sidewalk leads into the park, then curves behind the fencing. Behind the marker, another walkway leads back to a large covered pavilion, about 20 feet wide and 35 feet deep. The front half of this area has picnic tables, two on either side. Along the sides at the rear of the pavilion are 4 waysides signs. One titled \"The Capitalists\" discusses trade and merchantmen. The next is titled \"Los Capitalistas\" and discusses the traders and merchants at the New Mexico end of the Santa Fe Trail. Another is titled \"Bias and Business\" and covers the role of women, American Indians and slaves in trade. The last panel is titled \"Cultures in Collision\" and discusses the impact of the many trail travelers on native populations.<br /><br />The rear of the park property is covered with native prairie plantings -- tall and medium grasses and a variety of wildflowers.<br /><br />On either side of the sidewalk behind the stone marker are two more waysides, one discussing the three trails that passed through this region and the other discussing the role of the Daughters of the American Revolution or DAR in locating and marking the original route of the Santa Fe Trail.<br /><br />From the fenced area, the sidewalk leads another 50 yards to the right to one final wayside sign which discusses the disappearance of trail remnants due to modern development and the use of maps and aerial photographs to identify the routes.",

At the left end, a two-story wing extends back away from the parking lot. Where the two wings meet, the wide sidewalk leads through an archway to the entrance. Dark brown wooden shingles cover the roof. Restrooms are at the far right end of the building.<br /><br />The massive bluff itself, with its tan and brown layers, rises behind and to the left of the building. Immediately to the left is the flat cliff face of the south end, looking like someone sliced it with a knife.<br /><br />The main structure has no windows but there is decorative open grillwork just under the eaves. A curved adobe wall lines the sidewalk from the parking lot. In front to the left of the entrance is a flagpole with a granite-topped, brick vault next to it. Engraved text on the granite reads, \"Time Capsule, sealed December 12, 1994, to be opened December 12, 2069.\"<br /><br />As you enter the building, the information desk extends parallel to the left-hand wall.

    "bodyText": "<p>The bluffs of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/scbl/index.htm\">Scotts Bluff National Monument</a> rise directly from the North Platte River, blocking wagon travel along the river's south bank. At first, emigrants had to take a detour south and use Robidoux Pass, a natural gateway, to get through the bluffs. This mostly stopped in 1850 when a new route was opened at Mitchell Pass. Located close to the North Platte River, this route saved emigrants nearly 15 miles of travel. The route, though, was narrow, due to the land's geography. As such, more than 300,000 emigrants, and their wagons and livestock, had to travel on the same strip of land. Eventually, deep ruts formed as a result of this traffic. These ruts are still visible today and are now a part of Scotts Bluff National Monument. A section of them has been developed into a walking trail with interpretive waysides.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <p>In 1845, General Philip St. George Cooke marveled at the strange formation that rose before him.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Looming afar over river and plain was 'Scott's Bluff,' a Nebraska Gibralter; surmounted by a colossal fortress and a royal castle, it jutted on the water. . . . This morning marched three miles still nearer to that mysterious mountain . . . without being disenchanted of its colossal ruins and phantom occupants.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Three miles west of Gering, Nebraska on Old Oregon Trail (Highway 92 West))</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/oregon-trail-pathway.htm\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",
    "audioDescription": "To reach the walking trail, cross the access road at the left of the visitor center. The sidewalk on the other side leads back to the left towards the highway and then turns right to parallel the highway. Once past the curve, there are four reproductions of different style emigrant vehicles along the right side of the sidewalk as well as several wayside signs. Please feel free to touch any of the vehicles. To the left, on the other side of the road are more bluffs, layered in tan and brown. A cylindrical feature sits on top of the bluff nearest to the road.<br /><br />The first emigrant vehicle along the sidewalk, located about where the surface changes from smooth cement to a rougher aggregate, is a handcart. It has a small, square structure sitting directly over the two large wagon wheels with simple poles and a crosspiece extending in front for pulling it.<br /><br />A wayside sign near the handcart asks which route would you take? Before 1851, many emigrants took a long detour to the south through Robidoux Pass. Later a one-wagon wide trail was created through the ravines of these bluffs here at Mitchell Pass.<br /><br />Next is a common wagon, green in color with off-white canvas stretched on the overhead hoops. The rear wheels are larger than those in the front. The next wagon is very similar, this one painted white.<br /><br />The final wagon is larger, painted pale blue. The wagon bottom is slightly curved to the middle and the front and rear ends are angled outward. This one has a team of model oxen in front, wearing wooden yokes with chains running back to the tongue of the wagon.<br /><br />Past the last wagon, the sidewalk changes to a dirt and gravel path. A wayside sign here tells us that traffic went both ways through the pass. Fur traders traveled both directions, but some of the emigrants gave up and turned back eastward. Others returned to bring other family members out west. Traders drove massive freight wagons in both directions and Army units rode both ways as they patrolled the route.<br /><br />The trail continues around the base of Scotts Bluff, the flat end rising high above you on the right. Meadow vegetation lines the path along with earthen and rocky outcroppings. The path may be rough and uneven in places. More waysides at the end of the trail talk about how emigrants might get assistance along the trail and one shows a painting by William Henry Jackson that depicts the view of the trail looking back eastward through the pass, matching the current location of the sign.",

    "audioDescription": "Shawnee Indian Mission State Historic Site. 411 words<br /><br />This site has three historic, red-brick buildings and several smaller structures on both sides of the street. A stone sign near the entrance to the parking lot reads \"Shawnee Indian Mission\" and directly across the street is a stone marker proclaiming this as a state historic site. Another marker identifies this as a Registered National Historic Landmark. The buildings sit on grassy lawns with scattered trees. Some of the tree are black walnuts with their large round fruits on the ground underneath.<br /><br />One building is right next to the parking lot. A sign on the far side tells us that this is the East Building, erected in 1840-41, which \"provided a chapel and classrooms, and living quarters for the teachers. Indian boys slept in the attic. The first territorial legislature met here in 1855 and enacted the so-called Bogus Laws in an attempt to perpetuate slavery in Kansas.\" To the left of the building at the far end of the parking lot is a plot of land enclosed by split-rail fencing with several historic wooden buildings. Also at that end of the building, out in the middle of the lawn sits a covered wagon. Feel free to touch this exhibit.<br /><br />A sidewalk leads from the end of the East Building nearest the street which crosses a stream via a small wooden bridge and leads to the West Building. This building also has two stories and has a wing extending towards the rear. The wing has a second story porch enclosed by white railings and reached by an outside stairway next to the main building. A sign in front of this building tells us that \"This is the oldest of the three mission buildings now standing. Built in 1839 it was used for classrooms and living quarters for superintendents and teachers. Territorial officials had offices and rooms here in 1854-1856.\"<br /><br />At the front left corner of this building is a garden of native plants. Behind it is a small vegetable garden enclosed by a 4-foot-high wooden fence. <br /><br />The other building sits on the other side of the street. Also two stories, it has a two-story porch along the front with outside stairways leading up from either end. A sign tells us that \"This building, erected in 1845, was the dormitory and school for Indian girls. Here they were taught spinning, weaving, and other domestic arts. Andrew H. Reeder, first territorial governor of Kansas, had executive offices here.\"",

    "audioDescription": "South Pass. 401 words<br /><br />There is a wayside sign here at the intersection of a rough dirt track and the main gravel road. The land stretches away in all directions, sagebrush-covered prairie as far as the eye can see. Cement posts, one to the east along the dirt road and one to the west, mark the path of the Oregon Trail. To the north a distant mountain range can be seen. To the west is the slanted end of a butte, which extends away to the south. Another butte is visible in the distant south.<br /><br />The sign at the intersection reads, \"To the south stand the Oregon Buttes, a major trail landmark. The name is significant because the buttes were roughly the beginning of the Oregon Territory and also helped keep emigrants encouraged, even though there were still hundreds of miles of rough going ahead. Today the Oregon Buttes are an Area of Critical Environmental Concern because of their cultural significance and important wildlife values. <br /><br />\"About twelve miles to the southwest of Oregon Buttes is the Tri-Territory site. This site is the location where the Oregon Territory, Mexican Territory and Louisiana Purchase had a common border. The large landmark, just to the south of where you are standing, is Pacific Butte. The great height and mass of the butte, combined with a ridge to the north paralleling the emigrant trails, helps to create a visual channel through which travelers migrated on their way through South Pass.\"<br /><br />Following the dirt road to the west leads to another wayside sign and a fenced area with two stone markers. Parallel wagon swales are barely discernable through the sagebrush on both sides of the road. The sign tells us the South Pass was first discovered in 1812. Bonneville took the first wagons over the pass in 1832 and Fremont widely publicized the route after his expedition in 1842. Thousands of Mormons, future Oregonians and Californians would use the trail in the following twenty years.<br /><br />The two stone markers are on the north side of the dirt road. The larger one is a five-foot tall rock slab, reddish-tan in color, roughly rectangular with carved lettering that reads, \"Old Oregon Trail, 1843-57.\" The other stone slab marker is about 3 feet tall and is charcoal gray. It reads, \"Narcissa Prentiss Whitman, Eliza Hart Spalding, First white women to cross this pass, July 4, 1836.\"",

It reads, \"South Pass, on top of the world. From where you're standing South Pass doesn't look all that remarkable. But compared to the rugged Wind River Mountains, it can easily be recognized as a type of gateway. Nevertheless, crossing the Continental Divide into 'Oregon Country' was a task for all westward-bound travelers and many described their feelings about the event. In 1852 Lucy Rutledge Cooke, a young woman with 'California Fever' wrote, 'This morn we arrived at the South Pass after which all rivers we see will be running to the Pacific.'\"",

    "audioDescription": "Split Rock. 232 words<br /><br />From the parking lot a paved trail leads out on the flat ridge top to a spot overlooking the flat meadows below. The low vegetation consists primarily of grasses and sagebrush. On the other side of the narrow valley are granite ridges and outcroppings. Several wayside signs are located along the path. <br /><br />One tells us that Split Rock was a well-known trail landmark and navigation aid. Emigrants were guided by the rock for an entire day's travel from the east and it remained in view behind them for another two days. Travel time from here to South Pass was about 6 days. The granite rocks seen in front of you are the side view of Split Rock. Photographs on the sign show the view of the notch from the trail, which passes east of this location. One picture shows a pair of ruts running away from you into the distance. At the upper right is a flat-topped granite hill. On the left side of the flat ridge, is a notch, almost a perfect \"V\" shape.<br /><br />Other signs discuss the Pony Express, wild horses in the west, and the westward trails. Along the trail near the parking lot is a small stone marker with a panel indicating that Split Rock in on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /><br />Restrooms are located at the other end of the parking lot.",

The Studebaker name was as recognizable as Murphy on the trail. As blacksmiths, they provided the hardware for many of the early wagon manufacturers. Nearly every wagon making the journey westward had their components and spare parts. They would later expand into manufacture ring wagons for emigrants and freighting companies.  <br /> <br /> The influence of the family and their adaptive skills would extend into the modern era with the design and production of the Studebaker automobile.<br /> <br /> The Studebaker wagon at Scotts Bluff was purchased by the Monument in 2009.",

Emigrants who used the Oregon Trail settled in numerous places, including throughout Nebraska. This amount grew as land was increasingly claimed in Oregon. Soon, towns formed along the Trail in several locations and they used the Oregon Trail for local transportation.<br /> <br /> As time passed in this part of Nebraska, trains replaced wagons and parts of the Oregon Trail became a railroad. Later still, automobiles replaced trains and the Oregon Trail became a road.

    "audioDescription": "The Archway. 382 words<br /><br />From the parking lot the arched building can be seen extending over the Interstate highway with squat, square towers at either end. The entrance building extends out in front of the tower, with wings on either side. The building is made of large, horizontal logs with light-colored caulking. Broad stone pillars anchor the corners of the lobby and of the wings. The structure is covered with a green metal roof. On top of each of the towers is a gleaming metal sculpture of a leaping horse with huge, fan-shaped wings. <br /><br />Between the building and the parking lot is a fort structure containing a maze. Continuing past that is a large sculpture of a bison by Nebraska artist Gary Ginther. Feel free to touch. In front of the entrance is another sculpture, this one surrounded by a chain fence. The sculpture is of two boys on horseback in full gallop, their bodies pinned together by an arrow. A nearby sign tells us that this work was commissioned by Fred A. Bosselman and sculpted by David L. Biehl in 2011. Titled \"A Narrow Escape,\" it depicts the Martin brothers running from an Indian attack. Both boys survived.<br /><br />In front of the sculpture a circular garden surrounds a flagpole. There are benches along the sidewalk around the garden area. Beyond that, on the other side of the entrance road, is an iron foot bridge over a narrow lake. There are more exhibits and a walking path on the other side.<br /><br />At the right end of the building is an old sign for the Hammer Motel. A wayside sign along the sidewalk there tells us about the Lincoln Highway, an ambitious project to create a highway from coast to coast in the early 1900s. The Hammer Motel was one of the motels that grew up along the highway.<br /><br />The building entrance leads into a large two-story lobby paved with flagstones. To the left is a dining area. Directly ahead is an escalator leading up to the exhibits in the arch itself. Costumed docents are stationed there to take tickets and provide information. To the right is a large gift shop where tickets may be purchased. There are benches along the wall on either side of the entrance doors.",

    "audioDescription": "The Archway- Pioneer Sod House. 488 words<br /><br />Here on the far side of the bridge in front of the Archway Monument there is a picnic area directly in front of you. Two steps lead up to the large pavilion covered with a green metal roof. Three rows of picnic tables fill the area.<br /><br />To your left, a paved trail wanders long the lake. A nearby sign has a map that shows how this trail connects with a network of trails through and around the City of Kearny. There are several wayside signs and exhibits as well as benches along this section near the Archway.<br /><br />First along the right side of the trail are flat metal sculptures of an adult bison with a calf. Feel free to touch. The wayside sign, titled \"Fate of the American Bison,\" tells of the intense hunting that reduced the number of bison from as many as 60 million to only 541 animals in 1887. Today, living on preserves and ranches, the bison numbers have increased to about 200,000. On the left side of the sidewalk are more bison statues. These are made of open metal mesh.<br /><br />Farther down the trail on the right is a path that leads to a Pawnee Earth Lodge. A sign on the far side of the bridge tells us that the lodge was built in 2010 by members of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nations from North Dakota and the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma. About the size of a small house, the lodge is a circular mound of earth, now covered with vegetation. Here and there an underlying wood beam can be seen. The entrance tunnel is made of vertical poles topped with a log roof. The entrance is closed with a metal gate.<br /><br />Past the lodge on the tail is a wayside sign titled \"The Never-Ending Line.\" It describes the conflicts between settlers and Indians did not end until the Sioux, Cheyenne and Pawnee peoples were forced onto reservations in the 1870s. <br /><br />The last exhibit along this trail section is a reproduction of a one-room sod house. The sign on the other end of the bridge tells us that the 224 blocks for the house were made from nine parts dirt and one part Portland Cement. The roof includes 37 saplings, 8 split Nebraska Red Cedar logs and 10 inches of soil. One sign at the right side of the path leading to the house discusses life in a sod house. On the other side, another sign explains how a sod house was made. <br /><br />The entrance to the house is closed with a metal gate. Looking through you can see a bed made of logs in the back-left corner, covered with a patchwork quilt. A couple of small woven rugs are on the dirt floor. A wooden chest sits against the back wall along with a wash tub and cooking pots. The inside walls are white-washed.",

Emigrants would then attempt to ford the river, a risky undertaking that not all of them survived.</p> <p><strong>Emigrant Remarks</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\"Wednesday [August] 6 This morning we hired an Indian to show us the ford. After we saw him cross we determined to try it ourselves. We accordingly commenced making preparations. We crossed two slews to the second island. Here we put ox yokes under the wagon loads to raise them, and put four yoke of our best oxen to each of the four first wagons that crossed. These four got over safely. We then sent the teams back to fech the other three wagons... Suffice it to say we all got over, our cattle and all safely.\" Robert Haldane Renshaw, 1851</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Glenns Ferry, Idaho)</p> <p>Today, the overlook is managed by the State of Idaho. Numerous trail ruts and swales can be seen on the high mesa surrounding the overlook. Amenities include a small gravel path, interpretive wayside exhibits, and parking. The three islands from which the crossing gets its name are visible from the overlook. Parts of the road to the overlook are unpaved but suitable for most vehicles in dry weather. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://parksandrecreation.idaho.gov/parks/three-island-crossing\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Three Island Crossing Overlook. 311 words<br /><br />From the parking area, a short dirt path leads to an overlook at the edge of the bluff where a short stone wall holds two wayside signs. From here, there is a sweeping view of the river below, moving in a wide curve away from us. At the curve's bend, the river expands to flow around three small islands. The one on the left is roughly semi-circular. The middle is long and narrow. The one on the right, closest to the main river channel is also very narrow, but only half as long as the middle one.<br /><br />On the far side of the river the visitor center at Three Island State Park can be seen, with bluffs in the distance backed by high mountains at the horizon. On this side of the river, the land, covered with sagebrush, slopes steeply down to farmland at the river's edge.<br /><br />One of the wayside signs tells us about the river crossing here, illustrated with a drawing of wagons moving down the steep bluff, crossing to the largest island from the far side of the bend, then across the nearest end of middle island and finally floating across the main river channel. Text reads, \"Upon reaching Three Island Crossing of the Snake River, usually by mid-August, Oregon Trail pioneers had a difficult decision to make. Should they cross the sometimes dangerous Snake River using the islands as giant stepping stones or endure the safer but drier route on the south bank of the river? About half of the pioneers attempted the crossing, with diary accounts of many deaths and great loss of personal belongings. A successful crossing meant a shorter route and better food for livestock. The Three Island Ford was used by the Oregon Trail pioneers until 1869, when Gus Glenn constructed a ferry about two miles upstream.\"",

    "audioDescription": "Three Island Crossing State Park. 310 words<br /><br />The visitor center is a one-story building that fans out in front of you as you approach from the parking lot. The gray flat roof slopes slightly up towards the rear. The walls are also gray, covered with a horizontal siding. The sidewalk passes through a small plaza with native plantings and boulders on either side and forming a small island in the middle. About halfway along the left side there is a cement square with embedded footprints of various animals and of people, forming a guide to footprints that can be found in the entrance walkway itself. Feel free to touch.<br /><br />The entrance itself is flanked by two rough stone walls that funnel you towards the double glass doors. Engraved on stones in the wall are names of donors. Overhead a canvas canopy circles a central pole.<br /><br />To the left of the entrance area is a covered wagon with a stone fire circle in the dirt alongside. Feel free to touch. Looking in this direction you have a view of the river beyond, the land on this side flat and covered with grasses and sagebrush. Steep bluffs rise on the far side, one with a clear road scar sloping down to the farmland edging the river.<br /><br />Back up the entrance drive, to the right of the visitor center is a covered pavilion with two wagons, protected by a low railing. Interpretive signage there tells us that one is Idaho's Bicentennial Wagon, which joined other state wagons in journey from Fort Laramie, Wyoming, to Valley Forge to celebrate America's Bicentennial. The other one is a conestoga wagon.<br /><br />Out in the sagebrush to the west of the visitor center and the wagon pavilion you can spot a cement post, marking the path of the wagon trail as it came up from the river crossing.",

A benched seating area is on your left as you enter the walkway. At the right of the entrance to the walkway is a historical marker with a brief discussion of the early history of the \"Town of Kansas,\" ending with the information that Westport Landing became the trails gateway for westward emigrants on the Oregon Trail.<br /><br />The flooring of the walkway is made of horizontal wood planking, providing a fairly smooth surface. After an initial section that has cement walls on either side, the walkway is edged with metal grillwork with a large heavy mesh, providing views of the ground below. The metal fencing is about 4 feet high. About half way long the walk, where it passes over railroad tracks, the grillwork continues up over head, forming a metal mesh tunnel. At the entrance to this tunnel is a metal archway with a sign that reads, Town of Kansas Bridge. Open landings on either side of the walkway at this point have wayside signs. The one on the right covers the development of the town from steamboat landing to city from 1838 to 1855. The other one describes development of the waterfront town to a metropolis from 1856 to 1880.<br /><br />At the edge of the river, the walk opens up into a semi-circular platform, providing views up and down the river. To the left are two river bridges, both with steel superstructures. To the right is a single bridge with white metal truss work.<br /><br />On the left side of the back of the platform are two more wayside signs. One discusses the effort in 1855 to make the city accessible by cutting streets south through the bluffs along the Missouri River. The other one discusses the Gilliss House Hotel which sat on the riverfront.<br /><br />On the other side of the platform is a staircase which descends to river level where there is a cement walking trail along the river, leading eastward to the Berkley Riverfront Park. There is also an elevator down to that level. More waysides are along the sidewalk covering topics such as the Hannibal Bridge, the first railroad bridge across the Missouri River; John C. McCoy who was a founder both of Westport and of the town of Kansas; and the three trails, Oregon, California and Santa Fe, which passed here through the Westport Landing.",

    "audioDescription": "Town of Kansas Bridge (Westport Landing). 413 words<br /><br />From the end of the street here, an elevated walkway leads out to overlook the edge of the river. A benched seating area is on your left as you enter the walkway. At the right of the entrance to the walkway is a historical marker with a brief discussion of the early history of the \"Town of Kansas,\" ending with the information that Westport Landing became the trails gateway for westward emigrants on the Oregon Trail.<br /><br />The flooring of the walkway is made of horizontal wood planking, providing a fairly smooth surface. After an initial section that has cement walls on either side, the walkway is edged with metal grillwork with a large heavy mesh, providing views of the ground below. The metal fencing is about 4 feet high. About half way long the walk, where it passes over railroad tracks, the grillwork continues up over head, forming a metal mesh tunnel. At the entrance to this tunnel is a metal archway with a sign that reads, Town of Kansas Bridge. Open landings on either side of the walkway at this point have wayside signs. The one on the right covers the development of the town from steamboat landing to city from 1838 to 1855. The other one describes development of the waterfront town to a metropolis from 1856 to 1880.<br /><br />At the edge of the river, the walk opens up into a semi-circular platform, providing views up and down the river. To the left are two river bridges, both with steel superstructures. To the right is a single bridge with white metal truss work.<br /><br />On the left side of the back of the platform are two more wayside signs. One discusses the effort in 1855 to make the city accessible by cutting streets south through the bluffs along the Missouri River. The other one discusses the Gilliss House Hotel which sat on the riverfront.<br /><br />On the other side of the platform is a staircase which descends to river level where there is a cement walking trail along the river, leading eastward to the Berkley Riverfront Park. There is also an elevator down to that level. More waysides are along the sidewalk covering topics such as the Hannibal Bridge, the first railroad bridge across the Missouri River; John C. McCoy who was a founder both of Westport and of the town of Kansas; and the three trails, Oregon, California and Santa Fe, which passed here through the Westport Landing.",

The building itself was designed and built by the National Parks Service as a center of exploration in 1997. Here, visitors have the opportunity to retrace the steps of pioneers who came after Lewis and Clark, walking not only the trail blazed by the two intrepid explorers but also the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, and the Mormon Trail.<br /> <br /> Exhibits include sculptures by Timothy Woodman, photos, maps, and quotes pertaining to the trails and America's history of Westward Expansion. Outdoor picnic areas offer a tranquil place to enjoy the sunshine and scenery. Walking and biking paths wind through 400 acres of prairie along the scenic Missouri River, offering a glimpse into what the two explorers and the Corps of Discovery observed more than 200 years ago. <br /> <br /> Admission is free. School and group tours are available, but require advance scheduling by calling the center at (712) 366-4900.

    "audioDescription": "The visitor center is housed in a low, irregularly shaped building with a flat roof, sitting in a grove of mature trees. The smooth walls are painted tan with dark brown trim. The area surrounding the building consists of pasture-like fields with tall grass and backed by woods.<br /><br />The wide sidewalk leads to the entrance in the middle of the building. Restrooms are located on the outside wall to the right. There is a bench to the immediate right of the doorway, with a drinking fountain on the wall further to the right.<br /><br />The doors open on the carpeted lobby space with the information desk along the back wall straight ahead, just past a glass case which holds a model of the surrounding area.

    "audioDescription": "Wieduwilt Swales (85th and Manchester \"Three Trails\" Trail Segment). 481 words<br /><br />This site is located at the intersection of two quiet city streets. The corner plot of land is grass covered with scattered trees, including black walnut trees with their large fruits under foot. Under the shade of a large oak tree a brown sign reads, \"Wieduwilt Swales, Santa Fe, Oregon, California National Historic Trails.\" To the left of that is a wayside sign and still further to the left a concrete marker post. A small green sign on the post reads, \"This site contains the original swales created during the 19th century by the many wagons, pack animals and travelers on the Santa Fe, Oregon and California National Historic Trails.\"<br /><br />About 35 feet beyond the cement post is a broad, grassy swale or trough, about 3 feet deep and 40 feet wide. It winds its way up the gentle slope to your right and crosses in front of you, disappearing to your left.<br /><br />The wayside sign has an image of a covered wagon being pulled by a team of six oxen, its wheels moving in two ruts on a trail through tall grasses. Text tells us that \"thousands of wagon wheels, animal hooves and human feet once passed this way, creating the deep depression in front of you. This swale, now worn by erosion, is grassed-over evidence of three trails once connecting frontier Missouri to distant lands. In the mid-1800s, caravans moving through here hauled freight between Missouri and Santa Fe. Overland emigrants followed, headed for Oregon's farmlands or California's gold fields. This swale, evidence of past trail use, is one of the few known in the greater Kansas City area. During some years, wet and muddy conditions on the trails led to frustrating delays, yet memorable experiences.\"<br /><br />At the bottom of the sign are two contemporary accounts. The first reads, \"Amid the fiercest storm I have yet witnessed on the trip, I encamped last night with a party of â€˜our folks'; and though I was literally soaked through when I arose in the morning from my grassy couch, I never slept more profoundly, nor experienced healthier feeling. Favored with pleasanter weather, we continued, after breakfast, our ride to the plains. - George L. Curry, May 1846, writing near this spot.\"<br /><br />The second reads, \"The first day we got but 3 miles from town with half our wagons, the other half we left mired in devious and sundry mudholes strung along for a mile behind. On Sunday morning we started and got on pretty well until dark overtook us at Mr. Barne's place 8 miles from town where we encamped and placed our animals all in his pasture. It commenced pouring down rain soon after dark and the next morning the roads were so slippery and muddy that we could not stir until about 12 o'clock. - William H. Glasgow, June 1846, writing near this site.\"",

    "audioDescription": "(205 words) The Mary McLeod Bethune Council House NHS is located in the Logan Circle neighborhood of Northwest, Washington, DC. Traveling south on Vermont Avenue from Logan Circle, travel about four hundred fifteen feet and the location will be on your right. The site is a three-story red brick Victorian row house with off-white trim. A two-foot-tall iron gate lines the front of the property and three steps lead up to a checkerboard walk of about eight feet. On the left is a black iron post from which a one by two-foot brown sign reads in white lettering: Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site. Left of the walkway is a fifteen-foot square lawn with a black urn-shaped planter with flowers. A five-step gray wooden staircase with rounded railings at the bottom runs up to a double-sided glass front door. To the left are three windows of a first-floor alcove. Three windows line the front second floor, and three gabled windows sit atop the third floor. The neighbor's ten-foot tall bush hangs slightly over the front steps on the right side. Along the left side of the red brick fa√ßade from the front door are two bronze plaques describing some of Bethune's significant contributions to American history. END OF DESCRIPTION",

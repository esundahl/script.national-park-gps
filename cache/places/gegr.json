After New York City was chosen as a burial site, the next task would be deciding where in the ever-expanding city.<br /> <br /> While many favored Central Park, a location at Riverside Park was chosen after Frederick Law Olmsted’s close acquaintance Samuel Parsons Jr. convinced Grant’s widow Julia that the Hudson River setting, with its sweeping panoramic views, was superior.<br /> <br /> Shortly after the burial, anxiety began to grow regarding the site of Grant’s Tomb, that it was inappropriate and would lend an unfortunate funerary air to this section of Riverside Park, which had been considered a gala promenade. Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were particularly concerned.<br /> <br /> Nestled within the picturesque landscape of Riverside Park, Grant’s Tomb was designed to be approached by rail, water, carriage, and by foot. Grant’s Tomb is located atop one of the highest points along Riverside Drive, with surrounding formal walkways and parklands designed by Parsons and Vaux.<br /> <br /> To ease Olmsted and Vaux’s concerns, Vaux and Parsons proposed that the grounds of Grant’s Tomb be separated from the rest of Riverside Park with a newly cut road, which was done, ensuring Grant’s Tomb and Riverside Park could coexist in Olmsted’s vision of providing open park space unobstructed by the outside world.",

Grant's tenacity and boldness led to victories in the Battles of Vicksburg and Chattanooga and Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Scenes of these events are depicted in mosaics in the tomb. In 1866, Congress awarded Grant his fourth star, making him the first full General of the Armies. <br> <br> A grateful nation elected Grant to serve as President of the United States twice, in 1868 and 1872. Grant's accomplishments include signing the act that established the first national park, Yellowstone, on March 1, 1872. After his presidency, Grant settled in New York City. He died of throat cancer on July 23, 1885 in Mount McGregor, New York and was laid to rest in New York City on August 8.<br> <br> Approximately 90,000 people from around the world donated over $600,000 towards the construction of Grant's Tomb. This was the largest public fundraising effort ever at that time. Designed by architect John Duncan, the granite and marble structure was completed in 1897 and remains the largest mausoleum in North America. Over one million people attended the parade and dedication ceremony of Grant's Tomb on April 27, 1897.</p>",

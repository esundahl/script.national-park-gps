Manning</a> had the cabin built in 1905 for use as a mountain summer home. It was the first such retreat built in the Rincon Mountains.</p> <p>The cabin was built using pack horses and wagons to transport materials to the site. Trees for the cabin came from the immediate vicinity. The log structure contained a living room with a fireplace, a kitchen, two bedrooms, and two small bunk rooms. The cabin also housed a piano, brought up from the Rincon Valley via the wagon road.</p> <p>The Manning family used the cabin as a summer home from mid-summer 1905 to mid-1907. In 1907, the area became part of the Coronado National Forest. For several subsequent years, Manning leased the land from the Forest Service but did not use the cabin again.</p> <p>The historical importance of the cabin was formally recognized in 1975, when it was added to the <a href=\"https://focus.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/75000169\">National Register of Historic Places</a>.

Living together in this region are Native American tribes with ancient roots to the area, the descendants of Spanish settlers who colonized the valley in the late 1600s, Mexican families who settled the area before the 1854 Gadsden Purchase made it part of the United States, and current generations of late nineteenth-century American pioneers who ventured into this borderland seeking new beginnings. <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e5eadcd5-68c1-4372-b385-a06e2ecca7bf}{252}\" paraid=\"11\"><strong>The SCVNHA supports community-led efforts to:  </strong></p> <ul role=\"list\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"Noto Sans Symbols\" data-leveltext=\"●\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{6004c223-f64c-4bf9-bb61-a14236ff80f5}{3}\" paraid=\"12\">Increase heritage and nature tourism and grow tourism-related economic impact </p> </li> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"Noto Sans Symbols\" data-leveltext=\"●\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{6004c223-f64c-4bf9-bb61-a14236ff80f5}{14}\" paraid=\"13\">Develop heritage education programs </p> </li> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-font=\"Noto Sans Symbols\" data-leveltext=\"●\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{6004c223-f64c-4bf9-bb61-a14236ff80f5}{21}\" paraid=\"14\">Promote local foods, crafts, and other traditional products </p> </li> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"4\" data-font=\"Noto Sans Symbols\" data-leveltext=\"●\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{6004c223-f64c-4bf9-bb61-a14236ff80f5}{28}\" paraid=\"15\">Riparian restoration </p> </li> </ul> <ul role=\"list\"> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-font=\"Noto Sans Symbols\" data-leveltext=\"●\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{6004c223-f64c-4bf9-bb61-a14236ff80f5}{35}\" paraid=\"16\">Rehabilitation of historic buildings </p> </li> <li aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-level=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-font=\"Noto Sans Symbols\" data-leveltext=\"●\" data-listid=\"1\" role=\"listitem\"> <p paraeid=\"{6004c223-f64c-4bf9-bb61-a14236ff80f5}{42}\" paraid=\"17\">Improve the quality of life for residents by instilling a sense of place </p> </li> </ul> <p paraeid=\"{6004c223-f64c-4bf9-bb61-a14236ff80f5}{49}\" paraid=\"18\">The region has an abundance of well-preserved historic and archaeological resources associated with the rich multicultural history, along with spectacular natural, scenic, and outdoor recreational resources.

    "bodyText": "The Valley View Overlook Nature Trail is an easy 0.8 mile (1.3 km) roundtrip trail, starting at the Valley View Trailhead along the Bajada Loop Scenic Drive in Saguaro National Park's west district. <br /> <br /> This short trail was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. The trail drops into and out of a couple of washes and then gradually ascends to a ridge. Along the way, you will travel through typical Sonoran Desert vegetation. Signs along the way identify and interpret several of the more common species of plants. The trail ends at a ridge with benches that allow you to relax and enjoy sweeping views. From here you can see Avra Valley to the west, Signal Hill, which looks like a small black mound from here, and the jagged ridge of Picacho Peak to the north. ",

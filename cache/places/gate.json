    "bodyText": "<p>The 20-inch Rodman Gun is the largest muzzle-loading, smoothbore cannon ever made. It is located in Fort Hancock across from the Sandy Hook Chapel.</p> <h3>Lieutenant Thomas Jackson Rodman</h3> <p>Lieutenant Rodman graduated from the military academy in 1841 and was assigned to the Ordnance Department at Allegheny Arsenal in Pittsburgh. When Lieutenant Rodman heard that a large new cannon blew up while being fired on board the U.S. Navy warship USS Princeton in 1844, he started to think about how a big cannon could be made that was safe enough to fire. Lieutenant Rodman theorized that a cannon cooled from the inside out would make a super strong gun metal.</p> <h3>The Wet Chill</h3> <p>Rodman believed that internal cooling would cause the outer molten metal to compress against the bore and create enough tension to resist the pressure of large powder charges. Basically, he brought back the hollow casting process, but, instead of a solid core, he used a hollow tube. Water circulating through the tube cooled the bore while coals were piled against the mold to keep the outer surface hot. Lieutenant Rodman's manufacturing method, now known as the \"wet chill process\", forced the impurities outward while the outer metal shrank against the hardened interior.</p> <h3>Persistence</h3> <p>The first 15-inch Rodman gun was cast on December 23,1859. During the gun trials, 509 proofing rounds were fired. Since there were no accidents or misfires during the testing, the government saw fit to order these large guns in November 1861. During the Civil War, the Rodman guns were the largest in the U.S. arsenal. Two 20-inch guns were purchased, but the 15-inch gun, along with the 200 pounder (12-inch) muzzle loading Parrot Rifle, became the main seacoast armament.</p> <h3>No. 2 Rodman Gun</h3> <p>The second 20-inch gun was made in 1869, and, as far as anyone knows, it was never fired. The No. 2 Rodman gun was exhibited at the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition that celebrated the 100th birthday of the United States. At some point after the exposition ended, the No.2 gun ended up at the U.S. Army Sandy Hook Proving Ground, where it sat in storage for many years. In 1903, the commander of Fort Hancock wrote the Army's Chief of Ordnance, requesting that the gun be transferred from the Ordnance Department over to Fort Hancock, operated by the Army's Coast Artillery Corps. The gun was transferred to Fort Hancock where it was displayed \"as a monument to the old class of guns,\" as the Fort Hancock commander referred to it. The move probably saved this rare cannon from being scrapped.</p>",

Due to Battery Weed’s lack of lack of capacity for anything larger than the 10-inch Rodman guns, other batteries were constructed to mount larger cannons, like the 15-inch Rodman guns that would have been located here and at the South Cliff Battery. In 1885 President Grover Cleveland created the Endicott Board, which was tasked with updating the increasingly obsolete coastal fortification system in the United States with the latest in military technology. The concrete batteries scattered around the tour route like Battery Catlin are the remnants of this system of fortification, most of which were constructed between 1890 and 1910.</p> <p>Advancements in military technology in the 20<sup>th</sup> century led to the construction of more forts located even further out, like Fort Tilden in the Rockways and Fort Hancock at Sandy Hook. Following WWI the use of planes in combat completely changed the nature of warfare and defense; anti-aircraft guns were added to Fort Wadsworth’s batteries to attempt to deal with this new threat.<br /> <br /> How would you have felt as an immigrant travelling to Ellis Island passing through the narrows?

    "audioDescription": "Sandy Hook Battery Granger<br />268 words; Length: 1:05<br /><br />Battery Granger is a 19th century concrete, disappearing gun battery. It is about one hundred feet long. Part of the structure has two stories and other sections are one story with an open flat roof protected at the rear by six-foot high concrete walls. In the front, a black handrail runs most of the length of the second floor. The first floor has eighteen square concrete pillars across the front, that support the upper level walkways. The pillars are two feet by two feet and are about twelve feet tall.

Gunnison was built in 1903 as a twin six-inch disappearing gun battery. This site is only open to the public while on a tour.</p> <h3>Captain John W. Gunnison</h3> <p>Battery Gunnison was named in honor of U.S. Army Captain John W. Gunnison in 1904.<br /> Captain Gunnison served in the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers and was killed in 1853 at Sevier Lake, Utah, in the line of duty. He was part of an expedition searching for a feasible passage across the Continental Divide for a transcontinental railroad route from Saint Louis, Missouri to San Francisco, California.</p> <h3>Two 6-inch Guns</h3> <p>The south side gun and carriage was mounted in 1905, and the north side gun and carriage was mounted in 1908. During World War II, the Army wanted to make Battery Gunnison a faster firing gun battery. To do this, the Army removed the old disappearing guns and carriages, raised up the gun platforms with more concrete, and emplaced another pair of 6-inch guns, mounted on pedestal carriages. These carriages enabled the guns to fire 108-pound armor-piercing projectiles in any direction up to ten miles away.</p> <h3>New Battery Peck</h3> <p>The guns and carriages for the revamped Battery Gunnison came from Battery Peck, which was one mile north of Battery Gunnison overlooking the tip of Sandy Hook. The Army renamed Battery Gunnison \"New Battery Peck.\" Around 1949, the Army stopped using the former Battery Gunnison and abandoned it.</p> <h3> </h3>",
    "audioDescription": "Sandy Hook Battery GunnisonFirst of two descriptions at this area476 words; Length: 1:45Battery Gunnison is a one-story, concrete structure about twelve feet tall and 120 feet across the face. It is composed of three distinct sections. There are two round gun platforms at either end. Concrete steps lead up to each of the guns. In between the gun platforms, there is a flat-fronted, one story storage area. An 8-foot wide curving path leads to the battery with a wide grassy area on either side. Two descriptive audio described signs giving the history of the battery are located along the path. On the left side of the path, set three feet in, there is a wood and rope barrier. The wooden uprights are painted grey and cut at a 45-degree angle at the top. Rope is strung between the uprights through a hole 8 inches below the top of the upright. There are 15 steps up to the gun platform on the right. It has black painted hand railings which extend around the front perimeter of the gun platform. About twenty feet from the stairs, the barbette gun is mounted on a metal track inside a circular, raised concrete area about twelve feet in diameter. It is painted grey green and points upwards at a 45-degree angle. The track allows the gun to be rotated in any direction.There is a three-foot high concrete wall on the far side of the gun platform. Standing at the edge of the platform behind the low wall, you can see the ocean and the dunes. To your left is the earth covered roof of the storage area, with an earth embankment leading down to the dunes. Beyond the storage area, the barrel of the second barbette gun is visible.As you face the front of the storage area, there is a twelve-foot wide entrance in the center, now covered with a black pull down metal door. A concrete abutment on the roof above the doors has a window with black shutters. There is a smaller black door to the left of the wide entrance. The gun platform on the left also has 15 steps up. The gun is mounted in the same way as the gun on the right end of the battery. Standing at low wall on the far side of the gun, you can see the dunes covered in sea grass and the wide ocean beach.On the right of this gun platform, there is a second set of stairs. There are twelve steps down with a black handrail leading to a concrete wall with a black-painted door directly in front of you. You take a sharp right to head back towards the parking lot. As you walk back towards the parking lot, between the wall of the gun parapet and the wall of the storage structure, there are two more steps down. There is no handrail. End of messageSandy Hook Battery Gunnison WaysideSecond of two descriptions at this area732 words; Length: 2:50Sign: Battery GunnisonThis wayside sign stands about fifty feet in front of Battery Gunnison to the left of an eight-foot wide concrete path leading to the battery. It is housed in a pale green wooden frame mounted about three feet off the ground at the front, and measures three feet by four feet. It sits at a 45 degree angle front to back.The sign is entitled \"Battery Gunnison\" at the top. On the left hand side of the sign, there is text on a cream colored background that reads: \"The concrete structure beyond the trees is Battery Gunnison, built in 1904 as part of Fort Hancock's Endicott period defenses. The battery's two guns were originally mounted on counterweight carriages. These so-called \"disappearing\" guns recoiled back to their loading position behind the protective concrete wall each time they fired their 6-inch caliber shells.During World War II, the army raised Battery Gunnison's gun platforms and mounted two barbette guns here. These guns were also 6-inch diameter, but could rapid fire 108-lb. armor-piercing projectiles more than 10 miles in any direction. This short path leads to Battery Gunnison's barbettes and the only guns at Fort Hancock not scrapped after World War II.\"End of TextBelow the text is a diagrammatic drawing of the battery showing the circular gun platforms on either end. The circle on the left is labeled Platform 2. The one on the right is labeled Platform 1. The square structure in the center shows the Powder Room and Shell Rooms on the top of the battery with a large area below labeled Plotting Rooms. The Plotting Rooms are flanked on either side by Store Rooms.The caption above the diagram reads: \"Plan of Battery Gunnison as originally built (below) shows two large platforms designed for its original 6-inch-diamater \"disappearing\" guns (right).End of TextThe right two thirds of the sign is taken up by a black and white photograph of one of the barbette guns. The gun is manned by four soldiers in work style clothes, not regulation army uniforms. Two men are at the loading end of the gun, one is on top of the gun, and one mans the movable carriage.

Battery Kingman is a good example of a World War One designed barbette gun battery. The battery was constructed during 1917, but it's two 12-inch guns did not arrive until December 1918, just one month after World War One had ended. The long range gun batteries were the fort's first line of defense against battleships from 1919 through the end of World War Two. Battery Kingman's guns and carriages were scrapped in 1948.</p> <h3>Gun Battery Design</h3> <p>The design of the battery was simple. The battery had two circular concrete gun emplacements, one on the north side and one on the south side, spaced 420 feet apart from each other. Between the two gun emplacements the army engineers built a large rectangular shaped reinforced concrete blockhouse called a traverse. The traverse contained rooms for storage of ammunition, plotting rooms where soldiers could plot where enemy ships were headed, latrines, and heating and generator buildings. The north and south ends of the traverse had open ends so that supply trains could deliver ammunition and anything the battery needed to operate. The army covered the traverse hill with dirt and planted trees, shrubs and grass to prevent erosion by wind and rain and to make the hill look more natural looking.</p> <h3>Battery Casemate</h3> <p>During World War Two, Battery Kingman's two gun emplacements were enclosed with thick concrete walls and ceilings called casemates. The casemates protected the guns from being bombed by enemy airplanes.</p> <h3>Brigadier General Dan C. Kingman</h3> <p>Battery kingman was named in honor of Army Chief of Engineers Brigadier General Dan C. Kingman. He retired March, 1916. He died in November 1916 in Atlantic CIty, NJ.</p>",

In the coast artillery service during World War II, 90mm guns were known as \"dual purpose\" because they were assigned to shoot at both fast moving warships and warplanes.

    "audioDescription": "Sandy Hook Battery Potter<br />306 words; Length: 1:10<br /><br />Battery Potter is a 19th century stone and concrete gun battery. The approximately ten-foot wide, arched entrance, set into a grass covered hill, is flanked by two stone turrets, each two stories high, giving it the appearance of a medieval castle. Above the grassy hill, and stretching approximately 100 feet in either direction, there is a wall of concrete fortifications which look out towards the water. An informational wayside sign giving the history of Battery Potter stands about 30 feet to the left of the entrance.<br /><br />The entrance is approximately twelve-feet high at the peak of the arch. It is closed off with heavy black metal doors and further sealed with black iron gates that are constructed of both upright bars and a large metal X stretching from corner to corner. Each of the black doors have two small rectangular gun slits about six feet from ground level. The gates are locked with a heavy metal chain and a new padlock. The name \"Battery Potter\" is spelled out in large white letters just below the arch.<br /><br />Flanking the turrets, there are granite walls angling off from the height of the arched doors to approximately three feet high at the end of each wall. These angled walls, capped in concrete, extend approximately twenty feet to either side of the turrets. <br /><br />The turrets have three rectangular gun slits about ten feet above ground level. There are three more gun slits in each turret about thirty feet above ground level. <br /><br />At the upper level of the concrete fortifications, there is a series of eight-foot tall concrete rooms with entrances on both the front and backside.<br /><br />Black painted cannon shells lay on the ground on either side of the door.

    "bodyText": "<p>Battery Weed bears the name of Stephen Weed, a native New Yorker who was killed in action at the battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Construction on Battery Weed began in 1847 and was completed in 1861. An enemy ship attempting to enter New York Harbor would have come under fire from 116 10-inch Rodman guns mounted on the fort. Despite this formidable arsenal, Battery Weed was almost immediately obsolete due to advances in military technology.</p> <p>Rifled guns and exploding shells were the order of the day, and masonry structures, even if those made of a durable material like Battery Weed’s granite, could shatter and crumble under such a fusillade. In addition, Battery Weed’s casemates were only designed to mount 10-inch Rodman cannons, but 15-inch Rodmans, with a far greater range, were already becoming commonplace. By the turn of the century 90% of Battery Weed’s armament had been removed; in later years the structure would mainly be used for storage.<br /> <br /> Do you think most residents of New York were aware of how obsolete some of their city’s fortifications were?</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Battery Weed exterior, Torpedo Building and Wayside<br />1003 words; Length: 3:55<br /><br />Battery Weed is a three-tiered trapezoidal shaped fortification facing west across the Verrazano Narrows. The battery is constructed of rectangular granite blocks of irregular lengths. The western wall is about 20 feet tall, with an observation tower on the northern end. The central entrance is twelve feet wide and twelve feet tall, with a black metal gate. Tracks run from the torpedo building to the north through the gate into the central parade ground. As you stand in front of the massive gate on the eastern side, the Verrazano Bridge rises above you on the right. There is an informational wayside sign here.<br /><br />The road leading to the gate has grass on the right side, with a six-inch concrete curb. This area is about thirty feet deep. A bench sits against the wall at the back of the grassy area. There is also a curbed, grassy rectangular area, about twelve feet deep by twenty feet long, just to the left of the entrance.<br /><br />The informational wayside sign entitled \"Battery Weed\" stands in the grass three feet behind the curb. It gives a brief history of the battery and the other defense systems found around the New York Harbor area. <br /><br />Through the closed gate and past the center parade ground, arched gun enclosures are visible on the three-story eastern wall of the battery.<br /><br />About sixty feet to the right of the entrance, the wall rises to forty feet in height, with an open roofed lookout area, twenty feet deep by thirty feet high. As the wall continues to the right past the lookout area, there are narrow, six-foot tall gun slits evenly spaced about four feet apart. The gun slits are on all three levels of the battery, starting just a few inches off the ground.<br /><br />About sixty feet to the left of the entrance, there is another square lookout area. Past the lookout area, the wall continues another forty feet to the left with the same configuration of gun slits as on the right. <br /><br />A small, round lighthouse sits atop a square, red brick house in the northwest corner of the barbette roof of the fortress. The lighthouse has a white, domed lens house.<br /><br />Across the road is the Fort Wadsworth Torpedo Building. It is a twelve-foot high structure made of very large granite blocks that vary in size. It is forty-two feet across the face with three six-foot-wide doors. The roof is missing, although the remains of the steel girders that once supported the roof are partially in place. Vines grow up the girders and across much of the roof, hanging down from the second story level on the left hand side of the building. An informational wayside sign is to the right of the building.<br /><br />A remnant of a second story brick wall is still standing on the east side of the building, shored up with steel girders. <br /><br />Rail tracks in a concrete bed run from each of the doors to Battery Weed. The doors on the left and right are rusted metal double doors. The door in the center has a partially rusted pull down metal gate. A rusted three-inch in diameter pipe runs from the second floor to ground level and disappears into the asphalt below. <br /><br />A steep incline with trees, vines, low shrubs and grass rises up on the western side of the building. Two benches sit to the left of the building and one to right, facing each other on either side of the asphalt road that leads to the building. A black chain link fence runs along the eastern side of the building.<br /><br />A small granite house with a sharply peaked roof and a twelve-foot wide open entrance stands to the left of the Torpedo Building. Wooden beach fencing has been erected in front of the granite house and along the road at the bottom of the incline.<br /><br />The wayside sign, entitled \"Torpedo Building\" is positioned three feet off the ground at a 45 degree angle. It is three feet by four feet and stands on two grey two inch by four inch legs. A black and white photograph dated 1921 shows Battery Weed and the many buildings that once made up the torpedo area complex. The copy reads: \"This structure, built from 1892-94, once held the key to New York Harbor's defense. In the late 1800s, military engineers developed \"torpedoes\" - actually \"mines\" in current military terms - that could be exploded electrically from shore positions like Battery Weed behind you. New York's torpedoes and their miles of cable were not permanently wired in place, but stored here until needed. <br /><br />These tracks connected the 323-foot by 42-foot Torpedo Building and the nearby cable storage tanks to the wharf. If New York was threatened, small rail cars could quickly transport the torpedoes and cables to specialized vessels ready to stretch them across the Narrows. The Army tested this system in the late 1890s, but removed the torpedoes and cables in 1899.\"<br /><br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />The photograph below, which dominates the sign, shows each structure outlined and labeled in red. The Torpedo Building is on the left. The Torpedo Wharf is in the background on the left. The Torpedo Loading Room and the Cable Storage tanks are positioned in front of the east wall of Battery Weed. A tall, enclosed section of Battery Weed in the northwestern part of the battery is labeled Mine Control Center. The railroad tracks connect all of the buildings. <br /><br />An arrow that is labeled \"You Are Here\" points to the site of the informational sign.<br /> <br />There is a blue architectural diagram of the area imposed on the lower part of the photograph. The Torpedo Building is outlined in red. <br /><br />The bottom of the sign depicts four eras of defense systems employed at the fort. It is entitled \"Fort Wadsworth's Defense Systems\".<br /><br />The four systems shown are: 1794-1807 First System Defenses/Example: Block House. <br />1807-1817 Second System Defenses/Example: First Fort Tompkins. 1817-1876 Third System Defenses/Example: Battery Weed. 1890-1910 Endicott System Defenses/Example: Battery Duane<br /><br />End of Message",

Arriving in New York City in April of 1776 after the British evacuation of Boston, George Washington ordered a signal station placed on this location, watching for the imminent British arrival. In late June ships began to appear; within days they had sailed through the narrows unencumbered and landed on Staten Island, and within months they had captured Brooklyn and Manhattan. The British held New York City for the remainder of the war and constructed earthen fortifications on this location in 1778.</p> <p>The safety and security of New York City as a major port and center of finance made the permanent fortification of this site a priority. The first major American fortifications on this site were begun just before the War of 1812. Earlier forts like Castle Clinton and Fort Jay had been constructed closer to the city, but the strategic importance of the narrows in preventing passage to hostile ships was paramount. Like today, there was a fort located on this hill known as Fort Tompkins, and a fort located below on the water known as Fort Richmond (the current structure is named Battery Weed). These forts were replaced in the mid-nineteenth century by the structures you see today. An enemy ship attempting to attack New York City would have to contend with not only Fort Wadsworth, but Fort Hamilton on the other side of the narrows in Brooklyn.<br /> <br /> Would you have felt safer living in New York City knowing that these forts were here?</p> <h3> </h3>",

Wadsworth OverlookFirst Wayside Sign 511 Words; Length: 2:12First of five descriptions at this locationWayside Panel: Defending New York Harbor - Panel DescriptionThis wayside sign is set at the far left hand side of the Ft. Wadsworth Overlook in front of a three foot high, granite protective wall, with a view of the New York harbor directly ahead. Battery Weed is below, the Verrazano Bridge to the right, and in the distance off to the left, the New York and Brooklyn skylines. The wayside is angled at 45 degrees and is approximately three feet from the ground. It is four feet wide by three feet tall. The sign is entitled \"Defending New York Harbor.\"Below this, the text reads: \"How do you protect one of the world's busiest ports? This question has challenged military leaders for centuries. In 1776, the British landed unopposed on Staten Island, captured New York City, fortified this point, and occupied the area until the Revolutionary War Ended. Starting in 1794, the state of New York began building forts here. The War of 1812 hastened those efforts, and, by 1817, ten forts built by the state and the U.S. War Department ringed this harbor. As weapons improved over time, this circle of forts expanded to defend New York Harbor - which has not been attacked since the British left in 1783.\"End of TextIn the upper right, there is a quote from Prussian General Frederich Von Steuben, Aide to General George Washington during the Revolutionary War, which reads: \"...[The Narrows} are the place pointed out by nature for the defense of the harbor.\"The background of the sign is an 1853 lithograph of New York Harbor, depicting various sailing vessels plying the waters of The Narrows and the Harbor. The lithograph shows the busy harbor and harbor shoreline, still not densely populated, with church spires and low buildings at the tip of Staten Island and, across the Narrows on the Brooklyn shore line, two-story buildings on tree lined streets.The many fortifications ringing the harbor are identified in red type. The Text Reads:First Fort Tompkins, 1814(site of second Fort Tomkins, 1876)Fort Richmond under construction(renamed Fort Wadsworth in 1865, then Battery Weed in 1902)Fort Lafayette(fort's rubble now forms the base for the east tower of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge)Fort HamiltonFort Columbus(on Governor's Island)Castle Williams(On Governor's Island)Castle Clinton(On Manhattan)Fort Gibson(on Ellis Island)Fort Wood(on Bedloe's Island; now called Liberty Island)There are four small maps in the lower part of the sign, showing the ever-expanding fortifications around the harbor with red dots marking each fortification. The first map is labeled \"First System Defenses 1794-1807.\" The second map is labeled \"Second System Defenses 1807-1817.\" The third map is labeled \"Third System Defenses 1817-1876.\" The fourth map is labeled \"Endicott Period Defenses 1890-1910.\" The purpose of the illustrations is to show how the city is being defended at each period in time and the strategic locations of the batteries providing coverage of the harbor entry to the young city.End of MessageFort Wadsworth OverlookSecond Wayside Sign Battery Weed511 Words; Length: 2:08Second of five descriptions at this locationThis wayside sign describes the history of Battery Weed, located below the Fort Wadsworth Overlook on the edge of the Verrazano Narrows. The sign is predominated by a sepia toned drawing of the fort from Harpers Weekly Illustrated, circa 1860, and shows the outer moat of the fort still filled with water. There are about a dozen soldiers on the roof at the center of the fort's front wall and another dozen men on the roof in the far right corner of the fort. There are sailing ships in the waters of the Verrazano Narrows as well as steam-powered paddle wheelers. The sign is elevated approximately three feet from the ground and is four feet wide by three feet tall.Wayside Panel: Battery Weed - Panel DescriptionThe sign is predominated by a sepia toned drawing of the fort from Harpers Weekly Illustrated, circa 1860, and shows the outer moat of the fort still filled with water. There are about a dozen soldiers on the roof at the center of the fort's front wall and another dozen men on the roof in the far right corner of the fort. There are sailing ships in the waters of the Verrazano Narrows as well as steam-powered paddle wheelers. The sign is elevated approximately three feet from the ground and is four feet wide by three feet tall. Text reads:\"Begun in 1847, this granite structure was finally completed during the Civil War. Its four-tier design allowed up to 116 guns to skip cannonballs across the Narrows. However, by the mid-1860s, bigger, more-accurate guns could destroy a stone fort like this. Compromised, it became obsolete almost before its last stones were laid. First named Fort Richmond - after an earlier New York state-built fort on the same site - it was renamed in 1865 for Brt. Maj. Gen. James Wadsworth, who was mortally wounded at the Battle of the Wilderness. In 1902, the army post was named Fort Wadsworth and this fortification renamed Battery Weed for Brig. Gen. Stephen Weed, killed at the Battle of Gettysburg.\"End of text.There are three smaller illustrations across the lower part of the sign, the first one a drawing from the 1850s of Fort Richmond under construction, as shown in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Magazine. The second is a photograph of cannonballs stacked in triangular shaped rows in the interior grounds of Fort Wadsworth, circa 1893. The third is a photograph from the 1890s of a man in business attire standing on the roof of Fort Wadsworth with guns pointed towards the narrows. Text reads: Fort Wadsworth mounted almost every type of gun available in its day, including Rodmans and Parrots in the 1890s.End of text.The bottom of the sign depicts four eras of defense systems employed at the fort. It is entitled \"Fort Wadsworth's Defense Systems\".The four systems depicted are: 1794-1807 First System Defenses/Example: Block House. 1807-1817 Second System Defenses/Example: First Fort Tompkins. 1817-1876 Third System Defenses/Example: Battery Weed. 1890-1910 Endicott System Defenses/Example: Battery DuaneEnd of MessageFort Wadsworth OverlookThird Wayside Sign Verrazano Bridge415 words; Length: 1:53Third of five descriptions at this site.This wayside sign describes the construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge through text and photographs. The sign is elevated three feet from the ground and is four feet wide by three feet tall. It is set at the south end of the Fort Wadsworth Overlook, behind the bridge itself. The sign is entitled \"Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.\" To the right of the title, Giovanni da Verrazano, from 1554. Text reads: The quote reads: \"We found a pleasant place below steep little hills. And from among those hills, a mighty deep mouthed river ran into the sea.\" End of text.Text reads:Wayside Panel:The main body of text reads: \"Until the 1960s, the only way from Brooklyn to Staten Island was by water - first by Indian canoes, then boats and ferries. A railroad tunnel was started from Brooklyn in 1923, but never completed. Plans for a vehicular tunnel were studied in 1929 and 1942, but dropped. Finally, in 1946, the state of New York authorized a bridge to be built across these Narrows. Designed by Othmar Amman, the bridge was started on August 13th, 1959, by over 1,000 workers. The \" world's largest suspension bridge\" when dedicated November 21, 1964, it was named for Italian Explorer Giovanni da Verrazano, who discovered these Narrows 440 years earlier. For Staten Island, this bridge marked the beginning of a change from a rural landscape to today's urban environment.End of text.Below this text is a series of four photographs, showing the bridge in various stages of construction. The first is labeled \"Foundations laid, 1959\" and shows towering cranes on a concrete platform. The second is labeled \"Tower pedestals built, 1960\", showing cranes on the Staten Island shore of the Narrows. The third photograph is labeled \"Towers erected\", and shows one of the towers upon completion with an ocean bound ship in the background. The fourth is labeled \"Cables strung to Anchorages, 1962\", and shows the massive cables attached to one of the towers being drawn towards the foot of the bridge.Below these photographs is a diagrammatic drawing of the bridge with statistics on aspects of the bridge's construction. Some of these statistics include: The Length (including approach ramps): 13,700 feet. The Height of the Towers: 690 feet. The height above water in the summer and winter : 228 in the summer, 240 in the winter.End of MessageFort Wadsworth OverlookFourth Wayside Sign Fort Tompkins338 words; Length: 1:37Fourth of five descriptions at this site.

The background is a black and white photograph from 1920, showing soldiers drilling on the parade ground, surrounded by the fort walls. There are six rows of soldiers, all with arms and hands at their sides. Each row contains nine to thirteen men, all wearing long winter coats and military style caps. Two officers stand facing the front row of soldiers in the foreground. Text reads:\"Two forts, both named Fort Tompkins, have occupied this hill.

    "bodyText": "<p>This spectacular view was recognized for its strategic value centuries ago by no one less than George Washington himself. Arriving in New York City in April of 1776 after the British evacuation of Boston, George Washington ordered a signal station placed on this location, watching for the imminent British arrival. In late June ships began to appear; within days they had sailed through the narrows unencumbered and landed on Staten Island, and within months they had captured Brooklyn and Manhattan. The British held New York City for the remainder of the war and constructed earthen fortifications on this location in 1778.</p> <p>The safety and security of New York City as a major port and center of finance made the permanent fortification of this site a priority. The first major American fortifications on this site were begun just before the War of 1812. Earlier forts like Castle Clinton and Fort Jay had been constructed closer to the city, but the strategic importance of the narrows in preventing passage to hostile ships was paramount. Like today, there was a fort located on this hill known as Fort Tompkins, and a fort located below on the water known as Fort Richmond (the current structure is named Battery Weed). These forts were replaced in the mid-nineteenth century by the structures you see today. An enemy ship attempting to attack New York City would have to contend with not only Fort Wadsworth, but Fort Hamilton on the other side of the narrows in Brooklyn.<br /> <br /> Would you have felt safer living in New York City knowing that these forts were here?</p>",

Fort Wadsworth guarded the entrance to New York Harbor for the better part of two centuries without ever firing a shot in anger, earning it the moniker \"Guardian of the Narrows\". </p> <p>The unusual looking building in front of you houses Fort Wadsworth’s visitor center and museum. If it’s open be sure to stop inside, talk to a ranger, and learn about the history of New York City’s coastal defenses. Across the street from the plaza is Building 210, which was constructed as barracks in 1930 and today serves as the park headquarters. The large cannon that dominates the plaza is a training mortar.

    "audioDescription": "Jamaica Bay Frank Charles Memorial Park<br />499 words; Length: 2:01<br /><br />Frank Charles Memorial Park is a twenty-acre recreational area serving the Howard Beach Community. It faces south on Jamaica Bay, and has basketball, handball, bocce and tennis courts, a baseball diamond, as well as checkers tables and a children's playground. Oak trees and benches line fifteen-foot wide asphalt walkways, frequented by both runners and walkers. Picnic benches dot the grassy area between the recreation facilities and the narrow beach. A thirty-foot high flag pole stands in the lawn just south of the tennis courts. From the beach, you can see planes landing and taking off from JFK International Airport. <br /><br />The five tennis courts are located on the bay side of the park, along with a horseshoe pit. <br />Just east of the tennis courts, there is a glass encased upright sign attached about two feet off the ground to two black metal poles capped with a round finial. The sign is four feet by four feet and reads: \"Pvt. Frank M. Charles/Frank M. Charles was born on September 27, 1894 within Manhattan. His mother passed away during childbirth and his father soon placed Frank and his two sisters, Anne and Catherine, in a Staten Island orphanage where they lived for seven years. Eventually, his uncle and aunt, Agnes and Bill Charles, adopted the three children. <br /><br />When Bill bought land at nearby Hawtree Beach, he and Frank built bungalows and rented them out for additional income. During his high school years, Frank played football.<br /><br />Later Frank went on to attend Columbia University, but on December 8, 1917, Frank was drafted into the U.S. Army. World War I had hit home. After training at Yaphank, Long Island, he was assigned to Company B, 307th Infantry, 77th Division. In May 1918, Private Charles landed in France. He survived two months of trench warfare, but on July 21, while on a mission to liberate prisoners of war from behind the German line, he was killed in battle. He was 23 years old.<br /><br />In 1922 Private Charles' remains were returned to the United States and he was buried with full military honors at the Calvary Cemetery in Queens. His surviving family moved to West Hamilton Beach and then settled into their permanent home in Howard Beach.<br /><br />In 1912 a recreational building was constructed inside what was then know as Casino Park. The building became known as \"The Casino\" and was a popular place for residents to gather. Facing south, the structure stood just east of the tennis courts in today's park. Eventually the building housed the headquarters of the Pvt. Frank M. Charles Post #480 of the American legion.<br /><br />Although the structure is no longer standing today, the Pvt. Frank M. Charles Memorial Park commemorates this soldier to keep the memory of thousands alive. To recognize their sacrifices honors their service.\"<br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />To the left of the sign, there is a large stone, three feet by three feet, with two memorial plaques honoring local men who died serving their country.<br /><br />End of Message",

It is named for the Nike Air Defense Missiles, which were the last \"guardians\" of the New York Metropolitan Area.<br /> <br /> The granite monument was originally located at the Missile Launch Area in Middletown, New Jersey, where eight Nike Ajax Missiles exploded in 1958. The Middletown missile site closed in 1963, and the monument was then moved to the Army Highlands Air Defense Site in Highlands, New Jersey. With the closing of the Nike Air Defense System nationwide and the<br /> deactivation of the Highlands Air Defense Site in 1974, the Army decided to move the monument to Guardian Park since it would be open to the public as part of Gateway National Recreation Area.</p> <h3>The Damage is Done</h3> <p>In May 1958, eight Nike Ajax missiles exploded at Battery NY-53 in the Leonardo/Belford area of Middletown, New Jersey, during an attempt to modify safety and arming mechanisms. As a result of this accident, the Army initiated \"Operation Fix-it.\" By August 30, 1958, 5,971 Nike Ajax missiles had completed inspection. The new arming device was found to have been incorrectly installed on 605 of these missiles and another 309 were found to contain ruptured or damaged relay caps. Also damaged was the public's perception of the Army's Air Defense program.</p>",

As you walk south towards the missiles from the parking lot, there is step down from a four-inch-high curb before crossing the Multi-Use Path. (Be on the alert for bicycles.) If you approach this site from the road to the south, there is a large, grey wooden sign about four-feet high that reads in large white letters, \"Fort Hancock Historic District.\"<br /><br />The Hercules missile at the center of the site stands about twenty-four feet high. It is a round, white missile with four large triangular fins extending most of the length of the missile, coming to the narrowest point about six-feet from the nose of the missile. At the largest point of the fins, the Hercules missile is about six-feet across. There are four smaller fins above these larger fins, only about three-feet in length. These smaller fins are attached about three feet from the nose of the missile. \"US Army is stenciled in black on all sides. <br /><br />There is an eighteen-inch-high, square cement block installed in front of the missile, with a brass plaque attached that reads: <br /><br />\"Nike Hercules<br />History<br />The Nike Hercules surface-to-air guided missile was the second generation air defense missile developed by in the mid-1950s and initially deployed in 1958.

The Atlantic Ocean beach, boardwalks, courtyards, and walkways gave the city's poor a respite from cramped tenements and crowded city streets. The majestic Art Deco bathhouse acted as a symbol of democracy on this shoreline. Today, it is an excellent example of beachfront recreational architecture of the early twentieth century. Jacob Riis Park is one of Gateway's three swimming beaches. Lifeguards are on duty daily between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day from 10 am to 6 pm. Please only swim in lifeguarded areas when lifeguards are on duty. There are also playgrounds and a picnic area at the park. <br /> <br /> The park was largely built on the site of the former Rockaway Naval Air Station, one of the first US naval air stations.</p> <h3>Rockaway Naval Air Station</h3> <p>The Rockaway Naval Air Station was located on undeveloped New York City park land. In 1918, there were 21 buildings in use there, including hangars for servicing HS-2 flying boats, hangars for housing blimps and Navy-Curtiss flying boats, as well as a variety of other aviation-related structures. In 1919, one of the four Navy-Curtiss flying boats that departed from the air station completed the first transatlantic flight totaling 3,936 miles in 53 hours, 58 minutes.</p> <h3>Jacob Riis Clock</h3> <p>The Wise clock, sometimes known as the Riis Park Memorial clock, was installed on the promenade at the east end of the eclipse on March 4, 1941. Although the exact origin of the clock is unknown, it was probably built in the 1890s as a specially made item by the Wise jewelry store in Brooklyn (although some sources claim that the clock was manufactured by the Howard clock company of Boston). The clock stood in front of the Wise jewelry store at Flatbush Avenue and Nevins Street for approximately 30 years, and then was moved with the company before being moved to the park. The clock was donated to the department of parks by William A. Wise and son in 1941 when the firm went out of business. The clock was restored in 2019. </p> <h3>The Name Behind the Park</h3> <p>Originally named Seaside Beach when it opened in 1912, Jacob Riis Park was later renamed for the famous journalist Jacob August Riis (May 3rd, 1849 - May 26, 1914), who reported on the plight of the poor in New York City. Riis, himself an immigrant from Denmark who had experienced poverty himself, is best known for his book How the Other Half Lives. A bust of the \"muckracking\" journalist was installed during the city park years, but disappeared in the 1960s. A group of local schoolchildren donated a new bust in 2010.</p> <h3> </h3>",

Encompassing more than 9,000 acres, it is comprised of diverse habitats including salt marsh, upland field and woods, several fresh and brackish water ponds and an open expanse of bay and islands - all located within the limits of New York City.</p> <h3>Wildlife</h3> <p>From its inception, the refuge has been managed to provide a variety of habitats that accommodate a diversity of wildlife species. Songbirds and small mammals find food, shelter and nest sites in the upland woods and gardens; egrets, herons, ibis and waterfowl utilize salt marshes and ponds. The wildlife refuge is nationally and internationally renowned as a prime birding spot where thousands of water, land and shorebirds stop during migration. More than 325 species have been recorded here during the last 25 years.</p> <h3>West Pond Trail</h3> <p>This wide gravel trails follows the shoreline of the West Pond, giving visitors the opportunity to walk through the diverse habitats of Jamaica Bay. Salt marshes, mudflats, shorelines, and woodlands can all be found along the West Pond Trail. The abundance of wildlife and plants provide a unique experience for nature lovers throughout the year.<br /> <br /> Take a minute to observe the Osprey platform. Or stop by the northern-most part of the trail to take in breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline. For visitors looking for peace and quiet, or perhaps a bit of shade, the North and South Gardens offer a wonderfully serene experience.<br /> <br /> In order to enjoy the entire walking trail, plan to spend two hours outdoors.</p> <h3>East Pond Trail</h3> <p>The 117-acre East Pond was created in 1951 to support a variety of plant and animal life. Although the pond appears natural, it is in fact a Robert Moses creation. The manmade pond requires the water level to be manipulated throughout the year to provide mud flats for the surprising number of migrating shorebirds and waterfowl that stop here on their journey along the Atlantic Flyway.<br /> <br /> Located across from the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center on the east side of Cross Bay Boulevard, the East Pond demands some preparation for a successful visit. Be sure to wear waterproof walking shoes (or shoes that you won't mind getting muddy and wet). It is also recommended that you bring insect repellent from late Spring through early Fall.</p> <h3>Visitor Center</h3> <p>The Visitor Center building at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge treads lightly on the earth through sustainable design and the use of environmentally friendly materials and technology. Inside, the lobby floor is a sleek, blonde bamboo - a strong and resilient materials made from a quickly growing type of grass. The counters and shelves are made of sycamore, grown for lumber, and wheat (wheat board). The light-colored paint on the walls brightens the space and is made with low volatile organic compounds.<br /> <br /> This building fits into the landscape of the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge through its use of color, design, materials, and technology. To learn more about this environmentally-friendly building, ask a ranger at the front desk for more information.</p> <h3>Other Services</h3> <p>Birding, Nature Walks, Bird Blind, Benches, Parking Lot, Water Fountains, Restrooms</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge Center940 words; Length: 3:26The Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center is the gateway to this 900-acre preserve, home to salt marshes, uplands, open bay and beach areas, and two man-made ponds, all supporting hundreds of species of plant and wildlife. The one story, flat-roofed building contains a ranger desk, colorful exhibits on the eco-system of the surrounding area, a classroom, a book store, wheelchair accessible bathrooms, water fountains, and tactile, hands-on nature exhibits. The building is L-shaped, with one wing extending twenty-four feet towards the parking lot on the south side of the building. At the back of the building there is a garden of native plants found in the preserve, as well as the trailhead for the West Pond trail.You approach the building from the west side of the parking lot using one of two eight-foot wide concrete walks. The walkways have two-foot high solar lights on the side. The building sits back on a square concrete apron, twenty-four feet wide by twenty-four feet deep. There is a slatted bench on the right side of the platform and a garbage can just beyond. On the opposite side of the platform, a glass encased, weathered wood housing holds a bulletin board with information on the area. Over the entry doors there is a weathered wood overhang at roof level with \"Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge\" in raised gold metal letters. Solar panels sit at a 45-degree angle on a raised roof extension on the north side of the building. There is a women's room just to the right of the main entrance. A gravel path on the right leads around the building with a split rail fence on the right protecting the natural vegetation area. A sign issuing a warning about deer ticks hangs from the fence. The men's room is on the left of the path at the rear of the building, as well as a raised wooden apron leading to the rear entrance to the main room of the building.The trail head for the West Pond Trail is found at the rear of the building on the right hand side of the gravel walkway. There is a long trail and a short trail. You reach the trail head for the long trail first. The trailhead for the short trail is just to the left. If you continue along the rear path, you come to a phenology garden on the left. This garden has samples of different types of plants that can be found in the wildlife refuge. All of the plants are identified with markers. You enter the Visitor Center through the glass double doors into a trapezoidal-shaped foyer, about twelve feet deep and twenty feet wide at the widest point. The foyer has brown brick walls on the north and south sides. The bricks are set vertically and the walls are hung with floor-to-ceiling photographs of flora and fauna in the preserve. On the left, there is a photograph of a salt marsh with green marsh grass and mud flats. Hanging beside it is a photograph of a tree in early autumn, with leaves just beginning to turn bright red. On the right hand wall, there is a photograph of a small duck* sitting on a narrow rock in the water. Beside it hangs a close up shot of leaves just beginning to turn from green to orange and brown tones.Another set of wide, glass double doors framed in light brown wood open into the main room of the Visitor Center. The flat-screened television behind the desk displays information about events at the Wildlife Refuge as well as still photographs of the wildlife and plants in the area. Displays hang on the wall giving the history of the Jamaica Bay area, ecological information, and information on the National Park Service and parks throughout the United States. The room is approximately forty feet deep by twenty-four feet wide with twelve-foot high ceilings. The ranger station, a semi-circular, light wood desk about fifteen feet in diameter, is on the left. The light yellow walls and polished light wood floors combined with the floor-to-ceiling windows at the back wall give an open feeling to the space. Towards the back of the main room, there is a three-foot high, square, glass-topped display case with a map of the area entitled \"Jamaica Bay, Above, Below, and All Around\". On the four sides of the six-foot by six-foot display case, there are informational displays of various aspects of Jamaica Bay: the ongoing dredging, a short historical perspective of the area, the watershed ecosystem, and the wildlife. At each corner of the case, there is a tactile exhibit of different fish, shell fish, and amphibians in the area. There are boxes below the window sills at the rear of the room containing shells of horseshoe crabs, turtles, and mollusks. There are also boxes with mushrooms, pinecones, and other botanical samples. You can pick these samples up and feel them.The bookstore is on the left at the rear of the room. It sells games, books, plush toys, and souvenirs. There are windows on three sides of the store, filling the it with light. A birdhouse sitting on a colorful",

In the late 19<sup>th</sup> century residents complained that poor landscaping and frequent construction at Fort Wadsworth was leading to pools of standing water, from which foul vapors, known as miasmas, were issuing, causing outbreaks of diseases like malaria and yellow fever. Today we know that their fears weren’t entirely unfounded—both yellow fever and malaria are spread by mosquitos, which breed in pools of stagnant water. Major landscape work on the grounds did in fact lead to a decline in cases of malaria. It was also the start of the park like setting Fort Wadsworth has today.<br /> <br /> How is your community kept safe? Do you spend more time thinking about national security or the security of your neighborhood?</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Sandy Hook Mortar Battery<br />386 words; Length: 1:29<br /><br />The Mortar Battery is a concrete gun battery with four mortar pits. It is protected by dunes and earth embankments. It is faced with a wall about eight feet tall and four feet wide at the base. The wall is about two hundred yards in length. Outside the wall, there is a brown, upright metal sign posted on two grey wooden posts about three feet high that reads \"Mortar Battery\". The Multi-Use Path passes directly in front of the battery, so be alert for bikes. <br /> <br />You enter the area through a ten foot-wide opening in the wall. As you enter, you face an earth embankment with trees and low shrubs to the right and left. A path runs between the wall and the embankment. An electric, chain link fence stretches across the embankment on either side. A twenty-four inch by twelve inch white sign is attached to the fence. It reads: \"Electric Fence. Do Not Touch. Shock Hazard\".<br /><br />An informational sign entitled \"Mortar Battery\" stands just to right of the hazard warning. It has a black and white photograph of four manned mortars in one of the mortar pits and explains why batteries became more predominant than forts as battleships became more powerful.<br /><br />An interior path leads straight ahead between two eight-foot thick concrete walls. The massive wall slopes up at a forty-five degree angle until it levels off at ten feet in height. The path has two parallel metal tracks running down the center that were for transporting heavy armory. <br /><br />About fifty feet ahead, there is an arched concrete bridge across the walls with a ten foot by ten foot enclosed structure on the top. Just before reaching the concrete bridge, there is a black metal grate on the right, screening off crumbling concrete steps that once provided access to the structure.<br /><br />The archway is about fifteen feet high and fifteen feet long with rough concrete walls. You exit the archway into a center courtyard area with fifteen-foot high walls. The walls then angle upwards another fifteen feet in height to the earth embankment. The tracks lead to a metal gate directly ahead. <br /><br />Ranger tours are available that provide access to the closed off areas of the battery. There is a scale model of the Mortar Battery in the Lighthouse Visitor's Center.<br /><br />End of Message",

Sandy Hook became the only place in the US and its possessions having a nine gun battery mounting large caliber, disappearing guns. However, the Army found that having only one gun commander for the whole battery made it difficult to coordinate the loading, aiming, and firing of nine big cannons. To solve this problem, in 1904, the Army divided the long battery into four distinct gun batteries, each one commanded by its own gun commander.</p> <h3>Four Gun Commanders</h3> <p>The Army found that one gun commander had a hard time coordinating the loading, aiming, and firing of nine big cannons. To solve this problem, in 1904, the Army divided the long battery into four distinct gun batteries, each one commanded by its own gun commander.</p> <h3>Battery Alexander</h3> <p>This battery is at the north end of Nine Gun Battery. It consisted of two Model 1888, 12-inch, breech-loading rifled guns mounted on Model 1896 disappearing gun carriages. The battery was named in honor of Revolutionary War General William Alexander, known as Lord Sterling, who lived on a large estate in the Basking Ridge section of New Jersey.</p> <h3>Battery Halleck</h3> <p>This battery, next to Battery Alexander, consisted of three Model 1888, 10-inch, breech-loading rifled guns on Model 1896 disappearing gun carriages. The battery was named in honor of Major General Henry W. Halleck, who was the U.S. Army's Chief of Staff during the American Civil War.</p> <h3>Battery Bloomfield</h3> <p>This battery, next to Battery Halleck, consisted of two Model 1888, 12-inch, breech loading, rifled guns mounted on Model 1896 disappearing gun carriages. The battery was named in honor of Brigadier General Joseph Bloomfield, who served during the American Revolution and was governor of New Jersey when the War of 1812 began.</p> <h3>Battery Richardson</h3> <p>This battery, the most southern battery, had two Model 1900, 12-inch, breech loading, rifled guns mounted on Model 1897 disappearing gun carriages. The battery was named in honor of Brigadier General Israel Richardson, who was mortally wounded at the Civil War Battle of Antietam. Today, Antietam is a National Battlefield Park preserved by the National Park Service.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Sandy Hook Nine Gun Battery<br />426 words; Length: 1:39<br /><br />The Sandy Hook Nine Gun Battery is a massive concrete and brick two story structure about 200 yards long. The battery has three architecturally different sections, left, middle and right. It is fenced off with chain link fencing and no visitors are allowed on the structure. The Multi-Use Path passes directly in front of the fence. A paving stone plaza with benches, bulletin boards, bike racks and a portable toilet is positioned just off the parking area. There is an informational wayside sign at this site.<br /><br />The left side of the battery's lower level has a solid concrete face with four black metal doors, each about 10 feet tall, spaced about 6 feet apart. There are two wooden doors painted green to the left of the black doors. A set of stairs leading up to the upper level is at the far end of the structure.<br /><br />A brown metal upright sign with a white border, elevated about four feet high, reads: \"Extremely Hazardous Conditions/Area Closed\". The sign is positioned in front of the chain link fence at the left end of the structure.<br /><br />At the center of the lower level, there is a series of concrete steps up to the first floor gallery. The gallery is elevated three feet off the ground. The stairs are spaced about every 100 feet in a sloped concrete abutment. Two-foot wide, square concrete pillars support the upper deck. The pillars are approximately twelve feet tall. Above the lower gallery, there is a walkway protected by black handrails that run the length of the upper level.<br /><br />The right end of the structure has a lower level gallery raised four feet from the ground. There are four concrete pillars supporting the upper level. There is a storage area on the second story with doors and windows. Two of the windows are blocked off with cement. A black metal catwalk runs the width of the right end of the structure.<br /><br />The three foot by four-foot informational wayside sign is at the left of the battery positioned in the grassy area in front of the chain link fence. It gives an overview of the concrete gun batteries constructed here, as well as Sandy Hook's importance in the defense of New York Harbor. There are three black and white photographs depicting the batteries and guns, plus a color aerial photograph of the area. It is framed in black metal and stands three feet high at a slight ten-degree angle, front to back. It is entitled \"Fort Hancock/Coastal Defenses of Sandy Hook\". <br /><br />End of Message",

Addabbo Memorial Bridge provides access to the kayak launch and a narrow strip of beach about fifty yards long. The beach has a clear view of the hangars and control tower of JFK International Airport across the water. It has picnic tables and portable toilets. The parking lot runs north and south along side the north-bound lane of Cross Bay Boulevard and has a grass meridian strip planted with three London plane trees. A three-inch curb runs around the whole of the meridian. There are two rows of diagonal parking spaces on the east side of the lot and one row of parallel parking on the west side. The portable toilet is at the north end of the meridian strip. A pedestrian cross walk at the north end of the lot gives access to a second parking lot and narrow beach along the southbound lane of Cross Bay Boulevard. This second parking lot looks west across the North Channel and Pumpkin Patch Channel, with views of the hammocks and islands of Jamaica Bay.<br /><br />An upright sign at the north end of the lot, just before the sandy area and the water, is entitled \"Paddling Jamaica Bay\". It stands about three feet off the ground, attached to two black metal posts, and measures four feet by three feet. It features a photograph of a kayaker paddling in quiet waters, silhouetted against the sunset. The text reads: \"Gateway National Recreation Area is the primary steward of Jamaica Bay, home to a complex of wetlands and uplands that support a large diversity of both native and migratory fish, birds and other wildlife. In addition to providing critical habitat for wildlife, the wetlands of Jamaica Bay also provide important services for humans: marshes act as a protective barrier against storm surges and shore erosion, while improving water quality by absorbing pollutants.\"<br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />Below the text, there is a map of Jamaica Bay with all available kayak launches named in red. There are iconic symbols for the services offered at each one. To the left of the map, there is a column of text on a yellow background that reads: \"Jamaica Bay is the largest expanse of sheltered open space in the region, and one of the finest opportunities for paddle sports in the northeast United States. From short introductory trips lasting less than an hour; detailed excursions into the channels among the delicate marsh highlands; or more experienced paddlers navigating around the tip of the Rockaway Peninsula for some ocean kayaking. Jamaica Bay has something for every level.\"<br /><br />End of Text<br /><br />Below the map there are three extensive sets of kayaking tips entitled \"Know Before You Go\", \"Good to Go\", and \"Protect the Bay\". The tips are printed over a photograph of a snowy egret wading in the water.<br /><br />Four feet to the left of the kayaking sign, there is a white sign with the rules and regulations of the parking area.<br /><br />At the south end of the lot, there is a red brick picnic pavilion, no longer in use. Wooden posts, the last remnants of an old pier, emerge from the water in front of the former picnic pavilion.<br /><br />The beach is composed of tan sand but has quite a few large rocks, so watch your step. The edge of the beach and the shallow waters just beyond are often host to many seagulls. The grassy mounds of the Landfill Restoration Project lie straight ahead across the bay.

    "audioDescription": "Jamaica Bay Plumb Beach<br />449 words; Length: 1:33<br /><br />Plumb beach is a wide, sandy beach on Rockaway Inlet, just off the east bound lane of the Belt Parkway. It is frequented by windsurfers, kite boarders and kayakers. In May and June, Plumb Beach is a breeding ground for horseshoe crabs, so watch your step. Also, there may be glass on the beach, so tread carefully. There is a round, concrete, flat roofed building, once a concession stand, set back from the parking lot on a concrete apron. There are two portable toilets, one on either side of the circular building. Three flags fly from white brackets attached to the front of the building, the U.S. flag in the center, the New York State flag to the left as you face the building, and the New York City Parks Department flag on the right. The parking lot is about eighty yards long and has heavy wooden fencing on the beach side. A bike path runs through the area in front of the building and there are benches that line the path.<br /><br />The art deco building is painted red and is about fifteen-feet tall. On the beach side, about ten feet up, a circular shaped flat white roof extends from the building, supported by six round metal poles, also painted red. The poles are about about six inches in diameter. The rectangular windows just under the roof extension have grillwork with a sea life theme: fish and seaweed below, stylized waves in the center, and seabirds above. There are pull down steel shutters over the two doors, one in the front, one on the west side. A National Park Service green and brown arrowhead logo and a New York City Parks Department maple leaf logo are attached just below the roof line between the flags.<br /><br />The beach is about 50 yards wide and, on the east side, has a gentle curve. There is a breakwater of large grey stones on the east. It is about ten feet wide at the water's edge and gradually narrows as it follows the curve of the beach for about twenty yards. <br /><br />Looking out across Rockaway Inlet, the Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge is visible to the east and the apartment buildings of Sheepshead Bay to the west. At 2 o'clock, the modern architecture of the library and other buildings at Kingsboro College face the water. <br /><br />The low dunes are dotted with small trees and covered with sea grass and scrub. They are protected in places with beach fencing. If you step beyond the break water and follow the beach to the east, there is a salt marsh area on the other side of the dunes, a breeding ground for horseshoe crabs.<br /><br />End of Message",

The infectious disease ward at the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital that opened in 1911 is perhaps the best-known example of a quarantine in New York today, but for many years it was these two islands that served as New York City’s first line of defense against contagion. Hoffman and Swinburne islands, as they are known today, were created artificially atop a shoal in the harbor in the early 1870s.</p> <p>Ships coming to New York Harbor were required to stop at a new quarantine station on Staten Island in Rosebank, where the quarantine’s administrative offices were located. Doctors from the quarantine station would inspect the ships, with particular attention given to any that had travelled from South America and Africa. Tropical diseases were more easily spread amongst New Yorkers, who had little exposure and thus little natural immunity to them. Swinburne Island served as a hospital; people who were known to be infected and displaying symptoms would be treated there. Those who had been exposed to contagion but did not show signs of infection were quarantined on Hoffman Island, where they would remain until they either became ill or until enough time had passed that they could be considered healthy. For decades, these islands were the first—and sometimes only—stop for immigrants entering the United States. Today, they are unpopulated and comprise part of the Staten Island Unit of Gateway.<br /> <br /> The quarantine was located on these artificial islands because no one wanted a hospital for infectious diseases in their community.<br /> <br /> Would an infectious disease hospital near your home make you feel uncomfortable? Is it much different from objections to prisons or drug treatment centers in your neighborhood?</p>",

The Fresnel lens resembled a giant old-fashioned beehive, inside of which was a single lamp. The lens' thick prisms bent the lamp's light to the center of the lens, greatly magnifying the light into a powerful beam that could be seen for miles at night. Fresnel made his lenses in six different sizes, or \"orders.\" The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order lenses were usually installed in seacoast lighthouses to warn ships that they were approaching land. The 4th, 5th, and 6th order lenses were used in harbor and sound lighthouses. A Fresnel lens was shipped to America in 1840, destined for the Sandy Hook Lighthouse, but it was slightly too large to fit inside the lens house. That lens and a second one were transferred over to the Twin Lights in Navesink, NJ, making them the first American lighthouses to uses Fresnel lenses. The Sandy Hook Lighthouse was refitted with its present 3rd order Fresnel lens in 1857 when the iron lens house (lanthorn) was added to the tower.</p> <h3>National Historic Landmark</h3> <p>On June 11, 1964, the Sandy Hook Lighthouse was declared a National Historic Landmark on the 200th anniversary of its first lighting. This faithful sentinel still continues its original function. The light is currently an automated 3rd order Fresnel lens, fixed white light, visible for nineteen miles on a clear night. The light is maintained by the United States Coast Guard and is kept on 24 hours a day.</p>",

It has a rough stucco surface covering its brick structure. It sits atop a smooth white concrete pedestal, about 8 feet high. There are three 8 paned rectangular windows in the side of the tower closest to the door and four 8 paned rectangular windows along the next side of the lighthouse.<br /><br />The light house is accessed through a white door under a gabled roof. There is one step up to the door, which opens to the outside.<br /><br />To the right of the door there is a brass plaque attached to the lighthouse about 6 feet above the ground, measuring 2 feet by 2 Â½ feet that reads:<br /><br />\"Sandy Hook Light. This light was completed in 1764 and is the oldest continuously operating light house in the United States. New York merchants petitioned the Assembly to raise money for the light by lotteries and tonnage taxes on ships entering New York. In 1789, the federal government formed the U.S. Lighthouse Service, later incorporated into the U.S. Coast Guard, to operate this light and all other aids to navigation in U.S. waters. Sandy Hook Light is 29 feet in diameter at the base and fifteen feet in diameter at the top. Its 45000 candlepower light is 85 feet above the ground and can be seen for 19 miles. Sandy Hook Light is a reminder of our rich maritime history and is still an important aid to navigation into New York Harbor.\" The plaque was dedicated June 11th, 1976.

    "bodyText": "<p>More than two decades before Fort Hancock was commissioned in 1895, the U.S. Ordnance Department tested new and experimental weapons at Sandy Hook.</p> <h3>What is a Proving Ground?</h3> <p>\"Proving ground\" is a term for a place where weapons can be tested. The Sandy Hook Proving Ground was established in 1874. Less than 10 years earlier, the Civil War had introduced several new innovations in weaponry. Rifled cannons fired pointed-nosed projectiles farther and faster than cannonballs. Iron clad warships mounted guns that could easily destroy the walls of a traditional fort. The Army needed a place to test its own new weapons.</p> <h3>Testing Weapons</h3> <p>New weapons, such as artillery shells, fuses, gun powders, and other ordnances could be tested on the proving grounds of Sandy Hook. The Army had to develop new cannons and ordnance because the American Civil War had introduced new rifled, breech-loading guns, along with new steam-powered warships made of iron. Following the Civil War, foreign countries began making bigger cannons and bigger and faster warships. To keep up with the world-wide arms race, the U.S. Army began creating larger, more powerful guns that could sink any warship.</p> <h3>Location</h3> <p>Owned by the federal government since 1817, Sandy Hook was chosen for a proving ground because it was located next to a large industrial area that had rail and water transportation, yet it was isolated enough that local people would not be hurt by ordnance testing. Also, the Hook's long, flat beaches and low sand dunes provided a clear field of fire for guns firing from North Beach down to targets set almost four miles down range near the south end of the Hook.</p> <h3>Development</h3> <p>The Army developed a wide variety of weapons at Sandy Hook that included rapid fire machine guns, field artillery, howitzers (guns mounted on wheeled carriages that could quickly follow infantry and cavalry across battlefields) and siege & coastal defense artillery. Gun calibers ranged from 1-inch caliber up to a giant 16-inch gun that the Army began testing in 1902. Gun testing started in 1874 and would continue for 45 years when, in 1919, the Sandy Hook Proving ground was closed and moved to a new proving ground in Aberdeen, Maryland.</p>",

The area has 6 wayside signs that give the history of the site.<br /><br /><br />There are also 2 L-shaped walls south of the main gun battery. These walls are about ten feet high and 6 feet wide at the base, angling upwards from the rear of the walls to a top narrowing to four feet in width. <br /><br />Walking north, there is a 4 foot-high battery fronted by a wide apron of concrete. This structure is where guns were mounted for testing. The battery is about 100 yards long, with five sets of five crumbling concrete steps spaced about every twenty feet. Between the steps, there are 12 by 12 foot concrete platforms for the guns. The exposed 8 foot circle of steel rods is all that remains of the original gun mounts. <br /><br />Metal railroad tracks run through the ground level concrete apron in front of the mounting platform.<br /><br />Between the multi-use path and the gun platforms, there are two 12 foot-high walls that are 10 feet thick. These walls, called traverses, allowed protection for the gun crews and observers during testing. On the side of the walls facing the ocean, there are arched recesses about a foot deep where the soldiers could stand.

Never missing an opportunity, Robert Moses also had the construction teams build two freshwater ponds next to the railroad line - an East Pond of about 100 acres and a West Pond of approximately 45 acres. Moses had achieved his goal, creating a wildlife sanctuary in the middle of the strongly disputed Jamaica Bay.",

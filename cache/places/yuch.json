    "bodyText": "Â  <h4>A 19th Century City in Alaska</h4> <p>Preserved much as it was in 1899, the small isolated community of Eagle offers visitors a rare glimpse into Alaskaâs past. In its heyday, the City of Eagle served as judicial and transportation hub for interior Alaska, and adjacent Fort Egbert as the military and communications center. Eagle began as a fur trading post around 1880. When gold was discovered at nearby American Creek, a small mining camp was established at Eagle. The rush of gold seekers to Canadaâs Klondike in brought national attention to Eagle. The prime site along the Yukon River a few miles from the Canadian border was an ideal location for the development of the City of Eagle. Fort Egbert was established as a control station and headquarters for interior Alaska in 1899 adjacent to Eagle.<br /> <br /> Today, the Bureau of Land Management and Eagle Historical Society and Museums manage several of the historic buildings of Eagle. In addition, many of the historic homes are privately owned. A joint BLM/NPS field office is located in Eagle and can provide the visitor with more information on Eagle as well as nearby Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve.</p> <h4><br /> Additional Information</h4> <p><a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit-us/search-details/14535/2\">Visit Fort Egbert in Eagle, Alaska</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951p00916616d&view=1up&seq=1\">Eagle - Fort Egbert: A Remnant of the Past, BLM</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.eaglehistoricalsociety.com/\">Eagle Historical Society</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yuch/learn/historyculture/eagle-city.htm\">Yukon Charley Rivers National Preserve - Learn about Eagle's history</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/akso/history/PDF/NHL-Goldrush.pdf\">Alaska Goldrush NHLs: The Stampede North</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=2704ba41-0107-4c07-8a9d-e2231f72a6e2\">National Register of Historic Places - Official Nomination Form</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nhlalaska/index.htm\">More National Historic Landmarks in Alaska</a></p>",

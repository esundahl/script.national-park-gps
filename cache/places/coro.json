    "audioDescription": "The cave is made of a gray colored limestone. It extends 600 feet into the mountain. The entrance of the cave is made up of large boulders that have to be carefully navigated about 30 feet down. Once in the cave it is very dusty and does not require any technical equipment. The first large room is around 70 feet wide with 20-foot-high ceilings. Few formations can be found in this first room. An upward slope takes you to the narrowest part of the cave approximately four feet wide and into the second room which is similar in size to the first. The second room has larger formations such as stalactites, stalagmites, and columns. A steep slope at the back of the cave will take you to a skylight where daylight can be seen streaming in.",

When this happens, it looks just like a trail - only wider.<br /> <br /> The full length of the road can also be used by dog walkers to give people and leashed pets the rare opportunity of being able to walk under redwoods together. (Keep in mind, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">pets </a>are not allowed on any park trails).<br /> <br /> For bicyclists, Cal Barrel Road offers a round-tip ride of seven miles with a long steady climb.<br /> <br /> In the winter (and occasionally in summer) the gate at the bottom of the road will be closed. In this case walkers, hikers, and leashed pets are still able to use the road.",

    "bodyText": "This is a great hub for some hiking, biking, wildlife viewing AND it has plenty of parking! This combination is rare in the redwoods.<br /> <br /> Walkers and hikers love this place because it leads to the gentle Trillium Falls Trail with its old-growth redwoods, and also to the steep Berry Glen Trail. <br /> <br /> Seeing old-growth redwood trees - by bike - is an easy adventure from this location. Several designated bike trails cross through here. You can bike east towards the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lostmancreektrail.htm\">Lost Man Creek Trail </a>and the Bald Hills, north to the Elk Prairie Campground, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/nbd.htm\">Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway</a>, and the eastern side of Ossagon Trail, or you can bike west along bike trails and dirt roads to Gold Bluffs Beach - and eventually to the western side of Ossagon Trail.<br /> <br /> The site is currently a habitat restoration area and it has many stories to tell. For several decades in the 20th century there was a redwood logging mill right where the parking lot and meadow now is. Some of the forests next to this site were logged right up to the day before the national park was established in 1968. Interpretive panels show what the site looked like in the early 1990s and they explain the on-going ecosystem restoration efforts in the redwood parks.<br /> <br /> Some large pieces of logging equipment is still sitting in the meadows nearby, and second-growth forests surround almost the whole site.<br /> <br /> Prairie Creek runs close by, and salmon and other fish are benefiting from years of river restoration - though more restoration is to come. In autumn, large salmon can be seen here. It is common to see bears and elk in this area so keep smart and safe around these wild animals. <br /> <br /> Visitor coming here in the next years will see and hear ecosystem restoration efforts happening across HWY 101. This is part of \"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/learn/nature/restoration-main.htm\">Redwoods Rising</a>\" and we are working in once-logged forests and putting them on a course to grow into thousands of acres of healthier redwood forests.",
    "audioDescription": "This site has several acres of open space and grassy meadows that are surrounded by low hills. Forests of young Douglas-fir trees are closest to the site, and on the ridge-line across HWY 101 are old-growth redwoods trees. Picnic tables, wayside signs, orientation kiosks, viewing platforms and bathrooms are within a few hundred feet of the parking area.",

    "bodyText": "<strong>A Popular Walk That Comes With Stream Crossings and Walls of Greenery.<br /> <br /> NEW in 2022!<br /> If you plan to drive to Fern Canyon from May 1st - Sept 30th, you will need to apply for online - and have been issued - a free </strong><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/planyourvisit/ferncanyonpermits.htm\">Gold Bluffs Beach / Fern Canyon parking permit.</a><strong> </strong>Read the official <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/learn/news/gbbpermits.htm\">news release</a> about how we are protecting this area with timed-entries. Summer visitors now will have a safer and much less crowded experience at Fern Canyon. Note: Hikers can still hike the 11-mile round trip to Fern Canyon from the Prairie Creek Visitor Center without any permit.<br /> <br /> Prepare to get your feet wet to really explore this short walk into a stunning mini-canyon covered with ferns. This is a very popular walk up a cobbled stream. Many travel writers and bloggers talk about the natural beauty of this area. You won't find huge redwoods right here, but it is surrounded by Sitka spruce and other conifers.<br /> <br /> From the parking lot by Gold Bluffs Beach, the trail can be done as a 1-mile \"lolly-pop\" loop with an elevation gain of 150 feet. If you want to do the loop, a quarter of the mile up the canyon keep an eye out for stairs leading up the left side as the canyon walls get less steep. This side-trail will then eventually loop back to the mouth of Fern Canyon. <br /> <br /> Or, if you want to go in and out, hikers can stick to the bed of Home Creek. Within quarter of a mile you see the steep, leafy walls of Fern Canyon. This easier option has a 30-foot elevation change. Either of these options might mean walking or winding in-between or under log jams that occur in winter floods.<br /> <br /> Normally from June to September there are wooden footbridges installed in Fern Canyon to help walkers get partway up Home Creek without getting their feet too wet. Our advice is to wear waterproof footwear with good traction, and bring a pair of dry shoes to wear after your walk.<br /> <br /> Be aware that Davison Road (a windy, dirt road) is has limits on vehicle sizes. Vehicles need to be less than 24-feet long. Therefore getting to Fern Canyon is <strong>not an option for large recreational vehicles or anything towing a trailer</strong>. Also, people driving <strong>low-clearance vehicles often get stuck when trying to cross two streams</strong> on the way to the Fern Canyon parking area.<br /> <br /> There is a California State Park entrance kiosk to access the area. Fees are $12 for a regular vehicle. California State and federal entrance passes are honored at this kiosk.<strong> Credit cards are not accepted</strong>.<br /> <br /> A herd of Roosevelt Elk is often in the area and these are wild animals. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/learn/nature/roosevelt-elk.htm\">Learn how to be safe around elk</a>. It is important to keep your distance - don't approach them at all. In early summer, the females will protect their fawns by kicking at a human head with their massive front legs. In autumn, the male elk will be fighting for dominance and their antlers can be deadly.<br /> <br /> Before you set off to visit Fern Canyon, be sure to check <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/planyourvisit/conditions.htm\">current conditions</a> and make sure that the roads are open - or to see if the seasonal footbridges have been installed.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Safety Tips</span></span></span> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">We recommend you purchase and use a good map and trail guide for your adventures in Redwood National and State Parks.

    "audioDescription": "The gravel parking area can hold several dozen vehicles. On the northern end is the Fern Canyon Trailhead which has interpretive signs, orientation maps and safety information about elk. On the western end of the lot are the vault toilets. The trail is dirt and gravel for the first few hundred feet until it reaches Home Creek. The creek flows gently in the summer dry season and it can be a foot deep. From here the trail turns inland and becomes river cobbles. In the summer, temporary footbridges made of wood are installed to help cross parts of the creek. After several hundred feet, the canyon walls loom fifty feet high, and these are covered in different species of green ferns. Dripping water, and rivulets flow off these walls. Tree branches, and sometimes entire tree trunks can block the trail after winter rains and floods. These obstacles are not easy pass unless a person crawls or climbs over them.",

National Park Service and CA State Park passes are accepted here. Credit cards are not accepted.<br /> <br /> The access road (Davison Road) is dirt, very narrow and windy. <strong>Recreational vehicles and vehicles towing a trailer are not permitted on Davison Road</strong>.<br /> <br /> There are not toilets at every pullout along the Gold Bluffs Beach day use area. There are vault toilets at the northern end of the road - next to the Fern Canyon parking area. Picnic tables are plentiful along the length of the day use area, and the ocean is just a few hundred yards to the west. However, this is not a good swimming beach - the water is very cold and currents are swift. Vehicles are not allowed on the beach. Leashed pets are allowed.<br /> <br /> Gold Bluffs Beach is known for it's miles of gray sand, driftwood, and protected dunes. Mammals like seals and rare birds like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/learn/nature/western-snowy-plover.htm\">snowy plovers</a> nest and rest along the beach. To protect these species, it is important to keep out of any closures that the park staff might have set up. Sadly, wildlife on these beaches have been killed by off-leash dogs. Learn about our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">BARKRanger program</a>.<br /> <br /> The orange-colored bluffs along the road were formed by sediment coming from the Klamath River. In the mid-1800s, it was these cliffs that drew gold miners to the area. Sections of the California Coastal Trail pass along here, and the waters offshore are part of California Marine Protected Areas. (MPAs).<br /> <br /> In recent years, a lot of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/gbbdunerestoration.htm?utm_source=article&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=experience_more&utm_content=large\">beach restoration</a> and removal of invasive plant species has occurred along Gold Bluffs Beach. Wildlife, and the parks' ecosystems have benefited from this ongoing project.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<em>Note: In late 2021 the Prairie Creek Trail was renamed the Karl Knapp Trail. Future</em> <em>publications, maps, and signs will show the new name.</em><br /> <br /> Not to be missed! These wheelchair accessible trails make a breath-taking 2.5 mile (4km) loop under redwoods. Many other trails fork off from the route in this description - but signs along the trails allow for easy way finding.<br /> <br /> During this walk you will experience groves of some of the world's tallest redwoods, and you be able to rest on benches next to a babbling creek. Some of these trees are more than 310 feet (100m) high.<br /> <br /> This loop is a combination of the Karl Knapp Trail, the Foothills Trail and a few hundred feet of the Cathedral Trees Trail. The loop begins and ends in front of the Prairie Creek Visitor Center. From this starting point, the Karl Knapp trail heads north and follows creeks and the bottom of hillsides. There are two pedestrian bridge crossings and late autumn keep an eye out for salmon swimming or spawning below you. There are redwood benches located in a couple of places along the scenic trail. After a mile, the Karl Knapp Trail then forks east - towards the sounds the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/nbd.htm\">Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway</a> and to the \"Big Tree Wayside\".<br /> <br /> After crossing the parkway you will be on the Foothills Trail. Follow the signs south to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/bigtree.htm\">Big Tree Wayside</a>. Once at the \"Big Tree\" keep following the Foothills Trail south for less than a mile. This part of the Foothills Trail parallels the Newton B Drury Scenic Parkway.<br /> <br /> At the southern end of the Foothills Trail you will take a fork onto the Cathedral Trees Trail. Then head west on the Cathedral Trees Trail for a few hundred yards - crossing the parkway - back to the Prairie Creek Visitor Center.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Roosevelt elk </a>can be blocking the trail and it's important not to approach these large and wild animals. If you need to turn back - then that is the smartest decision to make.<br /> <br /> Parking close to this trailhead can be hard to find in summer. There is <strong>plenty of parking for RVs and trailers along the Elk Meadow section of Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway.</strong><br /> <br /> <u>Map Tips</u> <ul> <li>Use the zoom feature to explore trails and other digital map features in greater detail.</li> <li>Don’t solely rely on online maps when you are here.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>We recommend you use a physical map or trail guide for your adventures in Redwood National and State Parks.</li> <li>Staff are available at visitor centers to help with additional trip planning needs.</li> </ul> <u>Safety Tips</u> <ul> <li>To protect the habitats, leave no trace also means staying on the developed trail. Please don’t go off-trail and make any new trails. These forests grow by the inch, and will die by your foot.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>To protect the wildlife (and you and other visitors), pets are not allowed on park trails.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Cell coverage is very limited and cannot be relied on in an emergency. Have a plan for checking in and checking out with a friend when you are here.</li> </ul> <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The trail is four to five feet wide and composed of loose aggregate materials. Redwood trees with diameters exceeding 10-feet are common along these trails. Many fallen redwood trees more than 150 long are seen, and some of these fallen trees cross small gullies, or the creek. The creek is about 15 feet wide and is shallow. Grey cobbles form the stream channel. All over the forest floor are different species ferns.",

However, there is a hikers' bridge with a slope that makes it not officially accessible for those with a wheelchair.<br /> <br /> To get to this grove, you will need to drive three miles (5km) of the Bald Hills Road - <strong>this road is not recommended for RVs or trailers</strong>. It is narrow and windy with very few pull outs or turn-around spots. Parking on the Bald Hills Road is not allowed because of the danger of collisions with on-coming traffic. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lbjparking.htm\">Lady Bird Johnson Grove parking</a> spots are too small for buses, recreational vehicles and trailers.<br /> <br /> In summer, daily ranger-led walks begin at the parking lot. Numbered interpretive trail posts are found along the trail. We no longer have the printed version available at the trailhead. The online version of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lady-bird-johnson-nature-trail-stop-2.htm?utm_source=place&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=experience_more&utm_content=large\">Lady Bird Johnson Grove tour</a> is available to download on the NPS digital app.<br /> <br /> There is a lot of interesting human history, passion, and conflict surrounding the establishment of Redwood National Park. On this trail, you will walking in the footsteps of so many who helped protect the last of the redwoods.<br /> <br /> In the mid-1960s, clear cut logging of old-growth redwood trees was occurring all over these hills. On October 2nd 1968, Redwood National Park was officially established. At that time, logging of redwoods came right up to the park boundary - which originally was just outside of this grove. The first park visitors saw miles of scarred and logged landscapes that dramatically ended at the edge of the remaining redwood groves.<br /> <br /> The following year in 1969 President Nixon dedicated this grove to former First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson, for all of her conservation and environmental work. The dedication plaque for Lady Bird Johnson Grove can be seen about half a mile down the trail. Only 5% of the world's old-growth redwood forest remain - and nearly half of that (40,000 acres) is in Redwood National and State Parks.<br /> <br /> This trail is one of the few areas where you can walk in just a few steps through a second growth forest into an old-growth redwood forest. Most of the trees next to the parking lot are second-growth Douglas-fir trees. That means they were planted after the ancient redwoods were logged in the 1960s. Visitors today will see thousands of acres of second-growth forests before they experience the pockets of old growth-redwoods.<br /> <br /> Across Redwood National and State Parks, we have an ambitious habitat restoration program called <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/redwoodsrisingmain.htm\">Redwoods Rising.</a> It is planned that by the mid-2020s, the three miles of second-growth forests along Bald Hills Road leading up to this parking lot will be treated. Visitors will see first hand-how we <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/learn/nature/forestthinning.htm\">restore second-growth forests</a> so they can grow into healthy redwood forests of the future.<br /> <br /> Once you cross the hikers' bridge you will be immersed in old-growth redwoods that have never been logged. You can see, feel, and even hear the differences between these two kinds of forest.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Safety Tips</span></span></span> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">We recommend you purchase and use a good map and trail guide for your adventures in Redwood National and State Parks.

    "audioDescription": "At this site, old-growth redwoods, spruce, fir and hemlock forests are on the north side of the Bald Hills Road. This type of ancient forests have large, old trees widely spaced apart from each other. Old growth redwood forests have be a lot of light and ferns and other shrubs cover the forest floor. On the south side of the road and at parking lot is second-growth forests that were planted in the 1960s. These have young, skinny Douglas fir trees. In this kind of forest, all the trees just a few feet apart and it is dark with little undergrowth. There is parking for about twenty smaller vehicles and a vault toilet is at the trailhead. A wooden hikers' bridge crosses the Bald Hills Road and the slope of the ramps on the bridge allow for easy walking.",

This grove, like many others in Redwood National and State Parks, stands as a reminder of the extensive redwood forests that one blanketed the Pacific Coast from southern Oregon to Big Sur, California. Intense logging from 1850 through the present reduced these once endless forests to a fraction of their original expanse. Today, less than four percent of the old-growth redwood forests remain.<br /> <br /> Remnant old-growth forests persist. They persist because water, wind, fire, and light shepherd the forest through infinite centuries of birth, growth, death, and regeneration - without human interruption.<br /> <br /> Enter a place where time is measured in centuries and millennia. Here, majestic redwoods stand as regal as they did when our ancestors first gazed skyward into the dark canopy. The forest changes slowly here, yet it is forever reborn. We are only passing witnesses to the ongoing progression of life among these quiet giants.<br /> <br /> <em>Please remember that flowers and plants in Redwood National and State Parks are protected by law.

A discomfort to some perhaps, but the mild, wet climate of the North Coast ensures the survival of redwood forests. Wet winters soak the region under 60-70 inches of rain. Summer produces little rain, but temperatures rarely exceed 80 degrees. Summertime fog increases humidity and reduces the amount of water a tree loses through evaporation, softening the effects of drier periods. The small, tightly spaced redwood leaves intercept the moisture suspended in the fog. While some moisture absorbs directly into the leaves, the majority collects on the grooved surface of the leaf and drips to the ground. Water collected from fog may account for up to one-third of the total water in the redwood forest system. Water, the ever-present lifeblood of the redwoods, sustains life, both ancient and new.",
    "audioDescription": "A foggy day in the redwood forest is magical. Redwood trunks disappear into fog as you peer up into the canopy of the trees.

Its thick, insulating bark lacks the volatile resins found in pines, firs, and spruce, and its sap is largely water. This combination slows combustion, while the surrounding vegetation burns vigorously.<br /> <br /> Fire can burn repeatedly through cracks in the bark into the heartwood but leave the outside growing layers intact.

The outside bark is maroon and fresh, extending slightly over the charred edges to begin healing over the inside of the tree. As you look up, you can see the hollowed section extends above you before closing over 50 feet above your head.

In fact, what we call old-growth redwood forests may contain as few as eight or ten of the towering monarchs per acre. A diverse community of plants and animals thrive in the shadows of the redwood canopy. High above, Douglas-fir and western hemlock share the skyline with redwoods, their mossy branches home to flying squirrels and marbled murrelets, seabirds that only nest on large limbs of old-growth conifers. Tanoak and rhododendron fill in the middle space between the forest canopy and forest floor. Closer to the ground, the fleshy black berries of evergreen huckleberry and salal provide sustenance for bears and birds alike, and their shrubby forms shelter the ferns and redwood sorrel of the forest floor.<br /> <br /> The redwoods dominate and define this timeless forest community. They protect, shelter, and sustain the other residents of the forest through hundreds of years of harsh winter storms and long summer droughts.",

As you peer into the sky, you see the green needles and small trunks of young hemlock and Douglas-fir.

    "bodyText": "<b>Redwood Resurrection</b><br /> <br /> Commercial logging of redwoods reached into northern Humboldt and Del Norte Counties by the early 1870s. The logging industry dominated the economy of this region for three decades following World War II. The absence of tall trees in the distance stands as evidence of a clear-cut that extended from here to the highway. In the early 1960s, this hillside was denuded expect for the massive stumps of ancient trees.<br /> <br /> The look and feel of the forest changes in this transition zone between logged and unlogged forest. Unprotected trees endure high winds, salt-laden coastal air, and unmitigated summer heat. In these conditions, the tops of the tallest trees wither and die, while other trees collapse completely to the forest floor. Give time, the clear-cut will fill with ferns and shrubs. Eventually fir and hemlock seeds will ride the gentle breeze into the vacant clearings while redwood burls send up new sprouts from their ancestor’s stumps. Along this boundary, a recovering forest slowly regains its ancient forest character.",
    "audioDescription": "The canopy of the redwood forest is interrupted by a clear patch of sky in the distance. Under this blue sky, small and tightly packed trees growth in stark contrast with the redwood forest around you. This new forest is full of Douglas-fir and sitka spruce with little understory vegetation. This forest is often called a ‘dog-hair’ forest due to its tightly packed, small diameter trees. These trees are much smaller than the coast redwoods that tower before them and serve as a reminder of a previous clear-cut.",

The dense heartwood of a living tree resists most forms of insect damage and fungal growth, thus its value in commercial uses. The ability of a redwood to regenerate from burls ensures its longevity. More often than not, wind, fire, flood, or humans will topple a mature tree long before old age takes its toll.<br /> <br /> Leaning precariously against the branches of a neighbor, redwood snags like these play an important roll in the forest, even after their life ends. They provide perches for raptors, cavities for nesting woodpeckers and owls, and food for a multitude of forest insects.<br /> <br /> Shifting winds or eroding pedestals eventually dislodge the leaning snags and drop them unceremoniously to the ground. Insects, amphibians, and small mammals travel through the rotting wood in search of proliferating young plants. A redwood continues to nurture the forest below long after it falls.",
    "audioDescription": "Ferns dominate the forest floor, blanketing the ground in green. Redwoods rise from the ferns like ancient columns. As you pan from the ground to the canopy, you notice a large tree learning on another, the top of the standing tree supporting the fallen tree like a long-time friend. Both trees are scarred from a previous fire but remain alive, their green needles a testament to their resilient.",

    "bodyText": "A 19th Century Ranch That Tells of Mixed Cultures and World Class Endeavors.<br /> <br /> After the two-mile hike down from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/lyonsranchtrail.htm\">Lyons Ranch Trailhead</a>, the sight of a large redwood barn, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/learn/historyculture/historicalorchards.htm\">historical orchards</a>, and assorted farming outbuildings set on a sweeping prairie always comes a surprise. The protected nature of the landscape, the lack of modern conveniences, and the quality of the remaining structures makes it feel like you just stepped back more than 100 years.<br /> <br /> The 5,660 acre district was officially added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.<br /> <br /> <strong>What Is Here?</strong><br /> <br /> This historical site is an example of a farming operation created and managed by a mix of cultures: Native American and immigrant Anglo-Europe. Some of the features that makes this historic ranch special today are the large redwood planks used in the building of the barn. The fabrication by the Lyons family of these planks utalized 19th century equipment combined with the construction techniques used for millennia by Yurok and Hupa people. This blending of cultures - both within the Lyons family - and across the ranch's lambing and shearing operations made this a successful operation.<br /> <br /> The District is nearly devoid of modern intrusions and a high degree of historic integrity from the Lyons ranching period - 1868 to 1959. Many small-scale features exist as remnants, including orchards, fencing, water troughs, ponds, etc. Buildings are vernacular, built by the Lyons and their staff. Buildings that remain include the Elk Camp Sheep Shed, Lane House and Garage, Dolason Sheep Shed, Home Place Barn, Bunkhouse, Dooleyville Line Cabin, Long Ridge Sheep Shed, and the Coyote Sheep Shed and Line Cabin. Barns and sheep sheds serve different functions, although might look the same on the exterior. Barns serve a variety of functions (sheep sheds house and feed sheep) and the Home Place Barn accommodated horses, cows, sheep and even rabbits. The line cabins are small shelters where shepherds stayed while sheep grazed in the prairie around them. There are also remains of an early “RV” trailer that was likely used by shepherds as they followed the flocks.<br /> <br /> The District is historically significant for its association with the history and development of northern Humboldt County as a sheep ranching region and as an example of a large-scale sheep ranch that was active from the late 19<sup>th</sup> through the mid-20th centuries.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Lyons Family</strong><br /> <br /> Jonathan Lyons was an Anglo immigrant, and his wife Amelia was Hupa. Jonathan came west from Iowa around 1850 and he settled in the Hoopa Valley about 1861. He married a Hupa woman whose Christian name was Amelia and who was referred to by three different surnames — Kleiser, Silver, and Mesket. (the Mesket name is that of a village in the Hoopa Valley and may have indicated her birthplace, in the mid-1840s, along the Trinity River, the ancestral home of the Hupa people.) Their first son, Anderson, was born there in December 1863.<br /> <br /> The Lyons family, a family with Native American and European American heritage, formed a place of social and economic interaction between cultures that included continued Native American practices, along with ranching activities. Many of the structures reflect the influence of those traditional practices of the family and staff from the surrounding Native American communities.<br /> <br /> During its historic period the Lyons ranches were sheep ranches that were owned or leased by three generations of the Lyons family: Jonathan and Amelia Lyons, and four of the sons — Sherman, Antonio, Anderson, and William — and their grandson, Gene.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Ranch Operations</strong><br /> <br /> Upto eight of the prairies in the Bald Hills were managed by the Lyons family. Collectively, these operations were at the forefront of innovations and change in California sheep ranching. They were one of the two largest ranching operations in northern Humboldt County. The Lyons’ ranches were also known not only for the volume, but for the quality of their wool. The Lyons family were one of the pioneers in breeding Merino sheep in the United States and brought Humboldt County renown when Jonathon and Amelia were awarded a gold medal from the 1901 Paris Exposition for their high-quality product.<br /> <br /> <strong>Lyons Legacy</strong><br /> <br /> John and Amelia’s grandson, Gene Lyons was a college educated sheep rancher and the first Native American to graduate from the California College of Agriculture at Davis (later known as the University of California at Davis). He maintained his connection to the University and supported its scientific contributions to ranching throughout his tenure on the Lyons ranches. The University brought students to his ranch each year and conducted various experiments on the Lyons’ ranch land. Gene’s contributions to animal husbandry continued even after his death in 1972 when his will established the Austin Eugene Lyons Memorial Trust at the University of California, Davis to provide stipends for graduate students.<br /> <br /> The family used traditional methods of prescribed / cultural burning to keep the prairies open. This method of land management continued until the 1930s until it was outlawed by the federal government. It would be another fifty years before <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/learn/management/rxfire.htm\">prescribed fire</a> was returned to the Bald Hills by the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> <strong>Safety Tips</strong> <ul> <li>We recommend you purchase and use a good map and trail guide for your adventures in Redwood National and State Parks. Don’t rely on online maps when you are here.</li> <li>To protect the habitats, leave no trace also means staying on the developed trail. Please don’t go off-trail and make any new trails.

In summer, it will be hot and exposed here compared to all the other places in Redwood National and State Parks.  In winter, snow can cover this part of the Bald Hills Road and the trail will be difficult to hike on.<br /> <br /> No water or facilities are provided at the trailhead. The wide open spaces along this trail are completely different to any of the other views in the parks.<br /> <br /> At this site, views across the prairies covered with spring flowers, and views into the night sky are spectacular. Black bears, Roosevelt elk, and snakes have be seen in this area.<br /> <br /> The trail descends 400-feet as it follows dirt roads down the hill, through occasional groves of oaks to Lyons Ranch. This was a 19th and 20th century sheep farming operation which is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/learn/management/rxfire.htm\">Prescribed fire operations</a> occur in the Bald Hills in the autumn and these keep the prairies open.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Safety Tips</span></span></span> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">We recommend you purchase and use a good map and trail guide for your adventures in Redwood National and State Parks.

    "audioDescription": "Located on a knoll, the gravel parking area is surrounded by open prairies, grasses, and occasional Douglas-fir trees. A gate and trail head is to the south, and a trail leads down the hill to the south. Looking to the south across hill, is a valley formed by Redwood Creek. On the north-facing hills on southern side of the valley, are different kinds of forests. Straight-lines show where different forests meet. Dark-green patches of forest are 300-foot tall redwoods, and light-green forests are much shorter second-growth forests.",

The southern exit is <strong>exit #753</strong>. The northern exit is <strong>exit #765</strong><br /> <br /> You won't see many redwood trees unless you get off Highway 101 - so why not enjoy this ten mile drive? It parallels Highway 101 - so there is no need to backtrack or make any big changes to your driving plans. Additionally, this scenic drive is suitable for recreational vehicles and vehicles pulling trailers. This ability to take bigger vehicles (and also find parking) to see redwoods in these parks is rare - even more reason to take this drive.<br /> <br /> Set in the heart of Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, the ten miles of this parkway takes you past thousands of acres of old-growth redwood trees, and a wide range of walking and hiking opportunities. More than a dozen trails and pull-outs are located along the parkway. Near the southern end of the parkway the popular Big Tree Wayside.<br /> <br /> Since time immemorial, the forest and meadows now along the Parkway have been home to Yurok people. Along the length of the parkway there are interpretive wayside panels, audio boxes, and information kiosks that explain the human connection and Yurok history of the area. <br /> <br /> At the southern end of the parkway is a very large meadow that often has elk and other wildlife. Summer parking along this half-mile section of the parkway can be crowded.  On the western side of  the meadow is the Elk Prairie campground and the Prairie Creek Visitor Center is on the northern edge of the meadow.<br /> <br /> The parkway is named after a 20th century redwood conservation advocate and leader: Newton B. Drury (b.1889 d.1978). Mr Drury's work in leading different agencies and organizations led to the protection of 135,000 acres of redwood forests - that is more than half of what remains today. He is the only person who in their career held the title of Executive Director of Save the Redwoods League (1919-1939) and the Director of the National Park Service (1940-1951). Newton Drury also was instrumental in the centralization of California State Parks in the 1920s, and he held the role of Director of California Parks and Beaches (1951-1959), and he returned to the Save the Redwoods League as Executive Director in 1959. <br />  <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "This is a paved two-lane parkway that descends hundreds of feet over ten miles from the north to the south. Hikers, and bicycles share this parkway with vehicle traffic. The road is surrounded by thousands of acres of old-growth redwood forests, and more than a dozen trail-heads and parking pullouts are located on both sides of the parkway. Only the \"Big Tree\" wayside and the Prairie Creek-Foothills loop is wheel chair accessible. All these trails and pullouts are signposted. The parkway is not really wide enough for recreational vehicles / motor homes to safely make U-turns, but regular vehicles will be able to make these turns.",

    "audioDescription": "A flat four foot wide trail made of aggregate and bark. It is about 1/4 mile long and meanders through a classic example of old-growth redwood trees. These redwoods are about 8 to 10 per acre and have base diameters of twenty feet. The rough, furrowed bark of these trees can be gray, brown, red, or a mixture of those colors. The redwood trunks are tall and straight, often getting lost in the branches at about 100 feet above the trail. The forest floor is surprisingly open, but it has ferns, oaks, maples, and fir trees. Many of the redwoods have fire scars on their trunks, some extend from the ground up to the branches far above.",

This majestic 44-acre grove of old-growth redwoods is a popular summer destination for those willing to take on the challenge of getting there.<br /> <br /> In 1929, Clara W. Stout, widow of lumberman Frank D. Stout, donated this tract of old-growth redwood forest to Save the Redwoods League. She did this in memory of her late husband. Stout Grove then became the first dedicated grove in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park.<br /> <br /> The trail is a short 0.5 mile (0.8 km) in length and the grove is on the edge of the beautiful Smith River. A short spur trail decends down twenty feet to the confluence of Mill Creek and the Smith River. In summer many people picnic, paddle, and swim at this cobbled beach. In summer this is also where the hikers' bridge crosses the Smith River.<br /> <br /> Getting to and from this grove takes some time and effort and that is why we recommend allowing two hours for your visit.<br /> <br /> Option1. Year round. Smaller vehicles like cars and vans can access the trailhead and parking lot by driving the eastern section of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/drivehowlandhillrd.htm\">Howland Hill Road</a>. Howland Hill Road is winding, narrow, mostly unpaved, and is not suitable for large vehicles. <strong>There is no parking for RVs and trailers at the trailhead.</strong><br /> <br /> Option 2. In summer, you can park any vehicle at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/planyourvisit/developedcampgrounds.htm\">Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park Campground</a> Day Use Area ($8 fee required). Follow the footpath 0.8 miles (1.2 km) to access the campground from the Day Use Area. From the campground walk towards the Smith River and along the riverbank you will find a walking trail heading upstream. This trail is about half a mile and then crosses the summer hikers' bridge to Stout Memorial Grove.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Safety Tips</span></span></span> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">We recommend you purchase and use a good map and trail guide for your adventures in Redwood National and State Parks.

    "bodyText": "<h2>The Brine Vat</h2> <p>Investigate this fallen, hollow redwood. Do you notice anything strange? The historical abundance of salmon and steelhead trout in Redwood Creek gave one man the idea to turn this fallen redwood into a brine vat for salting fish. In the 1920s, during the Great Depression, this log was hollowed out and lined with cement by Bert Robinson. Every autumn Bert would row eight miles up the creek from the town of Orick equipped with supplies and plenty of salt. He spent the fall and early winter at the grove living in a lean-to or a treehouse modified from a goose-pen. Here he would catch fish, soak them in brine, smoke them, and then, in the spring and summer, sell his bounty to tourists along the old Redwood Highway.</p> <p>Salmon were once so numerous; scientists now know they were a major source of nutrition for redwoods growing along alluvial flood plain deposits like the one in this grove. After spawning, the fish would die, wash up on shore and decompose. The shallow roots of these trees would absorb these nutrients. Would you believe the nitrogen from salmon DNA has been found inside the wood high up in a redwood canopy?</p> <p>The last century has not been kind to our salmon species. Overfishing, climate change, and human alterations to their native habitat have decimated their populations. Here along Redwood Creek, clear-cut logging on the slopes above created erosion that choked salmon breeding pools with silt before the park was established. Will the next century showcase their success or their demise?</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This text refers to a redwood log that was split along its length and used as a brine vat in preparation for smoking fish. Only a small piece of cement remains in its hollow to represent the historical use of this log. Second-growth logged areas along the creek near the grove are referenced in the discussion of declining salmonid species.",

    "bodyText": "<h2>Floods</h2> <p>The habitat you are exploring here along the creek lies upon a sedimentary mix called alluvium. Composed of sand, silt and clay, this well-aerated mix of soils, combined with high moisture levels and low wind exposure, makes this area an ideal environment for redwood growth. At different times of the year, you may see small mounds of alluvium churned and kicked up by burrowing voles and moles.</p> <p>Drastic upheavals of sediment, however, can occur during periodic floods. If you were standing here on December 23, 1964, your head would have been underwater! Many of the surrounding redwoods’ shallow roots were made deeper by the accumulated deposits. Subsequent flooding also eroded some of these soils. How many now exposed redwood trunks can you count that still have gray silt embedded in their bark?</p> <p>Erosion from flooding can also undercut roots and topple these towering trees. Most of the fallen redwoods here will become nursery logs or head downstream, breaking up along the creek to create deep, cool pools for salmon and trout. However, once in a great while a fallen giant will survive. Looking over your left shoulder, you will see a fallen redwood that had the fortune of being half buried in sediment after it fell. A part of its root system remained intact, and now it has multiple, cloned upright trunks growing along its length. This is just another example of how redwoods endure the effects of an ever-changing landscape through time.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Movement of soil and substrate are discussed: from the small mounds of dirt freshly excavated by rodents to the large volumes of alluvium deposited and/or removed by floods. The gray coloring of embedded silt can be witnessed on trunks up to three feet from the ground. The fate of fallen trees is referenced with examples of creek-embedded logs that help deepen pools for salmon and living logs that clone linearly rather than in a circle.",

High above in the redwood canopy, beyond the focus of the naked eye, are multiple layers of life. Marbled murrelets, flying squirrels, tree voles, and wandering salamanders have all adapted to life in the redwood canopy.  A plethora of plant species can grow in the soil mats found in the \"elbows” of treetop limbs.  Western hemlock and bay laurel trees have been found growing over 100 of feet in the forest canopy!</p> <p>Did you know some species of lichen and mosses only grow at different altitudes along the length of a redwood? Lettuce lung lichen, a nitrogen-fixer, acts as an important fertilizer for the redwood forest. Every winter, powerful winds tear it from the canopy, and send it falling to the ground below. This frilled, leafy, silvery-green lichen only grows up high in the tallest of trees! Imagine how many hundreds of years it will take for a second-growth forest to provide a habitat for this uniquely adapted species to live.</p> <p>The biodiversity you cannot see flourishes not only above you, but below you as well. Countless species of fungi, bacteria, and macro-invertebrates inhabit the soil here: consuming, decomposing, recycling the richness of the forest. Fungi spread through soil via mycelium, vast networks of spongy, filament-like threads through which the fungus feeds. The banana slugs that slowly munch on the mushrooms of some of these fungi live their lives at a completely different pace. There’s certainly no rush, not when you are on redwood time.</p>",

How many other different textures and shades of green do you see in this forest?<br /> <br /> How does this forest differ from the one in the parking lot? You’ll notice the trees are bigger, older. There is more light, more space to grow. How long did it take for this forest to look like this? How many more centuries will pass before the second-growth forest near the parking lot will take a similar shape?<br /> <br /> As you slowly make your way to the next stop, you may witness a variety of mushrooms, orchids or other odd-looking plants. Gnome plants, pinesap, and coralroot orchids are plants which cannot produce their own food; instead, these plants steal sugars from fungi, which in turn take sugars from the roots of Douglas firs! Through this network, the fir trees gain more access to nutrient-rich water! Most of these unique species are seasonal, treasured for only a moment in time.<br /> <br /> Do you see evidence of something that might change this mosaic of life?</p>",

As you may have witnessed on your way down to this stop, fires aren’t the only major disturbance in this changing landscape. Severe winter storms in 2023 brought heavy snow and rain, placing extra weight on tree canopies; combined with high winds, hundreds of trees came crashing down. Geological uplift and erosion can alter the terrain as well, sometimes at a rate of just a few millimeters per decade or a hillside all at once! Before you arrive at your next stop you will encounter a majestic vista into the forest below. This grand opening in the canopy was created by multiple events of falling trees. What do you notice about the sizes and ages of the trees growing in such clearings?</p>",

Here time is measured by the seasonal growth of a forest giant. It’s old! What was happening in human history when this tree was just a sprout?<br /> <br /> The different trees around you have different record lifespans: red alder <100 years; tanoak <400; Douglas fir <1,000; coast redwoods can live up to 2,530 years! When a forest is cleared by fire or treefall, different species of trees may dominate the landscape at different times. Alders are often called the Band-Aid of the forest, as they are the first to quickly fill a void. Tanoaks and Douglas firs eventually surpass the heights of alders, replacing them as they die from old age or lack of sun. Eventually redwoods will outgrow all the other trees and become the dominant tree or “climax species.” This succession of trees can take centuries!<br /> <br /> The giant logs you see around you might remain a part of the natural scenery for years to come. The tannic acid stored in redwoods make the wood rot resistant by warding off the effects of insects, fungi, and bacteria. Our largest redwood logs can take up to 800 years to completely decompose! Compare that to the rate of decay of a leaf or an animal… Wheels within wheels in the perception of time... Your next stop is a bit further down the trail. As you marvel at the variable green tapestry above you, don’t forget to watch the ground at your feet. Look out for salamanders, boreal toads, banana slugs and Pacific side-band snails crossing the trails. Consider the ground itself, for the geology of this area is an important factor in its make-up.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h2>The Life and Death of a Redwood</h2> The massive log that fell here was once a tree that likely sprouted from a seed. Over its lifetime, after weathering various disturbances, it responded by cloning new trunks from the basal burl tissue found around the base of its trunk. Observe the two groups of redwood clones separated by the gaping hole left behind by this fallen giant. Cloned redwoods experience less competition than seedlings since they already have a well-established root system.<br /> <br /> The ecological value of a redwood tree does not diminish once it has fallen. Logs play an important role in carbon storage, water storage, and nutrient recycling. Did you know old-growth coast redwood forests store more carbon than any other forest on Earth? Not to mention, as this log eventually decays, it will one day become a juicy nursery log, home to many other plants and organisms.<br /> <br /> Before you arrive at the redwood named “Tall Tree,” you will observe a huge redwood that has fallen. Notice the domino effect these trees can have when they come crashing down. This tree stood for centuries, but it probably only took a few minutes for the last branches to settle as gravity brought its life to the ground. From destruction comes rebirth. There is now a new window of light above, space for new trees to grow, another revolution in the cycle of life, another notch in the wheels of time.<br /> <br /> <br /> Please note: hike the loop trail clockwise to continue the tour in the correct order.",

    "bodyText": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Klamath River Radar Station B-71, located near Klamath, California, is a rare, surviving World War II early-warning radar station. Modern radar was a very new technology in the 1940s and radar stations like B-71 were one of the </span>first steps towards today's more sophisticated early warning radar defense network.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why build radar stations?</strong><br /> As a result of the attacks on <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/valr/index.htm\">Pearl Harbor</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/aleu/index.htm\">Aleutian Islands</a><span>, the need to guard the American coastline on the Pacific Ocean became more important. This was made urgent when Japanese submarines shelled an oil refinery north of Santa Barbara, California, on February 23, 1942; Esteven Point in British Columbia, Canada, on June 20, 1942; and again at Fort Stevens, Washington, on July 21, 1942. On September 9, 1942, a Japanese submarine-launched aircraft dropped incendiary bombs on Oregon forests roughly 40 miles north of the Klamath River. <br /> <br /> To protect the Pacific Coast from further attacks, a</span> network of 72 radar stations was proposed as part of a radar air defense network. Although only 65 stations were actually built, the network stretched from the US/Canada border into Mexico.<br /> <br /> <strong>About the Station</strong><br /> <span>As part of the coastal </span>radar air defense network<span>, a station was built approximately two miles south of the mouth of the Klamath River in what is now </span><a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Redwood National and State Parks</a><span>. The radar station was designated Station B-71, (named \"Trinidad\") by a memorandum from the Office of the Commanding General, IV Fighter Command dated November 6, 1942. It was also referred to as the \"Klamath River\" station and was the northernmost coastal radar station in California. <br /> <br /> The radar station was manned by members of the US Army Air Corps quartered in barracks near the town of Klamath. It was commanded during part of 1943 by 2nd Lieutenant Neff, later replaced by one or more 1st lieutenants in succession. The station was manned around the clock. A single day's</span> operation of the station required a crew of about 35 men to work the 24 hours in shifts.<span> It was also guarded by military police with dogs and had three anti-aircraft guns.</span><br /> <br /> The buildings that made up the station were fairly unique in that their camouflage was \"built-in\". Most camouflage of structures disguised already existing buildings, but the buildings at Radar Station B-71 were new. This meant that they could be built with camouflaging as part of their new construction. The buildings were built to be disguised as a farm.<br /> <br /> <span>The station consisted of three buildings: a Power Building disguised as a farmhouse, an Operations Building disguised as a barn, a functional wood frame two-stall Privy or outhouse, and three anti-aircraft guns.</span><br /> <br /> <u>Power Building</u><br /> <span>As its name implies, the Power Building housed the power generators needed to run the radar equipment. Located south of the Operations Building, it was camouflaged to look like a farmhouse. The actual building was a rectangular structure made of concrete blocks. In order to disguise the concrete walls they were covered with false exterior wooden walls. The false walls were made of vertical board and batten siding on a wood frame and were secured to the concrete blocks. A number of fake windows were built Into the false walls but they did not penetrate the concrete walls. The building also had a large wood-shingled gable roof with </span>two false dormer windows. The dormers sat on top of the roof but didn't open into the roof space. The roof style, dormers, and wooden walls and windows all disguised the concrete building and added to the impression that it was really a farmhouse. <br /> <br /> <u>Operations Building</u><br /> <span>The Operations Building </span>housed the oscilloscope and operating personnel and <span>was disguised to look like a barn. A false barn door at the north end sat under a roof gable. An extension of the roof simulated the track for a traveling pulley hoist which, in a real barn, would have been used for moving bales of hay. The exterior concrete block walls were disguised with false wood siding whose outer edge was five or six inches beyond the outer face of the concrete walls. The interior of the operations building was divided into about seven rooms. The rooms all had acoustic tile ceilings and at least one room also had acoustic wall tiles.<br /> <br /> During the first half of 1943 a mobile SCR-270B radar antenna was installed uncamouflaged about 30 feet west of the operations building. It consisted of a rectangular metal grid mounted vertically on a pole of triangular metal framework. The whole assembly was carried on a wheeled trailer to make it mobile. At a later date more permanent antenna were installed.<br /> <br /> <u>P</u></span><u>rivy <span>(outhouse)</span></u><br /> <span>The two-stall privy was a </span>wood frame structure <span>located 95 feet north of the operations building. It has largely eroded away.</span><br /> <br /> <u>Anti-Aircraft Guns</u><br /> <span>Southwest of the power building is the remains of a circular pit about twelve feet in diameter which may have been the location of one of the three M2 (Browning) .50 caliber machine guns. The guns were on anti-aircraft mounts and protected the station. Northwest of the operations building is the remains of a similar circular pit which is believed to be the site of a second .50 caliber machine gun. The location of the third gun mount site is unknown.<br /> <br /> <strong>End of Service</strong></span><br /> As the threat of Japanese attack waned towards the end of World War II, the coastal early radar stations began to be phased out of service. While the need for early-warning radar decreased, the need for air-sea rescue radar increased, Effective July 1, 1944, Radar Station B-71 was converted to emergency rescue service, with the SCR-271 radar being replaced with RC-150 IFF equipment. The station was thus one of only 22 radar stations on the entire Pacific Coast to remained in operation until the end of World War II<br /> <br /> <span><strong>Preserving the Station</strong></span><br /> After the war, Radar Station B-71 was abandoned and it reverted to private ownership until the National Park Service acquired it with the creation of what was then known as Redwood National Park. The topography of the site has created conservation challenges with runoff and erosion causing mud to be deposited against the structure. The constant moisture has also damaged the remaining siding in some areas. The buildings are still standing, but are weathered. The first known photographs of the site date to the 1970s. Unfortunately, no photos of the site are known to exist from World War II.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Despite standing empty since the end of the war, Klamath River Radar Station B-71 remains one of the few World War radar stations still in existence in the US. The station is listed on the National Park Service's </span><a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">National Register of Historic Places</a><span> (NRHP No. </span><a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">78000282</a><span>) and was document by the </span><a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Historic American Engineering Record</a><span> (</span><a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">HAER-CA 332</a><span>). <br /> <br /> <strong>Visiting the Site</strong><br /> The Klamath River Radar Station B-71 site and buildings are part of Redwood National and State Parks. Anyone may visit the site either in a vehicle or by hiking to its trailhead. The site is reached from the pull off at the </span>WWII Radar Farmhouse Trailhead by <span>walking along the short </span>WWII Radar Farmhouse Trail<span>.<br /> <br /> <u>Vehicles</u><br /> Access to the trailhead is off the Coastal Drive. The Coastal Drive is a narrow, unpaved, gravel road. The road is <strong><u>not recommended</u> for recreational vehicles or busses</strong>. <strong>Motor homes or vehicles towing a trailer <u>are not allowed </u>on this road. </strong>Visitors arriving by vehicle may pull off at the </span>WWII Radar Farmhouse Trail<span>head.<br /> <br /> <u>Hiking</u><br /> Visitors hiking the </span><a href=\"javascript:HandleLink(\">Flint Ridge Trail</a><span> or camping at the </span>Flint Ridge Camp may visit Radar Station B-71 by walking approximately .5 miles south from the camp (west trailhead) along the Coastal Drive (Trail) to the WWII Radar Farmhouse Trailhead.</p> <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The gravel parking area is set next to the trail. The rough trail descends about fifty feet over the course of a few hundred yards. Long grasses might cover the trail if is has not been mowed. Two wooden buildings that look like a barn and a farmhouse are near a slope. To the west of the buildings are alder trees that are blocking the view towards the ocean.",

Within a quarter of a mile the land ends and craggy rocks, and coastal bluffs are seen. In the distance are tall sea stacks sticking hundreds of feet out of the ocean. These ragged rocks are covered with white guano from millions of circling and roosting shore birds. The trail then turns inland and passes through dense, scrubby forests.",

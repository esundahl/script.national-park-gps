    "bodyText": "<p>In anticipation of U.S. General Zachary Taylor’s return to Fort Texas, Mexican General Mariano Arista positioned his 3,500 troops here on this spot. The Mexican battle line was almost a mile long and ran east to west on the south end of Palo Alto Battlefield. Arista's rested his left flank right on the road. The object was to stop Taylor’s force from relieving the siege of the U.S. Army’s fort on the banks of the Rio Grande.<br /> <br /> The general’s plan was to let Taylor’s army advance down the road or across the field and then envelop him by closing in with his dreaded Lancers.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately for General Arista, things did not go as planned. Taylor never did charge down the road. Instead he pulled his artillery forward and the battle of Palo Alto turned into an artillery duel. It was a duel that put the Mexican Army at a disadvantage.<br /> <br /> On the afternoon of May 8, 1846, this end of the field took heavy fire from Taylor’s artillery. The U.S. guns bombarded the Mexican battle line with explosive shells from 18-pounder siege cannon and solid shot from 6-pounder field guns, tearing open holes all along the line. Arista army suffered 102 killed, 129 wounded, and 26 missing.</p>",

The open prairie and sea of chest-high cord grass, that U.S. and Mexican soldiers wallowed through, is now gone.<br /> <br /> The cord grass is much shorter now and the prairie is broken up by stands of mesquite trees and prickly pear cactus.  These battlefield invaders were aided in their assault by activities such as cattle ranching and development of the surrounding area.<br /> <br /> From here one can appreciate the size of the battlefield. Both battle lines are clearly visible from here as they are only about 700 yards apart. The range limits the artillery forced the lines to be this close. Despite its size, the small field this Overlook watches over would kick off a conflict that led to Mexico losing half of its national territory and the U.S. doubling in size.</p>",

News of the skirmish reached Fort Texas later that day. General Taylor forwarded word to President Polk that hostilities had commenced.In the time since the skirmish at Carricitos, the exact location of the ranch has been forgotten. Soldiers had measured the distance to the site along the winding path of the Rio Grande. The shifting course of the river has made these measurements unreliable.Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park has continued to conduct research that may, in time, pinpoint the exact location of the Rancho de Carricitos skirmish.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Kenedy County Rest Area is home to a U.S.-Mexican War historical marker. However, the marker you’ll find there is proof that you shouldn’t believe everything that you read. Zachary Taylor never camped under the tree that now stands at this rest area. The U.S. army did pass this way en route to the Rio Grande in March of 1846. But the marker has not always been at this spot.<br /> <br /> This is a Centennial Marker—one of many placed by the State of Texas in 1936 on the 100th anniversary of Texas independence. In 1978, officials of the Texas Department of Transportation received a request to move the marker several hundred yards to this rest area.<br /> <br /> The marker was relocated and plaque explaining the monument had been repositioned was supposed to be added. The monument was transferred, but the new plaque never was attached.</p>",

Taylor halted his advance at this spot and contemplated his next move.<br /> <br /> Taylor had told his men before they left Point Isabel it would be the bayonet that would settle any encounter with the Mexican army. However, carrying out a frontal attack against a numerically superior enemy already in battle formation would be foolish. It would also put his long supply wagon train in jeopardy.<br /> Instead of continuing down the road, and possibly taking heavy casualties, General Taylor deployed his troops into battle formation.<br /> <br /> Taylor set his right flank on the Matamoros to Point Isabel Road, near this spot. It consisted of the US 5th Infantry, Major Ringgold’s field artillery, Lt. Churchill’s 18-pounder siege cannons, and the 3rd and 4th Infantry. He kept Captain May’s dragoons in reserve.<br /> <br /> The left flank, to the east of this spot, consisted of Lt. Col. Child’s “Foot Artillery”, Captain Duncan’s field artillery, and the 8th Infantry. Captain Ker’s dragoons pulled double duty guarding the wagon train and supporting the left flank.<br /> <br /> The ensuing battle became a showcase for one of the U.S. Army’s latest weapons...the flying artillery. The light, mobile field guns made up for Taylor’s numerical disadvantage as his guns wreaked havoc on the soldados across the field. The infantries of both armies had very little involvement in the fight.</p>",

The trail is lined with interpretive waysides and features a replica, U S 18-pounder siege cannon.

    "bodyText": "<p>Only one tree on the park grounds of Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site today has been confirmed to have stood when Ulysses S. Grant lived on this property. It is a Black Oak tree that was planted around the year 1829.<br /> <br /> Black Oak trees are strong trees that thrive on moist soils like the kind seen throughout the St. Louis area. They often live for more than 200 years and develop a dark, thick bark on their exterior. Black Oaks are often used industrially to manufacture furniture and flooring because they are resistant to insect infestation.<br /> <br /> During the years before the American Civil War, roughly 600 of White Haven’s 850 acres were densely wooded forests that were not actively cultivated for farming. Julia Dent Grant recalled that some of the enslaved workers at White Haven would have roamed the woods on the way to their living quarters on the northern part of the property. Moreover, the enslaved would have used the woods as a space to catch a few moments of privacy away from the glare of White Haven’s white residents. Speaking of one enslaved man, “Old Bob,” Julia recalled that he “would ‘get religion,’ as his companions said. He would go away down in the meadow by the big walnut trees nearly half a mile off and pray and sing so we could hear him distinctly on our piazza. He would give out the hymn, two lines at a time, and then sing it all by himself . . .”<br /> <br /> The scientific name for Black Oak trees is <i>Quercus velutina</i> Lam.</p>",

Further studies were conducted and in 1948 a group of arborists found several thousand Dawn Redwoods near the same area. Family lore suggests that the Wenzlick family, the last to privately own Ulysses S.

Perhaps the most notable is James Milton Turner, an educator who helped found Lincoln University, Missouri's only Historically Black College or University. During Ulysses S. Grant's presidency Turner was appointed to serve as the country's Minister to Liberia, representing American interests and promoting education and economic growth in that country. Other notable figures resting at Father Dickson Cemetery include Moses Dickson (the cemetery's namesake), a member of the Underground Railroad and community leader during the Civil War era, and Susan Paul Smith Vashon, an educator and the namesake of Vashon High School in St. Louis. Father Dickson Cemetery is two miles north of Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site and is managed by the Friends of Father Dickson Cemetery. <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/african-american-history-at-father-dickson-cemetery.htm\">Learn more about Father Dickson Cemetery</a>.</p> <h2>Directions to Father Dickson Cemetery from Visitor Center</h2> <p><br /> 1.

The little house looked so unattractive that we facetiously decided to call it Hardscrabble.\"<br /> - Julia Dent Grant</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> When Ulysses S. Grant resigned from the military in 1854, he longed to spend time with his wife Julia and their young children. His plans shifted to supporting his family by farming at the White Haven property. Grant cultivated 80 acres given to the couple as a wedding gift and managed the rest of the land owned by his father-in-law, Colonel Frederick Dent. With the help of the Dents’ enslaved laborers, Grant planted crops of potatoes and wheat, corded wood, harvested fruit from the orchards, and tended a vegetable garden. He was so dedicated to this future that he commented to a friend, “whoever hears of me in ten years will hear of a well-to-do old Missouri farmer.”</p> <p>Establishing himself as a successful, independent farmer included the construction of his own house. Grant selected an elevated location close to his crops and about 100 feet from the road (the site of present-day St. Paul’s Cemetery). He began cutting, hewing, and notching logs for the cabin in the fall of 1855. Accustomed to the relative finery of her upbringing at White Haven, Julia lamented Ulysses’ decision to build a log cabin, not even “a neat frame house.” The next spring and summer, he set about digging a cellar and setting the stones for the foundation. Neighbors and enslaved laborers then assisted in the house raising. Grant completed much of the work himself, shingling the roof, building the stairs, and laying the floors.</p> <p>The cabin was divided into four rooms, two upstairs and two downstairs, with a hall running between them on both floors. Julia did her best to decorate the place, but even her standards of refinement could not conceal its rustic nature. Julia recalled that it was “so crude and homely I did not like it at all, but I did not say so. I got out all my pretty covers, baskets, books, etc., and tried to make it look home-like and comfortable, but this was hard to do. The little house looked so unattractive that we facetiously decided to call it Hardscrabble.”</p> <p>Even though Hardscrabble was the first house that the Grants ever owned, they lived there for only a short time. Julia remembered moving in during September 1856 and living there only three months. At the request of Colonel Dent, Julia and Ulysses returned to White Haven when her mother died in January 1857. The little cabin never again served as the Grants’ domicile.</p> <p>After the Grants vacated Hardscrabble the building acquired a history of its own. Due to its association with the famous General and President, it was dismantled and moved three times. In 1907 it was finally located on the property of present day \"Grant’s Farm,\" which is owned and operated by Anheuser-Busch and adjacent to Ulysses S. Grant NHS.</p>",

The ice house dates back to roughly 1840 while the chicken house was most likely constructed circa 1850 to 1870. Ice from local water streams was stored in the north room (facing the walking trace today) with sawdust packed on top for preservation. It is believed the south room housed perishable foods and drinks for refrigeration. The ice house was intentionally built into a soft, sloping hill just south of Little Prairie Creek so that the ice could be stored underground.

I never had the least trouble,” and that she usually raised fourteen to eighteen baby chicks at a time.

Grant to William Elrod, September 4, 1871</p> </blockquote> <br /> When Ulysses S. Grant acquired ownership of White Haven after the Civil War, he set about turning the property into a profitable horse-breeding farm. Grant helped design this horse stable while serving as President and ordered his caretaker William Elrod to begin constructing it. When the structure was completed in 1871, it was large enough to house as many as twenty-five horses in livestock stalls. The stable was originally located near a cul-de-sac on the western end of present-day Fernald Road. Elrod cared for the numerous horses at this stable, all of which were either purchased by the president or gifted to him. Grant primarily owned Thoroughbred and Morgan horses, although he enjoyed raising other breeds as well. In 1873 President Grant made a trip with his family along the Kirkwood and Carondelet Railroad (Grant’s Trail today) to visit his horses and inspect the White Haven property.<br /> <br /> Later owners of White Haven moved the horse stable in 1962. An apartment was added for an on-site caretaker, and after the National Park Service acquired ownership of the property the structure was converted into a temporary visitor center and office space in 1994. The horse stable was moved to its current location in 2007 to make room for a parking lot at its previous space. Today the structure houses the park’s museum.<br /> <br />  ",

The structure is what architects call a “double-pen,” a British design that features two side-by-side rooms with gable end chimneys. Early Drawings of White Haven suggest that this structure existed as early as 1840. Enslaved laborers worked in this structure cooking food and cleaning laundry when the Dent family owned the property before the Civil War. There is also evidence suggesting that some of the enslaved cooks may have lived in the attic of this structure.</p> <p>The stone building fell into disrepair in the early twentieth century. In the 1950s the structure was turned into a three-car garage by the owner of White Haven at that time, Delbert Wenzlick. After the National Park Service acquired ownership of White Haven in 1990, work was done to demolish the garage and renovate the building to its nineteenth century appearance. A large number of broken dishes, crockery, silverware, and other historical artifacts from the nineteenth century were discovered during several archaeological digs around this area, further demonstrating the ways enslaved laborers used this space to perform their duties at White Haven.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>“What are these weird looking, spiky balls all over the ground?” – Many Visitors to the Park<br /> <br /> The most asked about trees at Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site are the many Sweetgum trees scattered throughout the park grounds. The unique, spiky balls seen on the park grounds have a green color while growing on the tree’s branches. Once the “Sweetgum Balls” reach maturation, they turn brown and fall to the ground. Native to the Southeastern United States, Sweetgum trees are fast-growing, hardy trees that thrive in warm climates and wet soils often seen in river bottom areas like St. Louis. The leaves on these trees often have a glossy finish, while the wood is often used for lumber, plywood, veneer, and other industrial uses.<br /> <br /> The Sweetgum trees seen on the property today date to the mid-twentieth century and would not have been here during the Grant family’s time at White Haven. However, Julia Dent Grant recalled in her <i>Personal Memoirs</i> that locust trees would have stood around the immediate circumference of the White Haven estate at the time. While standing “on the south end of the front piazza at our old home, White Haven . . .  the very trees were welcoming me, and, sure enough, the tall locust trees were tossing their white-plumed branches gleefully,” she recalled.  <br /> <br /> The scientific name for Sweetgum trees is <i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i> L.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "A large tree roughly 5 feet off of the walking trace on the back side of the White Haven estate. The tree frequently drops spiky balls with seeds onto the ground, and most of the year these sweetgum balls can be felt on the grass surrounding the tree. There are numerous sweetgum trees throughout the park grounds.",

Dear papa, coming out with seeming great pleasure, caught me up and held me high in the air, telling me to look, the very trees were welcoming me . . .  I watched too the white clouds flying across the blue sky. All this I distinctly remember.\" - Julia Dent Grant</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The White Haven estate was built between 1812 and 1816 and was the childhood home of Julia Dent Grant. Julia recalled fond memories of family bonding at White Haven. She later boasted that \"our home was then really the showplace of the county, having very fine orchards of peaches, apples, apricots, nectarines, plums, cherries, grapes, and all of the then rare small fruits.\" Meanwhile, upon graduating from the U.S. Military academy at West Point in 1843, a young officer named Ulysses S. Grant was stationed with the U.S. Army at Jefferson Barracks, a military post five miles south of White Haven. Ulysses met Julia at White Haven and they fell in love, later marrying in 1848. After serving for eleven years in the U.S. Army, Grant resigned his commission and decided to try his hand at farming at White Haven. From 1854 to 1859, the Grant and Dent families, along with enslaved African American laborers, lived and worked at White Haven. <br /> <br /> As Ulysses S. Grant rose to prominence as the victorious general of the American Civil War and the country's 18th president, his connections to White Haven continued. Grant purchased the property after the Civil War and hired a caretaker to live at the main house and manage the farm. During his presidency, Grant invested money to make the farm a horse breeding operation. He also helped design a large stable for his horses that was completed in 1871. The Grants considered retiring to White Haven at some point in time, and President Grant recalled in a speech that St. Louis was one of the only places he had ever felt a connection to. Plans changed, however, and the Grants eventually retired to New York City after the completion of their world tour in 1879. Ulysses and Julia nevertheless continued to visit White Haven on a periodic basis after the Civil War. Their last visit to the home together was in 1883, and they owned the property until a few months before Ulysses died in July 1885. </p>",

The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a kit fox, with its red-brown fur and large, white-lined ears. It stands near a bush on top of a sand pedestal holding a dead rodent in its mouth. A black hole gapes in the side of the pedestal below the fox. Text at the top reads, “Look at me on top of my pedestal! I like it up there because I can see all around. I prefer to stay in my pedestal during the fierce heat of the day. A den dug deep stays nice and cool in the summer. Only after sundown do I come out and look for food. My large ears help me find lizards, insects, kangaroo rats, and small birds. I must be quick to catch my food!”",

Her prey, the tarantula spider, is bigger, hairier, and more venomous. When this wasp finds a tarantula away from its lair, a death match begins. If she wins, she paralyzes the spider and lays one egg inside it. She drags it to her hideout and seals it underground. After hatching, the young wasp eats the spider from the inside out.”",

In the center is the silhouette of a North American lion and a large paw print with a central pad and three toes clearly seen. At left is a line of double-toed tracks like a deer track next to a silhouette of a western camel. Text at the top reads, “We know the animals shown in the painting to the left were once here because we still find their footprints. The wind uncovers these clues of the distant past right before our eyes. But once they are exposed, the winds quickly erode these 18,000-year-old records.

It is mounted just down the slope from a small clump of scrubby cottonwood trees. The trees are short, almost bush-like in appearance with white bark and broad leaves that are almost heart-shaped. Past the sign as you face it, the trail continues downslope as the small ridge you are on drops down to a brush-covered flat basin. To the right the sand is broad and smooth. To the left, the side of the dune ridge falls off very steeply just past a group of yucca plants with their sword-like leaves. The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a brown bat, lying on the ground with wings folded, a large black insect in its mouth. Labels identify the animals as the Pallid Bat and the Darkling Beetle. Text at the top reads, “Most bats eat while they fly. But my pallid bat friends are not most bats. They like to crunch down on big bugs that almost never fly—crickets, cicadas, stinkbugs, and scorpions. Since their food is rarely up in the air, it is not strange to see pallid bats having their dinner on the ground. Darkling beetles (stinkbugs) are chock-full of protein and fat, BUT there is that AWFUL smell.”",

The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a Desert Cottontail Rabbit, crouched on all four legs, its huge ears raised alertly over its head. Text at the top reads, “What is your favorite hiding spot? Cottontail rabbits have to hide throughout their lives to stay safe. As babies, they stay hidden in fur-and- grass-lined nests, almost like a bird’s nest. Their moms stay away most of the time, except to nurse them. No mom “at home” means predators have less chance to find them. Adults hide under bushes in the heat of the day. When danger appears, they freeze, then zigzag away.”",

Burrowing owls line their dens with poop from other animals to attract their favorite food—beetles. When bugs show up, they grab them. These owls like to take over foxholes or tunnels of badger or prairie dogs —places rattlesnakes also live. The owls stay out of sight and fake out enemies by hissing and making scary rattlesnake sounds.”",

The rattlesnake has brown and white stripes circling its body. Text at the top reads, “Are you a picky eater? My friends the badgers are not! They will eat almost anything.

The sign sits near the top of a smooth sand dune, which extends even higher slightly to your left. Directly past the sign is a small clump of scrubby cottonwood trees, looking like large bushes. Behind you and to the right, the sand slopes downward to the grass covered basin floor below.

The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a bobcat, crouched down as it slinks towards us. It has light brown, dappled fur and amber eyes. In the lower left of the sign is a picture of a Black-tailed Jackrabbit sitting with its long ears laid down along its back, its wide eyes staring off to the left. Text at the top reads, “Do you like to eat the same food, night after night? Not me! I like to eat a lot of different things. The bobcats that also live here in the dunes like to eat jackrabbits—a lot! Biologists who study desert bobcats say that 45% of their diet comes from just one prey: jackrabbits! It takes a lot of 4-pound rabbits to keep a 24-pound bobcat going strong.”",

As you face the sign, a low ridge of dunes is visible on the far side of the playa. The trail continues on through the brush to the right and the trail back to the road lies on your left. The background of the sign features a picture of the playa from a perspective close to that of your current position. Vertical lines separate the picture into four sections corresponding to times of the year. Text above and below the picture is in both English and Spanish. At the top it reads, “Water is the magic ingredient that changes the color and character of the playa. What may appear to be barren and lifeless is actually another hidden world, waiting to come alive.” Text at the bottom reads, “Toads, tadpoles, and shrimp come out when water shows up. Where do they come from? Toads emerge from their underground hibernation. Tadpoles come from the toads and quickly develop legs before the playa dries up. Brine shrimp eggs embedded in the sand from previous years come to life. When the water evaporates, the remaining minerals form a white crust that quickly breaks into smaller pieces and turns into wind-driven powder. Then the playa waits another year for water to do its magic again.” From left to right the first section is labeled “Cool, December to March.” It shows a detailed picture of white fluffy crust. The next section is Hot, April to June. It shows a hot sun over the barren, dry playa. The third section is Storms, July to August. It shows a picture of a storm cloud as well as pictures of tadpoles, brine shrimp and a Spadefoot Toad. The last section is Warm, September to November. It again shows the dry playa with a picture of bright white mirabilite crystals, thin flat oblongs.",

    "audioDescription": "This three-foot by four-foot sign hangs on one side of a three-sided kiosk at the start of the Dune Life Nature Trail. The background of the panel is an illustration of the dunes at night with a variety of wildlife. Creatures identified include foxes, a lynx, rabbits, badgers, different kinds of mice, a rattlesnake, beetles, a wasp, and several kinds of birds, including an owl. At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “Living on the Edge. Here—where the desert ends and the dunefield begins—is where life is most abundant. If you walked this trail after sundown, you might see the creatures shown in this artwork. During the day, look for the tracks of kit foxes, badgers, birds, rodents, and reptiles that call this edge their home.” Below the text is a cartoon image of a red fox with long black eyelashes. Her left paw is raised and her long tail swoops to her left side, together forming the initial “K” in “Katie the Kit Fox.” Text to the right of the figure reads. “Look for Katie on the Trail. Kids! Look for Katie on the signs along the trail. She will introduce you to all her animal friends along the edge of the dunes.”",

At the top is text is both English and Spanish that reads, “How do you fit into this human history? Nine years before the military came in 1942, President Herbert Hoover created White Sands National Monument on January 18, 1933.” Across the center of the panel is a green band with a black and white photograph of a large group of people, all posed at the bottom of a dune slope, facing us. Text on the band reads, “1921 – U.S. Senator Albert Fall wanted to create a national park in the Alamogordo area. Most of his ideas got little support except for one, the preservation of the dunefield. 1933 – Local advocate Tom Charles and the citizens of Alamogordo supported the idea of forming a national park to protect the dunefield. Today – Every year over 400,000 people from all over the planet visit these amazing white dunes for recreation and renewal. White Sands National Monument preserves the largest gypsum dunefield in the world.”",

He faces away from us, in a low crouch with spear raised ready to throw. To the right of that is a black and white photograph of a man wearing a loose jacket and hat standing next to a wooly sheep with long horns. Text on the panel is in both English and Spanish. At top it reads, “Did you know that humans have been coming here for more than 10,000 years?” On the tan band are milestones in time that read, “10,000 Years Ago. The first people to arrive came following herds of mammoth. 8,000 Years Ago. A prehistoric people, now called the Jornada Mogollon, used this basin. They mysteriously disappeared before the 1400s. 1450s – The Apache settled here. They were first people to enter after the Jornada Mogollon left. 1860s – During the 1860s, the era of sheep ranching began. English and Spanish-speaking settlers founded the first settlements at the mouths of the La Luz and Tularosa Canyons.”",

It has a brown back and head, with lighter tan on its belly and front legs. Near the mouse is a shiny black stinkbug. Text at the top reads, “My fierce friends the grasshopper mice are almost 100% meat eaters—that is, if you think of deadly centipedes and scorpions as “meat.” They hunt at night like tiny cats. They claim and defend large territories—the size of 19 football fields. In a fight, they are as quick as lightning. After a kill, they get up on a rock, and let out a lion-like roar.

At the top is text is both English and Spanish that reads, “Have you ever heard a window-rattling sonic boom from a passing jet? They are common here. During World War II (1939–1945), a new set of occupants arrived in the basin— the U.S. military.” A white band across the center of the panel has two pictures, one of an F-22 Raptor fighter jet and the other showing a line of heavy military equipment moving across the desert, most of them tractor-like, one of them a huge flat-bed on wheels with a cylindrical structure lying on top of it. Text on the band reads, “1942 – The Alamogordo Bombing Range, now called the White Sands Missile Range, was established. Later in the year the Alamogordo Army Air Field, now called Holloman Air Force Base, was established as a training facility for American pilots. 1945 – The first atomic bomb was tested in July at the Trinity Site, 60 miles north of the White Sands. In this photo you see the blast containment canister Jumbo on its specially built 64-wheel trailer. Today – The wide-open skies of the Tularosa Basin provide a perfect training area for airmen and a great testing ground for new technologies from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and even NASA.”",

Behind you the trail makes a gradual climb up to a low ridge. The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of an Apache Pocket Mouse with its brown back and white belly and legs. The mouse clings to a slender stalk of Indian Rice Grass, which bends due to its weight. Text at the top reads, “What do you like to drink? I like water. My neighbors the Apache pocket mice don’t drink—EVER! They never have to take a drink because they get all the water they need from their food. These mice carry seeds they harvest in large cheek pouches. Then they stash them in cool underground pantries where the seeds absorb moisture. This helps the mice to get more water.”",

The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a Greater Roadrunner perched on a gnarled branch. The bird has a tan body marked with short black stripes. It has a black cap, white beneath and behind its eyes with occasional patches of red or blue.. Its bill is as long as its head and very pointed. Text at the top reads, “Roadrunners, my very fast friends, are mostly seen in motion. For the record, they can fly, but they prefer a super-fast trot. This makes it easier for them to grab a tasty lizard or snake for a snack on the run. At sundown they are ready for bed. They like sleeping in the same roost every night. You can find roadrunners in the same tree, night after night, catching some z’s.”",

He stands, facing right, his right foreleg raised as he stares intently ahead. He has fur that is brown with black tips, a white underbelly and a bushy tail. Text at the top reads, “When you are the size of a five-pound Chihuahua like me, you keep a sharp eye peeled for a coyote, the size of a beagle. Coyotes don’t care that we both belong to the Canis family. A hungry coyote will catch and eat kit foxes like me. Coyotes do a lot of patrolling every night. They can roam as far as eight miles from their den, which is like hiking this trail eight times.”",

As you face the sign, a low ridge of dunes borders the far side of eth playa and the brush covered flat desert is behind you. The background of the sign shows an illustration of flat, brush-covered land with steep mountains along the horizon. Pictures of prehistoric animals dot the landscape. At upper left, there is a herd of mastodons, elephant-like with long white tusks. To the left of them is a giant ground sloth, with a long, thick tail. At bottom left are two dire wolves. They stand in shallow water near some cattails, feeding on a carcass, black raven-like birds hovering nearby. In the center is a group of three North American lions, crouched at water’s edge, drinking. At the right side of the picture are two huge Columbian mammoths next to a herd of 6 western camels with single humps. At lower right, two sabre-tooth cats look on, their fur dappled like a leopard, their long canine teeth hanging past their chins. At lower left, a timeline asks, “How many years ago?” It shows silhouettes of the animals at 1.7 million years, then extinction at 12 thousand years agao. The duens appear at 10 thousand years. At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “Before this desert and these dunes were here, you would have seen a lusher, wetter world. Picture animals as gigantic as mammoths, mastodons, and ground sloths. Think fierce predators: lions, dire wolves, saber-toothed cats. Sand dunes or sabertooths…which do you prefer?”",

Three small photographs are in the bottom right corner showing different views of the night sky with lots of stars and the Milky Way forming bright clouds. The caption reads, “Sleeping Under the Stars. Here, away from city lights, starlight shines bright.” At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “Once darkness settles over the dunes, this white sand magically mirrors the colors of the night. On a moonless night, enjoy the splendor of the Milky Way. A full moon here can make night look almost like day. Look up, look out, and see the night in a whole new light.” Across the middle of the panel are three photographs. The one on the left shows a sunset, the sky glowing yellow and orange over the mountain peaks. The middle picture shows a scene under a bright moon, the white dunes aglow under the scattered clouds, one lone tree at the left. The final picture shows a sunrise, bright over the far mountains, giving the rippled sand a golden glow.",

Behind the sign the white sand slopes up slightly with grey-green bushes dotting the rolling surface. Immediately past the sign is a blue trail marker. More markers are visible to the right and to the left. Behind you, as you face the sign, are sand pedestals on each side of the path. These outcroppings of solid sand are about 12 feet high, topped with thick vegetation. Their vertical surfaces are made of hardened sand with many cracks and uneven places where chunks of sand have fallen off, looking like miniature cliff faces. The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has two groups of small round photographs of animals.Nine images arranged in an oval on the left side are identified as carnivores, and four in a circle on the right are labeled as herbivores. From the far left and moving clockwise, the animal pictures listed as carnivores are the Coyote, the Bobcat, the Lesser Nighthawk, the Apache Pocket Mouse, the American Badger, the Kit Fox, the Pallid Bat, the Grasshopper Mouse, and the Burrowing Owl. In the herbivores circle, starting at left and moving clockwise are the Yucca Moth, the Desert Cottontail Rabbit, the Greater Roadrunner and the Tarantula Hawk, which is a black insect with thin orange-colored wings. Text at the top reads, “Welcome to my home! My name is Katie the Kit Fox. I will be your guide today. Do you like to eat meat and vegetables? Humans that don’t eat animals are called vegetarians. In my world, they are called herbivores. Meat eaters like me are called carnivores. No matter what we eat, we depend on each other to live in this desert. Plants provide seeds and nectar to the herbivores, herbivores are meat for the carnivores, and carnivores die and become nutrients for the plants.” More text at the bottom reads, “Two animals are in the wrong group. Make your best guess and then get the answer from the signs along the trail.”",

    "audioDescription": "This 4-foot by 2-foot sign is mounted on the railing under the tent shelter along the boardwalk. The background shows a view of white dunes with mountain peaks rising in the distance. In the middle of the panel is a large picture of a yucca plant. Its base is a mound of long, sword-like leaves. Four stalks rise up out of the mound, over twice as long as the leaves. The two on the left are covered with clusters of white blossoms. A single flower is enlarged, to show it white cupped petals surrounding a center with white stamen and pistil. The third stalk is full of green seed capsules, long ovals in shape. The last stalk shows the capsules dried and brown. An enlargement shows the capsules splitting open to expose the seeds. A final enlargement at the bottom of the plant shows the fibrous roots. At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “Imagine yourself living in the surrounding desert some 500 years ago. Without grocery stores, where would you get your food? What about soap and medicine? The soaptree yucca would have been your store, with more than 100 different uses! 100% Yucca – Lift the panels to match products with the part of yucca used to make it.” At bottom left is a rectangular flap with pictures of a basket, a yarn-like apron and woven, flat sandals. Under the flap text reads, “Leaves – You can dry the leaves and weave them together. For finer threads, soak the leaves, scrape them, separate the fibers, and twist.” Photographs show hands scraping a leaf, then separating fiber-like pieces from it. At lower right are three smaller panels. The one on the left has a picture of a plastic bottle with a pump and two bars of soap. Lifting the flap reveals text that reads, “Roots, leaves – Peel and puree the root then dry. Scrape the leaf, mix with water, then strain the scrapings.” The middle panel has a picture of a frittata, creamy yellow in color with a yucca blossom for garnish. Under the flap text reads, “Flowers – Cook the petals with your favorite egg dish, or add them to hearty stews of beef, pork, or chicken.” The last panel has a picture of two woven bowls with intricate diamond and zig-zag patterns. Under the flap text reads, “Seeds – Soak seeds in water to make a rich black dye.”",

    "audioDescription": "This sign hangs on the back side of a kiosk made of rough-hewn logs as posts and a small shade roof made of small branches. The background of the panel features a photograph of the white dunes dotted with a few clumps of grasses or bushes. At the bottom are three maps, one showing details along the drive into the dunes, one showing the layout of the visitor center buildings and parking areas and the final one showing the full park boundaries and the relative location of the entrance road and the visitor center. At the top is text in both English and Spanish that reads, “The Dunes Drive offers a scenic loop through the heart of the dunes. The monument opens every day at 7 am. From Memorial Day to Labor Day, the drive is open until 9 pm, and all cars must exit by 10 pm. The rest of the year, all vehicles must exit the park one hour after sunset. There is no water in the dunefield, so fill up water bottles at the visitor center before exploring the dunes. “Be Safe in the Desert. In the desert, temperatures can vary up to 50 degrees Fahrenheit in one day. Always bring as extra layer of clothing to be prepared for changing weather conditions. Take a minimum of one gallon of water per person per day and snacks. Because the white sun reflects sunlight, use plenty of sunblock and wear a hat and sunglasses. Talk to a ranger for additional safety information. “The White Sands Visitor Center includes an information desk. Bookstore, exhibits, audiovisual presentations and a gift shop. A native plant garden and restrooms are located outside the main visitor center building.” The map at lower left shows detail of the Dunes Drive of White Sands National Monument. The road begins at the bottom of the map where it turns off Highway 70. Las Cruces is 45 miles to the left and Alamogordo is 14 miles to the right. The visitor Center is just to the right of the road as it exits the highway. Just past the visitor center is a gate with the Fee Station located a little further on. At 2.3 miles along the road is the Dune Life Nature Trail on the left hand side. There is a parking area there and the trail loop is shown as a dotted line. Just below that trail is a small pullout on the right side of the road for the Playa Trail. At 4.1 miles on the right is a parking area for the Interdune Boardwalk and just past that location, the pavement ends and the road turns to hard-packed sand. At 4.7 miles is the Sunset Stroll Meeting Area. At 6 miles, the road splits to make a loop. There are many parking areas along this section of the road, indicated by grey. Going counter clockwise around the loop, there are two picnic areas on the right, the Primrose Picnic Area and the Roadrunner Picnic Area as well as a Group Use Area, which requires reservations. Near the far end of the loop is Area 19 and the Amphitheater. Once you round the end of the loop, there is a large parking area for the Alkalai Flat Trail. Beyond that, is an area labeled West Filming Area. As you approach the split in the road, there is the Yucca Picnic Area, and finally, very close to the split is parking for the Backcountry Camping Trail.",

    "audioDescription": "This four foot by two foot sign stands in a metal frame near the southern edge of the playa. From the playa proper, a small low inlet extends towards us from the right and ends a short distance past the sign on the left. A small ridge of dunes lies on the far side of the playa, running back towards the road. Behind you as you face the sign, the desert prairie stretches back toward the entrance to the park. The background of the sign features a picture of the playa viewed from the position of the sign. The lower part of the picture is cut away, showing a blue band underneath. The label reads, “Water can be as close as one to two feet beneath the surface.” At bottom left of the panel is a sketch showing the San Andres Mountains to the west and the Sacramento Mountains to the east, with White Sands National Monument lying in the flat valley in between. Clouds over the mountains drop snow on the peaks. Blue arrows indicate melted runoff flowing off the mountain sides and pooling beneath White Sands. At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “How can there be a pool of water here in a desert? You will find the answer underground. White Sands is at the bottom of an enormous basin that gathers water from the surrounding mountains. This water has nowhere to go, so it just sits here a few feet beneath the dry desert surface. With summer rains, the underground water level rises. It fills in playas— places slightly lower than their surroundings.” At the bottom right of the panel are pictures of two different bushes with circles showing where the plants are located in the picture of the playa. The bush on the right is an Iodine Bush. The one on the left is a Four-wing Salt Bush. Text at the bottom reads, “Salty Survivalists. Gypsum is an evaporate mineral. The water that rises to the surface in playas is very briny. Only certain plants, like four-wing salt bush and iodine bush can survive in such salty conditions.”",

The stems that attach the leaves to the tree are flat instead of round.

The roots run deep into the ground and hold the trees in place, so they don’t lose their grip during windstorms. During the fall, the green leaves of the cottonwood will start to turn yellow to orange in color.<br /> Migratory birds will use the groves of cottonwoods as resting points. The trees give them a place to stop and rest during their long journey.",

This road served as the main access point to the Monument for most of the 1930s, and was finished just in time to welcome an estimated 776 cars on Opening Day. That was nearly five thousand people, all exploring where you are today!<br /> <br /> While the road added a nice splash of color to the otherwise white dunes, it had a natural inclination to get washed out during periods of heavy rains. Within a few years, the old clay road was replaced by the asphalt pavement you probably rode in on today. But its remaining pieces still caused confusion among new visitors, and countless drivers found themselves lost by following this now destinationless road. To keep people on the right track, Civilian Conservation Corps members eventually removed most of the old clay road in the 1940s.<br /> <br /> As it is in all National Parks, these fragments of history are protected by law. Please take care to Leave No Trace and take nothing from the dunefield, including sand, plants, and pieces of this historic road.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The visitor is surrounded by the white dunes rising and falling on all sides, with distant mountains visible both to the west and the east. The dunes are bare white sand, often with ripples across their surface. In between are small flat basins with some clumps of grass, small bushes and an occasional yucca plant. In this small basin in particular are many red pieces of clay, varying in sizes, in a line shaped like a road that rests above the surface of the interdune area. Small plants poke out of the clay, which is mixed in with white gypsum sand. The \"road\" is about four feet wide and extends around twenty feet long.",

    "audioDescription": "This 3-foot by 4-foot sign hangs on the front side of the kiosk at the start of the boardwalk. The background of the panel shows a satellite view of the region with the San Andres Mountains extending up the left side of the image. In the middle is a large white area surrounded by light brown. White Sands National Monument is outlined in green, including the bottom half of the white area. Within the lower left corner of the park boundaries are two blue patches labeled “Lake Lucero.” A vertical black line through the park marks the Cooperative Use Area Boundary. The left half of the park is labeled, “Restricted area – Permit Required.” On the right half of the park area the road is outlined in red, extending from the Visitor Center half way up the eastern edge into the center of an intense white zone. To the right of the park outlines is a small map of the United States and Mexico with the location of White Sands marked in the lower southwest. Text tells us that it is the largest in the world at 176,000 acres. Another dot slightly south east of White Sands locates the Guadalupe Mountains, with 2,000 acres. Another dot further south in Mexico locate 250 acres at Cuatrociénegas. A small inset photograph shows that the white area is visible even from space. Three small photographs above the park outline shows the different zones within the park. One labeled “Chihuahuan Desert,” shows flat land covered with the grasses and small bushes. To the left of that one in the Innerdunal zone, a flat basin bordered by white dunes that has spotty vegetation on it. The left-hand photo shows a pure white sand dune with ripples left by the wind. It is labeled “Heart of the Dunes.” At the top is text in both English and Spanish that reads, “The stark, pure white dunefield you will explore just ahead is one of the rarest landscapes on planet Earth. Only a tiny handful of gypsum dune systems exist—and here you stand in the largest. Astronauts can see these dunes clearly from space.” At the bottom is a picture of a metal robot creature. Text reads, “Showcased Around the World. Do you vaguely feel like you have seen this scenery before, and yet this might be your first visit? If you watch TV, it’s likely you have! Hollywood has filmed more than 20 major movies here since 1950. Hundreds of commercials, music videos, TV shows, and documentaries have also been shot here. Researchers from all over the world come here to investigate the unusual animals and geology here. Both scientists and storytellers love to work here at White Sands. What story will you write here today?” To the right are three small photographs. From left to right, the first shows two men lying in sand, pointing upward. The caption reads, “Shia LaBeouf, Michael Bay, Transformers, 2006. The next shows a man riding a camel with a huge tent on its back. The caption reads, “Year One, 2008.” The final one shows a mesh-sided tent. Inside a man sits at a table. The caption reads, “Researching groundwater.”",

The one on the right is completely white with no markings on its back at all. At bottom left is a picture of a sandy surface, with a few small stones scattered about. In the center is just visible a white lizard, a dark shadow underneath him. Text asks, “Can you find the hidden lizard in this photo?” At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “Many white animals you may see here, like the bleached earless lizard, once were dark. As gypsum dunes began to form, this landscape became more and more white. Lighter lizards survive better in the dunes because they match their surroundings. “Quick Change Artists. To completely change skin color in 7,000 years may seem like a long time to you. Keep in mind that humans today have the same DNA as when the Egyptians built their oldest pyramids 4,500 years ago. But for a scientist studying evolution over millions of years, 7,000 years is the blink of an eye. Just outside these white dunes, you can still find darker Holbrookia maculata lizards.

    "audioDescription": "This three and one half foot by one foot sign is mounted on the platform railing at the end of the boardwalk. Against a background of an image of the white dunes, illustrations across the panel show the geologic process of creating the white gypsum that forms the dunes. At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “The Making of White Sands, Stage 1. The rise and fall of the sea millions of years ago made the gypsum that now rests under your feet. We will take you from sea to sand in three epic stages. We start with water.” At the left side of the panel is a map that shows the western United States as it looked 280 million years ago. An inland sea open to the west covers western Texas and southern New Mexico, putting the location of White Sands under water. To the right of the map is a drawing of a slab of earth covered by a layer of white. Text reads, “SEA LEVEL FALLS. Salty minerals left behind form a layer of gypsum.” In the middle of the panel, a drawing shows that slab of gypsum-covered earth with a layer of water on top. Text reads, “SEA LEVEL RISES and buries the new layers.” To the right of that a final drawing shows a second layer of gypsum-topped soil on top of the original one. Text reads, “SEA LEVEL FALLS adding another gypsum layer.” At the right of the panel a final map shows the western US at 75 million years ago. A broad swath of land from western Wyoming down through Utah, Nevada, Arizona and west Texas is now high and dry, with an inland sea to the north covering the Dakotas, Nebraska and most of Colorado.",

    "audioDescription": "This three foot by four foot sign hangs on the front side of the kiosk at the start of the trail. The background of the panel shows a bird’s eye view of the white dunefield looking towards the mountains in the west. The path of the trail is marked by a dotted red line, making a rough loop shape across the dunes. A label at the bottom of the picture at the edge of the parking area reads, “You are here.” Other labels indicate that the trail goes up and down and is a 5-mile loop (8km), which takes about 3 hours roundtrip. On the right a label reminds us to take water and a cellular phone on every trail, every time. Text reads, “Follow the trail markers. If you can’t see the next marker turn back. Don’t rely on your footprints. They can disappear quickly.” At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “Know before you go. Alkali Flat Trail. This trail is not flat! You will be hiking hard up and down dunes the entire way. Wind, temperature, and lack of humidity can make Alkali Flat Trail even more difficult. At times you may be the only hiker on the trail. Go only if you are prepared. NO SHADE. Always wear a hat. Take at least two quarts/liters of water with you. DO NOT TOUCH ANY STRANGE OBJECTS. Sometimes military planes drop dangerous objects on our dunes. PETS must be on leash AT ALL TIMES. NO HIKING AT NIGHT. DO NOT RELY ON GPS TO FIND YOUR WAY. Some days military tests nearby disrupt satellite signals for hours. LEAVE NO TRACE. Do NOT bury your trash. Pack out what you pack in.” A section along the bottom of the panel is titled “If you get lost.” Step 1 – look for a trustworthy land mark. “Walk southeast, toward the morning sun. If you can see a restroom, head that way.” Small photographs show a man standing on top of a dune looking off to the right. Another photograph shows a small restroom building visible in the dunes. Step 2 – “Try your smartphone. Call 911 or text a friend, if service is available.” A photograph shows a man sitting on top of a dune, cell phone held to his ear. Step 3 – “Stay put, don’t wander. Stay visible, on top of a high dune. Use a small mirror to attract attention.” A photograph shows a group of three people sitting on top of a dune.",

    "audioDescription": "This trail begins at a large parking area on the side of the road. Both the road and the parking are hard-packed sand. Near the start of the trail the parking area is edged with a split-rail fence. Just past the fence is a tall, three-sided kiosk with three graphic panels that discuss safety and describe the trail. As you face the fence a restroom building is located at the end of the parking area to your right. The trail is marked by flat, four inch wide, red posts with a diamond symbol. From the kiosk, it leads across a flat basin with scattered tufts of tall grass into the dunes themselves. The trail proceeds up and down the dune slopes, pure white sand on all sides. In many places, the surface is covered with small ripples of sand, which glitters under the bright sun. The footing varies from a firm hard pack to deep, soft sand on some of the slopes. Once out of sight of the parking area, you are in a sea of sand stretching out on all sides, with the distant mountains on the western horizon just visible.",

    "audioDescription": "This trail begins at a parking area at the side of the road. Near the start of the trail the parking area is edged with a split-rail fence. In front of the fence is a tall, three-sided kiosk with three graphic panels. To the right of the kiosk as you face the trail is a picnic shelter and table. At the far side of the parking area is a small restroom building. Near the beginning of the trail is a small sign that reads, “Parking for Backcountry Camping. Permit required. Available at Visitor Center.” The trail is marked by flat, four inch wide, orange posts with a spade symbol. From the kiosk, it follows a low ridge on the right, across a flat area, then up a slope to a sign where the trail splits to make a loop. That sign has a map of where the camp sites are located around the loop, sites 1 – 5 to the right and 6 – 10 to the left. At that point you are surrounded by the white dunes rising and falling on all sides, with distant mountains visible both to the west and the east. The dunes are bare white sand, often with ripples across their surface. In between are small flat basins with some clumps of grass, small bushes and an occasional yucca plant.",

The owls take turns outside of the den watching for danger. Burrowing owls are known to eat insects, small mammals, and lizards.

    "audioDescription": "This three and one half foot by one foot sign is mounted on the platform railing at the end of the boardwalk. The left side of the panel has an illustration of what happens in the dune during wet seasons. The right side shows the process during dry seasons. At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “The Making of White Sands, Stage 3. The impressive dunes you see before you started to grow 10,000 years ago in a process that continues today. It starts with the 250-million-year-old gypsum that we can see in the mountains around us.” The illustration on the left end of the panel shows White Sands with Lake Lucero at its western edge located in the valley between two mountain ranges. Clouds produce snow over the mountains and thunder storms in the basin, with rain and snow-melt flowing in to the valley. Text reads, “From Sky to Earth. Snowmelt and rains dissolve gypsum. It drains, mostly underground, and settles down here in Tularosa Basin. With summer monsoons or heavy snows, groundwater levels will rise above the surface. Lake Lucero, a large, mineral-rich temporary lake, reappears southwest of here.” The illustration on the right end of the panel shows the same scene with the sun blazing overhead, leading to water evaporating. Winds blow from west to east. Text reads, “Crystal Magic. When the gypsum-laden water evaporates, fragile selenite crystals grow on the lake bed. Crystal shards, lifted by strong spring winds, collide and shatter, again and again. They eventually become the white sand that piles up into dunes.” Small images show selenite crystals, an oblong column with flat sides, and the resulting particles ranging from larger pieces to fine sand.",

The land behind the sign is flat, scrub-covered desert land, stretching out to the distant mountains in the east. On the other side of the road is a narrow strip of brush-covered land backed by low dunes with low, bushy vegetation on their slopes. The top half of the panel features an aerial view of this area showing the entrance road winding its way from the highway at the right into the heart of the dunes at the left, where it makes a loop. Labels at the top identify the changing landscape from the brown-colored Chihuahuan desert at the right, through a changing innerdunal zone, where the brown shows streaks of white, into the heart of the dunes which is totally white. A label marks your current location about tow-thirds of the way along the desert section. Across the middle of the panel is text in both English and Spanish that reads, “All around you, Chihuahuan life. The coldest and wettest desert in North America. This desert covers a vast area. The whole Chihuahuan Desert is 133% larger in size than New Mexico. You can find typical plants and animals like these in three U.S. states and five Mexican states.” Along the bottom of the panel are photographs of 4 different desert plants and one animal. From left to right, first is a cholla. It has thick stalks about 1 inch across with short stalks branching off, the surfaces covered by spones. Next is a picture of a lechuguilla. It has sword-like fleshy leaves rising from a central base. In the middle is a picture of a soaptree yucca with its mound of flat, sword-like leaves and tall stalks with bunches of white blossoms rising above. Next is a picture of a creosote. This bushy, green plant has small leaves on thin branches. At right is a picture of an earless lizard. Its back is brown dotted with yellow specks and its underbelly is white.",

    "bodyText": "The story of dunefield creation starts millions and millions of years ago, back when this area was covered by a shallow sea. Layers of gypsum were left behind as the sea emptied and filled over and over, and you can still see them as light layers of rock in the surrounding mountains.<br /> <br /> Water carries dissolved gypsum down to the basin, then evaporates, leaving behind gypsum crystals. Those crystals are then broken down into smaller and smaller pieces until they are the sand you just dug into.<br /> <br /> The dunes have been here for around 7,000 years! The secret to keeping all this sand in place is shallow underground water acting as an anchor. Much like a paper towel sucking up water, the dunes act like the paper towel and the water holds them in place. When you feel the wet sand a few inches down, you’re feeling the dunefield’s anchor.",
    "audioDescription": "This sign, about two feet wide and one and one-half feet high, is mounted at an angle on a single metal post. The trail slopes down the dune past the sign and the next marker is clearly visible. On either side and behind you, the white sand stretches over the rolling dunes. Clumps of low bushes are scattered about. The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a Grasshopper Mouse, sitting back on its haunches, front paws held up to its mouth. It has a brown back and head, with lighter tan on its belly and front legs. Near the mouse is a shiny black stinkbug. Text at the top reads, “My fierce friends the grasshopper mice are almost 100% meat eaters—that is, if you think of deadly centipedes and scorpions as “meat.” They hunt at night like tiny cats. They claim and defend large territories—the size of 19 football fields. In a fight, they are as quick as lightning. After a kill, they get up on a rock, and let out a lion-like roar. How loud can you roar?” End of description.",

This tour begins from the park’s adobe visitor center located immediately to the right as you enter the park from the highway. White Sands National Park is among the most unique places on planet earth featuring expansive gypsum sand dunes. However, White Sands is so much more than just the dunes. Here life within has evolved against a white backdrop which provides a natural laboratory to study rapid evolution. For human visitors, the Tularosa Basin is a place we come to for insights into our past, present, and future as human beings. This tour will show the value of White Sands as a natural wonder, ecosystem, and a place for human enjoyment. Before departing into the dunefield here are a few more tips to help you make the most of your visit:<br />   <ul> <li>Read up on our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/hiking-safety-tips.htm\"><b>hiking safety tips</b></a> before setting off on foot.</li> <li>This is the last chance to get water! We strongly recommend having at least a gallon of water per person, per day. <strong>There is no drinking water available in the dunefield.</strong></li> <li>Always know where you are in the park if you decide to explore the dunes from the road. Take note of the mile markers along the road and which parking area you leave your vehicle in.</li> </ul> <br /> Let's hit the road!",

    "bodyText": "When and where was the last time you stopped to appreciate a dark night sky? Today it is rare for many people to have the opportunity to appreciate the everchanging night sky, but it is always there night after night whether we take notice or not. When the world shifts to darkness, most of us humans settle into our homes, close our eyes, and go to sleep. Out here at White Sands however, the park residents relish in the darkness. When visitors are done with their picnics, sledding, and taking selfies the park gets dark, quiet, and nocturnal animals emerge to start their day. This is when moths appear, fluttering from yucca to yucca, making sure they will bloom again next season. Bats squeak, flap, and swoop for prey. Kit foxes’ tiny paws scuttle along the dunes, chasing creatures with tinier paws. A bobcat lurks through the dunes, its eyes aglow in the moonlight. You may associate darkness with evil, uncertainty, and danger, but darkness is essential for all living things. The absence of light allows natural rhythms to take place. Artificial light disrupts this rhythm and alters the behavior of nocturnal animals. Imagine trying to sleep with the lights on or getting up for breakfast in the middle of the night. For us, darkness signals the end of the day and for nocturnal animals the beginning of theirs. In the absence of light, they can navigate, nest, hunt, and hide. Beyond helping nocturnal critters maintain their groove, the night sky has been an inspiration since the beginning of human history. On a clear night, how many stars can you see from your house? What can you do to see more? Perhaps a porch light or a bright floodlight is trespassing on your vision. The more artificial light that is near you, the fewer stars you will see. With few large population centers nearby, the remoteness of White Sands makes it an oasis for nocturnal animals to live undisturbed and for visitors to catch awe-inspiring views of the Milky Way. Tonight, and during your travels, we encourage you to keep your eye on the sky. Observe the darkness in different locations and recognize that this valuable resource is disappearing as we sleep.",

    "audioDescription": "From the parking lot, the hard-packed dirt trail leads through the split-rail fence, past a three-sided kiosk with informational signs and then across flat grassland to the white dunes. The trail then ascends up the sand between two dunes to a wayside sign, where the loop trail then splits to the left and the right. The audio description follows the trail to the left, in a clockwise direction. The trail is marked by flat, four inch wide, blue posts marked with a three-leaved clover symbol. The trail meanders up and down the dunes, which are dotted with a variety of grasses, bushes and the occasional small tree. The footing varies from hard-packed dirt to soft sand. The parking lot is a loop and is adjacent to the vault toilets.. At the beginning of the trail near the parking lot a brown sign reads, “Dune Life Nature Trail. This one-mile loop trail winds through the edge of the white sands, where dune life is most abundant. Watch for the tracks left behind by various desert animals as they hunt for food among the dunes. Two steep climbs will be encountered on this walk. Summer temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Take plenty of water and protect your skin from the sun. Please lock your car.” Further down the trail another sign warns, “Stop – Stay Alive. Water required for this trail. Take 64 ounces or two liters of water for each person in your group. When your water is half gone, return to your car. Warning Dangerous to hike above 85 degrees Fahrenheit.”",

A dotted line marks the trail as it crosses the scrubby grassland, then ascends into the dunes and makes an irregularly shaped loop on the white dunes. Labels indicate your current position at the kiosk next to the parking lot and also states that the trail includes some up and down. At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “Know before you go: Dune Life Nature Trail. Ahead you will climb a steep slope and enter the shifting sands of the dunes. This is your first opportunity to walk on the sand. Keep in mind this trail is for observing plant and animal life. If you want to play in the sand, drive further down the road into the heart of the dunes, near the picnic areas. “NO SHADE. Always wear a hat. Take at least two quarts/liters of water with you. PETS must be on a leash AT ALL TIMES. DO NOT TOUCH ANY STRANGE OBJECTS. Sometimes military planes drop dangerous objects on our dunes. “FROM JUNE TO AUGUST, Do not hike in the hottest part of the day. KNOW WHAT TIME THE SUN SETS TODAY. Follow the trail markers. If you can’t see the next marker turn back. Don’t rely on your footprints. They can disappear quickly.” The trail is a one mile loop (1.6 km) and takes about one hour to complete.",

This adaptation helps them to move fast and catch their prey. In the desert, there is very little access to running water. The kit fox gets all the moisture it needs from the food it eats instead of drinking. While it prefers small mammals such as mice, the kit fox will also eat lizards. <a> </a>",

    "bodyText": "They use these pockets to carry food to their dens. Pocket mice will store seeds in their burrows to eat later. If there aren’t enough seeds around, they will also eat leaves, stems of plants, and small insects. The white coloration of the Apache pocket mouse makes it hard for predators to see them. The more a mouse blends in with its habitat, the more likely it will live a long life. With each life cycle, the mice will become lighter because of the process of natural selection. In other words, the lighter mice will survive long enough to reproduce. They spend most of the day under the ground to keep out of the heat of the day. They will block up the den opening during the day to keep the cool night air inside. The tracks of the Apache pocket mouse resemble the movement of when you pretended to be a frog by putting your hands in between your feet on the ground and hop forward.",
    "audioDescription": "This section of the trail is very open. Above on top of the hill to the left are some Hoary Rosemary Mint bushes and Soaptree Yuccas. Below on the right, there are a variety of grasses. The grasses in the fall will be a pale tan, but others will have a reddish hue. During the spring and summer these grasses will be green and have various sizes depending on the grass. Little bluestem the grass that turns red will be the tallest. The mice love to run from the hill down into the grass to gather seeds.",

The ears have a layer of skin that helps keep the sand out while digging.",

    "audioDescription": "This three one half foot by one foot sign is mounted on the platform railing at the end of the boardwalk. The background of the panel shows a map of the southern United States and northern Mexico. A brown area marking the Chihuahuan Desert extends from central Mexico up to southern New Mexico where White Sands is and just over into southeast Arizona. An inset image shows White Sands viewed from space, an area 19 miles across. At the southern end of the desert is Cuatrociénegas with a satellite view showing a white area three miles across. At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “Families today often reach across cities, states, even continents. White Sands National Monument and Área de Protección de Flora y Fauna Cuatrociénegas, in Mexico, are sister parks. They work together to preserve two of the largest gypsum dunefields in the world. “Área de Protección de Flora y Fauna Cuatrociénegas – This unique 325-square-mile desert wetland preserves a 250-acre dunefield and many rare features, including a lizard found nowhere else in the world.” A small picture at bottom left shows a lizard with brown skin circled by bands of white edged in black. The caption identifies this as Lugo’s alligator lizard, Gerrhonotus lugoi. On the right side of the panel is a row of pictures of men and women, most wearing some type of uniform, from South Korea, Ghana, Australia, Mexico, Congo, Germany and Guatemala. Text reads, “National Parks Around the World. The idea to create national parks was born in the United States in 1872. It has grown into an international family. Nearly half the countries in the world now have national parks. Australia has the most—almost 700.”",

    "audioDescription": "This sign, about 2 feet wide and one and one-half feet high, is mounted at an angle on a single metal post. The sign sits near the top of a smooth sand dune, which extends even higher slightly to your left. Directly past the sign is a small clump of scrubby cottonwood trees, looking like large bushes. Behind you and to the right, the sand slopes downward to the grass covered basin floor below. The trail continues to your right and slightly downward as it rounds the shoulder of the big dune you are standing on. The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a bobcat, crouched down as it slinks towards us. It has light brown, dappled fur and amber eyes. In the lower left of the sign is a picture of a Black-tailed Jackrabbit sitting with its long ears laid down along its back, its wide eyes staring off to the left. Text at the top reads, “Do you like to eat the same food, night after night? Not me! I like to eat a lot of different things. The bobcats that also live here in the dunes like to eat jackrabbits—a lot! Biologists who study desert bobcats say that 45% of their diet comes from just one prey: jackrabbits! It takes a lot of 4-pound rabbits to keep a 24-pound bobcat going strong.” End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Welcome to White Sands National Park’s digital self-guided tour! If you see the Backcountry Camping Loop Trailhead in front of you, you’re in the right place.<br /> <br /> White Sands is far more than just a sandbox. Over time, this land has been home to countless creatures and people. It’s been a site for research and recreation, sleds and snapshots. Just as the landscape shifts and changes every day, the way recent humans have utilized this place has changed, too. As we begin our voyage to explore how the ways we use this landscape has changed over time, remember that nothing is permanent – especially not the world’s largest gypsum sand dunes. Keep in mind that you may need to adjust your location to get a better view along the way.<br /> <br /> Here are a few more tips to help you make the most of this self-led tour:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Read up on our <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/hiking-safety-tips.htm\">hiking safety tips</a> before setting off on foot.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bring plenty of water! We strongly recommend having at least a gallon of water per person, per day. <strong>There is no drinking water available in the dunefield.</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>Always know where you are, and keep a keen eye on the trail markers both behind you and ahead of you. The backcountry trail markers will all have the spade symbol on them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Please be respectful of visitors setting up camp at the designated sites along the trail, and try to avoid wandering into campsites uninvited. We’re not Goldilocks, and the beds probably won’t fit “just right.”</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now if you’re ready to begin, you can continue along the trail. <br /> <br /> Let’s go!</p>",

The plants that grow in the sand have all found different ways to survive here. A plant pedestal is one such way of surviving. It is a tall structure of hardened sand. Pedestals form when the plant takes up water from the soil. When the soil dries out, the sand will compact around the root system. The wind blows the loose sand away from the root system, exposing the pedestal underneath. Hoary rosemary mint leaves have shiny white hairs all over. The hairs help protect the plant from the sun. Just like when we put on sunscreen, it protects us from getting burnt.",
    "audioDescription": "On the right side of this section of the trail, you will find many hoary rosemary mint bushes. They are soft to the touch and make your hands smell like rosemary and mint put together. The undergrowth contains dead branches making the plants base seem rougher. When in bloom, the flowers will be a light lavender color with three petals fused together. The plant itself is a pale minty green color but during the winter it will not be as vibrant in color and half less leaves.",

    "bodyText": "As you gaze out your window you should see the sign “Gone With the Wind,” and beyond that sparse vegetation, and pure white dunes. How far do you think you can see? On most days you can see for miles, including the surrounding mountain ranges. Now I want you to imagine those mountains becoming obscured. A windstorm has picked up. You can feel it beating against the side of your car. It’s howling all around you. As the wind increases, visibility decreases. You can see a mile away. Then 500 feet. The yucca on the next dune is no longer visible. Then 100 feet. You can no longer see the sledding family. Then 20 feet. Then 5 feet in front of you. You are in the middle of white-out blizzard conditions, but instead of snow, it’s gypsum sand. If you were to try to leave your vehicle, assuming you could get the door open, the result would not be pleasant, gypsum would sandblast its way into every nook and cranny, the feeling of thousands of tiny needles against your skin. Moving only a few feet away from your vehicle could result in total disorientation. Now, what are some words you would use to describe our theoretical encounter? (pause) Wild? Dangerous? Perhaps even violent? As humans, we ascribe violence to nature quite often. Violent storms, volcanoes, and floods are found throughout most of the world. All these forces we may fear or try to prevent, help create the stunning landscapes and natural beauty we love – and the environment you are currently looking at. Eventually, the windstorm subsides, revealing pristine dunes, no footprints insight, with patterns of ripples coating its surface. Dunes move to new destinations, covering plants and revealing fresh ground for others to grow. Seeds fly to those new homes. From the beginning to now, without wind, this landscape would not exist. To change selenite, the crystal form of gypsum, to sand, the wind erodes the landscape. Crystals bounce off each other, collide, and break into smaller and smaller pieces, until they’re the size of a grain of sand, piling high to form the dunes you are seeing. Even though the dunefield loses sand during these windstorms, the wind also carries in new sand, keeping the dunefield in balance.",
    "audioDescription": "From the pull-off, there is an interpretive metal sign which says \" \" and describes how the wind builds the dunes here in the park. Across the park road there is a larger parking area which goes right up to a 20 foot tall dune. In all directions the white sand dunes are expansive, range from 20-40 feet, and have very little vegetation mixed in the further you drive on the park road.",

The dunes surround you are pure white and stand close to 20 feet high. The only vegetation visible is in a flat basin on the other side of the sign. The background of the panel features a satellite image of the region, with a broad band of white stretching out between the two mountain ranges. The area of the park is outline in green at the lower left of the white. Red arrows point from left to right. Text reads, “Strong winds can blow gypsum dust for hundreds of miles. But without the wind, there would be no dunes to enjoy.” There are three other photographs on the panel, all in black and white, one on the left and two on the right. At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “In this land of constant motion, nothing is permanent. Everything here moves—or we can move it. Any strong windstorm can wipe out this road in a matter of hours. Our 20-year-veteran heavy equipment operator once said, “If I spent all my time, 40 hours a week out there, it wasn’t enough time to do the roads…” The photograph on the left shows a road plow, scraping back sand at the base of a white slope. The caption reads, “Roadwork here never ends.” Near the right side of the panel another photograph shows a flat trail marker in the middle of the dunes with only about a foot sticking up out of the sand. The caption reads, “Trails: here today, gone tomorrow.” The picture at the far right shows a picnic table with a slatted awning that rises from one bench to curve up and overhead. The caption reads, “Even our picnic shelters are moveable.”",

At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “Years ago, some people looked at these shifting dunes and saw dollar signs—millions of them. Here were endless tons of potential profit, lying loose on the ground, so easy to scoop up and haul off.” In the middle of the panel is a black and white photograph of a man and a woman identified as Tom and Bula Charles. Next to that photo is a picture of an old sign reading “Visit the heart of the White Sands National Monument, educational and recreational, United States National Park Service.” Text reads, “Bring Tourists, not Tractors. Beginning in 1885, curious geologists studied these white sands. People long debated its economic value versus its natural significance. Alamogordo businessman Thomas Charles led the effort in the 1920s to make this a national park rather than an enormous mine.” On the right end of the panel are pictures of a variety of products including dry wall boards, bread, ice cream, toothpaste, wine and beer, cheese and a bandaged hand. Text reads, “Why is gypsum so valuable today? Gypsum is a $100-million-a-year industry. It is the main ingredient in drywall and plaster of Paris. Did you know this mineral is found in all kinds of food, household products, and medicines? Fact: During your lifetime you will eat an average of 28 pounds of gypsum.”",

Why did this one day have a long-lasting impact on your life? These special days that change our lives are unique for each one of us but we all undoubtedly have them. Even rarer than a day that has a special significance to just you, are days that have an undeniable impact on every person on earth. If you had been standing here in the early morning of July 16<sup>th</sup>, 1945, you would have been witness to such an event. As you look out over the dunes to the north, imagine you are here before sunrise and a blinding flash of light appears in the distance before fading away without explanation. The first shot of the atomic age had been fired 60 miles to the north at the Trinity Test site. For three years in near-total secrecy scientists and workers at three sites across the United States had been developing a new kind of weapon designed to bring a swift end to World War II. Known collectively as the Manhattan Project, the Trinity Test was the culmination of their years of work and within weeks of the successful test here in New Mexico the first atomic weapons would be dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, avoiding a full-scale invasion of Japan, but inflicting hundreds of thousands in civilian casualties. To this day they are the only nuclear weapons to have been used. However, the opening of the nuclear age at the Trinity site has had untold impacts on the world we live in. The potential for nuclear weapons to end human existence through mutually assured destruction has dominated global politics throughout the Cold War and into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. It has brought benefits to society in the forms of nuclear energy and medicine, but the adverse impacts cannot be ignored. In communities downwind from nuclear testing sites or uranium mines, the consequences have been devastating with high rates of cancer and birth defects. The Trinity Test is the point in time when the Pandora’s box of the atomic age was opened, and these sands bore witness to that moment.",

The entrance to the trail is near the left end of the fence. The walkway is five feet wide and made of wooden planks painted grey with a roughened surface. There are recycled plastic railings on both sides. A vertical board at the bottom of the side rails clearly marks the edge of the walk. A metal grill leads up at a slight angle from the ground to the beginning of the walkway. A sign at the entrance to the walk warns that the boardwalk is slippery when frosty or wet. The walk makes a gentle zig-zag about four-tenths of a mile into a sandy area between two low dune ridges. On either side of the walk are patches of vegetation, with low bushes and spikey yucca plants. At several spots along the walk it widens to make room for a bench. The far end is a 15 by 20-foot platform. About half way down the walk, a side walk on the right leads to another 15 by 20-foot platform, this one covered by a tent canopy with three rows of benches on either side of a center aisle. Attached to the railings of both platforms are multiple wayside graphic panels. Along the fence at the right side of the walk entrance is a tall, three-sided kiosk with more signs.",

The entrance to the trail is near the left end of the fence. The walkway is 5 feet wide and made of wooden planks painted grey with a roughened surface. There are wooden railings on both sides. A vertical board at the bottom of the side rails clearly marks the edge of the walk. A metal grill leads up at a slight angle from the ground to the beginning of the walkway. A sign at the entrance to the walk warns that the boardwalk is slippery when frosty or wet. The walk makes a gentle zig-zag about four-tenths of a mile into a sandy area between two low dune ridges. On either side of the walk are patches of vegetation, with low bushes and spikey yucca plants. At several spots along the walk it widens to make room for a bench. The far end is a 15 by 20-foot platform. About half way down the walk, a side walk on the right leads to another 15 by 20-foot platform, this one covered by a tent canopy with three rows of benches on either side of a center aisle. Attached to the railings of both platforms are multiple wayside graphic panels. Along the fence at the right side of the walk entrance is a tall, three-sided kiosk with more signs.",

In between the stacked signs is an interpretive sign showing ways visitors can manage their waste and \"Help Keep White Sands White.\" It encourages visitors to throw waste away in the proper receptacles, pick up after their pets, and \"take photos, not sand.\" This restroom in particular is next to a paved two-lane road called Dunes Drive.

    "audioDescription": "From the parking lot, the hard-packed dirt trail leads through the split-rail fence, past a three-sided kiosk with informational signs, and then across flat grassland to the white dunes. The trail then ascends up the sand between two dunes to a wayside sign, where the loop trail then splits to the left and the right. The trail is marked by flat, four-inch wide, blue posts marked with a three-leaved clover symbol. The trail meanders up and down the dunes, which are dotted with a variety of grasses, bushes, and the occasional small tree. The footing varies from hard-packed dirt to soft sand. The parking lot is a loop and is adjacent to the vault toilets. At the beginning of the trail near the parking lot, a brown sign reads, “Dune Life Nature Trail. This one-mile loop trail winds through the edge of the white sands, where dune life is most abundant. Watch for the tracks left behind by various desert animals as they hunt for food among the dunes. Two steep climbs will be encountered on this walk. Summer temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Take plenty of water and protect your skin from the sun. Please lock your car.” Further down the trail, another sign warns, “Stop – Stay Alive. Water is required for this trail. Take 64 ounces or two liters of water for each person in your group. When your water is half gone, return to your car. Warning Dangerous to hike above 85 degrees Fahrenheit.” End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "This four foot by two foot sign stands in a metal frame at the edge of a pullout along the road that winds its way into the heart of the dunes. The land on this side of the road is more of the flat, scrub-covered desert land. To your left as you face the sign is a low ridge of dunes, which the road skirts on the left and then disappears behind as it curves back to the right. On the other side of the road is a narrow strip of brush-covered land backed by low dunes. The top half of the panel features an aerial view of this area showing Dunes Drive winding its way from the highway at the right into the heart of the dunes at the left, where it makes a loop. A label marks your current location about midway along the road. Labels at the top identify the changing landscape from the brown-colored Chihuahuan desert at the right, through a changing innerdunal zone, where the brown shows streaks of white, into the heart of the dunes which is totally white. Across the middle of the panel is text in both English and Spanish that reads, “In between the dunes is where life thrives. But just your footsteps can kill the microscopic life in this crust soil. It takes years to regrow.” The bottom part of the panel shows a bird’s eye view looking past the road over the pure white dunes to the mountains in the distance. Again, a label marks your current location near the end of a finger of brown desert that reaches up towards the white dunes. Every patch of brown on the image has a symbol of a footstep with a red line drawn through it. More text asks us to “Stay on bare sand as you walk.”",

Once-buried layers of gypsum came back into view.” At the left side of the panel is a cutaway drawing of the earth’s crust showing one plate moving in from the west and sliding under another plate. Text reads, “PLATES COLLIDE, one forced under, the other up.” Next to the drawing is a map from 70 million years ago that shows the land in Arizona and New Mexico moving upwards as land under the Pacific Ocean slides underneath. To the right of that, another cutaway drawing shows a mountain being split apart as the two sides move outwards, leaving an opening in between. Text reads, “RIFT IN THE CRUST pulling apart mountains, leaving openings called basins.” To the right of that is a map from 30 million years ago showing the Rocky Mountains splitting into the Rio Grande Rift with White Sands located near the southern end of the spreading crust.",

Sixty of those species are entirely new to science.<br /> .<br /> This moth research is critical because moths are a great indicator of a ecosystems health. The greater the diversity of moths, the greater the diversity of other animal and plant species, therefore the healthier the ecosystem! If moths died out, songbirds would all but disappear. </p>",

The background picture shows a reddish landscape of sand and gravel with several lumpy mounds scattered about. Text tells us that these crystal pedestals are similar to those found on Mars. At the top of the panel is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “What on Earth (or off) do these things have in common? They are all examples of wild science happening here and now at White Sands.” More text at the left reads, “Moths Apparently Love White Sands. Researchers identified over 650 species of moths in just a 2-mile radius (1%) of the park. Thirty five of those species were brand new, found only in White Sands.” Below that text are two photographs of moths, one with wings outstretched, the other with wings folded back. Both are white, with pale grey or tan markings. In the middle text reads, “Sister Dunes. In 2004 Mars Rover Opportunity landed on a playa made up of gypsum, just like you see here at White Sands. By studying our dunes, NASA scientists are learning more about the red planet—and possibly the future of White Sands.” Below the text are two photographs. One shows four people examining a sand pedestal. The other is a 2013 picture of the Mars Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars. More text at the right side of the panel reads, “Hotbed of Evolution. Here you can see many animals that have changed color radically to boost their chances to survive. We know these dunes have only been here for 10,000 years. White Sands gives us a chance to see evolution happening before our eyes.” Below are photographs of three pure white creatures. One looks like a type of grasshopper. The middle one looks like a type of beetle. The one on the right shows a white lizard.",

    "bodyText": "You are currently located at Dune Life Nature Trail! As you look up the trail leading into the dunes you will see desert scrubland vegetation on either side of the trail. Perhaps this is greener than you were expecting to see at a place with a name like White Sands. Here towards the front of the drive is a meeting point of two unique ecosystems that allows a diverse community to thrive. On Dune Life Nature Trail just up the path from the parking lot, you’ll find yourself in another world where snow white dunes are dotted with dune adapted plants such as soaptree yuccas, Rio Grande cottonwoods, and hoary rosemary mint. Across the park road towards the Sacramento Mountains to the east, you will see the Chihuahuan Desert scrubland full of low-growing, thorny fauna such as creosote bush, mesquite, ocotillo, and varieties of cacti. In the dunes, you’ll find full-time residents like kangaroo rats, bleached earless lizards, and over 60 species of moth found nowhere else on earth that have become color adapted to the blindingly white environment. The largest predator that lives full time in the dunes is a kit fox which weighs in at a whopping 4 pounds! Animals residing in the dunes are small, compact, and efficient with their water, never taking a drink in their life. But the White Sands community is more than just what’s found in the dunes. On the edge of the dunefield where the sand meets the desert scrubland, the park receives some interesting visitors. Larger mammals like bobcats, coyotes, badgers, and even porcupines that couldn’t survive in the dunes year-round make their way into the dunes to get the resources they need and then return to their homes in the scrubland. These temporary visitors to the dunes are no less of a part of the dunefield community whether their impact is big or small. Your visit to White Sands today is also a temporary one where you might come to hike, sled, or enjoy a picnic and then return home with memories to last a lifetime. Whether you’ve come from near or far to be here today by taking the time to explore White Sands you have become part of the White Sands community!",
    "audioDescription": "From the parking lot, the hard-packed dirt trail leads through the split-rail fence, past a three-sided kiosk with informational signs, and then across flat grassland to the white dunes. The trail then ascends up the sand between two dunes to a wayside sign, where the loop trail then splits to the left and the right. The trail is marked by flat, four-inch wide, blue posts marked with a three-leaved clover symbol. The trail meanders up and down the dunes, which are dotted with a variety of grasses, bushes, and the occasional small tree. The footing varies from hard-packed dirt to soft sand. The parking lot is a loop and is adjacent to the vault toilets. At the beginning of the trail near the parking lot, a brown sign reads, “Dune Life Nature Trail. This one-mile loop trail winds through the edge of the white sands, where dune life is most abundant. Watch for the tracks left behind by various desert animals as they hunt for food among the dunes. Two steep climbs will be encountered on this walk. Summer temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Take plenty of water and protect your skin from the sun. Please lock your car.” Further down the trail, another sign warns, “Stop – Stay Alive. Water is required for this trail. Take 64 ounces or two liters of water for each person in your group. When your water is half gone, return to your car. Warning Dangerous to hike above 85 degrees Fahrenheit.” End of description.",

You'll love bringing your furry companions with you to the park, too.as long as they are non-disruptive, on a leash no longer than six feet, and are under physical control at all times.</p> <p>We ask you to follow these simple rules for everyone's enjoyment and safety:</p> <p><strong>Pick up after your pet.</strong><br /> Please help keep White Sands clean and beautiful for your enjoyment and for the enjoyment of future generations. Cleaning up after your pet allows the area to remain sanitary and keeps diseases from spreading—helping to keep you and your family as well as your pet safe and healthy! Please consider the many people who walk barefoot, play, and sled in the sand—no one wants to step or sled into pet waste.</p> <p>For your added convenience, White Sands National Park has two designated pet walking stations complete with pet poop pick-up bags to help facilitate with the removal of pet excrement. Both are located outside the visitor center;one is adjacent to the women's restroom and the other is behind the picnic tables.</p> <p><strong>Keep pets on a leash.</strong><br /> Leashing your pet ensures your much-loved friend doesn't run away and get lost. It also prevents them from tangling with hazards such as cacti and rattlesnakes. Federal law prohibits dogs from being off the leash in public areas (36 CFR 2.15). The leash can be no longer than six feet (2 m).</p> <p><strong>Give pets plenty of water.</strong><br /> Like you, pets get thirsty too. Especially in the summer pets can become dehydrated very quickly. They can also suffer from heat stroke and die.</p> <p><strong>Do not bring pets inside the visitor center.</strong><br /> While we love seeing pets in the park, they are not allowed in federal buildings (36 CFR 2.15).</p> <p><strong>Do not leave pets unattended, especially in vehicles.</strong><br /> It is prohibited to leave a pet unattended and tied to an object (36 CFR 2.15).</p> <p>Temperatures at White Sands National Park can reach extreme highs. Pets should never be left alone inside your vehicle. Within just ten minutes, the inside vehicle temperature will become 25 degrees warmer than the outside temperature. Within 30 minutes, inside temperatures can rise over 30 degrees. Pets left unattended in hot vehicles have suffered severe organ damage or even death.</p> <br /> <strong>Service Animals</strong><br /> Service animals are allowed in all facilities and on all trails unless an area has been closed by the superintendent to protect park resources.<br /> <br /> <strong>Definition of Service Animal</strong><br /> The 2010 revision to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a \"service animal\" as a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability.<br /> <br /> Dogs which are not trained to perform tasks to mitigate the effects of a disability, including dogs used purely to provide comfort or emotional support (\"therapy animals\"), are considered pets.",

    "audioDescription": "The Primrose Picnic Area is a large parking lot found just off of Dunes Drive, which is surrounded by rolling white dunes. Within the parking lot are many picnic tables with curved metal shade structures connected to the concrete squares the tables are affixed to. The tables are designed to fit around 4-6 people, and there are about a dozen in this area. The tables range in location from right up against dunes that are anywhere from ten to thirty feet high, to off to the side of the road next to smaller, rolling dunes. The white, hard-packed gypsum sand road that Primrose Picnic Area is on connects to Roadrunner Picnic Area, a much larger lot with similar views.",

    "audioDescription": "This 4-foot by 2-foot sign is mounted two wooden posts in a wide parking area next to the road in to the heart of the dunes. Both the parking lot and the road are hard-packed sand, bordered by low, white sand dunes. The surrounding sand has spotty vegetation, grasses and bushes with a lone yucca plant here and there. The top half of the panel features an aerial view of this area showing the entrance road winding its way from the highway at the right into the heart of the dunes at the left, where it makes a loop. Labels at the top identify the changing landscape from the brown-colored Chihuahuan desert at the right, through a changing innerdunal zone, where the brown shows streaks of white, into the heart of the dunes which is totally white. A label marks your current location about half way between the edge of the desert and the loop at the end of the road. Across the middle of the panel is text in both English and Spanish that reads, “You are entering a rare wonder. Explore this white world of gypsum sand.” The bottom part of the panel shows an elevated view of the white dunes stretching towards the mountains along the horizon. Two hot air ballons hover near the ground, one dark blue, the other a light grey. Smaller inset photographs highlight activities in the dune. One at the left side, labeled “Explore,” shows two women with backpacks following a trail of footsteps through the white landscape. In the middle, another picture shows two men and a woman, lying side by side in the sand, looking out at us. The label says, “Connect.” To the right of that is a picture of an open hand, covered with sand. The label reads, “Feel.” At the right is a picture of a young boy sliding down a slope in a green, plastic sled, bare feet raised high. The label reads, “Play.” More text reads, “White Sands offers you an other-worldly experience like no other place on the planet. Take time to experience the heart of the dunes—a place so vast astronauts can see it from space.”",

    "audioDescription": "This 4-foot by 2-foot sign is mounted on the railing under the tent shelter along the boardwalk. The background picture shows white sand dune sloping down to the left. Leading away from us is a line of indentations in the sand, each with a sandy bar running across it. Text asks us to guess what made these tracks. At the bottom corner, the answer is written upside down – humans. Across the middle of the panel are 9 vertical pictures of different tracks made in the sand. Along the bottom of the panel are 9 square flaps, each with a picture of an animal on it. At the top is text in both English and Spanish, which reads, “Take a close look at the sand around you. What do you see? Chances are that a number of tiny footprints are scattered about, leading from one plant to another. Because most animals here are nocturnal, we usually see only the tracks they leave behind.” “Who made these tracks? Lift the flap to find the answer.” The first set of tracks is made of two parallel lines of small dots. These were made by a buckmoth caterpillar, a green caterpillar with a black stripe down its body. Track number two has two paw prints, each with four toes that end in a claw. These were made by kit fox, a small fox with large, triangular ears. It has a brown back with red neck and forelegs. Track number three shows a straight line of prints, each one made of four dots. Two dots are close together, flanked by two larger ones just above and on either side of them. These were made by the Apache pocket mouse, a small, tan-colored mouse with a hairless tail and large black eye. Track number four shows two lines made of prints of three dots in a cluster. These were made by the shiny black darkling beetle with its long legs. Track number five consists of a line in the sand with alternating footprints on either side. Each has a central pad and five long toes. These were made by the bleached earless lizard, with its white skin. Track number six has small prints that look like human feet with two small indentations in between and a short line extending below. These were made by Merriam’s kangaroo rat, a small furry creature with long hind legs and short front legs. Track number seven is a long, squiggly line in the sand. It belongs to the black-tailed rattlesnake, its brown body covered in darker diamond shapes. Track number 8 is a set of prints like a capital “Y” with a vertical line through it. These were made by the horned lark, a plump bird with a brown back, white breast and a yellow throat framed with black bands. The last track is made of prints that have three toes extending forward and two lines extending backward like an upside down “V.” These were made by the greater roadrunner, bird with a long narrow beak, a crest on its head and a very long thin tail.",

Sweat evaporates quickly. Your body loses water rapidly in the desert. Always carry extra water with you. When your water is half-gone, return to your car.<br /> <br /> One gallon (4 Liters) of water per person per day is recommended, as well as high-energy snacks such as fruit, nuts, and energy bars. Fill up water containers at the visitor center. There is no water available in the dunefield.<br /> <br /> In addition, it is important to balance food intake with fluid consumption, lest you run the risk of becoming dangerously debilitated and severely ill. <strong>Hyponatremia </strong>may occur when a person drinks too much water without replenishing electrolytes or eating salts. If a member of your party begins to experience nausea, muscle cramps, or disorientation, yet they are well hydrated, they may need salt. Crackers, pretzels, and sports drinks should be consumed to keep up sodium levels in the body.<br />   <figure><img alt=\"Graphic of a ringing cell phone\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_Phone_Thumbnail.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Phone\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Bring a <em>fully</em> <em>charged</em> cell phone</h3> <p>Start your day with a fully-charged cell phone. Bring a portable charger if you have one. There are no outlets for charging cell phones at the park. Turn your cell phone off or put in airplane mode while walking in the dunes. Conserving your battery for emergencies could mean the difference between life or death.</p>   <figure><img alt=\"A phone with text \"Call 911\"\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_Emergencies_911_Thumbnail.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Call 911\" /></figure> <h3><br /> In an Emergency Call 911</h3> Data and cellular signal strength can vary drastically throughout the park. Sometimes you can text when you are unable to make a call. In an emergency situation with limited cell reception, text a friend and have him call 911 for you. You may not be able to call 911 if you are using a cell phone from outside the United Sates. Consult your mobile service provider for instructions on how to access emergency services with your device prior to venturing out into the dunes.<br /> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"Graphic of hands pointing at a green map\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_Plan_Ahead_and_Prepare_Logo_Thumbnail.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Hands pointing to map\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Have a Plan and Share It</h3> Tell someone who is not in your party where you are going and when you will return. Know the weather forecast and what time the sun sets. Be prepared for the weather and ensure you have enough time to complete your hike.<br /> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"Three hikers on a trail surrounded by grass\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_visitors_hikers_thumbnail.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Hikers on Trail\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Hike with Friends</h3> It is not recommended to hike alone. Always keep your children in sight. Children can wander, and separating from your companions can mean getting lost.<br /> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"Composite image of orange post, flash light, compass, and cell phone.\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_Know-Where-You-Are_Thumbnails.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Know Where You Are\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Know Where You Are</h3> It is easy to become disoriented in the dunefield. Wind moves sand and erases your tracks. GPS can be unreliable. While hiking, pay attention to and follow trail posts, each marked with a specific color and symbol. Knowing the trail markers is critical if you become lost. Look carefully for the next trail marker before continuing. If you cannot see the next marker, do not continue, turn around and return to your car. Plan your hike so that you are back at the trailhead before sunset.<br /> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"One man standing and two children sitting on a white sand dune\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_Staying_Found_Stop_Do_Not_Wander_Thumbnail.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Lost\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Do Not Wander if Lost</h3> Carry a park map and compass and keep landmarks, such as water towers, in view. If you become lost, stop and sit on top of a dune. Wandering can endanger your life and make finding you more difficult. Use a mirror or piece of aluminum foil to flash sunlight towards potential rescuers. Call 911.<br /> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"A pile of gear and hiking supplies spread on an orange tarp\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_BePrepared_Thumbnails.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Gear\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Be Prepared</h3> The sun reflecting off the white sand is intense year round and can cause severe sunburns. Wear a hat, sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher, and sunglasses. Apply sunscreen to all exposed areas, even in winter. Wear clothing that is appropriate for the day’s weather: loose, light-colored clothing during warmer months, and warm clothing during cooler seasons. Remember that temperatures can drop drastically after sunset – anywhere from 20 to 30 degrees.<br /> <br /> In addition, take the park map, a flashlight and extra batteries, a whistle, a signal mirror, a first-aid kit, and extra clothes that can be layered for varying weather.<br />   <figure><img alt=\"Three people eating at a picnic table\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_RestOften_Thumbnails.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Rest at Picnic Table\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Rest Often</h3> Heat illness can occur fast. Take frequent breaks in the shade. There are picnic areas with sheltered tables along Dunes Drive. You can also bring your own sun shelter or sun umbrella. Exposure to full sunshine can increase heat index values by up to 15°F (9°C). The sun’s UV rays are the strongest at midday. Plan your visit for early morning or late afternoon when the sun is lower.<br /> <br />   <figure><img alt=\"One hiker walking on white sand dunes\" src=\"https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/images/WHSA_KnowLimits_Thumbnails.jpg?maxwidth=650&autorotate=false\" title=\"Hiker\" /></figure> <h3><br /> Know Your Limits</h3> <h4>Altitude</h4> The elevation at White Sands is 4,235 feet (1,291 m). This may have an effect on those traveling from lower elevations. Allow time for your body to acclimate by adjusting your activity level. Take frequent breaks and drink water. Common symptoms of altitude sickness include headache and loss of appetite. Pace yourself and pay attention to how you are feeling.",

Behind you is a flat, grass covered basin surrounded by the low dunes. The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a Burrowing Owl perched on a gnarled tree branch. Its back is brown with tan spots. Its head and breast are also tan with a brown cap and a brown mask around its big yellow eyes. Text at the top reads, “Do you have a trick for getting your favorite food? Burrowing owls line their dens with poop from other animals to attract their favorite food—beetles. When bugs show up, they grab them. These owls like to take over foxholes or tunnels of badger or prairie dogs —places rattlesnakes also live.

    "bodyText": "What drew you to White Sands National Park today? Hiking? Sledding? Solitude? The Tularosa Basin has been a place where we as humans have been coming for thousands of years, even before the dunefield you see today formed. If you had been standing here during the last Ice Age, you would have witnessed a climate that was much cooler, wetter, and greener with a massive lake known as Lake Otero that was the size of the present-day Great Salt Lake in Utah. These were the conditions that lured the Ice Age megafauna like Columbian mammoths, giant ground sloths, dire wolves, camels, and more. This abundance of large game is likely what attracted these early human migrants to this basin. The presence of humans and megafauna at White Sands is not from the discovery of bones or artifacts, but from the preservation of fossilized footprints in the ancient lake sediments. Today, these fossilized footprints have to be cataloged and studied rapidly because as quickly as they appear at the surface, they will continue to erode away with the wind in just a matter of years. These footprints will never tell us everything we want to know about what human and megafauna life at the time was like, but they do provide snapshots. A group of humans stalked a giant ground sloth on a hunt. A woman struggled and slipped through the mud for over a mile with a set of children’s feet appearing occasionally as she briefly sets her child down before moving on. A giant ground sloth made a footprint that became a puddle where children’s footprints show them splashing in the water. Sets of teenagers fossilized footprints carbon-dated to around 23,000 years old, older than any definitive evidence of human habitation yet found in North America. What will be remembered about your visit to White Sands today?",
    "audioDescription": "From the trailhead pull-off, a trail sign with the title reads \" \" and gives a description of the human and megafauna life that lived here during the ice age. The trail is marked by green posts with heart symbols on them. The trail begins in desert scrubland vegetation and leads towards a dry lake bed with a bright white surface where evaporite minerals have been left behind. Across the park road there is more desert scrubland before it meets the white sand dunes with sparse vegetation. The trailhead and a brown restroom building are also visible.",

    "audioDescription": "This sign, about two feet wide and one and one-half feet high, is mounted at an angle on a single metal post. It is mounted just down the slope from a small clump of scrubby cottonwood trees. The trees are short, almost bush-like in appearance with white bark and broad leaves that are almost heart-shaped. Past the sign as you face it, the trail continues downslope as the small ridge you are on drops down to a brush-covered flat basin. To the right the sand is broad and smooth. To the left, the side of the dune ridge falls off very steeply just past a group of yucca plants with their sword-like leaves. The sign has a picture of Katie, the cartoon fox figure, in the upper left, with text in both English and Spanish along the top. The bottom part of the sign has a picture of a brown bat, lying on the ground with wings folded, a large black insect in its mouth. Labels identify the animals as the Pallid Bat and the Darkling Beetle. Text at the top reads, “Most bats eat while they fly. But my pallid bat friends are not most bats. They like to crunch down on big bugs that almost never fly—crickets, cicadas, stinkbugs, and scorpions. Since their food is rarely up in the air, it is not strange to see pallid bats having their dinner on the ground. Darkling beetles (stinkbugs) are chock-full of protein and fat, BUT there is that AWFUL smell.” End of description.",

    "bodyText": "Have you ever felt that things fell into place perfectly for you? For the unusual dunes you see to form, the perfect sequence of geologic events had to occur here. Gypsum, the material that makes up the sand dunes, is among the most common on earth and is widely used as a construction material in drywall, plaster of Paris, and concrete. Despite gypsum being found on all seven continents, this place is worthy of being a National Park because gypsum sand dunes are among the rarest geologic features on earth, with only 3 in the entire world! The process of building this geologic wonder has been a long time in the making. In the mountains to the east or west, you may see lighter layers. This is gypsum! It was deposited 280 million years ago by a shallow inland sea that advanced and receded across the southwest, leaving behind the massive deposits of gypsum that make up the white sand today. Flash forward to 70 million years ago when colliding plate tectonics uplifted the horizontal gypsum layers in a massive mountain building event. Around 20 to 30 million years ago these plate tectonics began to pull apart creating the two separate mountain ranges you see today, the San Andres Mountains in the west and the Sacramento Mountains in the east. In between the mountain ranges where you now stand the earth fell away forming the Tularosa Basin. Finally, the ancient Rio Grande River flowed into the Tularosa Basin between 2 and 3 million years ago bringing with it sediments that eventually blocked any water carrying gypsum from flowing out of the basin. Later in this tour, you’ll explore the modern geologic forces that have sculpted these dunes, but without the perfect series of geologic coincidences to set the stage none of this would be possible.",
    "audioDescription": "From the road pull off, a two lane park road continues towards the dunefield. The basin extends flat to the east with green and brown, low lying, desert scrubland vegetation. In the distance, there are some buildings at Holloman Air Force Base and then the town of Alamogordo further out. The Sacramento Mountains rise several thousand feet above the basin floor. Across the park road to the west, 20 foot tall white dunes rise up from the scrubland vegetation and is dotted with few green plants.",

    "audioDescription": "This 4-foot by 2-foot sign is mounted on two wooden posts at the edge of a pullout along the road that winds its way into the heart of the dunes. The land behind the sign is flat, scrub-covered desert land, stretching out to the distant mountains in the east. On the other side of the road is a narrow strip of brush-covered land backed by low dunes with low, bushy vegetation on their slopes. The top half of the panel features an aerial view of this area showing the entrance road winding its way from the highway at the right into the heart of the dunes at the left, where it makes a loop. Labels at the top identify the changing landscape from the brown-colored Chihuahuan desert at the right, through a changing innerdunal zone, where the brown shows streaks of white, into the heart of the dunes which is totally white. A label marks your current location near the entrance to the park. Across the middle of the panel is text in both English and Spanish that reads, “You are in the Tularosa Basin. This basin is like a bathtub with no drain. Water, the essential ingredient in dune formation and stabilization, drains down towards White Sands, the lowest point. Without water, the dunes would not exist.” The bottom half of the panel shows a high aerial view of the basin with the snow-topped San Andres Mountains at the left and the Sacramento Mountains to the right. The basin is brown with a huge patch of white stretching from the center back to the left. A label identifies White Sands National Monument with the entrance road in the lower right of the patch marked in red. Wide blue arrows point from the mountains into the white area.",

On the front and side there is a shade roof attached to the sides of the building consisting of small logs laid on two-inch thick supporting beams. The shade roof is a dark brown and the walls are a desert tan, which has a slight pinkish cast to it. The area around the building is landscaped with smooth, fist-sized rocks and there is a flag pole in front flying the American flag. Just to the east of the building is a similar, smaller structure, which allows for two lanes of traffic going into the park during busy times.",

Since 1950, this park has been featured in dozens of films, ranging from classic spaghetti Westerns to modern action, science fiction, documentaries, and comedy movies. On top of being a great spot for yoga instructors to film their classes, this dunefield was even used in a promotion for the Olympics.<br /> <br /> Whether it’s rugged cowboys or old school boybands that pique your interest, it’s possible you’ve followed along some famous footsteps on your hike today. Take a closer look at the landscape the next time you spot some dunes in a video, too – it might be White Sands that you’re watching!<br /> <br /> Want to see White Sands on the big screen sooner rather than later? Swing by the Visitor Center to watch our captivating 17-minute orientation film, which is shown every half hour, on the hour. If the Visitor Center isn’t showing the film, the DVD is available for sale at the non-profit park store.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The trail is marked by flat, four inch wide, orange posts with a spade symbol. From the kiosk, it follows a low ridge on the right, across a flat area, then up a slope to a sign where the trail splits to make a loop. That sign has a map of where the camp sites are located around the loop, sites 1 – 5 to the right and 6 – 10 to the left. At that point you are surrounded by the white dunes rising and falling on all sides, with distant mountains visible both to the west and the east. The dunes are bare white sand, often with ripples across their surface. In between are small flat basins with some clumps of grass, small bushes and an occasional yucca plant.",

    "bodyText": "You are now at Interdune Boardwalk. On the signs detailing the trail, you will also see an overhead picture of the dunes. Imagine you are a bird of prey soaring over the dunes searching for a tasty snack in the form of a lizard or small rodent. As you look down on the endless waves of white dunes you might think that the dunefield is entirely barren other than the yuccas and rosemary mint dotting the landscape. However, darting in the interdune are small, white color adapted critters doing their best to go unseen. White Sands provides one of the best examples on earth of rapid adaptation to a unique environment. These white sand dunes have only been here for around 7,000 years and in such a short time the animals that call them home have shown remarkable adaptation to their environment. Unlike the surrounding desert, at White Sands it is survival of the lightest! Over generations, certain traits like color give animals an advantage in a given environment and pass on their advantageous traits to their descendants. Here you’ll find that being white color adapted not only helps an animal hide from predators, but it also keeps them cool in the scorching summers by reflecting sunlight away. The rapid change in habitat in the Tularosa Basin has led to an explosion of white, endemic species found nowhere else on earth. Just as isolated islands lead to unique, specialized species of animals, the unusual environment of the dunefield has led to lizards, moths, mammals, and even a species of fish that are found only at White Sands.  ",
    "audioDescription": "From the trailhead parking lot, there is a trail kiosk which has information about \" \". In the parking lot there is also a brown restroom building. The trail is an accessible, raised, metal boardwalk with rails which leads into the interdune area with grasses and flowers growing on either side of the trail. The trail continues for a quarter mile into the dunes. Midway on the boardwalk there is a tan shade structure with benches for seating. At the end of the trail, the landscape becomes open white sand dunes rolling into the distance with sparse plants like soaptree yuccas, rosemary mints, and sumacs dotting the dunes.",

White, plastic dinnerware is not easily visible on the white sand. Remember to <em><a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/leave-no-trace.htm\">Leave No Trace</a>.</em></li> <li>When you are done with your picnic, use our recycling bins by the vault toilets to recycle plastic and aluminum.</li> <li>Consider using reusable tableware to reduce the amount trash left behind in the park.</li> <li>Trash dumpsters are provided in the picnic areas for your use. If the small trash cans are full please throw trash in the large dumpsters.</li> <li>Bag your trash.

In between both doors are two brown square signs stacked on top of each other, one with a wheelchair denoting accessibility, and the other with female and male stick figures separated by a vertical line and the word \"restroom\" underneath them. In between the stacked signs is an interpretive sign showing ways visitors can manage their waste and \"Help Keep White Sands White.\" It encourages visitors to throw waste away in the proper receptacles, pick up after their pets, and \"take photos, not sand.\" This restroom in particular is in the center of a round gypsum sand parking lot, and is surrounded by picnic tables. The doors face the parking lot, with views of the picnic tables as well as Dunes Drive. When facing the doors, visitors can see rolling white dunes with minimal vegetation. Next to this restroom is a blue recycling unit and a large dark brown dumpster.",

    "bodyText": "Agate Bridge, original called Natural Bridge, is a partially exposed petrified log spanning a gully at Agate Mesa, forming a “bridge”. This landmark has long been one of the most popular attractions in Petrified Forest since the beginning and in the early history of the park many visitors had their picture taken while standing on the “bridge”. Fear of the collapse of this landmark by the railroad—it was a major attraction—led to masonry pillars being constructed underneath is April of 1903, later followed by concrete in 1911. These were replaced by concrete beam in 1917 at the cost of $1700, paid for by the government and installed by the railroad. The log is about 100’ in length and 4’ in diameter at its base. It spans 40’ across the chasm and is 16’ above the canyon floor. In the late 1800s the paleobotanist Lester Ward proclaimed Agate Bridge to be the “most noted single petrified log in the world.”",

    "bodyText": "<p>Only one national park in the country includes and protects a section of historic Route 66: the Petrified Forest National Park with one of the world’s largest and most colorful concentrations of petrified wood, multi-hued badlands of the Painted Desert, historic structures, archeological sites, and displays of over 200-million-year-old fossils. The national park and this section of Route 66 are not to be missed, and one of the most special places to visit in the park is the Painted Desert Inn.<br /> <br /> The inn is situated on a mesa overlooking the vast and colorful Painted Desert. It is rooted in a lodge that entrepreneur Herbert David Lore completed around 1920. In 1935, the National Park Service purchased the inn and its surroundings, and immediately began planning to overhaul the building using the rustic aesthetic so popular in park architecture of the time. The National Park Service commissioned Lyle Bennett, one of its most sought-after architects, for the remodeling. Young men employed in the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), one of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration’s back-to-work programs, supplied the labor.<br /> <br /> The inn is of wood and native stone in the Pueblo Revival style. Outside, flagstone terraces surrounded by low walls overlook the desert. The building’s stone walls are more than two feet thick and finished with textured earth-toned stucco. Multiple flat roofs with parapets give the inn its varied massing, and Ponderosa Pine logs pierce the walls, adding play between light and shadow.<br /> <br /> One construction foreman noted the importance of the building’s details. Its openings, for instance, had semi-oval shapes rather than right-angled edges. He commented that: \"This shape was produced in the rock and plaster to resemble the openings in old pueblo buildings where the wet adobe was shaped by the sweeping motions of the women's arms that shortened the horizontal width of the opening at the top and bottom. Consider the difficulty of teaching a journeyman mason to understand…After much arm waving they got the message and were able to proceed.” That same foreman recalled how the concrete floors, walls, and furniture made the whole interior glow with soft, blended coloring. The CCC used ponderosa pine and aspen poles from Arizona forests for the <em>vigas</em> or roof beams and crafted handmade light fixtures from tin and wooden tables and chairs with American Indian designs. The concrete floors in the dining room and viewing porch had etched and painted patterns from Navajo blanket designs.<br /> <br /> The inn opened in 1940 under the management of the Fred Harvey Company, which was famous in the Southwest for providing hospitality services to tourists and travelers on the Santa Fe Railroad. For two years, the inn offered Route 66 travelers food, souvenirs, and lodging, and local people with event and meeting space. It closed in 1942, as American involvement with World War II shifted resources away from domestic programs.<br /> <br /> In 1947, the Harvey Company’s noted architect and interior designer, Mary Jane Colter, was given responsibility for renovations of the facility. Along with overseeing repair work, Colter created a new interior color scheme and made other changes. New plate glass windows to capitalize on the magnificent surrounding landscape were an important addition. At Colter’s behest, Hopi artist Fred Kabotie painted murals on the dining room and lunchroom walls that are reflections of Hopi culture. The Harvey Girls provided their legendary service to the public at the Painted Desert Inn.<br /> <br /> Even so, over the next decade, the inn declined and suffered from structural damage. In 1963, the inn closed and a new facility opened to house the park visitor center and the Fred Harvey operations. The park scheduled the building’s demolition in 1975, but a public campaign helped save the building, which the National Park Service listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The Secretary of the Interior recognized the historic significance of the inn by designating it a National Historic Landmark in 1987.<br /> <br /> In 2006, the Painted Desert Inn reopened following its restoration. The inn now appears as it would have in 1949. Today, visitors again are able to experience the exquisite architectural details and richly colored walls of the Painted Desert Inn. Some highlights include the Trading Post Room, a magnificent architectural space with six hammered-tin, Mexican-style chandeliers, an enormous skylight, and windows overlooking the desert. The skylight has multiple panes of translucent glass painted in Indian pottery designs. The posts supporting the corbels and <em>vigas</em> are painted in muted colors. The inn still has the original Fred Kabotie murals. A large and stunning mountain lion petroglyph is on display inside the inn. Discovered in the 1930’s, the petroglyph is considered one of the finest, most vividly animated and lifelike depictions of mountain lions in the region.<br /> <br /> The Painted Desert Inn is located in the northern section of Petrified Forest National Park in Petrified Forest, AZ. The inn is now a museum open to the public. The park has an entrance fee but no additional fee is charged to visit the inn.<br /> <br /> For more information on visiting the the Painted Desert Inn, call 928-524-3522 or visit the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pefo/learn/historyculture/pdi.htm\">Painted Desert Inn web page.</a><br /> <br /> For more information on visiting Petrified Forest National Park, call 928-524-6228 or visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pefo/index.htm\">Petrified Forest National Park website.</a><br /> <br /> Find the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/database-research.htm\">Painted Desert Inn National Register nomination form.</a><br /> <br /> The Painted Desert Inn has been documented by the National Park Service’s <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.az0292\">Historic American Buildings Survey</a>.</p>",

Once an ancient log jam in a Late Triassic river, Giant Logs was the heart of the original national monument set aside in 1906 by President Theodore Roosevelt. This area is located behind the Rainbow Forest Museum. Rainbow Forest was first called the Third Forest (based on tours leaving the once closest town of Adamana). An interpretive trail passes through the area and major features include some of the largest, most colorful petrified logs, Old Faithful log, and the Mather Plaque. There is a booklet available at the museum that corresponds to the numbered posts on the trail. There is a nearby geocache, seasonal drinking fountain, and wayside exhibit as well as the museum.<br /> <br /> Giant Logs is geologically in the Rainbow Forest bed of the Sonsela Member (mostly sandstone and conglomerate with some mudstones) of the Chinle Formation. The Sonsela Member contains the majority of the petrified wood deposits in the park and was deposited between 219-213 million years ago.",
    "audioDescription": "Giant Logs is located on a low hill behind the Rainbow Forest Museum. Large and colorful pieces of petrified wood are scattered over the entire area, a butterfly-shaped trail that is paved or graveled winding among the logs. The ground is often covered by rounded ancient river pebbles or some of the native grasses and other plants. The view is of Rainbow Forest with mesas to the north, a large wash beyond the parking lot, the park road heading northeast, historic Rainbow Forest structures (homes and historic lodge) and another log deposit and badlands beyond to the east. Far to the south you can see a little bit of the White Mountains over the grassland.",

Look up into the hill and you will see who is “cutting” the wood. The hill itself is doing the job!<br /> <br /> It takes many, many stacked layers of dirt to make a hill. That is a lot of weight on top of the buried petrified logs. All that weight crushed and broke the logs.<br /> <br /> Why the regularity in sections? A normal log does not break that way. But a petrified log does! Petrified wood is mostly silica-quartz minerals. The inner surfaces where they have broken are flat because quartz doesn’t break neatly across its crystal faces, so instead it snaps across the log’s shortest area—sort of like when you snap a piece of chalk.",

In the late 1920s, the park superintendent’s wife said the log was to Petrified Forest what the Old Faithful geyser is to Yellowstone National Park. From this the name “Old Faithful” stuck.<br /> <br /> Notice that fragments at the base are mortared together? In 1962, lightning struck and fractured the log. At that time, the National Park Service repaired the damage and built a retaining wall to slow erosion. Attitudes about resource management in our national parks have changed over the years; a log would not be glued back together today.<br /> <br /> YOUR OWN REPHOTOGRAPHY SHOOT<br /> Petrified Forest has hosted many great scientific minds. Perhaps you recognize the face of this visitor? Just like your trip, Dr. and Mrs. Albert Einstein’s March 1, 1931 visit would not be complete without seeing Old Faithful. Use the photo at left and you can stand right where the famous scientist stood so many years ago.",

Roots and branches fall away from rotting trees, but this one still shows the stump of its taproot. A taproot is a central, dominant, deep-anchoring root.<br /> <br /> A tree is more than its trunk. Fossilized cones, needles, and roots tell us as much about the ancient trees as the fossilized logs do. Fossilized cones tell us the trees were conifers, reproducing through seed-bearing cones, like a modern pine tree. The taproot itself is also like some modern pines. Its purpose is to stabilize and nourish the tree during severe storms and drought.<br /> <br /> Nearly a dozen types of petrified wood have been formally described. There are more species that have yet to be determined. A healthy ecosystem is a diverse one.<br /> <br /> It was a time before flowers. Coniferous trees, tree ferns, and gingkoes thrived in the ancient subtropical landscape. Many of the giant logs found along the trail, unique to this area, have been given the scientific name <i>Araucarioxylon arizonicum</i>.",

    "bodyText": "<strong>Stone Tree House</strong><br /> Built of petrified wood and other native stone, the Painted Desert Inn was the vision of Herbert David Lore. While his family remembers the finished building prior to 1920, Lore registered the inn with the land office in 1924, fulfilling his responsibilities under the Homesteading Act.<br /> <br /> For almost twelve years, Lore operated the “Stone Tree House” as a tourist attraction. Visitors could eat meals in the lunchroom, purchase American Indian arts and crafts, and enjoy a cool drink in the downstairs taproom. Six small rooms—cubicles really—were available for two to four dollars per night. Lore also gave two-hour motor car tours through the Black Forest in the Painted Desert below the inn.<br /> <br /> The Stone Tree House was an oasis in the Painted Desert, and quite isolated. A shop containing a lighting-plant supplied electricity, as the inn was not connected to electrical lines. Water was hauled from Adamana, ten miles south on the Puerco River.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Lore had built his inn on a seam of bentonite clay. As the clay swells and shrinks in response to changes in moisture, the foundation of the inn shifts. Early on, the Painted Desert Inn began to show cracks in the walls and water damage.<br />  <br /> <strong>CCC</strong><br /> In the early 1930s, Lore had expressed an interest in selling or exchanging his property “in order that it could be preserved and protected.” He was probably also concerned about the integrity of the building. Petrified Forest National Monument purchased the Painted Desert Inn and four sections of land—four square miles—for $59,400 in 1936.<br /> <br /> In the early 1900s, National Park Service Rustic style architecture—nicknamed Parkitecture—arose in the National Park System. This style reflected its connection with the Arts and Crafts movement through buildings that harmonized with their natural environment and regional culture. In the Southwest, Pueblo Revival Style epitomizes this movement, drawing from the Puebloan and Spanish Colonial cultures.<br /> <br /> Pueblo Revival Style features stuccoed masonry, thick walls, earth tones, flat roofs, and projecting roof beams (vigas). Due to the structural problems of the inn and popularity of Pueblo Revival Style in the 1930s, the Painted Desert Inn was redesigned. Well-known for the Southwestern influence of his designs, National Park Service architect Lyle Bennett created a new look for the inn.<br /> <br /> Bennett first started as a ranger in 1927, but moved on to use his degree in fine art to become one of the best and most sought-after architects in the National Park Service. He was considered a master of the Pueblo Revival Style. More of his work can be seen at White Sands and Bandelier National Monuments and Mesa Verde National Park. The workers that made his plans a reality were the men of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC).<br /> <br /> In the 1930s, men were finding relief from the Depression through the CCC. They built roads, buildings, trails and bridges in many national parks and other federal and state areas, including Petrified Forest National Monument. Throughout the country, the men of the CCC have left their mark on many historic structures.<br /> <br /> The CCC used ponderosa pine and aspen poles cut from nearby Arizona forests for roofing beams and smaller crossbeams (savinos). Light fixtures were hand-made from punched tin, and wooden tables and chairs were given American Indian designs. The beautiful skylight panels were hand-painted by the CCC workers, designs of prehistoric pottery. Concrete floors were etched and painted with patterns based on Navajo blanket designs.<br />  <br /> <strong>Open for Business</strong><br /> The fine work of the CCC gave the Painted Desert Inn new life. The inn reopened for business of July 4, 1940, under the management of Edward McGrath for Standard Concessions. The Painted Desert Inn supplied Route 66 travelers with meals, souvenirs, and lodging. It was popular with local residents as a place for meetings and special events.<br /> <br /> The good times ended with the beginning of the United States’ involvement in World War II. The CCC was disbanded as most of the young men went to war. Travel was curtailed by wartime rationing. The inn closed in October 1942, reopening five years later under new management.<br />  <br /> <strong>The Fred Harvey Company</strong><br /> The Painted Desert Inn reopened in the late 1940s under the renowned Fred Harvey Company, a business with important ties to Southwest, railroad, and tourism history. Fred Harvey started his company as a partnership with the Santa Fe Railroad in 1876. His facilities for travelers were well known for comfort and quality. The company’s architect and interior designer, Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter, arrived in December of 1947. She was already noted for her innovative Southwestern concepts when she came to the Painted Desert Inn. Along with renovations and repair, Colter created a new color scheme. She ordered new plate glass windows placed in strategic walls of the Inn to take advantage of the magnificent view.<br /> <br /> Fred Kabotie, a renowned Hopi artist, was hired to paint murals on the dining room and lunchroom walls. The scenes are glimpses into Hopi culture: the Buffalo Dance, a trek to a sacred salt lake, planting time, and Tawa—the Hopi sun god. The sun face was also the logo of the Fred Harvey Company. Kabotie had previously worked for the company at the Grand Canyon and other locations.<br /> <br /> Colter was not the only woman that made history with the Fred Harvey Company. Frustrated by rowdy male employees, the Fred Harvey Company recruited women from towns and cities in the East and Midwest to serve customers. These young ladies had to be of good moral character, have at least an eighth grade education, display good manners and be neat and articulate. Their contract stipulated that they could not marry and must abide by all company rules during the term of employment. If hired, the women were given a rail pass to get to their place of employment, a smart uniform, good wages, and room and board. Since their beginning in the 1880s, the Harvey Girls have become American legends. The Harvey Girls of the Painted Desert Inn, from the late 1940s and through the 1950s, still have local ties.<br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <strong>Preserving Our Legacy</strong><br /> Thanks to the concern and support of the public, Painted Desert Inn remains a testament to the historic legacy of Petrified Forest National Park. Although its history is intriguing, the building is difficult to maintain. Cracks form in many of the walls. Window and door frames swell and skew. Water damage and cracks threaten the beautiful Kabotie murals. The seam of bentonite clay beneath the foundation of the inn continues to cause structural problems.<br /> <br /> Severe structural damage to the inn forced the Fred Harvey Company to move to the newly completed visitor center complex in 1963. The inn’s doors closed while debate over demolition versus preservation went on for many years. The park set aside funds and scheduled demolition of the building for 1975. Due to a public campaign to save the Painted Desert Inn, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and reopened on a limited basis as the Bicentennial Travel Center. Because of its fine examples of Pueblo Revival Style design by Bennett, historic work by the CCC, touches by Mary Colter, and Kabotie’s murals, the Painted Desert Inn became a National Historic Landmark in 1987.<br /> <br /> During the most recent work between 2004 and 2006, “modernizing” some of the structural elements in the building will help postpone damage—thirteen “floating” roofs, joint-less pipes in the walls, and re-laid flagstones to help with drainage. Even while bringing the structure into the present, the park is trying to maintain the historical integrity of the building and attempting to present the inn as it was in its heyday during the late 1940s into the 1950s. These rehabilitation projects have continued to preserve the inn for future generations to enjoy, thanks to generous public support.<br /> <br /> The inn continues to inspire and charm visitors. It is opened year round with shorter hours than the rest of the park. During the summer there is an ice cream parlor downstairs harking back to its past service.",

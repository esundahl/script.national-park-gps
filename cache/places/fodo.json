    "audioDescription": "Driving into the parking area, handicapped parking is available near the building. Concrete sidewalks and brick walkways lead to a two-story white frame, double-porched hotel. The walkways and porch are lined with native flowers and plants, some indicative of 19th century gardens. The structure has three chimneys. One chimney on the north end is the original limestone rock. The limestone foundation is original as well. The hotel sits within feet of the Cumberland River. One picnic table sits under an American elm just adjacent to the first-floor porch. The hotel was built sometime between 1851-1853, and has three levels: an upstairs (now used by the National Park Service), the first floor (an interpretive area with exhibits and 19th-century reproduction furnishings), and a basement (which is largely used by the Park Service as storage). Exhibits describe the personalities and commanders of the 1862 Campaign, as well as the events of the surrender. A short film may be viewed and limited seating is available for visitors. There is ample space for wheelchairs to navigate the exhibit area. The audiovisual film is also available online.",

Forrest's cavalry, launched an attack on the Union line held by Brigadier General John A. McClernand near this location. This road was known at that time as Forge Road because it led to Randolph Forge.<br /> <br /> Soldiers with both the 26th Mississippi and 26th Tennessee infantries, later joined by other regiments, were successful in pushing General McClernand's Division from its position. Soldiers with the 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th, 18th, 20th, 30th, and 41st Illinois Infantries fought valiantly to hold their positions, before they were exhausted and scattered, needing ammunition to continue the fight. <br /> <br /> For a brief time, Forge Road was open, which would have allowed a way of escape for Confederates.  By nightfall, after more than six hours of continuous battle, the Confederates were ordered to return to their original positions. The way of escape was now closed, as Union forces moved to reoccupy the area once more.<br /> <br /> The Texas Monument was placed in this location in 1963 to honor of the Texas troops who fought at Fort Donelson.  ",

One field cannon sits under an oak tree. Earthworks line the park road, ending at Main Street (to your right near the parking area). The area has a manicured lawn. A small, wood-framed church sits across the street from this location. In the distance from this tour stop, you can see another brick church, private homes, and a city municipal water tower.",

    "bodyText": "The fortification was constructed from logs and earth with picks and axes, creating walls that reached ten feet tall. Confederate soldiers and enslaved African Americans began working on the fort in the summer of 1861 and it was completed by the end of that year. In addition, all the trees surrounding the 15-acre fort were cut, with the treetops sharpened, to form an <em>abatis</em>. This <em>abatis</em> was an additional obstruction for the enemy.<br /> <br /> The fort was built for the defense of the artillery batteries on the Cumberland River.  ",
    "audioDescription": "The parking area for this tour stop is located to the right of the park road, just inside the rock columns. From here, you can see the earthen fort as it appears as a grass-covered mound. A few trees grow from the fort wall. As you drive further into the fort, field cannons are placed inside the wall at three locations as you continue the drive to tour stop #3. The entire area and park road sits along a ridge, which encircles a large hollow or \"bowl.\" Turkey, coyotes, deer and bald eagles and other wildlife may be seen seasonally within this area.",

    "bodyText": "The Quilt Tour is a self-guided auto tour of the colorful, painted quilt blocks in Stewart County, Tennessee. One of the blocks is featured on the side of the Mission-66 Visitor Center within Fort Donelson NB. Many of the other 90 quilt blocks are found on businesses, churches, and private homes.  It took nearly five years for a few volunteers and history enthusiasts to create and hang these beautiful pieces of art. <br /> <br /> The quilt trail was inspired by local artist Carolyn Walter Darke, who owned her own archtectural rendering business in Atlanta, and returned to her hometown. She was inspired by her own family's story, which was intertwined in the battle of Fort Donelson. More research led Darke and fellow art lover Betsy Tumelson to highight how Americans remembered the Civil War, how quilts commemorate the veterans who served, and how art and history unite to tell a story.<br /> <br /> Quilting is one of the oldest forms of American folk art. In the 19th century, women and young girls knew how to piece quilt blocks. Quilts were not really artwork, they were utilitarian, offering comfort and warmth for families. As the war began, quilts were taken by Confederate soldiers to training camps. Quilting provided a way to support the war effort too. Groups of women made quilts to raffle off as fundraisers or sewed soldier's cot quilts to cover coffins of deceased veterans (one may be found in the historic Dover Hotel). Newspaper journalists and sketch artists recorded the stories and images of thousands of Confederate soldiers, now prisoners-of-war at Fort Donelson, who wrapped themselves in homemade quilts and blankets to await their trip to Northern prisons.<br /> <br /> This auto tour consists of four separate driving tours. Some of the tour can take you approximately 25 -miles outside of the city of Dover. Plan for at least three-four hours to view all blocks. Don't be disappointed if some quilt blocks have been moved; it's entirely a voluntary agreement to display the quilt block for the visiting public.  <br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/964736f6-13de-49b9-bba1-26ea2cfbefc5?branding=NONE\">NPGallery Asset Detail (nps.gov)</a><br />  ",

This was a training camp for volunteers: they were mustered into Confederate regiments at this site, practiced their drills, and worked on the construction of the fort.<br /> <br /> According to post-battle accounts, the huts were burned after the battle.<br /> <br /> Weathering and erosion impacted the fortification since the Civil War.

The fort walls were built on top of the ridges surrounding this hollow. One reproduction log hut can be seen (and you may go inside) just adjacent to the parking area. It is believed that Confederates built winter huts similar to this during the winter of 1861-1862. Two wayside exhibits are accessed from this location: one in front of the log hut, and the other near a field gun across the park road. The walls of the fortification have eroded in the years after the 1862 battle. Signage directs visitors to stay off the fort walls to preserve the cultural resource. The walls have been sodded with grass and a few trees grow from the wall too.",

This tour stop is called the Union camp, because it was captured after General Smith's counterattack earlier in the day (Tour Stop #5).<br /> <br /> Many of General Buckner's men, the soldiers with the 18th Tennessee, the 2nd Kentucky, and the 14th Mississippi infantries, struggled throughout the afternoon on February 15th to try and dislodge the Union forces from their newly-acquired position in the former Confederate rifle pits. By nightfall, soldiers on both side collapsed, cold, exhausted, and hungry. Both armies roughly ended up in the same battlefield positions from which they began fighting earlier that same morning. The Confederates had captured some pieces of artillery, weapons, and military supplies, but this wasn't what this breakout attempt had been all about.<br /> <br /> Confederates now formed a new line, their final defense on the wooded ridge, across the park road, behind you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

The lower battery features several 32-lb cannons and one smoothbore Columbiad.  <br /> <br /> Rivers were strategically important for both armies. The Confederates chose this site to protect not only the waterway, but their supply base located in Nashville, TN.  <br /> <br /> At this location, Confederate gunners exchanged fire with Union sailors aboard the <em>City Series</em> fleet of ironclad gunboats on February 14, 1862. If you walk in front of the gun battery emplacement at the Lower Gun Battery, you will find interpretive signs explaining the ironclads and a War Department plaque which describes the battle. Wayside intepretive exhibits are also located on the observation deck.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "This historic area has both gun emplacements and cannons at two locations: the lower gun battery and the upper gun battery. The lower battery consists of seven 32-lb cannons and one columbiad. Two 32-lb cannons are resting on the grass near the park roadway. The upper gun battery has three guns, two 32-lb carronades and one rifled columbiad. Today, these features are separated by a parking area and limestone rock wall. The Cumberland River has been impounded by dams, thus it appears differently than it would have in 1862. The area across from this artillery battery is managed by the US Corps of Engineers. Depending on the season, you may see migratory waterfowl, duck blinds, flooded waters, or you may see crops such as soybeans or corn. The description of this area reflects the flow of the Cumberland River. The river flows north at this point; therefore, you pass by the Upper Gun battery first, and drive a little further, and you arrive at the Lower Gun battery. The Upper Gun battery can only be reached by trail. The trail is steep. The Lower Gun battery has an observation deck and one sidewalk. Exhibits may be found at both locations. Exhibits are also located on the observation deck. Walking around the gun emplacements at the Lower Gun battery, you will find interpretive exhibits and a War Department plaque which tell the story of the ironclad gunboats and 1862 battle.",

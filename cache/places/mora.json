A cloud on the summit may appear harmless from this perspective, but it is probably lashing climbers with an intense, localized blizzard. At other times the pattern may be reversed: halfway up the mountain, climbers may be emerging from dense mist into a glittering world of sunlit ice. <br /> <br /> If the mountain is temporarily hidden from this overlook, then you have simply become part of its stormy dynamics. Mount Rainier not only creates its own world of weather, but dictates the habitats around it: the dripping moss of the Carbon River rainforest, the massive glaciers, and the rain-shadow that leaves the Sunrise area to the east much drier than the rest of the park. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> This close to Puget Sound and the Pacific, Mount Rainier is a magnet for moisture-laden storm fronts. With its huge mass and elevation, the mountain forces the air to rise steeply. As it rises, it cools and percipitates heavily, often in record-breaking snowfalls on the slopes around Paradise. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single photo of a glaciated mountain peak rising above forested lower slopes fills the exhibit panel. The top of the mountain is wrapped in smooth lenticular clouds. The text forms a row across the top third of the panel. A quote in the bottom right corner of the panel reads: \"The weather on Rainier can reach a severity equal to that of the highest mountain in the world... Jim Whittaker, former Rainier guide and first American to climb Mount Everest\". A small box in the lower left corner of the panel reads \"User Fee Project. Your Fee Dollars at Work. Entrance fees were used to produce this exhibit\".<br /> <br /> <strong>Visit This Exhibit Panel</strong><br /> The Backbone Ridge exhibit panel is located at the Backbone Ridge pullout and picnic area, approximately 6 miles west of Stevens Canyon Entrance along Stevens Canyon Road.

It is a spandrel arch bridge 160 feet long and about 41 feet wide with a veneer of native granite. The lower Box Canyon Overlook provides an excellent view of the bridge, looking northwest towards Mount Rainier. From the bridge, look down 180 feet below at the Muddy Fork of the Cowlitz River rushing through the narrow slot canyon.<br /> <br /> About 100 feet west of the Box Canyon Bridge, Stevens Canyon Road passes through the <strong>Box Canyon Tunnel</strong>. The tunnel is 160 feet long. Unlike the other two tunnels found in the park (one further west along Stevens Canyon Road and one on SR123), this tunnel does not have portals covered with masonry and the tunnel walls are bare rock. The tunnel clearance is 12 feet, 6 inches. The <strong>Box Canyon Picnic Area</strong> is located to the west of the tunnel.<br /> <br /> The main <strong>Box Canyon parking area and comfort station</strong> is located east of the bridge. A short, paved path leads down to the overlook.<br /> <br /> The <strong>Box Canyon Loop Trail</strong> is 0.5 miles long and paved. Starting from the east side of Box Canyon Bridge, the trail follows the edge of the canyon northwest towards Mount Rainier, crosses the canyon over a wood footbridge, then follows the other side of the canyon back to Stevens Canyon Road. The western side of the trail does have some steps. Rounded, exposed bedrock borders the trail on the east side of the canyon. Look for fine striations or scratches across the rock’s surface left behind by the movement of past glaciers that once filled this canyon.<br /> <br /> <b>Hiking</b><br /> The Box Canyon Loop Trail connects to the <strong>Wonderland Trail</strong>, which crosses the road over the top of the Stevens Canyon Road tunnel if heading northwest, or climbs towards <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/indian-bar.htm\">Indian Bar</a> if heading northeast.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Carbon Glacier has the lowest terminus of any glacier in the contiguous United States at 3,617 feet. By area, it is the third largest glacier on Mount Rainier. Furthermore, it has the largest volume of any glacier on the mountain, a product of its unusual thickness. While most glaciers on the mountain have advanced and then retreated a mile or more, Carbon Glacier exposed only a half mile of deglaciated terrain between 1760 and 1966. This behavior and its thickness are the result of two factors. First, the glacier is well shaded because it is located on the north side of the mountain and surrounded by steep valley walls. Second, the lower end of the glacier is well insulated by rock covering. Both factors reduce melt rates.</p> <p>During one episode in the last major ice age, Carbon Glacier probably flowed into the Puget Sound and merged with the Puget lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Carbon Glacier</strong>: You can see the glacier from several vantage points along the Carbon River trail. From the park entrance at Carbon River, hike or bike along the Carbon River Road (former road closed to vehicles) to Ipsut Creek Campground. Bicycles are not allowed past the campground. From the campground, walk approximately 3.5 miles (5.5 km) to see the glacier terminus. Continue up the trail an additional 3 miles (5 km) to Moraine Park for an impressive view of the upper glacier.<br />  </p> <p><strong>Carbon Glacier Statistics as of 2021 (<a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/687937\">Beason et al., 2023</a>): </strong></p> <ul> <li>Aerial Extent: 2.752 ± 0.146 square miles (7.127 ± 0.378 km2) (Rank: 3 of 29 glaciers on Mount Rainier) </li> <li>Highest Elevation (Head): 12,212 feet (3,722 m) </li> <li>Lowest Elevation (Terminus): 3,617 feet (1,102 m) </li> <li>Elevation Range: 8,594 feet (2,620 m) </li> <li>Length: 5.02 miles (8.08 km) </li> <li>Average Slope: 20.22° </li> <li>Average Flow Direction (direction the glacier flows towards): North (353°)  </li> <li>Glacier Type: C - Cirque Glacier, or Glacier Head Starts Below Summit </li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Season: Year-Round</b><i></i><br /> <strong>NOTE:</strong> Visitors to the Carbon River area should be prepared to navigate around road and trail washouts and expect to encounter normal hazards, including downed trees, snow, and changing weather conditions. <br /> <br /> Because of its low elevation of 1,900 feet, the Carbon River area is an excellent place to explore year-round! Nestled in the remote northwest area of the park, the Carbon River area is one of the less visited destinations within the park. Since its construction in the 1920s, the Carbon River Road was repeatedly washed out by flooding. After extensive damage from the 2006 Flood, the Carbon River Road was permantely closed to vehicles starting at the park entrance and converted into a trail. <br /> <br /> The <strong>Carbon River Ranger Station</strong> is located in a remodeled historic farmhouse approximately two miles outside of the Carbon River Entrance and 5.5 miles east of the Mowich Lake (SR165) junction. Its location is strategic-- in an area prone to washouts and floods, the ranger station is far enough away from the river that it is not in danger of destruction. Hours can vary depending on the season. Talk with a ranger, pick up a map, or register for a backcountry permit. There are digital information displays inside the ranger station so visitors can learn more about the history of the area. There are no public facilities at the ranger station, but restrooms and picnic tables can be found at the Carbon River Entrance, just a few miles down the road. <br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking & Bicycling</strong><br /> There are a variety of recreation opportunities at Carbon River, whether you want to take a short walk to stretch your legs or go for a bike ride. Bicycles are allowed only on the <strong>Carbon River Trail</strong> (former road) to Ipsut Creek Campground. Several hiking trails begin from along the former road, including the popular day-hiking destinations of <strong>Chenuis Falls</strong> and <strong>Green Lake</strong>. Bike racks are available at all trailheads. Backpackers can continue past Ipsut Creek to connect to the Wonderland Trail or to view the Carbon Glacier. Trail bridges often wash out during the fall and winter. Always check conditions before proceeding.<br /> <br /> Carbon River does not provide direct driving access to any other area of the park. <strong>Mowich Lake</strong> is located nearby via State Route 165. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Carbon River Ranger Station is a two story wooden building with a pitched roof. The outside is green with brown trim, with windows all along its walls. When you enter, a large desk sits at the far side of the wall. There are computers for rangers to work at, as well as informational material, like maps and brochures. To the right there are a few kiosks with iPads that provide interpretive information about the Carbon River area. From the Carbon River Ranger Station, continue along the two-lane road to the Carbon River Entrance. The road has been washed out before the entrance, requiring visitors to park along the edge of the road and hike into the main entrance area via a temporary trail. The temporary trail is on the right side of the former road, while the Carbon River flows along the road to the left. Be alert for drop offs and unstable ground along the edge of the river. At the entrance are several inaccessible parking spots. To the left of the road is an old ranger station now closed for use and separate restroom facilities still in use. To the right of the road are several picnic tables, in a grassy area surrounded by a low, split-rail fence, and an information kiosk. To the left of the kiosk is the start of the Carbon River Rainforest Trail. Or, you can continue hiking or bicycling straight along the road past the main entrance area to a metal gate and the start of the Carbon River Trail. There are paths to go around the gate on either side. Shortly after the gate, the road transitions from paved to gravel and dirt. Sections of the road may be washed out, have larger rocks, and fallen trees are common.",

Most rainforests occur in tropical areas around the equator. They are steamy jungles full of hanging vines where colorful birds and chattering monkeys live in the forest canopy. Temperate rainforests are very different. They occur in cooler climates, usually nestled between the ocean and coastal mountain ranges. Only a few can be found inland, like the rainforest here at Mount Rainier. Temperate rainforests are dominated by evergreen conifers carpeted with an abundance of mosses and ferns. Here, more animals live on the forest floor than in the forest canopy, including black bear, long- and short-tailed weasel, black-tailed deer, bobcat, and coyote.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text stretches across the top third of the exhibit panel against a solid green background. The bottom third of the panel features a row of three photos with detail views of different types of tree bark.

The road has been washed out before the entrance, requiring visitors to park along the edge of the road and hike into the main entrance area via a temporary trail. The temporary trail is on the right side of the former road, while the Carbon River flows along the road to the left. Be alert for drop offs and unstable ground along the edge of the river. At the entrance are several inaccessible parking spots. To the left of the road is an old ranger station now closed for use and separate restroom facilities still in use. To the right of the road are several picnic tables, in a grassy area surrounded by a low, split-rail fence, and an information kiosk. To the left of the kiosk is the start of the Carbon River Rainforest Trail. The Carbon River Rainforest Trail was originally a loop trail but the bridge on the far side of the loop was destroyed so the trail is split into two prongs. Exhibit panels are located along both halves of the trail. The trail is dirt with stretches of wood boardwalk. The boardwalk may be slippery, uneven, and in poor condition. The trail is surrounded by dense mossy temperate rainforest, numerous fallen trees, and thick vegetation, which can encroach on the trail. Fallen trees have also damaged and blocked some sections of the trail and destroyed some of the exhibit panels. Exhibit Panel Description The main text of the exhibit panel stretches across the top third of the panel against a solid green background. The bottom two thirds of the panel is filled with a photo of a forest canopy with interlocking tree branches against a pale sky. In the upper left corner of the photo against a black band, a caption reads: \"The crowns of the tall trees overlap, forming the upper canopy and shielding the rest of the rainforest from wind and rain, like an umbrella. Some of the moisture from the fog and rain remains trapped beneath this green ceiling.\" On the right side of the exhibit panel, two smaller photos overlap each other and the background photo at slight angles. The top photo shows a small bird with a dark grey back and head with white on the cheeks, throat, and sides floating on still water. The second small photo, located beneath the first small photo, shows a similar bird nesting on a moss-covered tree branch. The secondary text is to the left of the small photos. A small box in the lower left corner of the panel reads \"User Fee Project. Your Fee Dollars at Work. Entrance fees were used to produce this exhibit\".",

    "bodyText": "<h4>Title: Usual Forecast: Rainy Conditions</h4> <p><strong>Main Text</strong><br /> The Carbon River Valley provides the right conditions for a temperate rainforest. Surrounded by mountains high enough to trap rainfall coming from the Puget Sound and low enough for mild temperatures, it receives about 70 to 90 inches of rain per year. Most of the rain falls in one long wet season during winter and spring. Summers are fairly dry, with fog providing most of the moisture.<br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> During the long rainy season, water falls on the tree canopy, trickles to the understory, and seeps into the ground. It then fills rivers, which return water to the ocean. Some of the moisture received by the temperate rainforests is returned to the atmosphere through evaporation. Moist air rises, forms clouds, and falls again as rain in an ongoing process. Big rainforest trees can store a large amount of water, which helps them get through the dry summer season. A single Douglas-fir can hold as much as 5,000 gallons of water.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single photo fills the exhibit panel, fading towards the top into a solid green background.

Because their skin must stay moist, these amphibians need water or wet surfaces to survive. They also need water to reproduce. The Pacific tree frog breeds in temporary pools of water, wetlands, and ponds, where there are fewer predators. The tailed frog breeds in fast-flowing streams, laying eggs on long, bead-like strings attached to the undersides of rocks.<br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> In the spring, the distinct \"rib-bit\" of the Pacific tree frog can be heard above the ever-present sound of dripping and rushing water. Sticky toe pads allow this frog to climb nearly-vertical surfaces as it hunts spiders and insects.<br /> <br /> The Pacific giant salamander is the largest terrestrial salamander in North America, growing up to 14 inches long. It lays eggs in hidden underwater chambers in the gravel of a spring, stream, or mountain lake. When frightened, it makes a barking sound like a dog.<br /> <br /> June Creek provides habitat for trout. Its undercut banks and overhanging plants, and the tangled branches of fallen trees, provide cover from predators.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A photo of a small bright green frog perched on a wet log fills the entire frame of the exhibit panel, with the main text on the left side.

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Season: Summer Only </b><i>(May - October)</i><br /> The Carter Falls Trailhead can be reached year-round along the road to Paradise, with access down to the Nisqually River. However the log bridge over the river to reach the main trail often washes out during the fall and winter.  <br /> <br /> Carter Falls is a horsetail-shaped waterfall about 50 feet tall. It was named in honor of Harry Carter, builder of much of the trail between Longmire and Paradise. Carter Falls can be viewed 1.1 miles up-river from the Cougar Rock Campground on the Wonderland Trail. Cross the Nisqually River below the campground and follow the trail toward Paradise. Continue past Carter Falls about 100 yards to view Madcap Falls, a short waterfall cascading down about 34 feet. For a longer hike, the Wonderland Trail continues to climb towards Narada Falls and eventually connects to Reflection Lakes or Paradise. Or, instead of crossing the Nisqually River, head southwest from the Carter Falls trailhead along the Wonderland Trail to reach Longmire.<br /> <br /> The Carter Falls trailhead also provides easy access to the Nisqually River. Explore the wide, rocky braided riverbed and stop to enjoy lunch next to the river. There is an excellent view of Mount Rainier from the riverbed. A log footbridge crossing the Nisqually River can wash out during the fall or winter. Check conditions before proceeding. Pets are not allowed on trails or along the Nisqually River. Parking can be limited at this popular trailhead.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The trailhead starts from the Paradise Road across from the Cougar Rock Campground. A large paved pullout on the east (uphill) side of the road provides parking, with a wayside exhibit panel in a metal frame on the north side of the pullout. The dirt trail descends steeply down log steps from the pullout down to the Nisqually riverbed, which is wide and rocky. The trail weaves around large rocks and boulders with sections of trail that are loose and sandy to cross the riverbed. The trail crosses the Nisqually River using a single log footbridge with a railing on one side only. Across the river, the trail climbs up the Paradise River valley through forest to reach an overlook with views of Carter Falls. The trail is dirt, broken by sections of rocks and rougher terrain.",

    "audioDescription": "The Chenuis Falls Trailhead is located on the Carbon River Trail. The Carbon River Trail is former unpaved, unmaintained road that is closed to public vehicles. The trailhead is on the left side of the road. The road winds through an old-growth forest in the northwest corner of the park. At the trailhead, there is a sign saying \"Chenuis Falls Trailhead\" and a bike rack for cyclist to use for locking their bikes. The trailhead is located right next to the Carbon River, which can cut into the bank creating a crumbling edge. Wayside Panel Description A single photo of a wide, rocky river bed with a muddy river braiding around gravel bars fills the wayside panel. The wayside text forms a column in the left third of the panel. On the right towards the top of the panel, a second smaller photo overlaps the background photo. The smaller photo is an aerial view of a long, narrow glacier curving through a valley. A caption above the photo reads: \"The source of the Carbon River is the meltwater that flows fromt the terminus of the Carbon Glacier. A small box in the lower right corner of the panel reads \"User Fee Project. Your Fee Dollars at Work. Entrance fees were used to produce this exhibit\".",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Season: Summer Only </b><i>(June - November)</i><br /> SR410 is open to vehicles during the summer season only, typically late May-November.  <br /> <br /> The Chinook Entrance Arch spans the width of the Mather Memorial Parkway (SR 410) at the 5,432 feet Chinook Pass on the eastern boundary of the park. The arch was designed as both an entrance portal and an equestrian overpass, to convey hikers and riders on the Pacific Crest Trail. Designed in the NPS Rustic Architecture style using natural materials, the arch is 90 feet long and the deck of the \"bridge\" rests on two cedar logs, 36 inches in diameter. Two more logs, 30 inches in diameter, serve as guardwalls. The stone abutments are masonry, consisting of irregular, mostly five-sided stones gathered from the roadsides. Built in 1936 by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the rustic-style arch became deteriorated by the elements and nearly eight decades of use, prompting Mount Rainier National Park to undertake a massive <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/photosmultimedia/chinook-entrance-arch.htm\">restoration project</a> to preserve this historic structure in 2011 and 2012.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> The Chinook Entrance Arch is located near Tipsoo Lake. The area experiences heavy snowfall in winter, with snow lingering well into June or even July. A network of easy trails, suitable for all ages, leads through the subalpine meadows and around the lake. <strong>Naches Peak Loop Trail</strong> is a popular hike. Starting from Tipsoo Lake, the 3.4 mi (5.5 km) trail connects to the Pacific Crest Trail on the eastern edge of the park, crosses over the Chinook Entrance Arch, then returns to Tipsoo Lake. This trail features superb wildflower displays in midsummer, huckleberries in early fall, and brilliant autumn colors. Note that while <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">pets</a> are allowed on the Pacific Crest Trail, they are not permitted on the portion of the loop trail within the park or around Tipsoo Lake. Swimming or wading is not permitted in the lake. Please <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/meadow-preservation.htm\">stay on the trails</a> at all times to avoid damaging the delicate meadow plants. Picnic tables are available near the parking area.<br /> <br /> Tipsoo Lake can experience heavy visitation and parking can be limited. Plan ahead with an alternate destination in mind or come early or late in the day or on a weekday to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/congestion.htm\">avoid congestion</a>.<br /> <br /> Please note that <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/management/lawsandpolicies.htm\">launching, landing, or operating an unmanned aircraft (drone) is prohibited</a> in Mount Rainier National Park (36 CFR 1.5 (a)(1) Superintendent's Compendium). </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Tipsoo Lake is a small alpine lake set into a glacier-carved bowl surrounded by rocky mountain peaks. Subalpine meadows ring the lake, with patchy forest on the surrounding slopes. Traveling east along SR410, the main parking area for Tipsoo Lake forms a horseshoe shape on the left side of the highway. Continuing past the parking area, the highway climbs in a loop around the lake before passing under the Chinook Entrance Arch at Chinook Pass. The entrance arch is not a true arch, but a foot bridge built out of large cedar logs set into stone abutments on either side of the road. The entrance arch marks the park boundary and serves as a crossing for the Pacific Crest Trail which travels north-south along the mountain range. Additional parking is available along the north side of the highway within the park, with a small pull off halfway between the main parking area and the arch providing access to the south side of the lake. The main parking area has two pit toilets located in the center of the horseshoe shape with picnic tables and an information bulletin board located at the top of the horseshoe. The main trail starts next to the bulletin board but quickly splits into several trails weaving through the subalpine meadows around the lake. One trail skirts the edge of the lake. The Naches Peak Loop Trail climbs up the mountain slope to the north, connecting to the Pacific Crest Trail which crosses over the highway using the arch. Trails on the south side of the lake connect to the smaller pull off then cross the highway to reach a secondary smaller lake and the other end of the Naches Peak Loop Trail. Trails are often very narrow, with limited room to pass, and bordered by thick meadow vegetation. Small footbridges cross streams and marshy areas that feed into the lakes in several locations.",

The falls are formed by Van Trump Creek, which passes north to south through the site, eventually flowing into the Nisqually River. To help preserve the outstanding scenery of the falls, this site was designed utilizing natural principles, intended to harmonize a man-made bridge in a natural environment. The waterfall is named for Christine Van Trump, daughter of P.B. Van Trump, one of the first climbers of Mount Rainier. </p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Columbia Crest is the name of the summit of Mount Rainier and the Columbia Crest Glacier occupies the summit crater. This name was suggested by H.E. Holmes of the E.S. Ingraham climbing party of 1891. The party spent two nights on the summit and before leaving jointly chose the name for it. It was believed at the time that the summit was the highest point in the United States. It was called Crater Peak by Hazard Stevens and PB Van Trump, who climbed the mountain in 1870. A report published in the Seattle Telegraph July 28, 1894, notes that Frank W. Hawkins named it Columbia Crest while he was a member of Ingraham's July 18, 1894, climb of the peak.</p> <p>Though most ice in the summit region flows to large glaciers below, some is confined to the crater at the mountain's summit. Distinct from other glaciers on Mount Rainier, the Columbia Crest Glacier is situated in and between the east and west rims of the volcano, which restricts outward flow.</p> <p>The crater, produced by volcanic eruptions, is a depression into which snow falls and is converted to ice. Since the crater tilts to the east, some ice and meltwater does flow into the Cowlitz-Ingraham watershed. However, much of the ice loss is caused by high ground temperatures that melt the ice, producing a maze of steam-riddled snow caverns.</p> <p>Climbers have often taken refuge from storms by descending into the caves from entrances along the crater rim. Geologist Eugene Kiver and Martin Mumma mapped over a mile (1.2 km) of passageways and found a network of tunnels at slopes of 30 to 40 degrees. Geologist Paul Kennard used radar to determine the thickness of the glacier and found it to be about 200 feet (60 m) thick.</p> <p><strong>Viewing the Columbia Crest Glacier</strong>: Because of its location, access to the Columbia Crest Glacier is limited to experienced climbers. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/climbing.htm\">Learn more about climbing at Mount Rainier</a>.</p> <p><strong>Columbia Crest Statistics as of 2021 (<a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/687937\">Beason et al., 2023</a>):</strong></p> <ul> <li>Aerial Extent: 0.067 ± 0.005 square miles (0.172 ± 0.012 km2) (Rank: 27 of 29 glaciers on Mount Rainier)</li> <li>Highest Elevation (Head): 14,393 feet (4,387 m)</li> <li>Lowest Elevation (Terminus): 14,146 feet (4,312 m)</li> <li>Elevation Range: 248 feet (76 m)</li> <li>Length: 0.43 miles (0.68 km)</li> <li>Average Slope: 9.99°</li> <li>Average Flow Direction (direction the glacier flows towards): East (96°)</li> <li>Glacier Type: S - Glacier Head Near Summit</li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Season: Summer Only </b><i>(June - October)</i><br /> The Comet Falls Trailhead can be reached year-round along the road to Paradise, but this trail can be very hazardous in winter with icy drop-offs and avalanche danger.  <br /> <br /> Plunging 320 feet, Comet Falls is one of the highest waterfalls in the park and a popular destination for many hikers. The trailhead is located four miles east of Longmire on the road to Paradise. Parking space is limited and often fills quickly. There is no additional parking nearby, so have an alternate hike in mind. The trail can be treacherous in spring, with ice and snow lingering well into June or July.  <br /> <br /> For 1.8 miles the dirt trail climbs steadily uphill, with sections of log steps. Just before reaching Comet Falls, the trail passes by Van Trump Falls, a tiered waterfall. Continue to reach the base of Comet Falls. Many hikers then return the same route back to the trailhead, but for a longer hike, the trail continues to Van Trump Park. Van Trump Park honors P. B. Van Trump who, with Hazard Stevens, was one of the first people to stand on the summit of Mount Rainier.<br /> <br /> From Comet Falls the trail switchbacks 0.8 miles uphill to the junction with the Rampart Ridge Trail, which connects to the Wonderland Trail and Longmire. Approximately half a mile along the Rampart Ridge Trail is a 0.5-mile spur trail that climbs to Mildred Point. From the junction, a trail to Van Trump Park is to the right, climbing through subalpine meadows until the maintained trail ends in 0.5 miles. There is 900 feet of elevation gain to reach Comet Falls, and 2000 feet of total elevation gain to reach Van Trump Park. From Van Trump Park, Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens are visible to the south while the Kautz and Van Trump Glaciers dominate views of Mount Rainier to the north. Look for marmots, pikas, and goats on rocky open slopes.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Comet Falls and Van Trump Park trail is steep and strenuous, with numerous sections of log steps and rocks. The trail is dirt, and often icy or snow-covered well into summer. There are sections of steep drop-offs, particularly around Comet Falls. The Comet Falls parking lot is a half-circle shaped, paved pullout on the left, or downhill, side of the road as you head towards Paradise. The trail starts from the right side of the pullout, with a trail information board next to the trailhead.",

This picnic area accommodates a wide variety of needs by providing <strong>over 30 tables with at least one grill for every two tables</strong>. Many of the tables are within 20 feet of the parking lot, while others are more secluded and require a short walk on maintained paths through the trees. There are individual tables that can comfortably seat up to six people as well as areas of clustered tables to accommodate larger groups. The designated wheelchair accessible tables, restrooms, and parking are located near the far end of the picnic area from the Paradise Road. The accessible picnic area with two tables is on the left and the accessible restroom is on the right, each with their own designated accessible parking spaces. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3e57d947-26d4-4357-876e-382ba06edb26}{57}\" paraid=\"1729389234\">The Cougar Rock Picnic Area and its campground counterpart are both one of many additions to the park from the Mission 66 program. Mission 66 provided a massive influx of funding for development and maintenance to the national parks. Mount Rainier National Park was at the forefront of this program, serving as the first national park to have a Mission 66 development plan. Part of this plan was to provide more accommodations for daytime use and relocate overnight camping out of sensitive meadow areas, resulting in a proposal for 1,200 new camp and picnic sites in the park. Originally, one of these proposed areas would be at Klickitat Creek on the east side of the park, but officials chose Cougar Rock instead. Both the campground and the picnic area were completed in 1961. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3e57d947-26d4-4357-876e-382ba06edb26}{61}\" paraid=\"1871109469\">As you enjoy a picnic here, please be mindful of your impact to the landscape, wildlife, and other visitors. Trash cans are located near each of the restrooms for you to clean up and dispose of all waste. Never feed any wildlife or leave food unattended to avoid wild animals getting food that could make them sick or cause them to act aggressively. Please empty wastewater in sinks and deposit any solid food waste into trash cans. Potable water is located at each of the restrooms. While there are grills throughout the picnic area, open fires are not allowed outside of the grills, and you must follow any fire restrictions in place. Pets must be on a leash, not more than six feet (1.8 meters) in length or in a crate/cage at all times. Pets are allowed along the road and paved sidewalks and may join you at your picnic at tables. <strong>Pets are not allowed on any trails</strong> in Mount Rainier National Park. There are many small, maintained paths to get to and between picnic tables. Stay within the established pathways to reduce impact on the forest floor. If you choose to play music, please be aware of volume out of respect for other visitors and wildlife.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Cowlitz and Ingraham are two glaciers that share a common terminus on the southeast slope of Mount Rainier. Separated by a rocky ridge named Cathedral Rock, the two glaciers merge at the 6,700 foot (2,200 meter) elevation to create a single stream of ice that flows down into the Middle Fork Cowlitz River valley. Below the ridge, a ribbon of rocky debris called a medial moraine produces a dark streak in the middle of the glacier. Further down the glacier are a series of concentric debris-covered ridges called ogives.</p> <p>More than 35,000 years ago, the ancestral Cowlitz Glacier merged with several other glaciers to become a single stream of ice that flowed nearly 62 miles (100 km) from the mountain's summit. By the end of the Little Ice Age, a little over a 100 years ago, the glacier had retreated to within 5.9 miles (9.5 km) of the summit. By 1994, the longest segment of the glacier was less than 4.4 miles (7 km) long.</p> <p>Cowlitz is the name of many geographical features in the State of Washington including those within Mount Rainier National Park. The Cowlitz people are one of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/historyculture/associated-tribes-of-mount-rainier.htm\">associated tribes</a> of Mount Rainier. The name appears in print as early as the Lewis and Clark journals of 1805 where it was written as 'Cowliskee.' The word is said to mean '...capturing the medicine spirit.' Locations named Cowlitz begin on the Cowlitz Glacier on the southeast side of Mount Rainier and continue in the Cowlitz River, which flows south into Cowlitz County.</p> <p>Ingraham Glacier was named by Professor I.C. Russell in 1896 for Edward Sturgis Ingraham of Seattle, an early mountaineer. He climbed Mount Rainier eleven times often serving as a guide.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Cowlitz and Ingraham Glaciers: </strong>These glaciers can be viewed from the top of Panorama Point or from along the Skyline Trail in the Paradise Area. Alternatively, a pullout at Backbone Ridge along Stevens Canyon Road provides views of the south-facing slopes of Mount Rainier, with the Cowlitz, Ingraham, and Paradise Glaciers visible.</p> <p><strong>Cowlitz Glacier Statistics as of 2021 (<a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/687937\">Beason et al., 2023</a>):</strong></p> <ul> <li>Aerial Extent: 1.423 ± 0.077 square miles (3.685 ± 0.200 km2) (Rank: 7 of 29 of glaciers on Mount Rainier)</li> <li>Highest Elevation (Head): 11,137 feet (3,395 m)</li> <li>Lowest Elevation (Terminus): 5,232 feet (1,595 m)</li> <li>Elevation Range: 5,906 feet (1,800 m)</li> <li>Length: 3.48 miles (5.59 km)</li> <li>Average Slope: 23.18°</li> <li>Average Flow Direction (direction the glacier flows towards): East southeast (121°)</li> <li>Glacier Type: C - Cirque Glacier, or Glacier Head Starts Below Summit</li> </ul> <p><strong>Ingraham Glacier Statistics as of 2021 (<a href=\"irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/687937\">Beason et al., 2023</a>):</strong></p> <ul> <li>Aerial Extent: 1.144 ± 0.063 square miles (2.962 ± 0.162 km2) (Rank: 11 of 29)</li> <li>Highest Elevation (Head): 14,064 feet (4,287 m)</li> <li>Lowest Elevation (Terminus): 6,493 feet (1,979 m)</li> <li>Elevation Range: 7,572 feet (2,308 m)</li> <li>Length: 3.22 miles (5.18 km)</li> <li>Average Slope: 25.17°</li> <li>Average Flow Direction (direction the glacier flows towards): East southeast (120°)</li> <li>Glacier Type: S - Glacier Head Near Summit</li> </ul>",

If entering Longmire from the Nisqually Entrance, drive past the National Park Inn, and turn right at the two-story building with the flagpole. Continue straight through the employee housing area and across the historic Longmire Suspension Bridge over the Nisqually River. The trailhead is located 300 feet past the suspension bridge. There is a small pullout for parking near the trailhead or continue a short distance down the road to park in front of the Longmire Community Building.<br /> <br /> Eagle Peak Trail is 7.2 miles roundtrip with 2,955 feet of elevation gain. For the first two miles the trail ascends steeply through dense forest to a small stream, then continues another mile to a meadow. Beyond the meadow the trail is much steeper and rocky as it climbs the final 0.5 mile to the 5,700 feet saddle where the trail ends. Use extreme caution when you reach the saddle. This area is exposed and a fall could be deadly. Snow can also linger well into June, with dangerous snow cornices possibly hiding the edges of the cliffs.<br /> <br /> This peak was originally known as Sim-layshe, a Native American word for eagle. When the Longmire family settled nearby, George Longmire anglicized the name to Eagle Peak. From the Eagle Peak Saddle look north for views of Mount Rainier and the buildings in the Paradise Area. Look south for panoramic views of the Nisqually River Valley and surrounding Cascade Range, with Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams in the distance. Subalpine meadows along the trail on the final approach to the saddle can have excellent wildflower displays in summer, with peak bloom typically in late July/early August.<br /> <br /> While Longmire is open year-round, snow can make this trail hazardous in winter.

Instead of the smooth sweep of the Emmons Glacier from the summit down to the valley floor, the northeast face of the volcano would have been broken up with craggy buttresses and ridges, much as the other sides of the volcano appear today. However, 5,600 years ago the summit and northeast flank of Mount Rainier collapsed in a gigantic avalanche during an eruption, forming a fast-moving slurry ofmud and debris called the Osceola Mudflow, which washed up as high as the present site of the Sunrise Visitor Center. You may remember seeing some of the loose Osceola sediment in the hillside road cuts as you drove up the road. The eruption that created the Osceola Mudflow left a large horseshoe-shaped crater in the northeast flank of the volcano, much like the crater left on the north flank of Mount St. Helens after the 1980 eruption. The enormous Osceola Mudflow had a total volume of about a cubic mile. The mudflow filled the valleys of theWhite River system to depths of 300 feet or more and flowed more than sixty miles to the Puget Sound. Carolyn Driedger, with the United States Geologic Survey:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Mount Rainier has an east-west fracture zone across its summit and that’s where magma has risen in the past and as it has risen in there it has baked the surrounding rocks... The surrounding rocks were bathed in a weakly acidic solution of sulfuric acid and that actually transformed the chemistry of the rocks, transforming the rocks from a hard rock to a soft clay... The fact that it was hydrothermally altered made the slide much more extensive than it would have been otherwise, and it slid much further down valley. Most of the hydrothermally altered rock on the east side of Mount Rainier was carried down in that mighty Osceola mudflow. The west side of the mountain and the summit still contain a fair amount of hydrothermally altered rock and that creates a hazard for people who live on the Puyallup river valley on the west side of the volcano because the rock remains and will fall someday.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Subsequent lava eruptions filled-in the horseshoe-shaped crater left by the Osceola mudflow, forming the smooth summit cone of the volcano that you see today. Glaciers reformed on the peak, but have not yet had time to carve the volcano into the craggy forms visible on other sides of the mountain. Instead, the expanse of the Emmons Glacier smoothly wraps around the northeast side of Mount Rainier.<br /> <br /> A <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/emmons-vista-overlook-1-wayside.htm\">wayside exhibit panel</a> provides additional information about Mount Rainier.

Can you see the terminus of the glacier? It's almost hidden beneath rocks and debris, so it can be hard to spot. In 1963, a rockfall from Little Tahoma Peak covered the lower glacier with debris, which continues to insulate the ice from melting. As a result of decreased melting, the glacier advanced rapidly in the mid-1960s and repeatedly in the following decades. <br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> A glacier advances when more snow accumulates than is lost. Snow compresses to ice, and debris collects on the glacier. When the terminus and the sides of the glacier recede due to melting, they leave behind piles of rubble called terminal and lateral moraines. <br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> A single photo of Mount Rainier and the White River Valley fills the bottom two thirds of the exhibit panel, with the text stretching across the top third against a green background. From the summit, the Emmons Glacier descends the mountain, filling the whole width of the valley, before ending in a rock-covered terminus where a river emerges. A large bank of rubble on the right side of the valley is labeled \"lateral moraine\", while a hummock of debris downstream from the terminus is labeled \"terminal moraine\". A large rocky peak on the left flank of the mountain, above the Emmons Glacier, is labeled \"Little Tahoma\". A smaller image overlays the right side of the photo. It shows a side-profile graphic of a glacier on a mountain slope, with a dotted white line marking a point halfway down the glacier. The section above the dotted line (uphill side) is labeled \"accumulation zone\", while the section below the line (downhill side) is labeled \"ablation (melting) zone\". A lateral moraine, terminus, and terminal moraine are also labeled on the graphic. Text above the graphic reads: \"Climate affects the health of glaciers. If the right conditions exist - a period of cooling and/or increased precipitation - glaciers will advance.\" A small box in the lower left corner of the panel reads \"User Fee Project.

The trail starts from the left side of the parking lot as you look towards the Sunrise Visitor Center where you may also pick up a trail map.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunrise Road Geology – Emmons Vista Overlook 2</b><br /> In front of you is the Emmons Glacier. It covers 4.3 square miles and is the largest glacier by area not only on Mount Rainier but also in the contiguous United States. The present terminus of the Emmons Glacier is not where the white snow and ice ends, but rather is where the river becomes visible emerging from the dark colored, rock-covered ice front. From here you can see the uppermost Winthrop Glacier, which flows northward from the triangular-shaped Steamboat Prow to form the headwaters of the West Fork of the White River. Carolyn Driedger, U.S. Geologic Survey:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>“Much of the appearance of the glacier that we see today has been determined by an event that happened in 1963... Rock fell off Little Tahoma peak on the left side of the glacier, rolled down onto the surface, completely covered the lower glacier, and came part way down the valley... Because of that 1963 rock fall that brought so much rock onto the lower portion of the Emmons glacier, the Emmons glacier has a lot more rock on it, a lot more rock within it, and so the moraines here are a little bit higher than they might have been otherwise.”</em></p> <p>Moraines are piles of rock, sand, and silt left behind by glaciers as they carve the landscape. There are several different types of moraines visible from the Emmons overlooks. The terminal moraine forms at the end, or terminus, of the glacier where rocks and other materials picked up by the glacier during times of glacier advance are left behind when the glacier ice melts away, or retreats. Lateral moraines accumulate similarly along the sides of glaciers. A few hundred years ago, the Emmons Glacier extended much farther down the White River Valley than it does today. As it melted and retreated up valley, it left terminal and lateral moraines that you can see below. The small milky-green ponds visible at the bottom of the valley are formed from melt water from ice that broke off from the retreating glacier and was left behind in the core of older terminal moraines. The large, steep lateral moraines skirting the edges of the White River valley were actually left by Little Ice Age glaciers 200–500 years ago. Carolyn Driedger:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>“I like to say to people that the Mount Rainier your grandparents see is a little bit different from what you will see and what your grandchildren will see because we have rock fall and changes in the glaciers and sometimes we have volcanic eruptions.”</em></p> <p>These modern-day moraines will eventually erode away or perhaps be buried by lavas or other volcanic deposits from Mount Rainier, just like the moraine layers left behind by ancestral glaciers. Future volcanic eruptions and lahars will reshape the mountain and its surrounding valleys. For thousands of years, the mountain has been built up and torn down by volcanic forces, and sculpted and molded by glaciers. These processes leave a mark, and the evidence is visible on a grand scale throughout Mount Rainier National Park.<br /> <br /> A <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/emmons-vista-overlook-2-wayside.htm\">wayside exhibit panel</a> provides additional information about Mount Rainier. Continue along the trail for additional views of the White River Valley and the subalpine meadows of Sunrise or return the way you came to get back to the parking lot. Exhibits in the Sunrise Visitor Center further explore the dramatic geology of Mount Rainier and the Sunrise area.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h4><b>Title: Moving Mountains</b></h4> <p><b>Main Text</b><br /> About 5,600 years ago, the entire summit and northeast face of Mount Rainier fell away suddenly in a massive landslide accompanied by volcanic explosions. Called the Osceola Mudflow, it was the largest mudflow originating from Mount Rainier in the last 10,000 years. <br /> <br /> The towering wall of mud and rock thundered down the valley at up to 50 miles per hour, temporarily filling the White River Valley with up to 600 feet of rock, clay, water, and ice. As the mudflow left the mountains, it spread out to form the Enumclaw Plain and plunged into Puget Sound. <br /> <br /> The Osceola Mudflow destroyed the top of Mount Rainier, lowering it by as much as 1,000 feet. Since that time, at least five immense landslides have sent massive mudflows down Mount Rainier, while eruptions of lava quickly filled the huge crater left by the Osceola collapse. <br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> Powerful mudflows have swept down Mount Rainier repeatedly, perhaps without warning. Because of the hazard surrounding communities face from catastrophic mudflows, scientists have ranked Mount Rainier the most hazardous volcano in the lower 48 states. <br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> A single photo of Mount Rainier and the White River Valley fills the exhibit panel, with the text stretching across the top third of the photo. From the summit, the Emmons Glacier descends the mountain, filling the whole width of the valley. A small photo overlays the background photo on the left side under the main text, showing a graphic of the volcano summit. The summit and left side of the volcano in the graphic has collapsed into a mudflow. Text above the graphic reads: \"This image illustrates how Mount Rainier would likely have appeared after the Osceola Mudflow.\" On the right side of the panel is a small map showing Mount Rainier and the surrounding region. A brown shape labeled \"Osceola Mudflow area\" covers an area that flows from the northeast side of the mountain, curving around the north side of the mountain to the west before spreading out around the towns of Enumclaw and Buckley before flowing through the towns of Puyallup, Sumner, Pacific, Auburn, and Kent to reach Puget Sound. Text under the map reads: \"The Osceola Mudflow covered about 212 square miles of Puget Sound lowland, extending at least as far as the Seattle suburb of Kent and the Port of Tacoma.\" A small box in the lower right corner of the panel reads \"User Fee Project. Your Fee Dollars at Work.

Park in the day hiking and climbing parking area. Do not park in a campsite or block any campsites. Parking is limited and can fill early on sunny summer days. Have an alternate destination in mind. There is a restroom and water fountain located near the day parking area. The trail begins in the D loop of the campground. The White River Road to access the campground is open to vehicles during the summer only.<br /> <br /> This route was once an old mining road which was rehabilitated for trail use. Although an effort was made to mine copper ore in this area in the late 1800s, nothing of commercial value was ever extracted and mining efforts were eventually suspended. The trail follows the White River for 3.5 miles. One mile beyond the trailhead is a junction with the <strong>Emmons Moraine Trail</strong>. This one-mile round-trip spur trail leads to a viewpoint which overlooks the Emmons Glacier, the largest glacier in the 48 contiguous United States. At first the ascent is gradual but becomes steeper on the final section before entering <strong>Glacier Basin</strong>. A climber's track continues past Glacier Basin camp, passing through an area of fragile wetland plants to the base of the Inter Glacier. A trail also connects the Glacier Basin Trail to Sunrise via the Burroughs Mountain Trail. From Glacier Basin, look for mountain goats on the surrounding slopes and climbers ascending the Inter Glacier to Steamboat Prow. Please stay on the trail to protect the vegetation. Always check current trail conditions before heading out. Log footbridges frequently wash out during the winter or other conditions could be affecting the trail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wilderness Camping</strong><br /> Campsites at Glacier Basin are popular with climbers who are beginning their ascent of Mount Rainier. The sites are located in the trees as one approaches the open meadows of the basin. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/wilderness-permit.htm\">Wilderness permits</a> are required for camping. Permits and current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, visitor centers and on our web site. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails. Treat water before drinking.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The White River Campground parking area is on the left side of the road as you enter the campground. Walk along the paved campground road to reach the trailhead on the far end of D loop. A bulletin board with additional trail information is on the right side of the trailhead.

The Grove of the Patriarchs Trail will remain closed until the bridge can be replaced, which will first require a series of environmental evaluations and engineering work to reevaluate the bridge design. During the closure, the Grove of the Patriarchs parking lot and restrooms have normal seasonal access, along with the Eastside and Silver Falls Trails. Construction to replace the bridge is scheduled to begin summer 2027. Summers represent the only viable construction season in the park due to the heavy snow that blankets the park from roughly November through May.<br /> <br /> The Grove of the Patriarchs is a wonderland of old growth trees and a bustling forest floor. Wander through trails boardwalks, bridges, and dirt paths while winding through centuries old trees. This trail is a destination for thousands of hikers each year. The Grove of the Patriarchs is a 1.1-mile round-trip, self-guided nature trail.  <br /> <br /> It begins at the Grove of the Patriarchs trailhead, just inside the park boundary beyond the Stevens Canyon Entrance. There is a parking lot and restrooms at the trailhead. Hike through the forest, and reach a short suspension bridge, connecting the trail to a small island in the middle of the Ohanapecosh River to a small loop on the island, consisting of boardwalks and dirt trail. Here, you can see the large old-growth Douglas-fir, silver fir, hemlock, and Western red cedar trees. Not to be overshadowed by the large trees, lush undergrowth can be found near the forest floor. Waysides line the trail giving visitors information on the area. Dogs are not permitted on this trail.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /><br /> Several trails connect to this trailhead. The <b>Eastside Trail</b> is accessed at the junction just before the suspension bridge crossing the Ohanapecosh River. Hikers can also access the <b>Silver Falls Trail </b>by crossing Stevens Canyon Road to the Eastside Trail Trailhead and continue 0.5 mile to meet up with the Silver Falls Trail. Continue another 1.2 miles to reach the Ohanapecosh Campground.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The trailhead is located just off Stevens Canyon Road from 123. There is a small parking area for visitors. Restrooms are available here. The trail begins to the right of the restrooms, with a large trailhead sign. The trail itself is usually packed dirt with roots and rocks. The trail is wide in most areas. There is a suspension bridge across the Ohanapecosh River, leading to a loop trail on an island in the middle of the river. The trail from here is a mix of packed dirt and wooden boardwalks.",

Built in 1918, the lodge mirrored the Paradise Inn's rustic design, with a steeply pitched roof for shedding snow and shingle siding with log facade. It overlooked the Paradise Valley and the Tatoosh Range and provided a commanding view of Mount Rainier. <br /> <br /> Services offered here were an economical alternative to meals and accommodations at the nearby Paradise Inn. The lodge was demolished in the mid-1950's to make way for additional parking. <br /> <br /> In 2006, prior to construction of the visitor center, archeologists explored this site for remains of the lodge. Along with sections of the original building's foundation they found flooring and structural basement components, plus articles left behind by early visitors and employees including ski pole baskets, glass, dinnerware, a partially full whiskey bottle, and other personal items. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Marking History: Four pieces of the original foundation mark the corners of the lodge in the landscaping before you. On either side of you, in the plaza surface, rock continues the outline with the remaining outline buried beneath the visitor center behind you. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The whole exhibit panel is filled with a single historic, sepia-tinted photo of the Paradise Camp Lodge.

Overlaying the background photo, the main text stretches across the top third of the panel on the left side, with the secondary text on the right side. Just below the secondary text is a small diagram map showing the rectangular outline of the current Henry M. Jackson Visitor Center. An outline of the Paradise Camp Lodge footprint overlaps the visitor center footprint on the left side at a diagonal. The four corners of the lodge footprint not obscured by the visitor center are marked by red dots. Below the diagram, text reads: \"Diagram of the footprint of the new visitor center overlying the footprint of the former Paradise Camp Lodge Building.\" On the left side of the panel under the main text, a second small photo shows three people excavating a trench in a construction area.

    "bodyText": "<h4>Title: A Road With a View</h4> <p><br /> <strong>Main Text</strong><br /> Historic Sunrise Road, completed in 1929, represents a unique approach to road and site planning. Part of Mount Rainier's master plan, its state-of-the-art design took advantage of the scenery and protected the landscape. Built by several road contractors, the road displays their craftmanship in its rustic, natural stone guardrails, handsome bridges and scenic turnouts. Designed by a National Park Service Landscape Architect, the road runs along a canyon rim to avoid cutting through fragile meadows. Its long, easy curves provide unobstructed views of the Emmons Glacier and the surrounding scenery.<br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Mount Rainier's master plan was the first National Park Service master plan to be developed, and it greatly influenced those of other parks. More than 100 miles of roads, including the Sunrise Road, were part of this plan. The entire road was designed to fit with the landscape before workers struck a single blade on the ground.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single historic photo of a road under construction stretches across the width of the exhibit panel. A rock wall supports the right side of the road and curved viewpoint, while the left side of the area is filled with piles of debris and several old-fashioned dump trucks with beds raised up to dump material. In the distance, a glaciated mountain peak rises up above the construction site. The main text stretches across the top fourth of the photo. On the right side of the exhibit panel, a slightly-angled inset black-and-white photo shows a row of workers with shovels shaping a hillside and ditch next to a dirt road. A caption under the photo reads \"To heal the scars caused by road construction, the Civilian Conservation Corps planted native vegetation.\" A small box in the lower right corner of the panel reads \"User Fee Project. Your Fee Dollars at Work.

The panel looks west over Sunrise Point towards Mount Rainier. Sunrise Road is open to vehicles during the summer, typically from early July to September. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Sunrise Point is perched on the terminus of a lava ridge that radiates out from the east side of Mount Rainier. The Sunrise Road ascends east along the southern flank of the ridge, before turning in a sharp hairpin shape to travel west along the top of the ridge back towards Mount Rainier. There is a small, paved parking lot in the center of the road hairpin, bordered by low rock walls. Sidewalks with stone curbs wrap around the outside of the road along the edge of the overlook. Low rock walls around the overlook are interspersed with crenelations in a triangle shape that roughly mimic the surrounding mountain peaks. On the eastern side of the overlook the sidewalks lead up to a slight rise framed by low rock walls. The Historic Sunrise Road exhibit panel, on the west side overlooks Sunrise Point road and parking area. In the center of the rise is a bench constructed of massive rock slabs. A trail descends the ridge to the east. Exhibit panels are also attached to the rock walls on the southern and northern sides of the overlook. Views to the south include Mount Adams and the White River Valley, while to the north Mount Baker can be glimpsed on clear days. Look down from the north side of the point to view Sunrise Lake surrounded by trees.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Huckleberry Creek Patrol Cabin was erected circa 1934. Located north of Sunrise near the park's northern boundary, Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) labor may have been used in hauling materials and constructing the ranger cabin. Between 1933 and 1934, the CCC built a cabin in the Carbon River District at the mouth of Ipsut Creek. They were also probably involved in the construction of the Three Lakes Patrol Cabin in 1934.</p> <p>The Huckleberry Creek cabin measures 13 feet 8 inches by 21 feet 10 inches and was built similarly to the \"Standard Plan for Patrol Cabins\" designed by the NPS Western Division, Branch of Plans and Design. The major difference between the Huckleberry Creek cabin and the standard plan is the full-length open porch extending across its front facade. Containing simply a dirt floor, the porch measures 7 feet by 21 feet 10 inches.</p> <p>A plan to construct ranger cabins and trail shelters around the mountain evolved during the brief superintendency of Roger W. Toll (1919-1920.) This plan was carried out between 1922 and 1934 largely during the administration of Superintendent Major O.A. Tomlinson. Acting Chief Architect W. G. Carnes executed the design of the 1930’s standard patrol cabin plan.</p>",

It is located at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/indian-henrys-hunting-ground.htm\">Indian Henry's Hunting Ground</a> on the edge of a subalpine meadow at an elevation of 5300 feet. The meadows of Indian Henry's Hunting Ground were visited often by the Nisqually and Cowlitz tribes in the mid-19th century. A mountain guide named Indian Henry, or Soo-Too-Lick, hunted a great deal in the meadow that bear his name. From there he guided James Longmire and other explorers in their search for routes through the Cascades.  </p> <p>By the turn of the century, tourist visitation to Indian Henry's had increased. This resulted in the construction of a tent \"hotel\" known as Wigwam Camp. Built in 1908 by George Hall and Sue Longmire, the camp was the third tourist facility established in the park after the Longmire Hotel and Reese’s Camp of the Clouds at Paradise. However, the camp was abandoned in 1918 as were other plans for developing tourist facilities at Indian Henry’s. Nevertheless, there was still a need for the presence of backcountry patrols which resulted in the construction in 1915-16 of a ranger station at Indian Henry’s.  </p> <p>Major alterations to the cabin occurred between 1970-79, when the rear shed was removed, a new front porch constructed, new base logs installed, roof re-shingled, new window frames and doors installed, and the log and wood post foundation was replaced with stone infill and concrete piers. The cabin is elevated off the ground which allows for ventilation during spring snow melt that deters log deterioration.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Season: Year-Round </strong></p> <p>Built in 1933 by the National Park Service and similar in design to patrol cabins at Huckleberry Creek, Lake James, and Three Lakes, this cabin was constructed from plans drawn up by the NPS Branch of Plans and Design in San Francisco, under the supervision of Acting Chief Architect W.G. Carnes.</p> <p>Constructed during the administration of Superintendent O.A. Tomlinson (1923-41) for use as a backcountry patrol facility, this cabin was a component of the early park policy to develop a string of shelters and cabins around the park to accommodate backcountry rangers on patrol and provide shelter for the hiking public.</p> <p>This cabin is located in the Ipsut Creek Campground, five miles from the Carbon River Entrance, a quarter mile off the Wonderland trail. The Carbon River entrance is open year-round; however, the road can be impacted by snow, fallen trees, and other winter hazards.</p>",

The road crosses the former Kautz Creek immediately to the west of the parking lot. The creek jumped to a new channel in the floods of 2006 and now crosses the road to the east of the parking lot. Restroom facilities (vault toilets), picnic tables, and a short interpretive trail leading to an overlook of the mountain are available at Kautz. The trail is also an access point for the 97-mile round-the-mountain Wonderland Trail, Indian Henrys, and Devils Dream backcountry camp. A wilderness camping permit is required for overnight stays in the backcountry.<br /> <br /> The interpretive trail tells of the influence of dynamic glacier-covered Mount Rainier on the landscape at Kautz. Follow the trail to learn about how mudflows and floods have scarred the area, and how vegetation heals the scar after each major event. Staying on trails allows forests to recover naturally. This forest will continue to recover until the next disturbance occurs. The boardwalk is approximately 0.10-mile-long, 5.5 feet wide, and starts by crossing the road at the crosswalk. It has a flat surface with two sloped sections.<br /> <br /> When visiting this area be aware that debris flows, and glacial outburst floods can occur at any time and without warning, eroding stream banks and scouring everything in their path, including rocks and trees. If an earthquake occurs or you hear a prolonged rumbling, move quickly uphill, at least 100 feet above the riverbed.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The approach to Kautz from either direction is through old-growth forest that towers over the road. Upon arrival towering old-growth trees give way to younger, smaller trees and an expanse of sky is revealed. The parking area is on the south side of the road with parking on the west end of the lot, restrooms on the south edge in the center of the lot, and picnic tables at the east end. A crosswalk across the parking lot from the restrooms leads to a short boardwalk. Approximately 80 feet from the boardwalk trailhead, a dirt trail on the east side of trail leads to the park backcountry. The boardwalk continues on to an overlook of Mount Rainier. Five wayside exhibits on the boardwalk and one at the overlook related the history of mudflows in the area. The overlook is approximately 100 feet long by 16 feet wide and has a hardened natural surface. Much of the area is lined by benches. When not hidden by clouds, Mount Rainier can be seen up the original riverbed to the east. Across from the end of the boardwalk, large rocks, approximately 1.5 to 2 feet high on average, line the edge of the riverbed. Caution should be used near the edge of the riverbed to prevent falling.",

The photo set on the left reads: \"Look for the western hemlock with its droopy limbs and flat needles, small cones, and a rough, scaly bark.\" The photo set in the middle reads: \"Alder's have leaves with teeth-like edges and smooth bark, often partially covered with lichens.\" The photo set on the right reads: \"You can identify the Douglas-fir by its pointed, bottle brush-arranges needles, and deeply ridged bark.\"",

Today only a small clear stream flows here. Kautz Creek has moved.<br /> <br /> In early November 2006, record rainfall caused debris flows in several areas of the park. Just upstream from here, one of these flows rerouted Kautz Creek. Coming to a stop at a high and narrow point in the creek bed, the debris flow dammed the creek. Diverted by this barrier, the rain-swollen creek carved a new course to the east through the forest.<br /> <br /> Do the changes at Kautz Creek hint at the future of Mount Rainier's landscape? Since 2001, park scientists have recorded an increased number of debris flows from small, south-facing glaciers. Scientists suggest this increase may be linked to climate change- when changing weather patterns cause glaciers to melt, debris flows become more common. As climate change reconfigures the glaciers and restructures weather patterns, the landscape of Mount Rainier will continue to be reshaped.</p> <p><strong>Secondary Text</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><em>\"Glacier-generated debris flows at Mount Rainier travel downstream at speeds of 10 to 20 miles per hour or more... These flows typically have steep, bouldery snouts-- up to 30 to 60 feet high in the most constricted parts of a stream valley-- followed by a churning mass of mud, rock, and vegetation. Their deafening noise is often accompanied by strong local wind, thick dust clouds, and violent ground shaking.\"</em><br /> - Joseph Walder and Carolyn Driedger, United States Geologic Survey (USGS)</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> The exhibit panel has a green background, with the main text in a column on the left third of the panel. Below the main text, a small aerial photo shows a creek flowing into a forest instead of through its original wide, gravel creek bed. A caption below the photo reads: \"The original creek bed is the wide, treeless area to the right. Unable to continue flowing in its bed because of a debris flow, the creek rerouted and flowed through the forest, disappearing into the trees.\" A larger photo fills up the right two-thirds of the exhibit panel, with the secondary text above it. The photo shows a large creek flowing along a rocky bed in a forest. Logs in a fence-like structure shore up one edge of the creek bed. A caption in the lower right corner of the photo reads: \"Kautz Creek before the flood and rechanneling.\" A secondary caption below the photo reads: \"Kautz Creek is made up of glacial melt water. The stream flowing here today is created by surface runoff- snowmelt and rain.\"<br /> <br /> <b>Visit This Exhibit Panel</b><br /> From the Kautz Creek parking lot, cross the road to the Kautz Creek Nature Trail. Kautz Creek, open year-round, is located three miles east of the Nisqually Entrance in the southwest corner of the park along the road to Longmire.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The approach to Kautz from either direction is through old-growth forest that towers over the road. Upon arrival towering old-growth trees give way to younger, smaller trees and an expanse of sky is revealed. The parking area is on the south side of the road with parking on the west end of the lot, restrooms on the south edge in the center of the lot, and picnic tables at the east end. A crosswalk across the parking lot from the restrooms leads to a short boardwalk. Approximately 80 feet from the boardwalk trailhead, a dirt trail on the east side of trail leads to the park backcountry. The boardwalk continues on to an overlook of Mount Rainier. Five wayside exhibits on the boardwalk and one at the overlook related the history of mudflows in the area. The overlook is approximately 100 feet long by 16 feet wide and has a hardened natural surface. Much of the area is lined by benches. When not hidden by clouds, Mount Rainier can be seen up the original riverbed to the east. Across from the end of the boardwalk, large rocks, approximately 1.5 to 2 feet high on average, line the edge of the riverbed. Caution should be used near the edge of the riverbed to prevent falling.

    "bodyText": "<p>Kautz Glacier is located immediately west of Nisqually Glacier on the mountain's southwestern flank. It is long and fairly narrow as it leads from the top of Mount Rainier to its snout at Mildred Point.</p> <p>On July 8, 1857, Wapowety of the Nisqually people, led a group of soldiers out of Fort Steilacoom bound for the summit of Mount Rainier. Over the course of eight days the party, consisting of Wapowety, Augustine V. Kautz, Dr. O. R. Craig and four other soldiers, made their way up the Nisqually River Valley to an elevation near 6,000 feet. There they set up camp in preparation for a summit attempt.</p> <p>The next morning the party set out for the summit. They made their way up the ridge now known as Wapowety Cleaver and then onto the ice of the Kautz Glacier. One by one the party began to falter due to a mix of snow blindness, fatigue, and altitude issues. Finally, at approximately 6:00 pm, the last team members turned around somewhere near 12,000 feet.</p> <p>In Kautz’s words, “Finally we reached what may be called the top, for although there were points higher yet, the mountain spread out comparatively flat and it was much easier to get along... It was after 6 o’clock and the ice was forming in my canteen and to stay on the mountain at such a temperature was to freeze to death as we brought no blankets with us.”</p> <p>While that party did not reach the summit first, that honor goes to P.B. Van Trump and Hazard B. Stevens, they climbed fairly high on the volcano and have features on Mount Rainier named after them.</p> <p>Although the Kautz Glacier is one of the smallest on the mountain, it is a significant player in the recent geologic history of the park. Twice during the last century the Kautz Glacier was the cause of major debris flows. In October 1947, water abruptly drained from underneath the glacier, ripping away a section of glacier over 1 mile (1.2 km) in length and gouging a 320 feet (100 m) deep canyon into the valley once occupied by the ice. Downstream the water mixed with rock, trees, and other debris to form a fast- moving slurry that flowed across the park road almost 6.2 miles (10 km) away. In August 2001, water bursting from Kautz glacier produced a debris flow that flowed over a ridge and into Van Trump Creek.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Kautz Glacier</strong>: The best views of Kautz Glacier can be found at Mildred Point. To reach the point, take the Comet Falls Trail, which starts from the small parking lot along the Nisqually-Paradise Road just west of Christine Falls. Follow the trail past Comet Falls to reach the junction with the trail to Mildred Point.</p> <p><strong>Kautz Glacier Statistics as of 2021 (<a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/687937\">Beason et al., 2023</a>): </strong></p> <ul> <li>Aerial Extent: 0.603 ± 0.034 square miles (1.561 ± 0.088 km2) (Rank: 16 of 29 glaciers on Mount Rainier) </li> <li>Highest Elevation (Head): 14,131 feet (4,307 m) </li> <li>Lowest Elevation (Terminus): 6,917 feet (2,108 m) </li> <li>Elevation Range: 7,213 feet (2,199 m) </li> <li>Length: 2.59 miles (4.17 km) </li> <li>Average Slope: 29.39° </li> <li>Average Flow Direction (direction the glacier flows towards): South southwest (193°)  </li> <li>Glacier Type: S - Glacier Head Near Summit </li> </ul>",

National Park Inn reservations can be used instead of a timed entry reservation to enter the Paradise Corridor after 1:00 pm the first day of your reservation and at anytime during the remainder of your stay.<br /> <br /> Longmire is located in the southwest corner of Mount Rainier National Park and is 6.5 miles (10.5 km) east of the Nisqually Entrance. Volcanic mineral springs create a rare low elevation meadow surrounded by forest, tucked in a valley between lava ridges. Stumbling across the meadow in the late 1800s, the area around the meadow became James Longmire's homestead. The Longmire family later developed lodging and a mineral springs resort. With the establishment of Mount Rainier National Park in 1899, the Longmire area became the park headquarters. Although park headquarters are no longer at Longmire (current park administration offices are located at Tahoma Woods outside of the park along SR 706), the original 1916 headquarters building houses a museum that tells the story of the early days of the park. Across the street from the museum, the \"newer\" Longmire Administration Building, completed in 1930, still holds offices for park staff and is home to the <strong>Longmire Wilderness Information Center</strong>. Visitors can stay overnight or get a hot meal in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/national-park-inn.htm\">National Park Inn</a> and general store, which was once park of the Longmire's mineral springs resort. Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/longmire.htm\">Longmire</a>.</p> <h4><strong>Hiking</strong></h4> <p>Open year-round, Longmire still serves as a gateway to exploring Mount Rainier. The easy <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/day-hiking-at-mount-rainier.htm\">Trail of the Shadows</a> (0.7 miles) loops around the Longmire Meadow, popular with birds, deer, and other wildlife. Along the trail view bubbling mineral springs and learn about the Longmire family and early park settlers. The Trail of the Shadows is located across the main road from the National Park Inn. The portion of the loop trail closest to the road is dirt and gravel and suitable for wheelchair users with help, including a short spur trail into the meadow with a view of Mount Rainier. The far side of the loop trail is broken by tree roots and and includes a short section of boardwalk. <br /> <br /> Explore Longmire's developed area by following the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/longmire-historic-district-walking-tour.htm\">Longmire Historic District Walking Tour</a>, viewing examples of National Park Service Rustic Architecture, including the picturesque Longmire Administration Building.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/eagle-peak.htm\">Eagle Peak Trail</a> (7 miles roundtrip) is a steep climb through old-growth forest with great views of Mount Rainier, Nisqually Glacier, and the Tatoosh Range. The Eagle Peak trailhead is found across the suspension bridge from Longmire on the east side of Nisqually River. <br /> <br /> Branching off from the Trail of the Shadows, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/rampart-ridge-trail.htm\">Rampart Ridge Trail</a> (4.6 miles roundtrip) climbs up through a forested slope to the top of Rampart Ridge. A viewpoint along the trail looks back down on the Longmire area and the Nisqually River. Follow the ridge to connect to the Wonderland Trail and loop back down to Longmire. <br /> <br /> Longmire is one of the main starting/ending locations for the <strong>Wonderland Trail</strong>, or a waypoint where backpackers can pick up supplies. Day hikers can also use the Wonderland Trail to hike northeast from Longmire to Cougar Rock Campground or northwest towards Rampart Ridge Trail.

    "audioDescription": "The main park road transects the Longmire Area, with the Longmire Meadow and Trail of the Shadows on the left and the developed area on the right. The National Park Inn, a two-story wood building with a wrap around porch, faces the road. A network of paved trails leads to the front of the Inn. Parking is located behind the inn. Next to the inn is a small pull off road that provides access to a historic old-fashioned gas station, now converted into an exhibit, and the public restroom building. Past the inn, turn right to enter the main Longmire area. To the left of the road is the Longmire Administration Building, a large two-story wood and stone building with a small lawn in front and framed by tall trees. Across the road from the Administration building are several smaller wood buildings, housing the Longmire Museum and library. Straight ahead the road continues into the staff housing area, a cluster of small wood buildings, with long wood warehouses clustered around the maintenance area. Continue through the housing and maintenance area to reach the wood Longmire Suspension Bridge, which crosses over the Nisqually River. Continue to follow the road on the other side of the river to reach the Longmire Community Building and the Longmire Volunteer Campground.",

The Rampart Ridge lava flow appears as a forested hillside to the lower left of the mountain.<br /> <br /> The historic Longmire Community Building is visible on the opposite side of the parking area. Closed to the public, the community building served as the social activity center at Longmire for many years. Constructed in 1927, the architect Thomas Vint used materials from inside the park whenever possible to achieve the famous \"NPS rustic\" style of architecture. Standing in front of the Longmire Community Building, you can clearly see how the rock foundations of the historic building match the rounded boulders of the Nisqually River. National Park Service buildings are designed to integrate into the scenery. Keep an eye out for NPS rustic construction elsewhere at Longmire and throughout Mount Rainier National Park.<br /> <br /> The Mount Rainier Valor Memorial is located a 50-foot walk south past the Longmire Community building across the gravel road. This cluster of stone pillars memorializes the park employees who have given their lives to save others at Mount Rainier National Park.<br /> <br /> The Longmire Community Building is still used by federal employees for meetings, lectures, and training classes at Mount Rainier National Park.

Four of these pillars are carved with the names of those who gave their lives to protect others at Mount Rainier National Park. The Longmire Community Building is on the east side of the pavement. This building is made of 3-foot diameter logs stacked on a foundation of large, rounded boulders. There is an accessibility ramp leading to a covered entryway. The Nisqually River and picnic area are on the west side of the pavement. There are ten evenly spaced boulders positioned to prevent vehicles from driving off the pavement towards the river.

The Community Building as the name implies, served as a gathering place for campers. Even today people assemble here for meetings, trainings and social events. <br /> <br /> With its steep-angled roof of cedar, stone chimney, walls of split log and glacial boulders, the structure echoes its mountain setting indoors and out. It is a beautiful example of the rustic style of architecture pioneered at Mount Rainier National Park in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text against a green background fills the top half of the small, vertically-oriented exhibit panel.

Inspired by frontier buildings of the Pacific Northwest, the structures incorporate local materials - massive logs, glacial boulders, and native plant landscaping. <br /> <br /> \"<em>In an area in which the preservation of the beauty of Nature is a primary purpose, always design buildings that are not only attractive to look upon, but also appear to belong to, and be a part of, their settings.</em>\" - Stephen T.

By 1928, the park superintendent was set to demolish it until Chief Naturalist C. Frank Brockman convinced him to save it for a museum. Brockman created the museum exhibits, some of which are still in use today. <br /> <br /> The structure moved to this location in 1978 and serves both as a museum and a historical exhibit in and of itself.

Since time immemorial American Indians have traveled to and from the mountain seasonally to pick huckleberries, hunt, and collect native plants for food and medicinal uses. Prior to the establishment of Mount Rainier National Park in 1899, American Indians used the ridges separating major streams as transportation routes to these resource rich parklands.After Mount Rainier’s designation as a national park, it drew visitors looking for recreational activities. As the park’s popularity grew with white settlers in the area, park architects and engineers designed roads, bridges, and buildings that blended with the natural scenery. This type of architecture became known as National Park Service rustic style. Today, our challenge is to accommodate millions of visitors while continuing to preserve park values and resources.<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 1 Secondary Text</b><br /> The Longmire Service Station, built in 1929 along the edge of wilderness. The building was designed with its natural setting in mind; whole logs frame the front porch and the pumps are mounted on an island of glacial stones.As the few remaining NPS rustic style service stations in the United States are altered to accommodate modern vehicles and machinery, this near-original building is a unique example of early national park architecture.<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 1 Description</b><br /> The main text fills the top left quadrant of the panel against a pale blue background.

Early travelers surmounted these obstacles using foot and horse trails, which eventually led to the sophistication and ease of railroad travel in the early 1900s. The spectacular mountain landscape that justified Mount Rainier’s designation as a national park—and continues to draw visitors—was a hindrance to early motor travel.<br /> <br /> Trails: Trade Routes and Subsistence - For millennia trails led from the lowlands, up the major river valleys, around the lower slopes of Mount Rainier, over the Cascade Mountains to the east, into the Puget Sound region, and south to the Columbia River. The trails were created and used by ancestors of the Nisqually, Cowlitz, Squaxin Island, Yakama, Puyallup, and Muckleshoot tribes for gathering food, hunting, and trade.<br /> <br /> Horse and Wagon Routes: Access to a Mountain Resort - In 1884, James Longmire constructed a rough trail to a series of mineral springs near here. The Longmire family, the first non-native settlers in what is now Mount Rainier National Park, promoted the medicinal values of the mineral springs and by 1889, had developed a primitive resort that led to the present park community of Longmire. In 1893, the family, aided by five Nisqually Indians, opened the first wagon toll road to Longmire Springs.<br /> <br /> Railways: Comfort and Convenience - In 1904, the Tacoma Eastern Railroad completed a rail line to Ashford, six miles west of the park entrance. Visitors traveled by rail from Tacoma, then boarded the waiting horse drawn carriages for the final leg of the journey to the five-year-old Mount Rainier National Park. The railroad also built and operated the National Park Inn at Longmire in 1906. Mount Rainier quickly became an increasingly popular destination.<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 2 Description</b><br /> The text fills the top two-thirds of the panel in two columns against a pale blue background.

Rows of people sit in the wagons. A caption below the photo reads “Horses and wagons at Paradise, 1900s.” Further down the column is a historic map of Mount Rainier filled with numerous faint lines of topographic layers and sketched out trails and roads. A caption below the map reads “A 1907 park map showing long used American Indian trails as well as the planned Nisqually Road”. The bottom third of the panel is filled with a historic sepia-toned photo that fades into the blue background of the rest of the panel at the top. The photo, labeled “Longmire Springs 1904” shows a meadow in a forest with Mount Rainier rising in the background over the forest.

The legislation that created the park “for the benefit and enjoyment of the people” also mandated that the land be retained in its natural condition, protected from “injury and spoliation”.<br /> <br /> A provision for the construction of roads and bridle paths allowed Americans to enjoy the new park, but park officials had to determine how to provide access without marring the spectacular scenery. Park architects and engineers developed a design aesthetic that blended roads and structures with the natural landscape, which was delightfully effective.<br /> <br /> Roads and bridges in the park require regular maintenance. Mount Rainier National Park’s road crews clear the road to Paradise year-round and when spring comes, they begin plowing the snowy roads to White River, Sunrise, Ohanapecosh, and Mowich.<br /> <br /> The Road to Paradise: Ricksecker’s Legacy - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was assignedthe task of constructing a park access road in 1903. A route survey along the Nisqually River to Longmire Springs and Paradise was selected, close to the path of Longmire’s original wagon road, which was determined to be unsuitable due to its proximity to the river. Civilian engineer Eugene Ricksecker envisioned a “pleasure road” and designed gentle grades, graceful curves, and a route that followed the natural contours of the terrain.<br /> <br /> Bridges and Buildings: In Harmony with the Landscape - The parkwide road and bridge system was built between 1920 and 1957, featuring natural materials such as local stone and wood. This became the design standard for the National Park Service known as the National Park Service rustic style of architecture. In 1997, Mount Rainier’s historic developed areas, including roads, bridges, buildings, and the Wonderland Trail, were collectively designated a National Historic Landmark District.<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 3 Description</b><br /> The text fills the top two-thirds of the panel in two columns against a pale blue background. At the top of the right-side column is a small black and white photo of a dirt road under construction. Several vehicles work on the road, including some tractors, while men stand on the side of the road. At the front of the photo is a vehicle that is an early version of a road grader. It is about the size of a standard car with a metal frame without any siding and has a grading blade attached to the underside between the wheels. A person sits towards the back of the vehicle where the steering wheel is attached. A caption below the photo reads “Surfacing the Nisqually Road, 1929. Originally built using picks and shovels, the road was later resurfaced and widened by the Bureau of Public Roads.” Further down the right-side column is a second photo of a historic drawing of an arched stone road bridge over a waterfall.

Several vehicles work on the road, including some tractors, while men stand on the side of the road. At the front of the photo is a vehicle that is an early version of a road grader. It is about the size of a standard car with a metal frame without any siding and has a grading blade attached to the underside between the wheels. A person sits towards the back of the vehicle where the steering wheel is attached. A caption below the photo reads “Surfacing the Nisqually Road, 1929. Originally built using picks and shovels, the road was later resurfaced and widened by the Bureau of Public Roads.” Further down the right-side column is a second photo of a historic drawing of an arched stone road bridge over a waterfall.

Should motor vehicles, which might eventually offer greater access to more Americans, be allowed in national parks? Would their noise, exhaust, and unpredictable drivers spoil the park experience for other visitors? With no easy solution at hand, an experiment was tried in 1907: allowing cars into two national parks on a temporary basis. Mount Rainier, as well as Hot Springs National Park, were chosen for the experiment and the results had a lasting impact throughout America’s national park system.<br /> <br /> Automobiles: An Experiment that Set a Precedent - The decision to experimentally admit automobiles was a response to pressure from Puget Sound area auto clubs and civic boosters for automobile access to the park. The popularity of car travel soon made the automobile policy permanent. Beginning in 1908, drivers were required to register their vehicles, read the automobile regulations, and pay a $5 entrance fee. Within seven years, all national parks were open to vehicle travel.<br /> <br /> The Motor Stage: Camaraderie and Open Roads - A new mode of transportation, the motor stage became available in 1910. Visitors could travel by stage from Tacoma, Seattle, or Ashford to Longmire and Paradise. Sharing the crowded confines of the coaches often created a special camaraderie among passengers. Travel by auto stage declined during the gas and rubber rationing of World War II and by the 1950s had ceased entirely.<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 4 Description</b><br /> The text fills the top two-thirds of the panel in two columns against a pale blue background. Towards the top of the left-side column is an image of a historic map of Mount Rainier National Park. The park border is highlighted in green with roads bolded in red. The roads include the road from Nisqually Entrance to Paradise and Westside Road in the southwest corner of the park, and the road to White River and Sunrise in the northeast corner of the park. Other routes and trails are marked with fainter red lines.

Stylized text on the image reads “Mt Rainier National Park 1939.” A caption reads “A Mount Rainier vehicle pass for the 1939 season\". At the bottom of the right-side column is black and white photo of a vehicle passing under a large log archway on a muddy road. The “archway” consists of three large logs supported by a frame of large logs. A caption under the photo reads “Visitors have long been greeted by various entrance arches throughout the park.” The bottom third of the panel is filled with a historic sepia-toned photo that fades into the blue background of the rest of the panel at the top.

On summer days, the convenience of private car travel has given way to the frustration of congestion: Visitors often find roads crowded and parking lots full. Balancing the continual growth in visitation with the park’s mission to preserve and protect resources invites problem-solving and innovation.<br /> <br /> Climate Change and Environmental Impacts on Transportation - Climate change affects all aspects of society. Flooding due to weather events has caused washouts and road damage.<br /> <br /> On November 6-7, 2006, heavy rains hammered the park, causing the Nisqually River to rise. Subsequent flooding destroyed part of the road to Paradise, caused parkwide damage to campgrounds, including complete destruction of Sunshine Point Campground, and led to the permanent closure of Carbon River Road.<br /> <br /> Aggradation is a continuing concern for many of the roads in the park. Aggradation is a geologic process where riverbeds rise in elevation due to sediment being deposited by flowing water. Since most of Mount Rainier's large rivers and streams are glacially-fed, roads in the park may be in danger of flooding as the global temperature warms and glaciers recede, which increases sediment availability into the system.<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 5 Highlighted Text</b><br /> What kind of experience would you like future visitors to Mount Rainier to have? What can you do now to ensure that future?Overcrowding and pollution combined with the effects of climate change have to potential to cause significant damage to the park’s resources. How do we ensure access for all while protecting those resources?<br /> <br /> <b>Panel 5 Description</b><br /> The text fills the top two-thirds of the panel in two columns against a pale blue background. The highlighted text is in a brown box at the top of the right-side column. Towards the top of the left-side column is a black and white photo of a parking lot filled with cars, surrounded by hillsides covered in patches of meadow and subalpine fir trees. A wood building with a steeply angled roof stands next to the parking lot. A caption below the photo reads “The Paradise area, shown here in 1963, has always been challenged by a shortage of parking. Annual park visitation has grown from an estimated 300 in 1899 to approximately two million. Automobile use has increased at an even greater rate.” Below the black and white photo are two colored photos both showing road damage. The top photo shows a paved road that ends abruptly at a steep bank that is falling into a muddy, raging river. The bottom photo shows a paved road with one edge crumbling off down a steep rocky hillside. The top photo is captioned “The Nisqually Road washed out in the flood of November 2006. Widespread damage caused the park to close for six months.” The bottom photo is captioned “Every area of the park was affected by the 2006 storms. Stevens Canyon Road washed out in three places and required extensive repairs.” The bottom third of the panel is filled with a color photo that fades into the blue background of the rest of the panel at the top.

    "audioDescription": "The main park road transects the Longmire Area, with the Longmire Meadow and Trail of the Shadows on the left and the developed area on the right. The National Park Inn, a two-story wood building with a wraparound porch, faces the road. A network of paved trails leads to the front of the Inn. Parking is located behind the inn. Next to the inn is a small pull off road that provides access to a historic old-fashioned gas service station, a small log building with two historic gas pumps, placed on a raised stone island, in front under a covered portico. The Transportation Exhibit is located inside the service station. The door to the service station is at the front of the building under the portico. The doorway has a slight lip as it transitions from the outside pavement to the interior. Inside, there is a single room with the exhibit panels attached to the log wall directly across from the entrance. The five panels are in a row next to each other with the timeline stretching the width of the room underneath the panels. The timeline panel is attached to an angled surface that sticks out from the wall about 17 inches and is about 28 inches high at the bottom. The text with the dates stretches the length of the panel in several columns. There are windows on the two sides of the building and on either side of the front door. At the front of the building, opposite side from the panels, a wood counter is built into the wall with some empty shelves under the counters.",

The bronze plaque bears the names of the Marines. In the mid 1990s, the road to Round Pass washed out, making the area inaccessible to vehicles.

One of four lookouts remaining in the park, it helped protect the park and surrounding national forests from fire. Located at 7,181 feet in elevation, it is the highest fire lookout in the park.  </p> <p>With their exposed locations, fire lookouts are vulnerable to lightning and windstorms. Shortly after its completion, a windstorm blew off the roof of the Mount Fremont Fire Lookout. </p> <p>This historic lookout was used by firewatchers to spot smoke and lightning strikes and report them by telephone. After World War II, aerial surveillance became the primary mode of fire-spotting. These lookouts, fully equipped for fire detection, are still used occasionally.  </p> <p>The hike along the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/mount-fremont-lookout.htm\">Mount Fremont Lookout Trail</a> starts at 6,400 feet elevation at Sunrise and climbs moderately a short distance to the top of Sourdough Ridge. Follow the Sourdough Ridge trail west to the five-way trail intersection at Frozen Lake. From there, the trail to Mount Fremont traverses the west side of a rocky ridge for another 1.3 miles. There is no camping at or around the lookout. </p> <p>The entire trail from Sunrise to the lookout is through meadowland and over rocky crags. On a clear day hikers can enjoy superb views of Mount Rainier, the Cascade Range, and the Olympic Mountains. North of the lookout lies the spectacular meadows of Grand Park. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Mount Fremont Fire Lookout sits at the northern end of a rocky ridgeline and there is a large pile of dark rocks blocking the view as you approach it from the south along the ridge. This is a popular spot where people sit and take a break and view the lookout from above. The lookout itself is a two-story, dark brown wooden structure that features a 14 foot by 14 foot square room with attached roof and a set of stairs leading up to the catwalk, or wraparound porch. There is a solar panel on the roof facing south and an information panel attached to the outside of the stairs on the west side. The lookout is covered in large windows to offer a clear view of Mount Rainier and the surrounding meadows and mountains. Visible through the glass inside the lookout in the middle of the room is an Osborn Fire Finder, a large 360 degree compass that allowed firefighters to pinpoint a lightning strike and determine the coordinates of a fire’s location. It is elevated on a tall shelf in the center of the room. This device is surrounded by miscellaneous furniture and camping items, including a register book with visitor comments inside it and photos with labeled peaks in the surrounding area.",

Two trails approach the lake from either end of the parking area. At the far end of the parking area, a bulletin board sign provides information about the area and the campground. A pit toilet restroom with bear-proof trash canisters is located to the right of the sign. Beyond the sign is a single loop walk-in campground with several tent platforms. Another trail descends to the lake on the left side of the campground, which is bordered by a split-rail fence. The large deep blue lake is surrounded by forested mountain slopes. A trail skirts the southwest edge of the lake (nearest to the campground and parking area), terminating on the right at the Mowich Lake Ranger Cabin, a small log cabin with a food locker on the porch for hikers. Continue following the lake trail to the left and it eventually leaves the lake and becomes the trail heading to the Tolmie Peak Fire Lookout.",

After completing the road to Paradise in 1915, park officials set plans for a road around the mountain, which included a section named the Westside Road that would connect Carbon River to the Longmire area. The Mowich Lake area was intended as a separate junction and point of attraction along that road. In 1921, the Carbon River Road was constructed, followed by the start of constructing the southern section of the Westside Road in 1926. In 1933, the northern portion of the road via Mowich Lake was completed. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fa98fc2b-7d06-461c-bde9-612f2611dc19}{162}\" paraid=\"584302986\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Within the first few years after being built, all sections of completed road were damaged due to flooding. By 1934, park officials decided against extending Westside Road all the way to Carbon due to the immense cost and potential negative impacts to the landscape. As a result, the Mowich Lake Road wasn’t opened to the public until 1955 and has undergone very little improvement since then. To this day, Mowich Lake is one of the more isolated areas of the park thanks to heavy winters and a rough drive on the unpaved road. Although more difficult to reach, this entrance provides access to remarkable hiking, backpacking, and camping, as well as fishing and boating at Mowich Lake. In the winter, the unplowed road makes a relatively easy snowshoeing route. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{be7ec947-eb55-4cb8-8bf7-67f73e263790}{242}\" paraid=\"1236579311\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"> </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{be7ec947-eb55-4cb8-8bf7-67f73e263790}{252}\" paraid=\"1962867435\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Hiking </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{595fc64d-eb29-44c4-9301-22af3676dbf9}{48}\" paraid=\"1233480145\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Immediately near the national park boundary is the Paul Peak Trailhead. This trail ventures south for 3.1 miles to a junction with the Wonderland Trail. While the trail does not reach the summit of Paul Peak, it features old growth forest, unique views of Mount Rainier, and ample amounts of solitude. Take a right at the Wonderland Trail junction to continue for less than a mile to Mowich River Camp. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{43346001-954c-4487-8a85-c24d4278bd87}{102}\" paraid=\"1160555662\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Continue along the Mowich Lake Road to reach Mowich Lake, which includes trailheads for more popular hikes like the Tolmie Peak Trail and Spray Park Trail. Stream crossings can be particularly hazardous in spring and fall with higher water levels and it is not uncommon for log bridges to be washed out during heavy rain events. Check updates on the conditions of bridges and crossings before your trip, and practice techniques for safe stream crossing. Snow will linger on the trails late into the season, requiring navigation and snow travel knowledge. In the winter, the road itself becomes a popular snowshoeing route. Because this area is so remote, there is no cell service or other connectivity, and help may be difficult to reach in the event of an emergency. Be sure to plan and prepare appropriately for your own safety. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{229bc0ca-b6af-4e9d-a40f-6171fd9e9f5a}{128}\" paraid=\"2020055037\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"> </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{229bc0ca-b6af-4e9d-a40f-6171fd9e9f5a}{148}\" paraid=\"849701340\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Camping </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{229bc0ca-b6af-4e9d-a40f-6171fd9e9f5a}{150}\" paraid=\"77454981\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Five miles up the road is the Mowich Lake Campground, which is the smallest campground in Mount Rainier National Park with only 13 sites. This campground is drive in and first-come, first-served with self-registration. There are no other car camping options nearby within the park. All backcountry camping within park boundaries requires a permit. The closest backcountry camps are Mowich River Camp, Eagle Peak Camp, and Ipsut Creek Camp. Permits and current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. The nearest ranger station is the Carbon River Ranger Station. Due to high demand during the summer season, it is strongly recommended to make a wilderness permit reservation if you are planning to hike the Wonderland Trail. Hikers doing the complete Wonderland Trail are limited to camping in designated camps only - the use of cross-country zones is not permitted. Treat water before drinking. Fires are prohibited. Pets on a leash are allowed along the Mowich Lake Road and in the developed campground. Pets are not permitted on any trails, including the lakeshore trails.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Fifteen and a half miles southeast of Carbonado, Washington on SR165, a rough dirt and gravel road crosses the National Park Boundary and leads you to a trailhead. On the right, a small sign reads “Paul Peak” and is followed by a parking area bordered by logs. The road continues for about 5 miles until it terminates at a campground. On the eastern edge of the Paul Peak parking area is a stop sign with a bulletin next to it for paying the park entrance fee. At the southwest corner of the parking lot are a pair of paths. The right-most path leads to a brown structure with unisex toilets. The path on the left is the trailhead itself, which includes a set of trash and recycling receptacles on the right-hand side, and a bulletin board on the left-hand side followed by a picnic table. The two-foot-wide dirt trail is broken by rocks and tree roots in places and continues for 3.1 miles through old growth forest until a junction with the Wonderland Trail.",

    "bodyText": "<p><strong>Season: Summer Only</strong></p> <p>Mowich Lake Patrol Cabin is one of the oldest backcountry ranger stations in the park. It was intended as a temporary headquarters for rangers on patrol of the park 's western boundary and the Wonderland Trail. Aspects of the cabin's log frame, rectangular design with its steeply pitched cedar shake gable roof, saddle notch cornering, and post and beam frame front porch, were incorporated into the construction of future patrol cabins in the park.</p> <p>Prior to 1920, there were very few shelters for backcountry rangers and hikers. In 1919-20, Superintendent Roger Toll reported the need for backcountry shelters to be placed ten to fifteen miles apart along the Wonderland Trail. Toll's system evolved into the construction of both patrol cabins and trail shelters under Superintendent O.A. Tomlinson's administration (1923-41).</p> <p>The Superintendent's annual report for fiscal year 1922 reported the construction by the National Park Service of three patrol cabins on the west side of the park at Mowich Lake, St. Andrews Creek, and at Sunset Park. The Mowich Lake Patrol Cabin is located 0.1 miles east of the junction with the Wonderland Trail after the Mowich Lake Campground. It is still in use today and serves as one of three food-cache locations for hikers along the Wonderland Trail.</p>",

The trail to the lower viewpoint is snow covered and hazardous during the winter. NOTE: From May 24 - September 2, 2024, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/timed-entry-reservations.htm\">timed entry reservations</a> are required to enter the Paradise Corridor, which includes Narada Falls, between 7:00 am and 3:00 pm. <br /> <br /> Narada Falls is located approximately 17 miles east of the park’s southwest entrance, with Paradise one mile to the northeast. At only 150 feet from the road to Paradise, Narada Falls is the largest waterfall accessible by car in the park, and one of the most impressive. The area is composed of a parking area with a viewpoint, a stone-faced bridge across the top of the Narada Falls, picnic tables, restrooms, and a trail to a scenic overlook. Structures in this area, including the bridge, were designed and constructed according to naturalistic principles of landscape design and the National Park Service rustic style of architecture in the early 1900s.<br /> <br /> Walk across the bridge to access the restrooms and a steep trail to the bottom of the waterfall. The path may be wet and slippery. The trail is 0.2-mile (0.4 mile round-trip) with a steep, 200-foot descent/ascent. The trail connects to the 97 mile around-the-mountain Wonderland Trail to the south. Take the trail north to access the Lakes Trail that leads to Reflection Lakes to the east or Paradise to the north.<br /> <br /> At the end of the short trail, the entire 168-foot-high waterfall is visible. The vista is not only about dramatically falling water but also the rock that creates the steep drop. Here the Paradise River plunges over the edge of a relatively recent flow of hard andesite lava that abuts much older rock. This lava’s cooling was accelerated by contact with the icy surface of the glacier that once filled this valley. The Paradise River runs clear, not milky, because it originates from snowfields, not debris-laden glaciers.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The approach to Narada Falls is dramatic from any direction with the craggy Tatoosh peaks soaring to the south and east, and glimpses of Mount Rainier to the north along the way. Once in the parking lot, picnic tables are located on the south edge of the lot and a historic stone bridge arches gracefully over the Paradise River as it begins its fall over the edge of dark andesite cliff to the northeast of the parking area. A wayside exhibit with a view of the top of the falls is located on the rock wall between the parking lot and a steep drop off. The entire waterfall can be viewed down a steep 0.2 miles trail that starts on the far side of the historic bridge. Restrooms are located between the bridge and the trail.",

National Park Inn reservations provide <strong>access to the Paradise Corridor only</strong>; they do not provide access to the Sunrise Corridor.<br /> <br /> The National Park Inn in Longmire is a popular place to stay for exploring Mount Rainier National Park and is the only accommodation in the park that operates year-round. The current inn has 25 guestrooms. In addition to overnight guests, the National Park Inn has a restaurant that serves many day users to the park. A general store adjacent to the main inn building provides gifts, basic groceries, firewood sales in the summer, and snowshoe rentals in the winter.<br /> <br /> Part of a National Historic Landmark District, the National Park Inn has a long history of providing shelter to visitors to Mount Rainier National Park. The Longmire area was first developed by Longmire family in the late 1880s, which included the construction of the rustic Longmire Springs Hotel. Originally marketed as a health resort, the hotel invited visitors to partake of the natural volcanic mineral springs found in the Longmire Meadow. Over time the hotel was expanded and rebuilt, including a two-story annex. When the national park was created in 1899, interest in the Longmire area shifted from the mineral springs to using Longmire as a base for exploring Mount Rainier National Park. In 1906 a competing hotel, the National Park Inn, was built by the Tacoma & Eastern Railroad Company under lease by the park. In 1916, the newly formed Rainier National Park Company purchased the Longmire Springs Hotel and Annex, along with the National Park Inn. They dismantled the old Longmire Springs Hotel and moved the annex across the road from its original location and next to the National Park Inn. In 1926, the original National Park Inn burned down, leaving behind the annex and clubhouse. The annex soon became known as the National Park Inn that exists today. The club house is now the general store and gift shop next to the Inn. Learn more about the history of this historic building in the article \"<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-national-park-inn.htm\">The National Park Inn</a>\". <br /> <br /> <strong>Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</strong><br /> Electric vehicle charging stations are available at Longmire year-round and at Paradise during the summer season, operated by <a href=\"https://mtrainierguestservices.com/\">Rainier Guest Services (RGS)</a>. If you are interested in using them, visit the corresponding lodging operation (National Park Inn for Longmire and Paradise Inn for Paradise) to get their access code. Pricing will be based upon the amount of time requested and acceptance rate of energy (Tier 1, 2, or 3) requested.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The National Park Inn is a rectangular, two-story wood-shingled building with gabled roofs on either end of the building. A covered porch stretches along the front of the building on the side facing the main road into Longmire. A network of paved paths, lined with river stones, leads up to two sets of stairs that divide the front of the porch into thirds. There is a third set of stairs on the right side of the porch. Tables and high-backed wood chairs are set along the porch overlooking the road and a view of Mount Rainier. On the right side of the building is a covered walkway that connects the main building to a smaller wood building, which houses the general store and gift shop. Enter the building from the porch into a lobby. A lounge with a fireplace is to the right. Ahead there is a set of stairs leading to the second floor.

Predating the 1916 creation of the National Park Service, the entrance arch with its massive rough-hewn logs established the authority of this new park. This archway is a preview of the architectural style throughout Mount Rainier National Park, called \"National Park Service Rustic\", that has shaped the design of parks throughout the country. This style utilizes natural elements from the landscape to blend with the environment while enhancing significant features of the park. As you pass the gateway arch and rustic entrance booths, trace the path of generations of visitors as you follow the road to Longmire and up to Paradise.

    "bodyText": "<p>Nisqually Glacier is perhaps the most visited and best surveyed glacier on Mount Rainier. Due to easy access and its prominent location on the southwest side of Mount Rainier near Paradise, the glacier has been studied since the mid-1850s.</p> <p>In 1857, Lt. August Kautz crossed Nisqually Glacier during an attempt to climb the summit. In 1884, Allen Mason photographed the glacier for the first time, laying the foundation for a photographic record of the Nisqually Glacier that spans over a century.</p> <p>During the 1930s, Tacoma City Light Department and the U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) began a series of measurements of glacial surface elevation to determine the impact of the Nisqually Glacier's retreat on water supplies for hydroelectric power production. USGS and park scientists continue to regularly survey the glacier today.</p> <p>The product of this research is a record of Nisqually Glacier change spanning nearly 150 years. During this time the glacier has retreated and advanced several times, though the general trend has been retreat.</p> <p>In 1857, Kautz wrote in his journal that the terminus reached a narrow rock channel located underneath the present Glacier Bridge on the road to Paradise. By the time Mason began photographing the glacier, the terminus had retreated up the valley 0.2 miles (0.3 km). Photographs taken early in the 1900s show national park visitors posing near the bridge with the glacier clearly visible over their shoulders. By the 1950s, such photographs were not possible since the glacier had retreated nearly 1.2 miles (2 km) up past a curve in the valley and was lost from view to anyone on the road. An advance in the glacier a few years later made it once again visible from the bridge for a short time. However, by the 1970s the glacier had resumed its retreat and again disappeared from view. Since that time the glacier has gone through a series of minor advances and retreats.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Nisqually Glacier</strong>: The best views of the glacier are from the Nisqually Vista Trail in Paradise, which starts from the lower parking lot. It can also be viewed from Glacier Vista, a short spur off the Skyline Trail.</p> <p><strong>Nisqually Glacier Statistics as of 2021 (<a href=\"https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/687937\">Beason et al., 2023</a>):</strong></p> <ul> <li>Aerial Extent: 1.584 ± 0.086 square miles (4.102 ± 0.222 km2) (Rank: 6 of 29 glaciers on Mount Rainier)</li> <li>Highest Elevation (Head): 14,371 feet (4,380 m)</li> <li>Lowest Elevation (Terminus): 5,347 feet (1,630 m)</li> <li>Elevation Range: 9,024 feet (2,751 m)</li> <li>Length: 3.57 miles (5.74 km)</li> <li>Average Slope: 27.00°</li> <li>Average Flow Direction (direction the glacier flows towards): South southeast (166°)</li> <li>Glacier Type: S - Glacier Head Near Summit</li> </ul>",

    "bodyText": "<b>Season: Year-Round</b><br /> <br /> The Nisqually Suspension Bridge is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the national park system and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Longmire Historic District. Like other structures in the Longmire Historic District, it is an example of “NPS rustic” architecture, a design philosophy that attempts to make park buildings appear as if they belong in the natural spaces where they were built.<br /> <br /> The first light weight suspension bridge was installed across the Nisqually River at this site in 1911. This “pony bridge” quickly became outdated as more of the visitors to the park began to travel by automobile. When superintendent O. A. Tomlinson decided to build a new car-friendly campground on the south bank of the river in the 1920s, a new bridge was needed to support the increased traffic and weight.<br /> <br /> The Longmire location was so remote, the National Park Service received only one bid for the construction of the new Nisqually Bridge. Monson-Trierweiler Co. out of Portland, Oregon, proposed a design that used massive locally sourced vertical logs as suspension supports. A hard winter stretched the construction time to over seven months. Once the bridge was finally completed in 1924 it took over a year to build the Longmire Campground on the opposite bank. The new bridge was first open to public in August 1925 and praised as an example of “NPS rustic” architecture.<br /> <br /> The original logs were pretty but precarious and the log supports were carefully updated with dimensional timber towers in 1952. This work was necessary because of heavier vehicles, increasing use, and changing bridge safety standards across the country. The Nisqually Suspension Bridge is considered the oldest vehicle suspension bridge in the National Park Service because most of its original form has been retained. The majority of the bridge’s timber and hardware was sorted, saved, and reintegrated during the construction in 1952. The only other major change to the bridge design is the addition of a second, lower safety railing.<br /> <br /> The Nisqually Suspension Bridge remains in use but doesn’t see as much traffic as it once did. The road continues to provide access to the Longmire Community Building and the renamed Longmire Stewardship Campground, but these facilities are closed to the public and used only by park volunteers and researchers who contribute to the mission of the National Park Service. With this gentle usage and rigorous upkeep, the bridge can be expected to be in service for decades to come.<br /> <br /> To visit this bridge first go to the Longmire Historic district 12 miles from the southwest Nisqually Entrance. There is no parking at the Nisqually Suspension Bridge, so it is best to find parking at Longmire and continue on foot. The bridge is located less than a quarter of a mile past the Longmire Administrative Building. There is an “S” bend in the road and a small incline before the bridge. Use caution while walking as vehicles share the road. It is also possible to view the Nisqually Suspension Bridge by driving across it. The road is a dead-end but there is space to turn a vehicle around at the Longmire Community Building one-half mile past the bridge.",
    "audioDescription": "A paved, single-lane road approaches the bridge from the west side of the river from the main Longmire area, with a tight “S” curve to climb up a short hill to reach the bridge. After crossing the bridge, the road turns south and parallels the river a short distance to the Longmire Community Building. The bridge rests on rock outcrops on either side and is framed by forested slopes. The bridge is 15 feet wide and 50 feet long. The wooden bridge surface is supported by steel cables from four, 30-foot tall, timber frame towers. These towers are connected by timbers across the top to form two massive arches, one at each end of the bridge. Four-foot tall wooden safety railings line the bridge between the one-lane road and the suspension cables. Two feet below these railings, wooden boards provide a second safety railing to prevent falls. The riverbed below the bridge is full of boulders, with the river splitting into multiple channels. The Nisqually River passes approximately 25 feet below the bridge.",

    "bodyText": "What does the future hold for Mount Rainier? In its short (geological) history, Mount Rainier has undergone many changes – sometimes drastic and destructive, sometimes small and barely noticeable. In our even shorter history, humans have interacted with, influenced, and left our marks upon the mountain. Seismic measurements and other data tell us that the mountain is still an active volcano. Warning systems help us manage the risks of volcanic activity and lahars. Continuous monitoring indicates that our climate is warming with impacts to the glaciers and the ecosystems on the mountain. We know that the mountain will continue to change, but the question is, “How?” As we learn from its history and study is ongoing processes, we get a better understanding of what is possible in the future, and the role that we play in the evolution of the mountain. As you conclude your tour, enjoy one more moment with the mountain and its meadows on this trail and consider: What is something you enjoyed today that you hope others will appreciate many years from now? How can we ensure that these experiences are passed along to future generations?",
    "audioDescription": "From the junction, the wide, paved trail retraces the path at the first section of this tour. The trail has a continuous uphill stretch past the meadow and hollow rock visited previously, and then descends past Deadhorse Creek before the final ascent to a small hill with a bench on the left. Stopping at this bench and turning to face the direction from which you came again reveals a view of the upper mountain, complete with glaciers, rocky outcroppings, and its rounded summit. Lining the lower part of the view are stands of trees and large patches of open meadows. Turning back with the bench on the left, the trail continues straight and leads back to the stone steps of the trailhead, ending back at the Paradise lower parking lot.",

    "audioDescription": "The Nisqually Vista Trail begins with a set of stone stairs that leads to a hill, and then descends through a meadow field to a bridge crossing a flowing creek. The trail is paved and about 4 feet wide. At the bridge, rocks line the trail and build up from the sides of the creek around a metal culvert. The creek has a rocky bed and a steady stream of water year-round. Coming from the trailhead, upstream is on the right and downstream is on the left. The trail leading up to the creek is surrounded by lush meadows with a variety of wildflowers in shades of red, yellow, pink, and purple. Beyond the creek, clusters of small, crooked trees cover the hillside with a tall metal tower – the weather station – peeking out from between the tops of the trees. The trail continues on a gentle but steady incline through the trees and passes the weather station on the right to the next stop.",

    "bodyText": "This tiny pond demonstrates the unique ecosystem here in the subalpine meadows of Mount Rainier. Life forms in the pool race with the weather to grow, reproduce, and store food in the short snow-free season between June and September. Soils around the pool are composed of fine particles of volcanic ash and mudflow materials. Tiny fragments of pumice, called ash, are so small and light that they can drift long distances through the air when ejected from a volcano. Many layers of ash from Mount Rainier coat Paradise meadows, but some ash layers were carried from Mount St. Helens and even from Mount Mazama in Oregon, which erupted and collapsed, forming Crater Lake. While ashy soil is nutrient-rich and provides fertile ground for the meadows, it is also quite fragile. Pocket gophers and meadow voles, members of the rodent family, dig small holes and tunnel trails year-round, which helps to stir and aerate the soil. Their activity is important because the fine soil is very easily compacted and eroded. In fact, as few as 12 footsteps in the same spot can compress the soil enough that plants will not be able to grow.",
    "audioDescription": "From the stop at the small stream in the meadow, the wide, paved trail follows the right-hand path from the “Y” junction. The trail is surrounded by meadows of flowers and lush greenery, with the glaciated summit of Mount Rainier peering above the skyline. About 50 feet past the junction, a wetland with surface water begins to appear on the right. The water flows and begins to pool into a shallow pond about 15 feet across. Meadow plants line the pond almost up to the water line, while the pond itself hosts a variety of algae, insects, and other small amphibians. The pool drains into a small stream the flows under the trail. At the crossing the trail is lined with rocks. The stream flows out to the left, along a rocky bed surrounded by dense vegetation. From here, the trail has a gentle descent around a bend to the left and then meanders through patches of trees and flower fields until a series of overlooks begins on the right.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Rising to 14,410 feet (4,394 m), Mount Rainier is the tallest of the Cascade volcanoes and one of the most massive mountains on Earth. Throughout its history, Mount Rainier has erupted a series of lava flows which piled atop one another like layers (or strata), giving Mount Rainier the classification of \"stratovolcano\". At one point, these layers built the mountain up to a height of about 16,000 feet. Due to its height and periods of colder climates, ice covered the mountain, causing erosion and redirecting lava flows.<br /> <br /> Mount Rainier erupted thick lava which flowed repeatedly like hot tar, filling the deep canyons around the vent. When glaciers were present during eruptions, the massive bodies of ice influenced the path of lava flows. Where in direct contact with lava, glaciers could cause the molten liquid to cool so quickly that it sometimes formed fragmented columns (an example of these columnar joints can be found just below this overlook). In turn, the lava would melt snow and ice in its path, causing floods and mudflows to course down the flanks of the mountain. Lava flows that resisted erosion now form ridge tops extending from the mountain summit. The ground beneath you here is one of these ancient lava flows.</p> <p>During the last 10,000 years, huge masses of rock have repeatedly slid from the volcano, reducing the cone height by more than 1,000 feet and reducing its bulk by one third. This left a gaping depression in the east face of the mountain top. In the last 2,000 years, Mount Rainier has partially rebuilt itself by repeated eruptions. A new cone of andesite lava now tops the summit depression. Steam vents in the craters still melt caves under the summit ice cap.</p> <br /> With internet access, dive deeper into the volcanic history of Mount Rainier here:<br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/nature/volcanoes.htm\">Volcanoes</a>.",
    "audioDescription": "After the fairy pool, the trail ventures around a bend and slightly downhill through trees and flower fields, eventually reaching an overlook on the right. The overlook is an extended section of pavement that reaches a clearing in the trees along the outer edge and is bordered on three sides by a fence made of large, rough-hewn logs. The overlook frames a view of Mount Rainier, a massive mountain covered in snow and glaciers. Interspersed among the blue and white of the glaciers are dark grey peaks and ridges of various shapes towering above the ice fields. Within the field of view is a rocky outcrop jutting from the same cliffside as this overlook. The outcrop features a lichen-covered dark grey rock forming columns that extend from the top of the ridge to a sudden end that hangs freely over the steep valley below. Returning to the main trail from the overlook, you will continue to the right for a short distance through trees to a smaller overlook on the right.",

    "bodyText": "Mount Rainier is built on the foundations of much older mountains. Long before Mount Rainier formed, volcanoes 26-28 million years ago spread great blankets of hot pumice and ash over the landscape. Some flows were 350 feet thick. Heat trapped in the flows remelted the particles, forming the hard rock, known as welded tuff, of the Stevens Ridge Formation, which forms the peaks of the Tatoosh Range visible to the south. From beneath these rocks a large blob of magma many miles across pushed upward about 18-14 million years ago. Before it reached the surface, the molten rock cooled and hardened into a \"salt and pepper\" crystalline rock, known as granodiorite – a relative of granite. Grano­diorite forms the base rocks under both the Tatoosh Range and Mount Rainier. As the entire Cascade Mountain Range rose, severe erosion carved rocks of the Tatoosh into the rugged ridges and deep valleys we see. In the last million years, repeated glaciation shaped the range into a series of horns and cirques.",

    "bodyText": "The Nisqually Glacier is one of six glaciers on Mount Rainier that begins at the summit of the mountain. It is also the best surveyed and monitored glaciers on the mountain. Due to easy access and its prominent location near Paradise, the glacier has been studied since the mid-1850s. The product of this research is a record of Nisqually Glacier change spanning nearly 150 years. Although the glacier has had some small advances in that time, these records indicate that the Nisqually Glacier – and most other glaciers on Mount Rainier – has retreated significantly in the last century.<br /> <br /> The upper zone of the glacier, where snowfall exceeds melting, is called the accumulation zone. The lower area where melting exceeds snowfall is termed the ablation zone. An equilibrium line, where ice accumulation equals ice loss, separates these zones. A rising equilibrium line indicates a glacial retreat, while a lowering equilibrium line signals that the glacier may advance down-valley. Changes in glacier size (advance and retreat) depend on the climate including air temperature and snowfall.<br /> <br /> While the response of each glacier depends on its local conditions, the two main factors driving glacier change are precipitation with low temperatures in winter, and rate of melt due to higher temperatures in summer. The current trend of glacier loss seems to be largely the result of a regional tendency toward warmer weather, resulting in less snowfall and higher melting. During the Ice Ages, the Nisqually Glacier terminated 30 miles down-valley, beyond Ashford and Elbe. Photographs from the early 1900s show park visitors posing at the Nisqually Bridge on the way to Paradise with the glacier clearly visible over their shoulders. Today, the terminus of the glacier is almost 1.5 miles up-valley from the bridge.<br /> <br /> To learn more, read the exhibit panel here as the next stop on this tour, and visit our website with internet access here: <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/nature/glaciers.htm\">Glaciers</a>.",
    "audioDescription": "From the last stop, the wide, paved trail curves along a meadow with less frequent trees to a large extended platform area of pavement just ahead and to the right. The overlook lined along the cliffside with a stone and rough-hewn log border. Near the middle of this border is a break in the logs with an exhibit panel resting on top of a stone platform. Facing directly out from this exhibit panel, the mountain is fully on display with its steep slopes, rounded summit, and mosaic of rocky outcroppings and glacial ice. One of these glaciers – the Nisqually Glacier – is now completely visible, extending all the way from the summit of the mountain to its terminus near the bottom center of the view ahead. As the glacier gets lower on the mountain, it becomes more covered in rocks, appearing mostly grey at the very bottom. The terminus is indicated by a blunt, flat face of the glacier, with the Nisqually River starts directly from this point and flows down-valley (to the left). Immediately behind you at this exhibit panel is a wooden bench. To the left of the bench, the trail continues with a gentle uphill before a steady descent through trees.",

    "bodyText": "As one of the tallest and snowiest mountains in North America, Mount Rainier creates a perfect environment for glaciers. Glaciers form when, for many decades, more snow falls in winter than melts in summer. As succeeding snows accumulate, their weight compresses the air space out of the snowpack, and the individual crystals bond together into glacial ice. Mount Rainier currently is encircled by 25 glaciers and has been significantly shaped by their presence.<br /> <br /> As we have discovered, glaciers are capable of powerful erosion and transporting large amounts of material. Over the last 6,000 years, this erosion has reduced the height of the mountain by an estimated 1,000 feet (300 meters) and carved features into the face of the mountain. Deep U-shaped valleys are typical in the lower regions of some of the largest glaciers, while steep-walled bowls known as cirques and sharp peaks called horns are characteristic of glacial erosion on the upper mountain.<br /> <br /> The glaciers transport eroded rocks into the riverbed below, and much of the rock accumulates at the edges of the glacier, forming ridges called moraines. If the ridge forms on the side of a glacier it’s called a lateral moraine; if it forms at the end of the glacier, it’s a terminal moraine. The occurrence of moraines is important because they are used to determine the size of glaciers during earlier, colder times. The lateral moraine on the far side of the valley was formed during the glacier's last major advance, around 1840. The sharp edge at the top of the moraine marks the upper surface of the glacier during that time.",
    "audioDescription": "From the second overlook, the wide, paved trail continues to the right for a short distance to a large bend with an extended section of pavement on the right, bordered on three sides by a large rough-hewn log fence. At the edge of the bordered overlook, small trees and shrubs obscure the lower portion of the vista, which highlights the upper section of Mount Rainier. The mountain rises high on the skyline with steep slopes and a rounded summit. Both the slopes and summit are covered in glaciers, appearing in various shades of blue where the ice is exposed, white in the sections covered in snow, and grey in places that have been covered by rockfall. Amidst the snow and ice, large, dark grey rocky outcroppings emerge with a variety of shapes and sizes. Some of the outcroppings are steep peaks towering over the glaciers, other have sheer walls and a plateaued top, while others form long ridges following the slope of the mountain. Along the bottom left section of the mountain within view is a gently sloping hillside that appears to be a meadow with trees that dot the landscape. The large swathe of green ends abruptly along an edge parallel to the cliffside you are on, and immediately becomes a steep walled ridge line of unconsolidated rock – the lateral moraine of the Nisqually Glacier when it was much larger. Continuing the trail to the right, the path curves left along a clear patch of meadow and leads to the final overlook on the right.",

    "bodyText": "This unusual rock is an excellent example of the forces that drive the formation and evolution of Mount Rainier. Mount Rainier is a volcano that has been active for less than 700,000 years, and this rock was once part of a lava flow that erupted. When extremely hot magma encounters water deep under the Earth’s surface, it can create steam. This steam will dissolve gases into the magma. As these gases expand, they create pressure sometimes high enough to cause an eruption. Opening a carbonated beverage has a similar effect, where gases are dissolved into the liquid and can create an explosive event when opened. Often, the gasses escape as the lava cools like a soda going “flat”. Sometimes, however, the lava cools so quicky that gas gets trapped, leaving holes in the rock of various sizes. If the lava has many tiny bubbles that become encased in the cooled lava, the rock may become pumice. In the case of this rock, a very large gas bubble was unable to escape before the lava hardened. Later the rock broke open, exposing its hollow center. ",
    "audioDescription": "From the last stop at Deadhorse Creek, the wide, paved trail gains elevation, venturing through tight clusters of evergreen trees with small patches of wildflowers and shrubs on the meadow floor. As you approach this stop, the trail passes a larger field of wildflowers on the right that is interjected by a boulder immediately off the trail. The boulder is large – about 5 feet wide and 4 feet tall – and dark grey with angular features that feel as though they have been gently smoothed on the edges. In the middle of the boulder, facing the trail, is a large and deep hole, about 2-3 feet in circumference. The trail continues past the boulder, uphill for a short distance and then a moderately steep downhill through another stand of trees.",

The original trees in each group become established in longer periods of warm growing seasons and provide shelter and warmth required for the survival of nearby seedlings. Extreme winters limit the growth potential of trees when they stand individually, which is why the biggest trees at this elevation are those growing in clusters. As you continue uphill on the switchback, you'll be surrounded by many trees with crooked trunks. Both the mountain hemlock and subalpine fir are quite flexible. Under heavy snow loads, small trees may bend to the ground. If a tree is held in this position for a long time, the trunk adjusts to the strain and becomes permanently bent.",

The trees in the largest cluster are distinctly much larger than all of the other trees and have a craggy but shallow, greyish bark with long dropping branches densely covered in dark green needles. The trail continues ahead with a slight curve to the right and then a sharp turn to the left which marks a steeper ascent on the trail switchback. Along this rise in the trail, the trees become less dense, less tall, and have more crooked appearances. Eventually, the trees clear enough into larger patches of wildflower meadows.",

    "bodyText": "<p>While flowing lava has created the rocks of Mount Rainier, flowing water and ice erode and transport those rocks. Both glaciers and rivers are responsible for redistributing rocks of all sizes down the mountain from their origins. Glaciers are masses of ice that flow very slowly under their own weight. As glaciers flow, they grind and pluck rocks from the bedrock below, and carry rocks distributed from avalanches and rockfall above. Eventually, the glacier gets to a low enough point that the ice will melt, depositing its load of rocks into the riverbed below.<br /> <br /> Pulverized rock, called glacial flour, is suspended in the river flowing from the glacier, giving the water its muddy appearance. Rocks and boulders transported by the glacier can build upon themselves and raise the riverbed higher and higher – a process called aggradation. Flowing water will continue to push around and rearrange these rocks, creating a wide and rocky riverbed while the river itself is braided in constantly changing channels.<br /> <br /> Occasionally, there are larger flooding events that carry vast loads of material. Heavy rain fall, glacial outburst floods, and even volcanic activity can cause the sudden release of water. If a massive amount of water gains enough momentum, it can pick up large boulders and other materials, becoming a debris flow. The largest of these flows is known as a lahar, a destructive slurry of water and debris that can extend for many miles. Mount Rainier has experienced many of these events throughout its history.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "From the first overlook, the wide, paved trail continues through denser stands of trees for about 170 feet until the pavement extends to another outlook on the right with a single rough-hewn log fence on the outer boundary. Through a clearing in the trees, the mountain is visible, along with a clear view of the glacier terminus that feeds into the riverbed below. The valley has steep walls with a wide, flat bottom that is covered entirely with rocks and boulders of various sizes. A muddy, brownish river flows along the center of the riverbed, with multiple channels that cross and separate one another as the water winds around rocks and small ridges in the riverbed. Higher on the mountain, an assortment of waterfalls flow from streams and creeks, eventually tumbling into the large valley below and feeding the Nisqually River. The waterfalls and the river itself create a constant thunder of sound that echoes through the valley. Coming back to the trail from the overlook edge, the tour continues to the right through dense trees.",

    "bodyText": "The hollow rock we visited earlier and many of the boulders that are scattered through this meadow were carried down to Paradise by a lahar about 6,000 years ago. The volcano had steamed intensely for many centuries as hot gases dissolved rocks into clay. Then the weak mass of rock and clay was jostled or shoved by a small eruption so that a huge block avalanched down across Paradise. The lahar, known as the Osceola Mudflow, flowed like wet cement and spread out into a sheet over ridges and valleys. It may have been 600 feet thick when the wet mass extended nearly 20 miles down the Paradise and Nisqually valleys. Remnants almost 15 feet thick remain in Paradise Meadow. When large boulders are carried far from their origins, they are called erratics. Erratics can be found throughout the park due to the powerful forces of glaciers, floods, and debris flows that have transported them.",
    "audioDescription": "From the cluster of trees, the wide, paved path ascends along a switchback as the trees become less dense and the meadows open up into wildflower fields. After the trail becomes more even, it eventually reaches a junction with the loop that you just completed and the section of trail that leads back to the trailhead. At this junction, the trail is surrounded by the same wildflower field that was discussed in the “Meadow Life” stop earlier in this tour. Flowers of all colors and shapes cover the field during peak bloom and scattered throughout the meadow away from the trail are large boulders about four to five feet wide and tall. The boulders are a stark contrast to the wide, flat meadow and have the same grey color and angular features as the hollow rock near the start of the tour. The trail continues to the right at the junction to return to the trailhead along the same section that you initially traveled.",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Season: Summer Only </b><i>(May - October)</i><br /> Ohanapecosh is open to vehicles via SR123 during the summer only, typically from May to early November. Hikers, snowshoers, and snowmobiles can use the closed road during the winter. <br /> <br /> Ohanapecosh is located on the southeast side of the park, a few miles beyond the park boundary on SR123. It is just minutes from the Stevens Canyon Entrance, which provides access to Paradise, and it is 13 miles from SR410, which connects to the White River, Sunrise, and Tipsoo Lake areas, as well as the towns of Enumclaw and Yakima, WA. The area is home to the <strong>Ohanapecosh Visitor Center</strong> and campground. The <strong>Ohanapecosh Campground</strong> has 188 sites for RV or tent camping. Each site has a bear box for campers to secure food, as well as a designated fire ring. There is a bathroom in each campground loop. There are no electrical hookups at the Ohanapecosh Campground. <br /> <br /> The <strong>Ohanapecosh Visitor Center</strong> is a large building with a pitched roof, designed in the classic Mission 66 style. Upon approaching the building, there is a double doored entrance and to the left a covered outdoor hallway leads to restrooms, a pay phone, and a water fountain. <br /> <br /> Ohanapecosh has a long history of human use. The area is still used by members of the Cowlitz and Yakama tribes. Due to sampling done in the Ohanapecosh Campground in 2014, archaeologists were able to find the first ever, low elevation, pre-contact sites within the park. More field work followed in the summer of 2015, yielding artifacts like chipped stone tool remains and hearth features dating to between 3,700 and 6,400 years ago. It is believed that Ohanapecosh served as a way-stop to and from high elevation summer sites used for hunting and resource-gathering. Please remember that all historic and archaeological artifacts you might find must be left in place. This allows archaeologists to learn much more about our cherished history. Report anything you notice to the nearest visitor center or park ranger. <br /> <br /> Volcanic hot springs still bubble near the campground. These hot springs were developed into a Hot Springs Resort in the early 1900s, but the resort fell into disrepair in the 1950s and was closed in 1960. The National Park Service had several stages of development, from the construction of the campground and trails by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, to the development of the visitor center and employee housing during the Mission 66 era in the 1950s-60s. The hot spring area was also restored to a more natural state and the resort buildings were removed. <br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Tucked amongst low-elevation forest next to the Ohanapecosh River, hiking access abounds. Most hikes are family friendly and short in length, including the popular <strong>Silver Falls Trail</strong>. The Silver Falls Trail connects to the <strong>Eastside Trail</strong>, with access to the Grove of the Patriarchs. The hot springs can be viewed along the <strong>Hot Springs Nature Trail</strong>, which starts behind the visitor center. <br /> <br /> <b>NOTE: The Grove of the Patriarchs is CLOSED </b>to all public entry due to flooding in November 2021 which caused significant damage to the suspension bridge that provides the only safe access to the area (<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/news/mount-rainier-national-park-announces-temporary-closure-of-grove-of-the-patriarchs.htm\">News Release, 11/17/21</a>). The Grove of the Patriarchs Trail will remain closed until the bridge can be replaced, which will first require a series of environmental evaluations and engineering work to reevaluate the bridge design. During the closure, the Grove of the Patriarchs parking lot and restrooms have normal seasonal access, along with the Eastside and Silver Falls Trails. Construction to replace the bridge is scheduled to begin summer 2027. Summers represent the only viable construction season in the park due to the heavy snow that blankets the park from roughly November through May.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Ohanapecosh Visitor Center consists of bathrooms and information boards outside the building. Inside, the visitor center consists of one large room with exhibit panels educating visitors on the history and natural resources of the area. There is an information desk to the right upon entering and a small seating area to the left. There is a small book store behind the desk where visitors can purchase books and maps. The rest of the room has exhibits. The building itself is Mission 66 style, and surrounded by tall fir and cedar trees. There are also numerous types of smaller plants that can be found here, including alder and various wildflowers. There is parking in front of the building to the left. A path to the left of the building leads visitors to a large tree round with various world events marked on the tree like a timeline. There is a covered area with a few benches underneath. A path behind the building connects visitors to various hiking trails, including the Hot Springs Trail and the Silver Falls Trail. Ohanapecosh Campground is located on the Ohanapecosh River, situated in an old-growth forest. When you enter the Ohanapecosh area, the Visitor Center is on your right. There are 8 loops in this campground, names Loop A through Loop H. There is a bathroom in each campground. Each site has a picnic table and designated fire ring. To the left is a road which leads to day use parking, a picnic area, and a bathroom. Continuing on, you will enter Loop A. Upon returning back to the main road, there will be a bridge crossing the Ohanapecosh River. Just before this bridge you will see Loop B to the right and Loop C to the left. Loop C has two walk in sites at the far end of the loop. When you cross the river, you will come to Loop D almost immediately on your left. Continuing along the main road, Loop E will be to the right and Loop F will be to the left, just over a small bridge. Loop H will be to the right as you continue towards the far end of the campground. The road will bring you right into Loop G, which has 4 walk in sights on the righthand side.",

This picnic area provides eight tables divided into three clusters designed to accommodate groups of up to 18 people. Each cluster of tables has a grill and is situated on a path extending from the parking area to the restroom about 200 feet away. Wheelchair accessible tables are located at the first two sets of picnic tables closest to the parking area, although there are no designated accessible stalls at this parking area.

More field work in the summer of 2015 yielded artifacts dating to between 3,700 and 6,400 years ago, presumably from the Taidnapam people, whose descendants are part of the Upper Cowlitz and Yakama tribes. In the early 1900s, as the area became more popular for settlers, a series of resorts based around the natural hot springs were built. When Mount Rainier National Park was established in 1899, the Ohanapecosh area remained in private use and wasn’t included in park boundaries until 1933. The resort existing at the time remained in use until 1961 when the contract was ended, and the associated buildings were torn down. Since then, the picnic area, campground, and visitor center have become the primary amenities for modern day visitors, continuing a tradition of recreation and human interaction with the river and surrounding old-growth forest. </p> <p paraeid=\"{e438f768-278a-4911-98f5-a14a3efc446e}{243}\" paraid=\"1871109469\">As you enjoy a picnic here, please be mindful of your impact to the landscape, wildlife, and other visitors. Trash cans are located near the parking lot for you to clean up and dispose of all waste. Additional trash and recycling bins are 200 feet. down the road past the picnic area near campsite A54. Potable water is located at restrooms and at the faucet near campsite A54. Never feed any wildlife or leave food unattended to avoid wild animals getting food that could make them sick or cause them to act aggressively. Please empty wastewater in sinks or toilets and deposit any solid food waste into trash cans. While there are grills in the picnic area, open fires are not allowed outside of the grills, and you must follow any fire restrictions in place. Pets must be on a leash, not more than six feet (1.8 meters) in length or in a crate/cage at all times. Pets are allowed along the road and paved sidewalks and may join you at your picnic at tables. Pets are not allowed on any trails in Mount Rainier National Park. There are maintained paths to get to the picnic tables. Stay within the established pathways to reduce impact on the forest floor. If you choose to play music, please be aware of volume out of respect for other visitors and wildlife. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "One and a half miles north of the southeast entrance arch and eleven and a half miles from Packwood, Highway 123 reaches a left turn for the Ohanapecosh Visitor Center, Campground, and Picnic Area. The side road descends through trees until the visitor center building and parking lot are on the left, and a series of small loop roads lead to the various sites of the campground. The campground road immediately across from the visitor center (south) leads to the picnic area on the east side of this small roadway. There is a parking area suitable for up to ten vehicles, which immediately leads to the picnic area after a 1–2-inch drop to packed dirt. The picnic area is separated into three sets of tables along a dirt path leading south from the parking lot. The first set of three tables and one grill is immediately next to the parking lot, and the second set is about 50 feet down the path. After about 100 feet, the path becomes broken by roots, and leads to the third set of tables and finally the restroom. The restroom building at the end of the path is off-white with a brown roof and has separate multi-stall rooms for men and women. The picnic tables and path are lined with a three-foot wooden fence, and the entire area is surrounded by coniferous trees.",

The Ohanapecosh River is a vibrant turquoise. Other rivers on the mountain are impacted by glaciers and are characterized by their milky color. As glacial ice grinds down the rocky slopes of Mount Rainier, Takhoma (Cowlitz tribal word for Mount Rainier), it accumulates silt. But unlike these rivers, the Ohanapecosh flows fairly clear due to the recession of the Ohanapecosh Glacier, which has retreated far enough into the high country to effectively eliminate the glacial sediment seen in larger, glacier-fed rivers. ",

Surrounded by mountains high enough to trap rainfall coming from the Puget Sound and low enough for mild temperatures, it receives about 70 to 90 inches of rain per year. Most of the rain falls in one long wet season during winter and spring. Summers are fairly dry, with fog providing most of the moisture.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{69ca8c74-53a6-4a9a-87c0-1a077dd78ef6}{217}\" paraid=\"1750002515\">During the long rainy season, water falls on the tree canopy, trickles to the understory, and seeps into the ground. It then fills rivers, which return water to the ocean. Some of the moisture received by the temperate rainforests is returned to the atmosphere through evaporation. Moist air rises, forms clouds, and falls again as rain in an ongoing process. Big rainforest trees can store a large amount of water, which helps them get through the dry summer season. A single Douglas-fir, like this one on the left side of the Carbon River Trail, can hold as much as 5,000 gallons of water!  </p> <p paraeid=\"{69ca8c74-53a6-4a9a-87c0-1a077dd78ef6}{241}\" paraid=\"392750981\">Douglas-fir (<em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em>) is a dominate species in Pacific Northwest forests. Mature trees can be as large as 13 ft (4 m) in diameter and reach heights of 300 ft (90 m). Some Douglas-fir in the park are believed to be over 1,000 years old. The bark of older trees becomes very thick with reddish-brown, deeply-furrowed ridges. Older trees also lose their lower branches, leaving behind straight trunks. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4a622c9e-c5c6-4c5f-a853-55895cdd0cc4}{16}\" paraid=\"200936876\"> </p>",

This plan was only partially accomplished by other roads in the park, including SR410/123 on the east side of the park and Stevens Canyon Road on the south side of the park. Carbon River Road was meant to stretch along the north side of the park. However, from the beginning maintenance of the road was challenging and the road was frequently damaged by flooding due to the dynamic glacier-fed Carbon River. Historically, the Carbon River Road once reached as far as Cataract Creek, an additional three miles past its current length, which spans five miles to Ipsut Creek.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{903e6f31-d2c0-4a25-bce0-0946a3385929}{116}\" paraid=\"1271423015\">The Carbon River Road has always been a primitive road, winding through old growth temperate rainforest along the Carbon River Valley. It was constructed using wagon road technology, rather than modern engineering. In an attempt to design the road to blend with the landscape, it was routed close to the river, instead of further away on a valley bench. As a result, the road is in a floodplain and numerous floods have damaged or destroyed sections of the road. Eventually extreme damage from the November 2006 Flood closed the road to vehicles permanently, and the road now operates as the Carbon River Trail. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "At this location the paved portion of the road ends and continues on as a narrow single lane dirt and gravel road. A small service road peels off of the main road to the left. The road is bordered by dense temperate rainforest, with tall, moss and lichen covered trees and a dense understory of ferns, shrubs, and other plants.",

    "bodyText": "<p>A short distance along the Old Mine Trail are several fallen logs covered in moss, lichen, and other plants. A tree is an essential contributor to the life cycle of a forest – not only when it is alive, but also after it has fallen to the ground. Resting upon the forest floor, a tree absorbs rain and holds it like a sponge, whereupon mosses and other plants can colonize. The dead tree, called a nurse log, provides water and nutrients for new growth. Young trees sprout on the log, competing for sun and enough space to grow roots that will eventually anchor in the ground. While supporting the growing trees, the log slowly deteriorates. Many types of fungi, often seen as mushrooms growing out of the wood, help break down the decomposing log. Ants, beetles, and other invertebrates tunnel through the moist wood and feed upon it. The decaying matter enriches the soil by recycling nutrients. A tree constantly contributes to the forest until nothing remains of the tree.<br /> <br /> What can you see growing on the nurse logs along the Old Mine Trail? Can you count how many different species or types of plants there are?</p>",

Each thorny stem supports large maple-shaped leaves, also with thorns, and topped with a pyramidal stalk of numerous small, greenish-white flowers in spring that turn into red berries. Devil's club can be found in large thickets in wet areas, like this one along the Old Mine Tail.

They can grow to be 7-10 inches (185-260 mm) long. While they can be yellow, they also come in green, brown, or white colors and can have dark spots. Their color changes according to their diet and moisture in the environment. Because they have no shell, which provides them with needed moisture, banana slugs prefer wet and shady environments like the forests of Carbon River. They love humidity so much that they use nearby water to make their very own slime. This slime allows them to stay hydrated and alive, navigate the forest floor, and protects them against predators who might want to take a bite out of them.</p>",

However, the locations of many of these claims are not well known and it is believed that some were excuses to get access to illegal timber, instead of being used for mining.<br /> <br /> Between 1910-1912, the Government Land Office directed adverse proceedings against twenty-four of the mining claims for lack of assessment work or filed charges of abandonment against the other remaining mining claims owned by the Washington Mining and Milling Company. As a result, the company began relinquished the claims. While some mines did have activity, by at least 1913, all company operations had ceased or been declared invalid for lack of assessment.<br /> <br /> The “Old Mine” here is believed to be one of the mines operated by the Washington Mining and Milling Company. A local visitor told Ranger Aubrey Haines in 1950 of working in a nearby mine over 40 years before belonging to the Washington Mining and Milling Company. The company was engaged in taking out a white ore which was found in a clay strata which hardened rapidly on exposure to the air. A notable feature of the mine was an incline railway which was used to lower ore from the mine to the river bottom or possibly a road three hundred feet below. Ranger Haines went out and located the remains of the mine 1951. At the time, the ranger found the remains of a shake building with a cast iron stone and other equipment near the mine entrance. The mine tunnel was six feet by six feet neatly cut into gray crystalline rock. About fifty feet inside the tunnel it took a turn to the right. The ore tracks were still in place. Today the mine entrance remains remarkedly similar to this description from the 1950s, though the entrance has been blocked off for safety (do not attempt to enter the mine further than the closure).</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Midway up the valley slope, the trail reaches its conclusion at the entrance to an old mine. The mine entrance is a roughly square hole cut into the rocky hillside, roughly 6 feet high and 6 wide. The exterior edges of the entrance are covered in thick moss and layers of ferns. Inside the mine entrance, the walls have horizontal layers of rough stone. On the ground, old metal train tracks extend into the mine tunnel. Approximately 20 feet into the tunnel the entrance is blocked by a metal grate. The floor of the mine tunnel is typically covered in shallow standing water, with a few rocks and pieces of wood creating slippery footholds to approach the metal grate. If you look through the grate using a flashlight, you can see the tunnel continuing a short distance and turning to the right. Listen and you can hear trickling and dripping water echoing in the tunnel.",

Here, plants must be able to tolerate shade or reach the canopy to thrive. When a fallen tree creates a gap in the canopy, nearby trees grow rapidly, racing to fill it. This stop along the Carbon River Trail is at a gap in the forest where several trees fell during past storms along the right side of the trail. Note the small tree in the center of the gap – a Western hemlock. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4a622c9e-c5c6-4c5f-a853-55895cdd0cc4}{146}\" paraid=\"1261853113\">Western hemlocks (<em>Tsuga heterophylla</em>) are well-adapted to low light conditions and can thrive for years in the shade of taller trees like Western red cedar and Douglas-fir. Mature trees are commonly about 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter but can grow as large as 8 feet (2.4 m) in diameter and 200 feet (60 m) tall if they get enough space. The Western hemlock growing in this gap has a long way to go!  </p> <p paraeid=\"{4a622c9e-c5c6-4c5f-a853-55895cdd0cc4}{176}\" paraid=\"703045045\">Many trees, like this hemlock, are also draped with layers of mosses and lichens in every shade of green. These are epiphytes - \"air plants\" that grow on other plants. Epiphytes rely on host trees for support but not nutrients. They get their nourishment from air, falling rain, and the compost that lies on tree branches.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{4a622c9e-c5c6-4c5f-a853-55895cdd0cc4}{190}\" paraid=\"2087401546\"> </p>",

But emerging from the protection of the canopy can be risky. These tall trees are battered by winds and storms, which sometimes knock them to the ground. At this stop, the Carbon River Trail cuts through an old growth Douglas-fir tree (its uprooted stump is on the left side of the trail with the main trunk on the right side of the trail) and the remains of a large Western red cedar (<em>Thuja plicata</em>) that fell along the left side of the trail just past the fallen Douglas-fir tree.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{69ca8c74-53a6-4a9a-87c0-1a077dd78ef6}{29}\" paraid=\"1565520526\">Notice the bright red color of the Western red cedar wood and its distinctive scent. Due to oils in the wood, Western red cedar is naturally resistant to water, rot, and insect decay. Cedar has been used by native people for generations and continues to be used for traditional purposes today. The wood is easy to carve to create canoes or tools and can be split to form cedar shakes and boards. The bark is collected and used as a fiber in making baskets and clothing. At Mount Rainier National Park, many of the park buildings use cedar shakes for roofing materials, and many trail bridges are built out of cedar boards.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{69ca8c74-53a6-4a9a-87c0-1a077dd78ef6}{71}\" paraid=\"217470127\">NOTE: It is illegal to collect or remove any cedar wood from the park.  </p>",

The trailhead is located across the road. Parking is very limited and can fill early on sunny summer days. Have an alternate destination in mind. <br /> <br /> The trail climbs steadily for 3.5 miles through the forest on a series of switchbacks to reach the lakes. According to legend, these lakes were named after Yakama Chief \"Owhi,\" who loaned horses to Theodore Winthrop (after whom the Winthrop Glacier was named), when Winthrop was on a trek across the cascades in the mid-1850s. Although this hike offers no views of Mount Rainier, it does offer an array of secluded mountain lakes and meadows aglow with wildflowers in mid-summer. The jagged cliffs of Governors Ridge rise high above the lakes to the east while Tamanos Mountain lies directly west.<br /> <br /> Return back to White River, or the trail continues and descends down into the Ohanapecosh River Valley where it connects to the Eastside Trail at Deer Creek, an additional 4.9 miles. From Deer Creek, a trail (0.4 miles) connects to SR123 where a second vehicle can be parked. If returning to White River, the trail is 7 miles round trip with 1,350 feet of elevation gain.<br /> <br /> Tamanos Creek Camp is located among the trees three miles from the trailhead, 0.5 miles short of the lakes. Although the creek is often dry by late summer, Owyhigh Lakes provide a reliable source of water. Treat water before drinking. A <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/wilderness-permit.htm\">wilderness permit</a> is required to camp. Permits and current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Owyhigh Lakes Trailhead parking area is a paved pullout along the White River Road, with the trailhead on the opposite side of the road from the parking.

In the spring and summer enjoy the many wildflowers that decorate the mountainside. In winter Paradise offers a winter wonderland, receiving on average 643 inches (53.6 feet/16.3 meters) of snow in a year. Winter activities include snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, and sledding. The road between Longmire and Paradise is plowed but closes at night during the winter. <br /> <br /> Paradise is located just south of Mount Rainier and is 19 miles (30 kilometers) east of the Nisqually Entrance. The park's main visitor center, the <strong>Henry M. Jackson Memorial Visitor Center</strong>, is located in the upper parking area and is open in the summer and with limited days and hours in the winter. Inside the visitor center are accessible restrooms, an information desk staffed by a ranger or volunteer, food services, gift shop, park movie, and exhibits about the plants, animals, and the volcano. Stop by the Paradise Wilderness Information Center (WIC), located between the visitor center and Paradise Inn for climbing information and permits during the summer. <br /> <br /> Located on the east side of the upper parking lot, the historic <strong>Paradise Inn </strong>is open during the summer season. Built in 1917, the Paradise Inn allows people to take photos of rustic architecture, enjoy a meal in the dining room, or just relax and enjoy the stately lobby.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{202cff50-a7d8-41a4-8073-d1a34cf728c9}{222}\" paraid=\"1696351944\"><strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Open year-round, weather permitting, Paradise offers the best recreational opportunities no matter the season. In the spring and summer take the one mile round-trip trek on the Skyline Trail to Myrtle Falls. The trailhead is located on the north side of the upper parking lot, next to the visitor center. Suitable for wheelchairs with help, and strollers this trail offers an iconic view of a waterfall in front of a Mount Rainier backdrop. In winter check out the Nisqually Vista Trail which leaves from the lower Paradise parking lot. This trail is 1.2 miles round-trip and offers excellent views of the Nisqually River drainage. Many trails start from the Muir steps (pictured) at Paradise, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/skyline-trail.htm\">Skyline Trail</a> to Panorama Point or continue on the big jaunt to Camp Muir. Whatever your skill level, Paradise has something to offer and excellent views in all seasons waiting just outside your vehicle. Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/paradise.htm\">Paradise</a>.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The main park road passes Longmire and makes its way to Paradise. As you pass the Paradise Sign with a National Park Service logo that says, \"Paradise Mount Rainier National Park National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior Elevation 5,400 feet.\" Just past the sign on the left will be the lower Paradise parking lot. As you continue to the upper lot the Jackson Visitor Center comes into view. The visitor center building is two stories tall. The sides of the exterior are carved blocks of mottled gray and white granite speckled with black and planks of wood. Floor to ceiling multi-paned windows, trimmed in light green, fill most of the north and south sides. The smooth, gray metal roof has a steep slope to the north and south from its center peak. To the north of the visitor center you see the gray stone Muir steps that begin a lot of trails at Paradise the steps say, \"...the most luxuriant and the most extravagantly beautiful of all the alpine gardens I ever beheld in all my mountain-top wanderings. -John Muir, conservationist, 1889.\" Restrooms and the old ranger station are just to the right of the Muir steps.

The Inn's architecture provides a clue - the steep roof is designed to shed heavy snow. On a larger scale, extreme annual snowfalls have created enormous glaciers that radiate from the summit of Mount Rainier. <br /> <br /> <em>\"Living under a mountainous snowdrift we could not hear the wind. The huge wooden building would creak and groan every night as the snow settled and bore down upon it... It often happened that our first evidence of a storm outside was to wake up at eight o'clock in the morning in midnight darkness. The tunnels had all been snowed over or drifted full in the night.\"</em> - Floyd Schmoe, early Park Naturalist, who wintered at Paradise Inn, 1920.<br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Annual snowfall is recorded at the Paradise Weather Station in the Paradise meadows, July 1 - June 30. <br /> <br /> During a year of extreme snowfall, Paradise Inn gets almost completely buried. <br /> <br /> This close to the coast, Mount Rainier is a magnet for storms. At moisture-laden Pacific air is forced to rise steeply, it cools and percipitates heavily on these slopes.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single photo of the Paradise Inn in winter fills the exhibit panel.

    "bodyText": "<h4><b>Title: Paradise Historic District</b></h4> <p><b>Main Text</b><br /> Since the late 1890s Paradise has served as a base camp for people attracted to the spectacular wildflower meadows and high-mountain recreation. Built between 1916 and 1942, structures at Paradise were designed in an alpine rustic style. Massive timbers and glacial boulders blended the buildings with their natural surroundings. Steeply pitched roofs shed heavy snow loads. Many of the original buildings remain at Paradise, which was designated a historic district in 1990.<br /> <br /> As you walk the area, investigate the buildings’ individual histories, from the Guide House to the Paradise Ranger Station. History here evokes a continuity of spirit. Car and clothing styles may have changed, but people continue to travel to Paradise to visit the meadows and experience the mountain.<br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> The Mount Rainier National Historic Landmark District includes the park road system, the Wonderland Trail, most of the major developed areas, and some backcountry ranger cabins. The district was designated to preserve this outstanding example of early park planning and National Park Service rustic architecture of the 1920s and 1930s.<br /> <br /> <b>Map Labels</b><br /> 1 - Cabins<br /> 2 - Ski Dorm<br /> 3 - Lodge<br /> 4 - Community Building<br /> 5 - Henry M.

To the right of the main text are two small black and white photos. One labeled “Paradise Inn, 1948” shows a large wood building with a steeply angled roof and rows of old-style vehicles parked in front. Text below the photo reads “Room without bath, one or two persons - $3.00. Room with bath, one or two persons - $4.00. From the Paradise winter brochure, 1939-1940.” The second photo shows a large white tent surrounded by smaller tents, with a ranger standing in front and the peak of a glaciated mountain rising above the tents. Text below the second photo reads “Before Paradise Inn, a tent city called “Camp of the Clouds” operated from 1898 to 1915 near Alta Vista. Tourists arrived here by stagecoach.” The secondary text and map labels overlap the map filling the lower portion of the exhibit panel on the left side, under the main text. The map shows a simplified layout of the current Paradise area, with roads and existing buildings labeled, and historic locations of structures marked by yellow squares or yellow highlighted circles. From the left side of the panel the Paradise Road curves up to the lower parking lot, with the Paradise Picnic Area loop road branching off it. Overlaying the picnic area are numerous small yellow squares labeled “1”. Overlapping the lower parking lot are three rectangles labeled “2” (towards the end of the parking loop), “3” (middle of loop), and “4” (just below the parking loop). Above and slightly overlapping the lower parking lot is a circle labeled “5”. The Paradise Road continues up from the lower parking lot towards the right side of the exhibit panel to the upper parking lot, where the Paradise Visitor Center, Guide House, Restrooms, and Paradise Inn are labeled. A “You are here” label points out a location of the south side of the Paradise Inn. Above and to the left of the Paradise Visitor Center a narrow oval is marked “6”. A small oval below the Paradise Inn and two large ovals below the upper parking lot are also labeled “6”. A dotted line heading up from the Guide House is labeled “7”. A small L-shaped rectangle next to the Paradise Visitor Center is labeled “8”. A small square below the Guide House is marked “9”. A small box in the lower right corner of the exhibit panel reads \"User Fee Project. Your Fee Dollars at Work. Entrance fees were used to produce this exhibit\".<br /> <br /> <b>Visit This Exhibit Panel</b><br /> This exhibit panel is located on the porch on the south side of the Paradise Inn. The Paradise Inn is open during the summer only, typically from May to September, and the exhibit panel is only installed during the summer as well. While the Paradise area is open year-round, the area around the Paradise Inn is covered in deep snow during the winter.</p> <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Paradise Inn porch is wood, with a portion covered by a wood roof supported by large wood beams and framed by a log fence. The Paradise Historic District exhibit panel is a large rectangular panel in a metal frame attached to a single, large log base set against the log fence. The view from the exhibit panel overlooks a section of subalpine meadow overgrown with small subalpine fir trees and shrubs towards the upper parking lot and a view of the Tatoosh Range, a line of rocky peaks. Towards the right, the peaked roofs of neighboring buildings rise above the trees and parking lot, including the guide house, ranger station, and visitor center. The porch is often crowded with tables and chairs.

    "bodyText": "<p>The Paradise Inn is open generally from late May through September. This historic building, which opened in 1917, allows people to take photos of historic architecture, enjoy a meal in the dining room, or just relax and enjoy the stately lobby. The inn features 121 rooms for overnight guests. Rooms do not include modern amenities such as internet, telephone, and television. A gift shop, café, and dining room are all located within the Paradise Inn. Guests are invited to imagine an earlier time when life was simple without the distractions of today’s modern world.</p> <p>The lure of Paradise has drawn people to the slopes of Mount Rainier for millennia. Local tribes like the Nisqually, Yakama, Puyallup, Cowlitz, and others, traveled to the Paradise meadows to hunt and gather. Early mountain climbers scaling the glaciers, used Paradise as a way stop. Paradise’s wildflower meadows also became a destination for some of the first tourists to the mountain. Before the creation of Mount Rainier National Park in 1899, people recognized a need for accommodations at Paradise. Construction of the Paradise Inn began the summer of 1916. Ground was broken on July 20, and most of the lobby, dining room, and rooms above the dining room, were completed that first summer. Opening on July 1, 1917, the inn had thirty-seven guest rooms and a dining room that could accommodate 400. Distinctive furnishing enhanced the lobby, including woodwork of the registration desk, two massive cedar tables and chairs, a mail drop “stump”, and cases for the 14 foot tall clock and the piano.</p> <p>After World War I, enough guests were staying at the lodge that the company could start building again. The Paradise Inn Annex, once completed, more than doubled the size of the inn, providing 104 more guest rooms. Structural braces were added to the timbers to help with the extra stress of long winters. Time and weather have not been kind to the Paradise Inn. Mount Rainier National Park has worked to renovate the structure while maintaining the historical aspects that make the Paradise Inn a unique place to visit. With this work, the National Park Service hopes that future visitors will continue to see and enjoy the historic, rustic beauty of the Paradise Inn.</p> <p>For audio description of the exhibit panel in this location, refer to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/paradise-inn-exhibit-panel.htm\">Paradise Inn Exhibit Panel</a>.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Paradise Inn is a large wooden building with a steeply-pitched roof, and two stone fireplaces. The first floor is lined with floor to ceiling windows, that are lined in green trim, facing the mountain. A wrap around porch with tables is around the south end of the building. The second floor features gabled windows looking out towards the meadows at Paradise. In the winter the entire building can be covered by snow. The exhibit panel is located in front of a small island, covered in meadow vegetation, in the parking area in front of the Paradise Inn. There is an entrance on the southwest side of the building. In the grand lobby, large timbers and a massive stone fireplace greet you as you enter. Tables and chairs from an earlier time, made of wood, grace the center of the floor. A historic piano once played by President Harry S. Truman sits on the edge of the room. Note the hand painted luminaries that adore the ceiling as you continue straight past the row of tables just before turning left to follow along the far wall. As you are continuing along the wall, past the café and the gift shop towards the north end of the building, you will see the large corner desk that is the main front desk for the Paradise Inn. If you continue north, through a doorway and down a few steps, the room opens up again to a large dining room. The dining room features floor to ceiling windows on both sides, with excellent views. Tables are set in neat rows to allow for dining, with table clothes embellishing the tops. Staff are there to greet you as you enter the hall and seat you accordingly. A hallway to the northeast of the main desk, leads you to the Paradise Inn Annex. The Annex features long hallways with rooms on either side and windows on the end. There are 121 rooms throughout the multi-floored annex building for you to enjoy your stay.",

    "bodyText": "<p>In the 1930s, winter-time access to Paradise brought more opportunities for winter recreation. Ski races and even Olympic tryouts were held in Paradise. The first tow rope at Paradise was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937. It was installed in 1938 and went to the top of Alta Vista.</p> <p>After World War II, returning soldiers with wartime ski training made downhill skiing very popular in the U.S. As demand for downhill skiing grew in the 1940s and 1950s, demand also grew to install more lifts and ski jumps at Paradise. Park managers had one firm rule; whatever was put up for the ski season had to be brought down before summer. After all, who wants to see a line of chairlift supports and cables running through their favorite meadow?</p> <p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, downhill skiing grew in popularity in the U.S. and more folks from the Puget Sound wanted to drive up to Paradise to ski. As their demand for ski opportunities at Paradise peaked, a new answer arrived. The U.S. Forest Service began leasing land to downhill ski groups outside the park at Crystal Mountain and White Pass. There developers could build all the lifts, jumps and gondolas that downhill skiers demanded. Other winter activities replaced downhill skiing at Paradise. Cross-country and back-country skiing replaced downhill skiing. Instead of needing lifts and gondolas, these skiers would “skin up” hills under their own power and then ski down. The rope tow operated until the 1970s. Today the building that powered the rope tow remains. The interior is closed to visitors.</p> <p>For decades, rangers, volunteers, and staff have worked to balance the needs of visitors and the protection of the meadows and other natural resources. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/harmonizing-paradise.htm\">Bringing harmony to Paradise</a> is still a work in progress today.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>In the 1930s, winter-time access to Paradise brought more opportunities for winter recreation. Ski races and even Olympic tryouts were held in Paradise. The first tow rope at Paradise was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937. It was installed in 1938 and went to the top of Alta Vista.</p> <p>After World War II, returning soldiers with wartime ski training made downhill skiing very popular in the U.S. As demand for downhill skiing grew in the 1940s and 1950s, demand also grew to install more lifts and ski jumps at Paradise. Park managers had one firm rule; whatever was put up for the ski season had to be brought down before summer. After all, who wants to see a line of chairlift supports and cables running through their favorite meadow?</p> <p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, downhill skiing grew in popularity in the U.S. and more folks from the Puget Sound wanted to drive up to Paradise to ski. As their demand for ski opportunities at Paradise peaked, a new answer arrived. The U.S. Forest Service began leasing land to downhill ski groups outside the park at Crystal Mountain and White Pass. There developers could build all the lifts, jumps and gondolas that downhill skiers demanded. Other winter activities replaced downhill skiing at Paradise. Cross-country and back-country skiing replaced downhill skiing. Instead of needing lifts and gondolas, these skiers would “skin up” hills under their own power and then ski down. The rope tow operated until the 1970s. Today the building that powered the rope tow remains. The interior is closed to visitors.</p> <p>For decades, rangers, volunteers, and staff have worked to balance the needs of visitors and the protection of the meadows and other natural resources. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/harmonizing-paradise.htm\">Bringing harmony to Paradise</a> is still a work in progress today.</p>",

Using the trail that James Longmire built from Ashford to Longmire and then up to Paradise, people found a rustic campground awaiting them as early 1895. John Reese started developing his Camp of the Clouds in 1898 with tents for guests and a dining tent on the shoulder of Alta Vista, just above where the Jackson Visitor Center stands today. Working with the U.S. Forest Service and then the National Park Service (NPS), Reese ran his camp in the summers, gradually expanding its size until 1916. The government constructed a rough road that reached Camp of the Clouds in 1910. Visitors were driving their cars up by 1912, creating a big increase in the number of people at Paradise.</p> <p>By 1927, about 50,000 cars entered the park, bringing many visitors, guests, and campers to Paradise throughout the summer. More people required more facilities. Where the lower parking lot is today, a community building was constructed for campground ranger programs and activities. Camp of the Clouds closed in 1930, replaced by 275 cabins near the community building and then a new Paradise Lodge in 1931 in between the community building and cabins.</p> <p>While the tent camps no longer exist, the meadows themselves are included within the historic district because they have been an inextricable part of the patterns of human activity in the area over the last 100 years.</p>",

This historic building, which opened in 1917, allows people to take photos of historic architecture, enjoy a meal in the dining room, or just relax and enjoy the stately lobby. The inn features 121 rooms for overnight guests. Rooms do not include modern amenities such as internet, telephone, and television. A gift shop, café, and dining room are all located within the Paradise Inn. Guests are invited to imagine an earlier time when life was simple without the distractions of today’s modern world.</p> <p>The lure of Paradise has drawn people to the slopes of Mount Rainier for millennia. Local tribes like the Nisqually, Yakama, Puyallup, Cowlitz, and others, traveled to the Paradise meadows to hunt and gather. Early mountain climbers scaling the glaciers, used Paradise as a way stop. Paradise’s wildflower meadows also became a destination for some of the first tourists to the mountain. Before the creation of Mount Rainier National Park in 1899, people recognized a need for accommodations at Paradise. Construction of the Paradise Inn began the summer of 1916. Ground was broken on July 20, and most of the lobby, dining room, and rooms above the dining room, were completed that first summer. Opening on July 1, 1917, the inn had thirty-seven guest rooms and a dining room that could accommodate 400. Distinctive furnishing enhanced the lobby, including woodwork of the registration desk, two massive cedar tables and chairs, a mail drop “stump”, and cases for the 14 foot tall clock and the piano. After World War I, enough guests were staying at the lodge that the company could start building again. The Paradise Inn Annex, once completed, more than doubled the size of the inn, providing 104 more guest rooms. Structural braces were added to the timbers to help with the extra stress of long winters. Time and weather have not been kind to the Paradise Inn. Mount Rainier National Park has worked to renovate the structure while maintaining the historical aspects that make the Paradise Inn a unique place to visit. With this work, the National Park Service hopes that future visitors will continue to see and enjoy the historic, rustic beauty of the Paradise Inn.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Paradise Inn is a large wooden building with a steeply-pitched roof, and two stone fireplaces. The first floor is lined with floor to ceiling windows, that are lined in green trim, facing the mountain. A wrap around porch with tables is around the south end of the building. The second floor features gabled windows looking out towards the meadows at Paradise. In the winter the entire building can be covered by snow. There is an entrance on the southwest side of the building. In the grand lobby, large timbers and a massive stone fireplace greet you as you enter. Tables and chairs from an earlier time, made of wood, grace the center of the floor. A historic piano once played by President Harry S. Truman sits on the edge of the room. Note the hand painted luminaries that adore the ceiling as you continue straight past the row of tables just before turning left to follow along the far wall. As you are continuing along the wall, past the café and the gift shop towards the north end of the building, you will see the large corner desk that is the main front desk for the Paradise Inn. If you continue north, through a doorway and down a few steps, the room opens up again to a large dining room. The dining room features floor to ceiling windows on both sides, with excellent views. Tables are set in neat rows to allow for dining, with table clothes embellishing the tops. Staff are there to greet you as you enter the hall and seat you accordingly. A hallway to the northeast of the main desk, leads you to the Paradise Inn Annex. The Annex features long hallways with rooms on either side and windows on the end. There are 121 rooms throughout the multi-floored annex building for you to enjoy your stay.",

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Season: Year-Round</b> <br /> <i>Summer/Fall (July - September)</i>: Paradise is an extremely popular destination. To avoid congestion, visit earlier or later in the day or on a weekday.  <br /> <i>Winter/Spring (October - June)</i>: The Paradise Meadows are covered in deep snow in winter, but the area remains open for snowshoeing and other winter recreation. The road to Paradise closes nightly at the gate at Longmire typically from November to mid-April depending on weather; always check road status before starting your trip. Snow can linger well into June or even July.  <br /> <br /> Starting from the Muir Steps, a set of steps inscribed with a quote by John Muir, a network of trails weave through the famous subalpine meadows of Paradise. There is a ramp to access the trails to the right of the Muir Steps. Views along the trails include Mount Rainier as well as the Tatoosh Range, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and the Cascade Range. Look for wildlife, including black-tailed deer, marmots, and birds, in the meadows. The meadows fill with a wide variety of flowers, with peak bloom in late July or early August, and can have colorful fall foliage starting in September. During the winter, trails in Paradise are covered by a deep layer of snow and are mostly unmarked. Snowshoers should have experience with route finding and avalanche terrain. Always check current conditions before heading out and be prepared with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/hiking-safety.htm\">Ten Essentials</a>.<br /> <br /> Please do not feed any wildlife. Stay on the trail at all times to protect the delicate subalpine vegetation. Pets are not allowed on trails. Download a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/upload/2019-Paradise-Area-Trails_508.pdf\">Paradise Area Trails Map</a> or pick up a map from a ranger at the Jackson Visitor Center before starting your hike.<br /> <br /> <b>Skyline Trail - </b>5.5 miles round-trip, 1700 feet elevation gain.<br /> The Skyline Trail is the premiere loop trail through the Paradise Meadows. There are several side trails to modify the main route, which may add or decrease the total trail length and elevation change of your hike.<br /> <br /> Hiking the loop clockwise, the trail climbs 2 miles until reaching Panorama Point, where a toilet is provided for hikers. Past Panorama Point use of the High Skyline Trail avoids a dangerous icy slope that does not melt. This connects back to the Skyline above the junction with Golden Gate trail (an alternative for a shorter hike). Another 0.75 mile and the Skyline Trail reaches the Stevens-Van Trump Memorial and its junction with the Paradise Glacier Trail. From there it descends into the Paradise Valley, then climbs slightly to Myrtle Falls and finally back to Paradise.<br /> <br /> <b>Deadhorse Creek Trail and Moraine Trail</b> - 2.5 miles round-trip, 400 feet elevation gain.<br /> For excellent views of the Nisqually Glacier, follow Deadhorse Creek Trail to Glacier Vista and return via the Skyline Trail.<br /> <br /> <b>Alta Vista via the Alta Vista and Skyline Trails</b> - 1.75 miles round-trip, 600 feet elevation gain.<br /> Follow the Skyline Trail and then climb up to Alta Vista at 5,940 feet for views of Mount Rainier and the surrounding Paradise Meadows. Return via the Alta Vista Trail.<br /> <br /> <b>Lakes Trail Loop, via Reflection Lake</b> - 5 miles round-trip, 1300 feet elevation gain.<br /> This trail follows the southern portion of the Skyline Trail to connect to the Lakes Trail and loop around the Paradise Valley. Consider parking at Reflection Lakes and hiking up to Paradise, then returning downhill to your vehicle.<br /> <br /> <b>Skyline Trail to Myrtle Falls</b> - 1 mile round-trip, 100 feet elevation gain.<br /> Suitable for wheelchairs with help and strollers, this easy portion of the Skyline Trail leads to a scenic waterfall with views of Mount Rainier.<br /> <br /> <b>Nisqually Vista Trail - </b>1.2 miles round-trip, 200 feet elevation gain.<br /> Connect to the Nisqually Vista Trail from the main Paradise Meadows Trailhead or start this trail from the west end of lower Paradise parking lot. This easy trail features viewpoints overlooking the Nisqually Glacier and Nisqually River Valley.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Muir Steps, and the trailhead to the Paradise Meadows, is on the north side of the Paradise upper parking lot, between the Jackson Visitor Center and the Plaza (slate) restrooms. The steps are light grey stone and framed by low stone walls and lead up to a paved path that heads through the meadows towards the summit of Mount Rainier. On the vertical sides of the steps text reads \"\"...the most luxuriant and most extravagantly beautiful of all the / alpine gardens I have ever beheld in all my mountain-top wanderings.\"/ - John Muir, conservationist, 1889.\" A three-panel wayside with trail information stands to the left of the steps while a long paved trail provides a ramp around the steps on the right side. The paved trails in Paradise are approximately 6-8 feet across. Edges of the trail can be rough with some short drops due to erosion and is often bordered by a low rope to discourage off-trail hiking. The trail is completely snow covered in winter, with patches of snow and ice lingering into June or July. As the trails climb in elevation, paved trails give way to narrower dirt trails often broken by rock steps and uneven terrain. The portion of the Skyline Trail to Myrtle Falls and most of the Nisqually Vista Trail have a medium-to-gentle slope. The trails are surrounded by patches of lush subalpine meadow, filled with blooming wildflowers during the summer months, and interspersed with patches of subalpine firs and mountain hemlock trees.",

The overlook is not paved but is roughly level with packed dirt and bordered by a low fence of logs spanning between stone posts. The wayside is attached to a stone post in the fence. The wayside overlooks a deep valley on the slopes of Mount Rainier. A glacier flows from the summit of Mount Rainier and into the valley, terminating about half way down.

All are large, active volcanoes that line the western edge of North America from Northern California to Southern British Columbia. This chain of volcanoes, part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, is growing above the collision zone of oceanic and continental plates. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens displayed the power of Cascade volcanoes. The effects were catastrophic, but much larger eruptions have occurred in the past. With large populations nearby, Mount Rainier is potentially dangerous because its huge volumes of snow and ice could generate deadly lahars. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single photo looking south out over the Paradise Meadows towards the Tatoosh Range and distant volcanic peaks on a clear day fills the exhibit panel. The peaks are labeled, left to right, as Goat Rocks, Mount Adams (in the distance behind the Tatoosh Range), Mount Hood (very far and faint in the distance), Castle Peak, Pinnacle Peak, Plummer Peak, and Mount St. Helens (also in the distance behind the Tatoosh Range). The main text is in the upper left corner of the panel against the blue sky of the photo. To the right of the main text is a map of a portion of the west coast of North America, showing the Cascade Range stretching from Northern California to Southern British Columbia.

Several peaks are not labeled. A caption next to the map reads: \"Nineteen major volcanoes appear in a chain of fire from northern California to British Columbia.\" The secondary text is to the right of the map in the upper right corner of the panel. A small box in the lower left corner of the exhibit panel reads \"User Fee Project.

At this middle elevation, the trees are smaller than the lush old growth near Nisqually Entrance and Ohanapecosh. Here the vegetation must adapt to fierce winters, heavy snow, intense cold, and a shorter growing season. <br /> <br /> Higher still, at Paradise, the adaptions are even more extreme. Subalpine fir grows in island-like clusters in response to almost perpetual snow. Throughout the park the look of the forest gives clues to climate and elevation - a sense of where you are on the mountain. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Pacific silver fir is abundant at this elevation. Here seedlings must be able to survive heavy snow. In areas where fire or blowdown has occured, noble fir may dominate. A mix of forest might also indicate recovery from mudslide or avalanche. <br /> <br /> Some forest adaptions are subtle. Look for the \"skirting\" effect on trees with stunted upper branches and longer, denser branches near the ground. Harsh winds stunt the higher branches, while snow protects the lower growth. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text stretches across the top third of the exhibit panel in a band with a green background.

    "bodyText": "<p>In the 1930s, winter-time access to Paradise brought more opportunities for winter recreation. Ski races and even Olympic tryouts were held in Paradise. The first tow rope at Paradise was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937. It was installed in 1938 and went to the top of Alta Vista.</p> <p>After World War II, returning soldiers with wartime ski training made downhill skiing very popular in the U.S. As demand for downhill skiing grew in the 1940s and 1950s, demand also grew to install more lifts and ski jumps at Paradise. Park managers had one firm rule; whatever was put up for the ski season had to be brought down before summer. After all, who wants to see a line of chairlift supports and cables running through their favorite meadow?</p> <p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, downhill skiing grew in popularity in the U.S. and more folks from the Puget Sound wanted to drive up to Paradise to ski. As their demand for ski opportunities at Paradise peaked, a new answer arrived. The U.S. Forest Service began leasing land to downhill ski groups outside the park at Crystal Mountain and White Pass. There developers could build all the lifts, jumps and gondolas that downhill skiers demanded. Other winter activities replaced downhill skiing at Paradise. Cross-country and back-country skiing replaced downhill skiing. Instead of needing lifts and gondolas, these skiers would “skin up” hills under their own power and then ski down. The rope tow operated until the 1970s. Today the building that powered the rope tow remains. The interior is closed to visitors.</p> <p>For decades, rangers, volunteers, and staff have worked to balance the needs of visitors and the protection of the meadows and other natural resources. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/harmonizing-paradise.htm\">Bringing harmony to Paradise</a> is still a work in progress today.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "The Paradise Valley Road is a paved single-lane road with a wide parking lane along the right side of the road. The road is roughly horseshoe-shaped, with one end of the horseshoe starting from the Paradise upper parking lot, then descending in a long curve around the western edge of the valley, crossing the Paradise River at the top of the horseshoe at the head of the valley, and then continuing to descend the eastern side of the valley to connect to Stevens Canyon Road at the bottom of the valley. A small bridge with low stone walls crosses over the Paradise River and the 4th crossing trailhead is located just past the bridge on the left side of the road. The trail starts with stone steps climbing up along the edge of the Paradise River, which tumbles over rocks. On the right side of the road just past the bridge is a large, paved pullout. The valley slopes are covered in patches of open subalpine meadow and clumps of subalpine fir and mountain hemlock trees. Mount Rainier’s glaciated summit rises above the valley to the north and the Tatoosh Range is visible if looking down valley.",

    "audioDescription": "The main Alta Vista Trail and East Alta Vista trail meet at this three-way junction, the two trails combining to continue steeply downhill. Both trails are paved but the pavement can be very uneven, with abrupt edges, broken-off sections, and potholes filled with gravel or dirt. A large roughly triangular-shaped boulder rests between the upper “V” of the trails, with some social trails eroded into the meadows behind the boulder. Logs serving as benches are set on either side of the boulder next to each trail. Alta Vista Peak is the top of a ridge to the northwest, its slopes covered in patches of fir trees and subalpine meadows. The peak partly blocks the view of the west flank of Mount Rainier’s summit.

    "audioDescription": "The East Skyline Trail is a wide paved trail that gently cuts across the meadow slopes in this location. The meadows are broken by numerous patches of fir trees, with Mount Rainier’s snowy peak just visible between the trees to the north. The Guide House Connector Trail is also paved, but narrower, and climbs steeply to the north. To the south, the connector trail widens and wraps around an exhibit panel installed on a low rock stand in the middle of the trail. The exhibit panel is oriented so that it overlooks the Paradise Inn to the east. A trail branches off to the right to connect to the guide house while another trail past the exhibit panel descends into the upper parking lot in front of the Paradise Inn.

    "audioDescription": "The “Dancefloor” is a large, flat paved area surrounded by subalpine meadows and excellent views of Mount Rainier. The Dancefloor forms a rough rectangle. If oriented to the north, with the peak of Mount Rainier slightly to the left in the northwest, the uphill branch of the Skyline Trail leaves from roughly the middle of the rectangle, climbing up a ridge line. The uphill trail is dirt and gravel, broken by wood steps. The downhill side of the Skyline Trail starts from the lower left corner of the rectangle and is paved. The edges of the paved trail can be abrupt. The Alta Vista Trail starts in the lower right corner of the rectangle (opposite side of the Dancefloor from Mount Rainier). It is a narrower dirt trail. A short distance from the Dancefloor the Alta Vista Trail splits, with one branch steeply climbing up to a nearby rocky peak, while the other branch more gently descends around the side of the peak. Benches made from large logs frame the right side of the Dancefloor.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Nearly a century ago, one of the main attractions in the park was the Paradise-Stevens Glacier area. At that time, Paradise-Stevens Glacier was riddled with ice caves and crevasses and was within easy walking distance of major roads. An 1896 map of the glacier places its terminus within 0.6 mile (1 km) of Sluiskin Falls. However, by the 1970s the glacier area had decreased to less than 50% of its 1896 area and separated into two small segments of stagnant ice (glacier ice no longer in motion). The rapid melting of the ice left behind a large area strewn with boulders and rubble carried by the glacier and its meltwater streams, providing visitors with an uncommon opportunity to observe the rock features at the bed of a glacier.</p> <p>In 2023, the Stevens Glacier was officially removed from the Park’s inventory, due to its lack of features indicating flow, and therefore is no longer a glacier but instead a perennial snowfield.</p> <p><strong>Viewing Paradise-Stevens Glacier</strong>: From Paradise, take the Skyline Trail counter-clockwise for 1.8 miles to the junction with the Paradise Glacier Trail.

NOTE: From May 24 - September 2, 2024, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/timed-entry-reservations.htm\">timed entry reservations</a> are required to enter the Paradise Corridor, which includes Reflection Lakes, between 7:00 am and 3:00 pm. <br /> <br /> This popular destination is named for lakes that reflect views of Mount Rainier. During the summer, hikers must <b>stay on trails</b> at all times to protect the delicate subalpine meadows around the lake. Boating and fishing is not permitted in Reflection Lakes. During the winter, snowshoers and hikers can still access the area and winter camp around the snow-covered lake. <br /> <br /> <b>Hiking</b><br /> Several trails intersect around Reflection Lakes. The <b>Lakes Trail</b> is an approximately three-mile loop trail that starts from either end of the parking lots next to the lakes. Starting from the west side of the lake, the trail climbs up to the ridge above the lake, follows the ridge to Faraway Rock, then descends back to the lake. Faraway Rock overlooks Louise Lake and Stevens Canyon to the east, as well as providing views to the southwest of the Tatoosh Range and Reflection Lakes. The trail is dirt, broken at times by tree roots and rocks. The eastern side of the loop from Faraway Rock to Reflection Lakes is steeper, with rock and log steps. Trails connecting to the Lakes Trail lead to Paradise through the Paradise Valley or along Mazama Ridge to the Skyline Trail.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/pinacle-peak.htm\">Pinnacle Peak Trail</a> is a popular 2.5-mile roundtrip trail that starts to the south of Reflection Lakes. The rocky trail climbs 1,050 feet up several switchbacks through subalpine meadows to a saddle between Pinnacle Peak and Plummer Peak in the Tatoosh Range. The trail can have patches of snow lingering well into summer and steep, exposed drop-offs. From the saddle, view Mount Rainier to the north or look south for glimpses of Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens. Pinnacle Peak Trail reaches the edge of the designated <b>Butter Creek Research Natural Area</b> (RNA). This is intended as a pristine natural area for ecological study and is closed to public use except pursuant to a scientific research permit, consistent with the national RNA system. Please <b>stay on the trail</b> and follow<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/\">Leave No Trace</a> principles.<br /> <br /> The <b>Wonderland Trail</b> also connects to Reflection Lakes. To the west, the Wonderland Trail descends towards Narada Falls, while to the east the trail follows Stevens Canyon.  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Reflection Lakes are tucked between Mount Rainier to the north and the Tatoosh Range to the south at the northwest end of Stevens Canyon. The lakes are surrounded by forest with patches of subalpine meadow around the shore. The largest of the Reflection Lakes is framed by Stevens Canyon Road, with long stretches of parking and paved sidewalks along the lake side. A secondary, smaller lake is to the east. The sidewalk along the road is bordered by a low rock wall with metal-framed wayside exhibits along the wall at two locations. Stone steps lead down to a dirt trail on either end of the parking and in the center. On the opposite side of the road from the center parking area is the trailhead for the Pinnacle Peak Trail, with a trail information sign in a wood frame to the right of the trailhead.",

A boat concession which began in 1927 and the stocking of non-native fish had unintended consequences: the lakeshore and surrounding meadows were damaged by increased recreational activity. Eventually the lakes were closed to fishing, boating, and swimming due to their negative impact on the lake ecosystem. Fish stocking was stopped in 1973. <br /> <br /> Now the National Park Service is taking steps to restore the area's beauty by clearly delineating trails and revegetating the spiderweb of informal paths and bare ground. You can help by staying on trails and never short-cutting. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> If the air and water are still - usually in early morning - the lake perfectly mirrors the mountain. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single black and white historic photo fills the exhibit panel with the main text stretching across the top third of the photo.

The Nisqually River valley lies to the northwest of the ridge and the Paradise River valley is to the southeast. A one-way scenic loop drive traces the edge of Ricksecker Point. The third of a mile-long road has two main pullouts featuring views of Mount Rainier, the Nisqually and Paradise river valleys, and the Tatoosh Range.

The road closes during the winter, typically from early November through mid-May.<br /> <br /> Ricksecker Point is a contributing component to the Mount Rainier National Historic Landmark District. Ricksecker Point is named for Eugene Ricksecker, an Army Corps of Engineers supervisor who surveyed the route to Paradise in 1904. The survey team originally named the feature “Gap Point”, but it was renamed after a road was constructed in 1909. Part of the original road to Paradise, the section around Ricksecker Point was considered one of the most dangerous stretches. It was narrow, bordered by steep cliffs, and prone to rockfall. Over the years the road was widened, resurfaced, and parking was included at viewpoints. A detour constructed in 1930 replaced the original route and became the main Paradise Road, while Ricksecker Point Road was left as a scenic bypass. In addition to providing excellent views, Ricksecker Point is an example of rustic style architecture that sought to blend with the natural environment. The road follows the curve of the ridge and guardwalls along the road use roughly cut, native stone. The stone guardwalls were constructed during the 1930s in part by the Civilian Conservation Corps.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Ricksecker Point is located at a promontory and forested ridge which projects between Rampart Ridgeand the Tatoosh Range. Nisqually River valley lies to the northwest of the ridge, and the Paradise River valley is to the southeast. The elevation of Ricksecker Point is 4200 feet. The topography of the road around Ricksecker Point maintains a relatively level 1% grade around the promontory. The road is generally 24 feet-wide, though the road widens in several places to form vehicular pullouts. Two pullouts are located along the first segment of the road, and one is located along the middle segment of the road between the two parking areas. The road and pullouts are bordered by a guardwall. The guardwall is 1 1/2 feet-wide, and 1 1/2 feet-high. The top of the guardwall is crenellated, with crenellations located at approximately every 18 feet. Ricksecker Point is organized as a series of overlooks to the outer edge of a road, which hugs the side of a steep promontory ridge. The road is one-third of a mile in length and follows a southwest orientation for about a quarter of its length away from the Road to Paradise; then turns and heads southeast for half its total length; then turns and heads north, to return to the Road to Paradise. The first, southwest trending segment of the road has two pullouts at the outer side of the road. This curvilinear segment is the most proximate to views of the Nisqually River Valley. The road turns to head southeast at a parking area known as the Nisqually Valley overlook parking area. This is the location of the earliest parking area and offers the most panoramic views at Ricksecker Point. The road then becomes less curvilinear and follows the orientation of the Paradise River valley. A very steep uphill slope bounds the road to the inside edge, and the stone guardwall and a steep downhill slope to the outer edge. This segment of the road offers magnificent views of the Tatoosh Range. One small pullout exists to the inner side at approximately half-way along this segment of the road. The road turns and heads north at another parking area, from where the Paradise River valley can be viewed. From here the road follows a relatively level road cut through silver fir and pines, to return to the Road to Paradise.",

After completing the road to Paradise in 1915, park officials saw a need for increasing vehicle access to the park and sought to construct a road “round-the-mountain\". Extending the national park boundaries to include Ohanapecosh in 1931 offered the opportunity for a better route in the southeastern section than previously available. This allowed for officials to proceed with the previously proposed East Side Highway, which would extend from Ohanapecosh to Cayuse Pass, and construction began the same year. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{eed42275-1f97-4eec-9734-9dd9cfa51f83}{220}\" paraid=\"680033770\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The East Side Highway was completed in 1940 and is now known as State Route 123. The archway for the entrance to the park was not included with the original construction of the road and was added in 1976 to give consistency with the look and feel of the historic Nisqually Entrance. The arch was constructed with peeled cedar logs and is in keeping with the signature rustic style seen throughout the park.</p>",

This became more possible after Washington State, with funding from the Bureau of Public Roads, began construction of a highway that is now the Mather Memorial Parkway.  </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{64d8b547-b68c-45cc-b223-acebdf7fabae}{167}\" paraid=\"581891442\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Although the section of highway within the park (from the north entrance to Chinook Pass) was completed in 1932, the entrance arch wasn’t constructed until 1977. This was the last entrance arch to be built in the park and was constructed with peeled cedar logs. While it is not considered to be a contribution to the period of significance for the Mather Memorial Parkway, the arch was constructed in the rustic style similar to the other entrance arches and is compatible with the historic architecture of the park. </p>",

At 2.7 miles round-trip, this loop trail only gains 600 feet of elevation, making it an excellent option for many ages and abilities! The trail runs parallel to the Ohanapecosh River before crossing it, leading hikers to a bridge with a stunning view of Silver Falls. The turquoise water churns below, turning white as the water rushes around rocks, and between the eroded walls of the small canyon. The trail continues along the other side of the Ohanapecosh River, leading hikers back to the campground.<br /> <br /> The trail has two trailheads in the Ohanapecosh Campground. Hikers can begin their journey from Loop B (near the visitor center), or across the river near the campground amphitheater. Watch children closely on this hike and do not venture on to the rocks, as they are very slick. There are no backcountry camps along this trail. Pets are not permitted. This trail is typically hikeable from May to October. The Ohanapecosh area is not accessible by vehicle in the winter months.<br /> <br /> <strong>Hiking</strong><br /> Hikers can access the <strong>Grove of the Patriarchs</strong> and the <strong>Eastside Trail </strong>from the Silver Falls Trail by traveling north at the north end of the loop rather than going back to Ohanapecosh. The <strong>Hot Springs Trail </strong>is also nearby, connecting to the Silver Falls trail behind the Ohanapecosh Visitor Center.",

The trailhead starts as a service road between the restroom facilities and the Sunrise Day Lodge. Keep to the right as you start walking up the road to reach the main trail or follow the road to the left to reach the Sunrise Picnic Area. At a large trail sign, follow the wide gravel trail climbing up the slope towards Sourdough Ridge. The road continues to the left to reach the upper side of the Sunrise Picnic Area and can be followed in a loop back to the parking lot.<br /> <br /> Views along the trails include Mount Rainier as well as the White River Valley, Cowlitz Chimneys, Mount Adams, and the Cascade Range. On very clear days, Mount Baker can be glimpsed to the north from Sourdough Ridge. Look for wildlife, including black-tailed deer, mountain goats, marmots, golden-mantled ground squirrels, and birds, in the meadows. The meadows fill with a wide variety of flowers, with peak bloom in mid-to-late July, and can have colorful fall foliage starting in September.<br /> <br /> Always check current conditions before heading out and be prepared with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/10essentials.htm\">Ten Essentials</a>. Please do not feed any <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/keep-wildlife-wild.htm\">wildlife</a>.

    "bodyText": "<p>Located on the southwest side of Mount Rainier, South Tahoma and Tahoma Glaciers are separate glaciers that were connected in the recent historical past. Today the two glaciers are separated by Glacier Island. Tahoma Glacier is south of the Puyallup Glacier and is separated from it by the Puyallup Cleaver. The South Tahoma Glacier is south of the Tahoma Glacier and separated from the Pyramid Glacier on the southeast by Success Cleaver.</p> <p>South Tahoma Glacier flows from a cirque into the Tahoma Creek Valley. Near its terminus the glacier becomes a stagnating mass of ice covered by rock that is nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding moraine. Tahoma Glacier flows from the summit as a single stream of ice before splitting into two lobes that empty into Tahoma Creek and Puyallup River valleys.</p> <p>Between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago the Tahoma and South Tahoma Glaciers were connected, forming a tributary to the ancient Nisqually Glacier. The two smaller glaciers were again connected during the Little Ice Age about 100 years ago and remained so until nearly the middle of the 1900s.</p> <p>Like other glaciers on Mount Rainier, South Tahoma produces periodic and sudden catastrophic floods. In August 1967, water stored within the glacier burst from the glacier surface at the 7,000 feet (2,133 m) level. This sudden flood severed the lower glacier into two halves and then mixed with rocks, mud, and trees, forming a debris flow that destroyed the former Tahoma Creek Campground. Since 1967, at least two dozen glacial outburst floods have undercut ice-laden moraine and formed debris flows that rushed down the Tahoma Creek valley, destroying trails, roads, and the former Tahoma Creek Picnic Area.</p> <p><strong>Viewing South Tahoma and Tahoma Glaciers:</strong> One of the best areas for viewing Tahoma Glacier is from the crest of Emerald Ridge along the Wonderland Trail.

In 1919-20, Superintendent Roger W. Toll reported the need for backcountry shelters to be placed ten to fifteen miles apart along the Wonderland Trail. Toll's system evolved into the construction of both patrol cabins and trail shelters under Superintendent O.A. Tomlinson's administration (1923-41). The St. Andrews Patrol Cabin was an early component of Superintendent Roger Toll's vision of a string of backcountry shelters to accommodate backcountry patrols and provide shelter for the hiking public; a policy that evolved and expanded under Superintendent Tomlinson's administration.</p> <p>The Superintendent's annual report for fiscal year 1922 reported the construction by the National Park Service of three patrol cabins on the west side of the park at Mowich Lake, St. Andrews Creek, and at Sunset Park.</p> <p>It is presently used in the summers as headquarters for backcountry rangers on patrol in Klapatche and St. Andrews Parks along the Wonderland Trail.

Shortly after crossing the creek at a small cascade, the trail climbs steeply for another 0.5 miles before reaching the open subalpine meadows of Summerland. The variety of subalpine wildflowers, panoramic views of Mount Rainier and Little Tahoma, and frequent sightings of mountain goats and other wildlife make this hike extremely popular. This is one of Mount Rainier's most crowded trails, hosting several hundred hikers per day on a nice summer weekend.

The trail is dirt, with sections of log or rock steps.<br /> <br /> Please hike only on the constructed trails and rest on nearby rocks.

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Season: Summer Only </b><i>(July - September)</i><br /> Sunrise is open during the summer only, typically from early July to late September (sometimes mid-October depending on weather). Wildflower peak bloom is typically late July or early August. Sunrise is an extremely popular destination. NOTE:<strong> From July 4 - September 2, 2024, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/timed-entry-reservations.htm\">timed entry reservations</a> are required to enter the Sunrise Corridor between 7:00 am and 3:00 pm. </strong></p> <p><br /> At 6,400 feet, Sunrise is the highest point one can drive to on the mountain with the summit 8,000 feet higher. Sitting in colorful subalpine meadows that turn bright reds and oranges in fall, Sunrise offers spectacular views of the mountain and glaciers. The area offers a visitor center with exhibits and a bookstore, ranger-led activities, a day lodge with a gift shop and restaurant, restrooms, and miles of trails. Arrive mid-week or early or late in the day to avoid the crowds.<br /> <br /> Sunrise is perched on top of the earliest lava flow from modern Mount Rainier. Numerous layers of ash sit upon this ancient flow and catalog a variety of more recent geologic events. Popcorn sized pieces of ash from an eruption that occurred 2,200 years ago litter the meadows surrounding the visitor center.<br /> <br /> One can clearly see the scar of a massive collapse of the northeastern side of the mountain that occurred 5,600 years ago. The Emmons Glacier covers part of what remains of this wound like a giant bandage. The long ridges that radiate out from the volcano were formed by their interaction with much larger ice-age glaciers. Fire on the mountain has always had to contend with ice. Rock from a 1963 rockslide off Little Tahoma insulates Emmons Glacier and slows the melting of the largest glacier in the contiguous United States.<br /> <br /> A thin soil layer has developed from volcanic deposits. This volcanic soil drains quickly, erodes easily, and retains little moisture. The mountain intercepts moisture-laden ocean air flowing inland. This air cools as it rises over the mountain, dropping most of its moisture as rain or snow on the western slope. These factors have led to the development of subalpine meadows interspersed with clumps of trees. The annual wildflower display here is very beautiful, but the drier conditions prevent the growth of the lush flower displays that one can see at Paradise. On the other hand, the dry side generally offers clearer views of the mountain. The beauty and tranquility of the meadow’s disguises the constant effort of plants struggling to survive in this subalpine ecosystem’s short growing season. Please stay on trails. Plants in this environment are easily damaged.<br /> <br /> The area’s buildings evoke a sense of the past with their log sidings, stone foundations, and cedar shakes. These buildings in the Sunrise National Historic Landmark District were intended to blend harmoniously with their environment.<br /> <br /> For thousands of years before development of the area, Native American people recognized the meadows as a productive place to hunt and gather a variety of animal and plant resources. Aside from hunting and gathering, it is reasonable to believe that these early visitors enjoyed and gained a sense of spiritual renewal from the mountain. These values continue to be important to Native American people to the present day.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Sunrise Road begins its ascent to Sunrise at its junction with White River Road and the turnoff to the White River Campground. Along the way, the road winds along the edge of a ridge through forests and past open slopes. Several hairpin turns make a sudden change of direction from north to west or east. In summer the roadsides are often dotted with colorful wildflowers and wildlife such as birds and squirrels are often in this area and, on occasion, elk, deer, and bear. At several points the road runs next to groupings of andesite columns that formed in the past from cooling lava. These columns are hexagonal in shape and grey in color. A wayside exhibit in a turnout near one of these provides information on andesite columns. At the end of one massive hairpin curve lies Sunrise Point. Inside the hairpin is a parking area. Here, the road is lined with sidewalks and rock walls on the outside of the curve. Several wayside exhibits tell the story of the natural features of the area while one provides trail information for the Palisades Lake trail. Mount Rainier rises impressively to the southeast. Continuing west from Sunrise Point, the road runs along the top of the ridge with few hills and curves. The White River Valley drops off to the south while the ridge continues to rise to the north. Farther along the road the slope of the ridge smooths out and are covered with wildflower meadows with islands of thin, pointy topped subalpine fir lining both sides of the road. Marmots, small dog sized furry brown mammals are often sunning themselves or rocks, walls, or in the road. At the end of the road is a large parking lot with rustic wooden buildings on the north and west sides. Rising to the southwest is snow and glacier covered Mount Rainier, with the smaller jagged Little Tahoma Peak sitting on its left shoulder. The massive Emmons Glacier with its deceptively smooth appearance often cut by cracks in the ices known as crevasses dominates the mountain’s slope. Hundreds of feet below Sunrise Ridge lies White River and the White River Campground. Once parked in the lot the facilities on the north side of the parking lot, from east to west are, a small pit toilet, the historic Day Lodge (with a ranger station on the parking lot level and food service and a gift shop accesses on the second level by a stairs on the left side of the building), trail access, and restrooms with running water. Accessible parking spaces are in front of the restrooms. At the far west end of the parking lot is a grouping of three historic log buildings that mimic the look of a frontier fort. In front of them, adjacent to the parking lot is a flagpole that displays an American flag during daylight hours and a drinking fountain. The buildings are accessed by a few stairs and paths that start from in front of either of the two blockhouses. The blockhouses are not open to the public. Both paths continue on to the third building, the visitor center with a few stairs to enter the east entrance and wheelchair access on the north entrance. Ask for the audio description equipment inside to explore the exhibits. North of the visitor center is a picnic area that can also be accessed by taking the path from the parking lot, next to restrooms. On the south side of the parking lot are several trails that lead to easy trails that overlook the White River and provide amazing views of Mount Rainier. They continue on to more extensive hikes.",

But returning these areas to their original condition takes a great deal of effort. Old roads must be removed and the ground reshaped to match the original topography before native vegetation can be planted. <br /> <br /> As part of the restoration, the National Park Service is researching the effects of blister rust, a disease introduced in the 1920s, on whitebark pine. The whitebark pine plays an important role in subalpine environments. A pioneer species, it is often the first tree species to establish itself after a fire, providing shelter for other trees. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> The Clark's nutcracker helps the whitebark pine reproduce. Its beak has evolved to fit perfectly between the scales of the whitebark pine cone. It pries out the seeds and buries them for later use. Those that aren't eaten during the winter germinate and grow in the spring. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text stretches across the top third of the panel on the left side against a green background. Below the main text, a large photo fills the left side of the panel, showing numerous people planting young plants in a section of bare ground.

Overlapping the whitebark pine photo on the right side of the panel is a photo of a grey bird with black wings and a pointed black beak labeled \"Clark's nutcracker\". The secondary text is just above the Clark's nutcracker photo.

Unable to melt through the thickest part of the glacier, the lava flowed along its side and against a ridge, where the ice was thinnest. The lava then cooled and hardened into rock. When the glaciers retreated, they left behind high ridges of resistant rock like the one you are standing on now. <br /> <br /> The struggle between fire and ice has shaped Mount Rainier for hundreds of thousands of years.

During the ice age, the White River Valley to your left was filled with glacial ice a thousand feet thick. <br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> The interaction of fire and ice also created unusual rock formations. Half a million years ago, adesite lava, the most common type on Mount Rainier, flowed along the margin of a large glacier that filled the White River Valley.

For specific dates and times check the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/hours.htm\">Operating Hours</a>, which can vary. Stop in for a meal or ice cream after a hike. Pick up supplies and gifts in the building’s gift shop. There is no overnight lodging at the Sunrise Day Lodge.<br /> <br /> The Sunrise Day Lodge and fortress style blockade houses and visitor center are part of the National Historic Landmark District. They are set amid colorful subalpine meadows with Mount Rainier and Emmons Glacier as a stunning backdrop.<br /> <br /> Opened in 1931, this wood shingled rustic lodge with a steeply pitched roof was built by the Rainier National Park Company. The building was intended to be the first wing of a resort hotel. However, the project didn’t come to complete fruition leaving just the one wing to service hungry visitors, offer gifts and supplies, and provide lodging to concessionaire employees. There are no overnight guest rooms.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Sunrise Day Lodge is a three story rustic building. The first level is the ranger station, accessed from the walkway on the front of the building. A short stairway to the left side of the building off the walkway leads to the second floor. Once up the stairs, food service is to the left and a gift shop is to the right. The top floor is not accessible by visitors as it houses concessions employees.",

These plants that live in the subalpine, situated on the higher slopes of the mountain live by thin margins, face fierce competition for resources, and endure long winters with harsh conditions. The lingering snow and short summers leave little time for plants to grow, flower, and seed. After surviving all this, their greatest threat may be the millions of visitors coming to appreciate them. As you enjoy the views today, do your part to preserve this subalpine environment by staying on trails.",

    "bodyText": "At 14,410 feet, Mount Rainier towers over Sunrise and is a major influence on landscape and the life it supports. In addition to its volcanic and glacial activity, the mountain intercepts moisture-laden ocean air flowing inland. This air cools as it rises over the mountain, dropping most of its moisture as rain or snow on western slopes. The northeast side receives less precipitation, resulting in more clear, dry days at Sunrise than at on the southwest side at Paradise. This “rain shadow” effect is a major influence on the plant life in this area.<br /> <br /> We hope you enjoyed this guided hike and that on your next visit to Mount Rainier the meadows will look as beautiful as they did today, in part due to your own efforts to keep it so. As a good steward, you are leaving a lasting legacy by staying on designated trails to preserve the meadows that call Mount Rainier National Park home.<br /> <br /> Turn left and head down to the Sunrise parking area or take the trail to the right to hike the Sunrise Rim Loop, a 5.2-miles roundtrip, 1,000 feet elevation gain, or take in views from the Fremont Fire Lookout, 5.6-miles, 900 feet elevation gain roundtrip, or check out the water source for the Sunrise area, Frozen Lake, a 2.8-miles roundtrip trek.",

In winter their flexible branches provide shelter from winds and cold nights. Less snow accumulates under tree islands than in open meadows.

Last winter’s snow can often linger in the meadows as late as August. The growth rate of a subalpine plant is one-tenth that of a plant growing at lower elevations. The soil on which these plants depend takes thousands of years to develop and is easily washed or blown away when disturbed, so please be mindful of where you step.",

    "bodyText": "The meadows at Sunrise change color with the changing season. The blooming of Mount Rainier's gorgeous wildflower meadows is inextricably tied to the amount of snow on the ground. When snow melts earlier, some flowers bloom earlier. As the climate warms, impacting snowmelt, “peak bloom”, when a large variety of wildflowers bloom simultaneously, could also change in the future. Wildflower season may stretch out throughout spring and summer, moving away from a time in which you could capture 20 species blooming in one photo. The yellow glacier lily and white pasqueflower bloom early in the season. Blue lupine and purple Cascade aster (pictured) provide most of the color in midsummer. In late summer, the pasqueflower forms a seedhead (pictured) and the ripening red berries of Sitka mountain ash bring new color to the area. How many species do you see in bloom today? Ask the park staff at the Sunrise Visitor Center for a free wildflower identification brochure to learn more about the wildflowers of Mount Rainier.",

The snowpack lingers here, holding back the forest, and allowing meadows to grow. Subalpine meadow plants have adapted to the high winds, late snowmelt and short growing season. Extensive root systems and mat-like growth help stabilize plants against high winds. Thick, waxy leaves and leaves with tiny hairs help retain heat and moisture. In this environment, trees have adapted unique strategies to survive. They clump together in dense islands that provide mutural physical support as well as shelter from the wind and cold. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A single photo of a ridge with two rocky peaks fills the width of the exhibit panel.

    "audioDescription": "Sunrise Point is perched on the terminus of a lava ridge that radiates out from the east side of Mount Rainier. The Sunrise Road ascends east along the southern flank of the ridge, before turning in a sharp hairpin shape to travel west along the top of the ridge back towards Mount Rainier. There is a small, paved parking lot in the center of the road hairpin, bordered by low rock walls. Sidewalks with stone curbs wrap around the outside of the road along the edge of the overlook. Low rock walls around the overlook are interspersed with crenelations in a triangle shape that roughly mimic the surrounding mountain peaks. On the eastern side of the overlook the sidewalks lead up to a slight rise framed by low rock walls. The Historic Sunrise Road exhibit panel, on the west side overlooks Sunrise Point road and parking area. In the center of the rise is a bench constructed of massive rock slabs. A trail descends the ridge to the east. Exhibit panels are also attached to the rock wall on the northern and southern side of the overlook. Views to the south include Mount Adams and the White River Valley, while to the north Mount Baker can be glimpsed on clear days. Look down from the north side of the point to view Sunrise Lake surrounded by trees. Exhibit Panel Description A single photo of a ridge with two rocky peaks fills the width of the exhibit panel.

On clear days, look for Mount Adams to the south and Mount Baker to the north. Landscape architect Ernest A. Davidson, who helped design Sunrise Point, noted that \"even the most jaded, scenery-weary tourist cannot help but be thrilled by the magnificent panorama that greets the eye\". Sunrise Point is an overlook along the Sunrise Road, which was built specifically to enhance views and connect visitors with the natural landscape. At Sunrise Point the road naturally bends around the tip of a lava ridgeline. Crenulations along the rock walls around the overlook roughly mimic the peak of Mount Rainier. Construction on the road started in 1927 and the road opened to the public in 1931. During the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) improved the road, including work at Sunrise Point.<br /> <br /> <b>Hiking</b><br /> Two trails can be accessed from Sunrise Point. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/palisades-lake.htm\">Palisades Lakes Trail</a> begins on the eastern side of Sunrise Point, while the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/day-hiking-at-mount-rainier.htm\">Sourdough Ridge Trail</a> heads to the west, following the ridgeline in parallel to the road towards the Sunrise developed area with a spur trail to Dege Peak along the way.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunrise Road Geology – Sunrise Point</b><br /> The Cascade Range consists of volcanic and metamorphic rocks established over millions of years. Prominent volcanoes like Mount Rainier and Mount Adams are much younger. They have grown on a basement of older uplifted rocks that formed the Cascade Range. Modern Mount Rainier began growing about half a million years ago but it is not the first volcano to be located here. An ancestral volcano grew at about this same site between one and two million years ago. The ancestral volcano has almost entirely eroded away during the past million years, so that only a few remnants of it exist today.</p>",

Along with Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, and Mount Baker, it is part of a chain of volcanoes that extends from northern California to southern British Columbia. The Cascade volcanoes arise from the collision of enormous sheets of the planet's surface. These large slabs of rock, called tectonic plates, float atop the Earth's mantle. Here in the Pacific Northwest, the Juan de Fuca Plate plunges beneath the North American Plate, a process called subduction. The high temperatures and pressures of the subduction zone melt solid rock. Some of the newly-formed magma rises to the surface to erupt, forming volcanoes such as Mount Rainier above the subduction zone. <br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> On a clear day, you can see three other Cascade volcanoes: Mount Adams to the south; Glacier Peak and Mount Baker behind you looking north. <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> The main text stretches across the top third of the exhibit panel on the left side against a green background. To the right of the main text is a small illustration of a subduction zone.

The pullout is located 2.3 miles up from the gate along the Sunrise Road. A wayside exhibit panel next to the pullout provides additional information about the rock formation. <br /> <br /> <b>Sunrise Road Geology – Columnar Rock Formations</b><br /> The lava that formed the columnar rock formations you see at this stop flowed here during an eruption approximately 496 thousand years ago, making it one of the oldest lava flows from Mount Rainier. Carolyn Driedger, a hydrologist from the United States Geologic Survey:</p> <blockquote> <p>“We’re very high up here and you have to ask the question, how did the lava flow get here? Why did it perch up here so high? And the reason is because... when the eruption occurred, the valley of the White River was filled with a thousand feet or so of glacier ice at least to the surface that we are at today.”</p> </blockquote> <p>These lava columns are evidence that the valley was once filled with glacial ice. As the lava cools it crystallizes into columns pointing in the direction of cooling. Normally, one would expect them to be vertical, assuming that the coldest direction would be the air above the lava flow. These columns however lay horizontally, indicating that the cooling surface was to the edge of the lava flow. Geologists think that this lava flow actually erupted while the White River valley was filled with a very thick Ice Age glacier. The lava flow skirted the edges of the glacier, cooling as it came into contact with the ice along its flank. When the glacier eventually melted away, it left behind the lava ridge Sunrise is built on.<br /> <br /> While we encourage you to enjoy the impressive views while traveling up the Sunrise Road, please stay aware of the road and drive safely. The Sunrise Road is steep and winding. Watch out for bicyclists and other drivers on the road, as well as wildlife. Please do not stop your vehicle in the road and block traffic.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Sunrise Road is a narrow, steep, and winding two-lane paved road. The road does not have shoulders. The pullout is on the right, or uphill lane, side of the road, and loops around a small island that includes a metal wayside exhibit panel. The pullout is not paved.

These exposed hillsides reveal the geologic layers that built the Sunrise ridge.<br /> <br /> <b>Sunrise Geology – Hillside Road Cuts</b><br /> Mount Rainier is an active volcano formed by the accumulation of many layers of lava, volcanic debris, ash, and pumice during thousands of years of volcanism and glaciation. Some of these events, such as the Osceola Mudflow, form visible layers of different types of material in the hillside road cuts. Here’s a description of what to look for along the road from Carolyn Driedger, a hydrologist from the United States Geologic Survey:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“As you’re traveling up the road, especially in the lower part of the valley, you’re going to see some outcrops of very loose rock unsorted. It has big boulders set into a fine matrix and much of that is from the Osceola Mudflow, the big mudflow that formed 5600 years ago when we had an eruption of Mount Rainier... So we’re looking at this landslide from just the base of the mountain, and you’ll see as you travel that it did travel a fair ways up the valley wall... It hardened here in place and you can see it’s a very unstable slope and we get a lot of small rock falls off this slope over the years.”</i><i></i><i></i></p> </blockquote> <p>While we encourage you to enjoy the impressive views while traveling up the Sunrise Road, please stay aware of the road and drive safely. The Sunrise Road is steep and winding. Watch out for bicyclists and other drivers on the road, as well as wildlife. Please do not stop your vehicle in the road and block traffic.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Sunrise Road is a narrow, steep, and winding two-lane paved road. The road does not have shoulders. The pullout is on the right, or uphill lane, side of the road. The pullout is not paved. A large, exposed hill cut is on the opposite side of the road, while on the right, the hill drops steeply down into the White River Valley. Most of the road is bordered by forest, but a low concrete retaining wall extends across a gap where the forest has been broken by hillside debris fall. The road cut reveals layers of different sediment. Some layers are of pale tan pumice and ash, with a thick layer of rocky debris in between. Rocks and other debris can fall off the exposed slope, and the ditch at the bottom between the road can have unstable footing.",

Its deep crevasses and towering ice blocks rival those on Denali and the Himalayas. <br /> <br /> Each year, thousands of people summit Mount rainier. To reach the summit and return before nightfall, many climbers begin their final ascent from high camp around midnight. They make their way through the darkness by the light of headlamps, roped to at least one other team member. About half the people who attempt it turn back due to weather, exhaustion or altitude sickness. <br /> <br /> The Emmons Glacier route is one of the standard climbing approaches. Use the spotting scope to look for climbing parties on their way to the summit. <br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> <em>\"What a gorgeous day!! After a month of waiting, a window of good weather. It's worth the wait! The stars were incredible, the dawn beautiful, the day tremendous.

Wildflower peak bloom is typically mid to late July, with fall color starting in September. Tipsoo Lake can experience heavy visitation and parking can be limited. Plan ahead with an alternate destination in mind or come early or late in the day or on a weekday to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/congestion.htm\">avoid congestion</a>.<br />  </p> <p>Tipsoo Lake is a popular summer destination on the eastern edge of Mount Rainier National Park. Located at Chinook Pass along State Route 410, this subalpine lake is set in a glacier-carved basin and surrounded by subalpine wildflower meadows. The area experiences heavy snowfall in winter, with snow lingering well into June or even July. State Route 410 closes for the winter season.<br /> <br /> In additional to viewing wildflowers in the meadows around the lake, observe tadpoles and frogs in the lake, and watch for birds. Swimming or wading is not permitted in the lake. Please <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/meadow-preservation.htm\">stay on the trails</a> at all times to avoid damaging the delicate meadow plants. Picnic tables are available near the main parking area.</p> <h4>Hiking</h4> <p>A network of easy trails, suitable for all ages, leads through the subalpine meadows and around the lake. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/natches-peak-loop.htm\">Naches Peak Loop Trail</a> (3.4 miles) is a popular hike. Starting from Tipsoo Lake, trail connects to the Pacific Crest Trail on the eastern edge of the park, then returns to Tipsoo Lake. This trail features superb wildflower displays in midsummer, huckleberries in early fall, and brilliant autumn colors. The <strong>Pacific Crest Trail</strong> crosses over SR 410 using the Chinook Pass Entrance Arch, which is actually a historic wood and stone bridge. Note that while dogs are allowed on the Pacific Crest Trail, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">pets are not permitted</a> on the portion of the Naches Peak Loop Trail within the park or around Tipsoo Lake.<br /> <br /> Tipsoo Lake is also the northern terminus of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/eastside-trail.htm\">Eastside Trail</a>, which descends from the subalpine meadows around the lake to follow the Ohanapecosh River through old-growth forest to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/ohanapecosh.htm\">Ohanapecosh</a>. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Tipsoo Lake is a small alpine lake set into a glacier-carved bowl surrounded by rocky mountain peaks. Subalpine meadows ring the lake, with patchy forest on the surrounding slopes. Traveling east along SR410, the main parking area for Tipsoo Lake forms a horseshoe shape on the left side of the highway. Continuing past the parking area, the highway climbs in a loop around the lake before passing under the Chinook Entrance Arch at Chinook Pass. The entrance arch is not a true arch, but a foot bridge built out of large cedar logs set into stone abutments on either side of the road. The entrance arch marks the park boundary and serves as a crossing for the Pacific Crest Trail which travels north-south along the mountain range. Additional parking is available along the north side of the highway within the park, with a small pull off halfway between the main parking area and the arch providing access to the south side of the lake. The main parking area has two pit toilets located in the center of the horseshoe shape with picnic tables and an information bulletin board located at the top of the horseshoe. The main trail starts next to the bulletin board but quickly splits into several trails weaving through the subalpine meadows around the lake. One trail skirts the edge of the lake. The Naches Peak Loop Trail climbs up the mountain slope to the north, connecting to the Pacific Crest Trail. Trails on the south side of the lake connect to the smaller pull off then cross the highway to reach a secondary smaller lake and the other end of the Naches Peak Loop Trail. Trails are often very narrow, with limited room to pass, and bordered by thick meadow vegetation. Small footbridges cross streams and marshy areas that feed into the lakes in several locations.",

    "audioDescription": "Tipsoo Lake is a small alpine lake set into a glacier-carved bowl surrounded by rocky mountain peaks. Subalpine meadows ring the lake, with patchy forest on the surrounding slopes. Traveling east along SR410, the main parking area for Tipsoo Lake forms a horseshoe shape on the left side of the highway. Continuing past the parking area, the highway climbs in a loop around the lake before passing under the Chinook Entrance Arch at Chinook Pass. The exhibit panel is located on a rock wall that frames a small pullout halfway between the main parking area and the entrance arch. To the left of the panel on the edge of the pullout, a trail descends into the meadow and encircles Tipsoo Lake. Cross the road opposite from the pullout to connect to one end of the Naches Peak Loop Trail and a secondary smaller lake. Trails are often very narrow, with limited room to pass, and bordered by thick meadow vegetation. Small footbridges cross streams and marshy areas that feed into the lakes in several locations.

Discover the plants and animals that call this area their home, including deer, birds, and beavers.<br /> <br /> <b>Rampart Ridge Loop Trail</b><br /> This moderate loop trail passes through forests with glimpses of the surrounding mountain vistas. Also known as \"The Ramparts,\" this ridge is the remnant of an ancient lava flow which originated at the summit of Mount Rainier.<br /> <br /> Rampart Ridge Loop Trail is 4.6 miles long with 1339 feet of elevation gain. The trail begins at the west end of the Trail of the Shadows, approximately 0.2 miles from the trailhead if heading clockwise. The loop can be hiked in either direction, but going clockwise keeps Mount Rainier in front more of the time and is thus recommended. Walk up through an old growth forest as you make your way to the top of Rampart Ridge. At 1.8 miles, there is a viewpoint looking up the Nisqually River Valley. As you hike along the relatively level ridge, listen for the tapping of the woodpeckers or the booming of the grouse. Keep an eye out for deer and other wildlife. Notice the various mosses and lichen clinging to the trees. On a clear day, hikers are also rewarded with excellent views of Mount Rainier and the Nisqually River Valley from two viewpoints atop the ridge. At 2.9 miles, join the Wonderland Trail for the return to Longmire.<br /> <br /> While Longmire is open year-round, snow can make this trail hazardous in winter. Winter hikers and snowshoers must have experience with navigation. <br /> <br /> <b>Backpacking</b><br /> There is no designated camp along this trail nor atop Rampart Ridge. Permits are required for camping. Permits and current trail conditions are available at park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Treat water before drinking. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Trail of the Shadows Trailhead is located across the road from the Longmire Transportation Exhibit, a historic gas station, and the National Park Inn. Parking is located behind the inn and follow paved paths across the main road to the trailhead. The Trail of the Shadows is at the base of the Rampart Ridge cliffs and weaves in and out of the forest around the edge of a marshy meadow. Moving counterclockwise, a portion of the unpaved trail is wheelchair accessible, from the trailhead to the spur trail that branches off to the left into the Longmire Meadow with a view of Mount Rainier. There are low wooden benches at the terminus of the spur trail. The trail is approximately 6 feet wide with a small-sized gravel surface bordered by a split-rail fence. Just past the spur trail on the right is a mineral spring well encircled by a low rock wall with a short path bordered by low rock walls. Continue on the main trail, which was gentle elevations changes. The trail over looks a small pond on the left at the far end of the meadow before entering forest, with some trees showing evidence of beaver activity. Sections of the trail may be broken by tree roots. At the far end of the loop is a replica of a small single room wood cabin. Next to the cabin, down a short slope is another mineral spring, framed by a horse-shoe shaped rock walls. Water sediment from this spring is bright orange with oxidizing mineral deposits. Past the spring, the trail crosses over a small creek with a wood footbridge, then starts to encircle back on the other side of the meadow. There is a stretch of wood boardwalk through a marshy section, and the trail weaves along the edge of the forest. A short spur trail with boardwalk on the left goes to a third mineral spring with travertine deposits and view of the meadow. Rampart Ridge Trail starts from the right just past the travertine spring. The trail then crosses two more creeks with wood footbridges at the bottom side of the meadow and parallels the road for a short distance as it returns to Longmire. The Rampart Ridge Loop trail has sections of steep switchbacks as it climbs to the top of the ridge, along with sections of log steps and rocks. The trail is dirt, and often icy or snow-covered well into summer.",

These plants and animals seldom overlap. Along this trail where the forest and meadow meet, species of both communities survive in the same area. This is called an edge environment.<br /> <br /> An edge environment supports a greater diversity of species than either community can manage alone. Many types of wildlife – birds, mammals, insects, even amphibians – interact with forest and meadow for food, shelter, and refuge. Trees that fall along the edge become growing platforms for forest plants, and retaining walls for water where meadow plants can survive.<br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> The combination of natural resources available along this edge made it possible for James Longmire to develop a resort. This environment is now preserved by Mount Rainier National Park as a culturally significant landscape. Hence, the natural and cultural histories of the plants, animals, and people tell the story of the edge environment along this trail.<br /> <br /> Look around. Can you find evidence of an edge environment? How far into the forest do meadow plants grow? How many forest plants can you see growing in the meadow?  <br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> A single photo fills the exhibit panel. On the left side is a meadow with tall green reeds and grasses, while on the right side is a forest.

    "audioDescription": "The Trail of the Shadows Trailhead is located across the road from the Longmire Transportation Exhibit, a historic gas station, and the National Park Inn. Parking is located behind the inn and follow paved paths across the main road to the trailhead. The Trail of the Shadows is at the base of the Rampart Ridge cliffs and weaves in and out of the forest around the edge of a marshy meadow. Moving counterclockwise, a portion of the unpaved trail is wheelchair accessible, from the trailhead to the spur trail that branches off to the left into the Longmire Meadow with a view of Mount Rainier. There are low wooden benches at the terminus of the spur trail. The trail is approximately 6 feet wide with a small-sized gravel surface bordered by a split-rail fence. Just past the spur trail on the right is a mineral spring well encircled by a low rock wall with a short path bordered by low rock walls. Continue on the main trail, which has gentle elevations changes. The trail over looks a small pond on the left at the far end of the meadow before entering forest, with some trees showing evidence of beaver activity. Sections of the trail may be broken by tree roots. At the far end of the loop is a replica of a small single room wood cabin. Next to the cabin, down a short slope is another mineral spring, framed by a horse-shoe shaped rock walls. Water sediment from this spring is bright orange with oxidizing mineral deposits. Past the spring, the trail crosses over a small creek with a wood footbridge, then starts to encircle back on the other side of the meadow. There is a stretch of wood boardwalk through a marshy section, and the trail weaves along the edge of the forest. A short spur trail with boardwalk on the left goes to a third mineral spring with travertine deposits and view of the meadow. Rampart Ridge Trail starts from the right just past the travertine spring. The trail then crosses two more creeks with wood footbridges at the bottom side of the meadow and parallels the road for a short distance as it returns to Longmire. The Border Town exhibit panel is located on the left side of the trail past the board walk as you travel counter clockwise along the trail. Exhibit Panel Description A single photo fills the exhibit panel. On the left side is a meadow with tall green reeds and grasses, while on the right side is a forest. Some of the meadow plants encroach into the forest while some trees lean out into the meadow, but there is a clear border between the two environments.

    "bodyText": "<h4><b>Title: Cryptic Creatures</b></h4> <p><strong>Main Text</strong><br /> The damp meadow and forest floor are ideal habitats for frogs and salamanders. Because their skin must stay moist, these amphibians need water or wet surfaces to survive. They also need water to reproduce. The Pacific tree frog breeds in wetlands, ponds, and temporary pools, where there are fewer predators. The Coastal tailed frog breeds in fast-flowing streams, laying eggs in long, bead-like strings attached to undersides of rocks. <br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> Pacific tree frogs (<i>Pseudacris regilla</i>), also known as chorus frogs, are masked, two-inch-long frogs that change color to blend into their environment. “Ribbit”, “robbit”, “rabbit” are the loud synchronized, competing calls of the males. A loud “kreck-eck” is an advertisement call.<br /> <br /> The Pacific giant salamander (<i>Dicamptodon tenebrosus</i>) is another amphibian that only lives in the Pacific Northwest. This salamander might metamorphose (change) into a terrestrial adult, living primarily on land and returning to the stream to breed. Others retain their youthful aquatic adaptions and live only in water.<br /> <br /> Nowhere else in the world can boast of having Coastal tailed frogs (<i>Ascaphus truei</i>). They are only found in the Pacific Northwest. Living cryptic lives in this rocky stream, these frogs are seldom seen and never heard. Adapting to noisy streams, tailed frogs lack a vocal sac for calling and do not have external ears or a middle ear bone for hearing. Because they live in fast moving water, the male, unlike any other frog, has a tail for internal fertilization. Hardened fingertips assist with crawling along the rocky bottom. Small lungs decrease buoyancy, so the tailed frogs breathe mostly through their skin.<br /> <br /> Red-legged frogs (<i>Rana aurora</i>) occupy meadow ponds during breeding season and then move to a moist forest habitat. The red-legged frog is twice the size of the vociferous chorus frog but it is seldom heard. Their quiet, grunt-like call is often made underwater.<br /> <br /> Listen for the chorus frog, especially in evenings, spring to fall.  <br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> A photo of rushing water in a creek, the out-of-focus ripples creating an abstract pattern, fills the exhibit panel.

Under each of the photos is a paragraph of secondary text relating to the photo. The first photo, the Pacific tree frog, is of a small, bright green frog sitting on a rock. The second photo of the Pacific giant salamander shows a large salamander with glistening brown skin covered in wavy darker brown stripes.

Moving counterclockwise, a portion of the unpaved trail is wheelchair accessible, from the trailhead to the spur trail that branches off to the left into the Longmire Meadow with a view of Mount Rainier. There are low wooden benches at the terminus of the spur trail. The trail is approximately 6 feet wide with a small-sized gravel surface bordered by a split-rail fence. Just past the spur trail on the right is a mineral spring well encircled by a low rock wall with a short path bordered by low rock walls. Continue on the main trail, which has gentle elevations changes. The trail over looks a small pond on the left at the far end of the meadow before entering forest, with some trees showing evidence of beaver activity. Sections of the trail may be broken by tree roots. At the far end of the loop is a replica of a small single room wood cabin. Next to the cabin, down a short slope is another mineral spring, framed by a horse-shoe shaped rock walls. Water sediment from this spring is bright orange with oxidizing mineral deposits. Past the spring, the trail crosses over a small creek with a wood footbridge, then starts to encircle back on the other side of the meadow. There is a stretch of wood boardwalk through a marshy section, and the trail weaves along the edge of the forest. A short spur trail with boardwalk on the left goes to a third mineral spring with travertine deposits and view of the meadow. Rampart Ridge Trail starts from the right just past the travertine spring. The trail then crosses two more creeks with wood footbridges at the bottom side of the meadow and parallels the road for a short distance as it returns to Longmire. The Hiding in the Shadows exhibit panel is located on the left side of the trail towards the start of the section of boardwalk as you travel counter clockwise along the trail. Exhibit Panel Description A black and white photo of a forest serves as the background of the exhibit panel with the main text in a column on the left half of the panel. Filling the right half of the panel is a close-up view of a tree trunk covered in a patchwork of different lichens, some scaly, some leafy, some with long strands, all in a variety of green, white and brown-black colors. In the lower left corner of the panel is the secondary text set into a small grey oval. Above the text is a small graphic of a historic gas lantern lit with a soft yellow light.",

    "bodyText": "<h4><b>Title: Life on the Edge</b></h4> <p><b>Main Text</b><br /> By 1883, James Longmire, a local pioneer and explorer, saw the beauty and economic benefits of the mineral springs. His vision gave rise to the development and expansion of the meadow as a tourist destination. With the establishment of Mount Rainier National Park in 1899, visitation increased as did the demand for concessions. Tent cabins, an auto shop, a gas station, tennis courts, and a clubhouse were among the services that arose in Longmire Village, which is the area that surrounds you. Today, the natural integrity of this edge environment, where meadow and forest converge, continues to evolve, preserving the history of people, plants, and animals.<br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> The main text is in the upper left corner of the panel against a grey background. Several small black and white historic photos are scattered across the rest of the panel, set at slight angles and slightly overlapping. Under the main text is a photo of a garage with several early-model cars parked in front, their drivers posed next to the vehicles. A signboard the building’s open garage bay reads “Park Garage – Gasoline-Oil-Supplies”. Behind the building rises Rampart Ridge, a forested ridge with lava cliffs, and the glaciated summit of Mount Rainier. A photo in the middle of the panel at the bottom, shows a vehicle refueling at a small gas station with two, tall cylindrical gas pumps. The building is built out of logs with an angled roof and a covered drive-through. Between the park garage and gas station photo is a caption, which reads “Facilities were built to serve the growing use of automobiles: (<i>left</i>) the garage and repair shop, formerly located at the current trailhead for Trail of the Shadows; and (<i>right</i>) the service station, which still exists in its original location across the road.” Above the service station photo is a photo of several large wood buildings with gabled windows and covered porches. In the lower right corner of the panel is a photo of two rows of tent cabins divided by a wood walkway and with Mount Rainier in the distance. Between the photos is a caption: “Early accommodations ranged from tent cabins (<i>right</i>) to hotels. The original National Park Inn (<i>in the above photo, on the right</i>), built in 1906, was destroyed by fire in 1926. The inn’s Annex (<i>in the above photo, on the left</i>) was originally built in 1916 where you now stand, and was relocated across the road in 1920. After the original inn burned the Annex remained, serving guests to this day at the same location.” At the top of the panel are the final two photos. On the left side is a photo of a dog sled parked in front of a large wood building covered in snow with several people crowded around the sled looking at the string of dogs. On the right side is a photo of two women in dresses or wide-legged pants and straw hats sitting astride two horses.

    "audioDescription": "The Trail of the Shadows Trailhead is located across the road from the Longmire Transportation Exhibit, a historic gas station, and the National Park Inn. Parking is located behind the inn and follow paved paths across the main road to the trailhead. The Trail of the Shadows is at the base of the Rampart Ridge cliffs and weaves in and out of the forest around the edge of a marshy meadow. Moving counterclockwise, a portion of the unpaved trail is wheelchair accessible, from the trailhead to the spur trail that branches off to the left into the Longmire Meadow with a view of Mount Rainier. There are low wooden benches at the terminus of the spur trail. The trail is approximately 6 feet wide with a small-sized gravel surface bordered by a split-rail fence. Just past the spur trail on the right is a mineral spring well encircled by a low rock wall with a short path bordered by low rock walls. Continue on the main trail, which was gentle elevations changes. The trail over looks a small pond on the left at the far end of the meadow before entering forest, with some trees showing evidence of beaver activity. Sections of the trail may be broken by tree roots. At the far end of the loop is a replica of a small single room wood cabin. Next to the cabin, down a short slope is another mineral spring, framed by a horse-shoe shaped rock walls. Water sediment from this spring is bright orange with oxidizing mineral deposits. Past the spring, the trail crosses over a small creek with a wood footbridge, then starts to encircle back on the other side of the meadow. There is a stretch of wood boardwalk through a marshy section, and the trail weaves along the edge of the forest. A short spur trail with boardwalk on the left goes to a third mineral spring with travertine deposits and view of the meadow. Rampart Ridge Trail starts from the right just past the travertine spring. The trail then crosses two more creeks with wood footbridges at the bottom side of the meadow and parallels the road for a short distance as it returns to Longmire. The Natures Own Laboratory exhibit panel is located on the left side of the trail, just past the junction of the main trail and the spur trail. It overlooks a section of ground that often shows evidence of the bubbling mineral springs when covered in water in winter and spring and patches of reddish-tan travertine earth when the springs dry out in later summer.

They stayed in a two-story hotel, 20 feet by 30 feet, with five sleeping rooms upstairs. Soaking in the springs or taking a sulphur plunge bath was recommended. Rubs and massages were specialties of the house. <br /> <br /> The property was sold in 1920 and the original, outdated hotel was demolished and burned. That same year, the stone encasement and seating were added to this spring and more modern facilities were constructed in the area. </p> <p><strong>Secondary Text</strong></p> <p>In response to tourist demand, the Longmires enlarged the hotel, added cabins and tents, and built bathhouses over the hot springs, with cedar-planked tubs sunken into the ground. <br /> <br /> Elcaine Longmire (James' eldest son) and his wife Martha were proprietors of the Longmire resort during its heyday in the early 1900s. </p> <p><b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> The main text forms a column on the left third of the exhibit panel, against a tan background.

The Nature's Spa exhibit panel is set into a metal stand the right side of the trail just past the start of a short walkway leading to a circular mineral spring well. The walkway and spring are bordered by a low wall constructed of rounded river rocks. The walkway wall forms a roughly square space around the circular spring in the center, with shallow stone seats set into the wall. Immediately around the spring, the ground is covered in wood boards. One side of the circular spring's wall is lower than the rest of it, and water often overflows the spring and can partly cover the walkway. The spring is relatively shallow and its bottom is covered in rocks similar to those that make up the wall. The water is typically clear, with bubbles coming up from the bottom of the spring, and sometimes has patches of green algae growing in the water. The area is surrounded by alder and conifer trees with lush grass growing around the spring and along this section of trail.

    "bodyText": "<h4><b>Title: On the Shoulders of Giants</b></h4> <p><b>Main Text</b><br /> A tree is an essential contributor to the life cycle of a forest – not only when it is alive, but even after it has fallen to the ground. Resting upon the forest floor, a tree absorbs rain and holds it like a sponge, whereupon mosses and other plants can colonize. The dead tree, called a nurse log, provides water and nutrients for new growth. Young trees sprout on the log, competing for sun and enough space to grow roots that will eventually anchor in the ground. While supporting the growing trees, the log slowly deteriorates. Many types of fungi, often seen as mushrooms growing out of the wood, help break down the decomposing log. Ants, beetles, and other invertebrates tunnel through the moist wood and feed upon it. The decaying matter enriches the soil by recycling nutrients. A tree constantly contributes to the forest until nothing remains of the tree.<br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> “Trees receive a most beautiful burial. Nature takes fallen trees gently into her bosom – at rest from storms.” – John Muir<br /> <br /> Count the number of trees competing for space on the nurse log behind this sign.<br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> The main text stretches across the top third of the exhibit panel against a green background.

It is often referred to as a “living fossil”. Tree-sized horsetail-type fossils reveal that through millennia, the species has not significantly changed in shape, only in height.<br /> <br /> Common horsetail shares the wet streambank with two giant-leafed, prehistoric-looking plants, skunk cabbage and devil’s club. Their historic significance has endured for centuries as valuable medicinal sources for Native American’s. These plants also were used as tools and occasional food sources.<br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> Common horsetail (<i>Equisetum arvense</i>) is known for its hair-cleaning properties and as a cure for diarrhea.<br /> <br /> Devil’s club (<i>Oplopanx horridus</i>) is a significant plant to Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest. Roots, back, and spines were steeped or infused as a treatment for many ailments from colds to arthritis, ulcers, and especially diabetes.<br /> <br /> Skunk cabbage (<i>Lysichiton Americanum</i>) roots were boiled and the liquid drunk to clear the bladder and purify the blood. A mash of skunk cabbage leaves had a soothing effect on headaches, cuts, fevers, and chest pain.<br /> <br /> How do <i>you</i> use plants for healing?  <br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> A blurry, mottled background fills the left third of the panel. The main text is in a column on the left over the blurry background. Below the main text in the lower left corner of the panel is the last section of secondary set into a small grey oval.

    "audioDescription": "The Trail of the Shadows Trailhead is located across the road from the Longmire Transportation Exhibit, a historic gas station, and the National Park Inn. Parking is located behind the inn and follow paved paths across the main road to the trailhead. The Trail of the Shadows is at the base of the Rampart Ridge cliffs and weaves in and out of the forest around the edge of a marshy meadow. Moving counterclockwise, a portion of the unpaved trail is wheelchair accessible, from the trailhead to the spur trail that branches off to the left into the Longmire Meadow with a view of Mount Rainier. There are low wooden benches at the terminus of the spur trail. The trail is approximately 6 feet wide with a small-sized gravel surface bordered by a split-rail fence. Just past the spur trail on the right is a mineral spring well encircled by a low rock wall with a short path bordered by low rock walls. Continue on the main trail, which has gentle elevations changes. The trail over looks a small pond on the left at the far end of the meadow before entering forest, with some trees showing evidence of beaver activity. Sections of the trail may be broken by tree roots. At the far end of the loop is a replica of a small single room wood cabin. Next to the cabin, down a short slope is another mineral spring, framed by a horse-shoe shaped rock walls. Water sediment from this spring is bright orange with oxidizing mineral deposits. Past the spring, the trail crosses over a small creek with a wood footbridge, then starts to encircle back on the other side of the meadow. There is a stretch of wood boardwalk through a marshy section, and the trail weaves along the edge of the forest. A short spur trail with boardwalk on the left goes to a third mineral spring with travertine deposits and view of the meadow. Rampart Ridge Trail starts from the right just past the travertine spring. The trail then crosses two more creeks with wood footbridges at the bottom side of the meadow and parallels the road for a short distance as it returns to Longmire. The Rooted in Time exhibit panel is located on the left side of the trail between two foot bridges that cross over small creeks at the bottom of the Longmire Meadow as you travel counter clockwise along the trail.

    "bodyText": "<h4><b>Title: Rusty Springs</b></h4> <p><b>Main Text</b></p> <p>Water flowing down the nearby stream and water rising up through this mineral spring both originate high above the meadow from snowmelt and rainfall. <br /> <br /> From the upper slopes, water percolates through the earth's crust into the mountain. Geothermal heat, supplied by magma deep within the mountain, warms the water. The hot water travels underground through cracks. It eventually mixes with shallow, cold groundwater before it reappears above ground at the spring. <br /> <br /> Hot water dissolves iron as it circulates past underground rocks. Iron oxidizes (rusts) when it is exposed to the air and the resulting iron oxy-hydroxides deposit a reddish pigment along the spring channel. <br />  </p> <p><strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> This enclosed spring is historically known as \"Iron Mike\", and its reddish pigment was referred to as \"mineral paint\". <br /> <br /> Taking advantage of the existence of these minerals, James Longmire filed a placer (mining) claim to assert the prescence of his early settlement. In 1892, he was awarded a patent for 18.2 acres of land that included the adjacent meadow and most of its mineral springs. <br />  </p> <p><b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> A historic black and white photo of the Iron Mike mineral spring fills the exhibit panel.

It is the only remaining relic of an energetic enterprise by one family to establish the first settlement in what is now Mount Rainier National Park. The National Park Service maintains the cabin to preserve its original appearance. <br /> <br /> The Longmire dream was interrupted by the rise of more modern businesses that grew around the meadow as the result of Mount Rainier's popularity as a wilderness park. This cabin stands to remind us that the James Longmire Family contributed significantly to the park's history. They were explorers, trail blazers, road builders, entrepreneurs, and mountaineers.  <br />  </p> <p><strong>Secondary Text</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\"...Many a time, I sat, I won't say for long, on those stumps in front of the present Longmire cabin at the edge of the forest primeval, down by the iron spring. When you stand in front of this cabin in summer, you may picture in your mind's eye a barefooted kid in a calico dress, as happy and free as the squirrels in the forest.\" Mary Longmire Jacobs, daughter of Elcaine Longmire, ca. 1980</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> A historic black and white photo of the Longmire Meadow fills the exhibit panel, with a hand-written label in the bottom right corner reading \"Longmire's Springs, No 280\". On the right side of the photo is the two-story wood lodge, with a fenced yard, small out buildings, and a stone well in front. Tucked amongst the trees on the left side of the photo is a small single-room cabin, highlighted by a white circle. A label next to the circle reads \"In this historic photograph (circa 1904), the cabin is visible in trees at the north end of the Longmire Meadow, where you now stand.\" The secondary text is above the cabin, with the main text stretching across the top third of the panel on the left side. In the upper right corner of the panel, a small photo shows the front of a wood cabin with a man standing on the step next to the door.

    "audioDescription": "The Trail of the Shadows Trailhead is located across the road from the Longmire Transportation Exhibit, a historic gas station, and the National Park Inn. Parking is located behind the inn and follow paved paths across the main road to the trailhead. The Trail of the Shadows is at the base of the Rampart Ridge cliffs and weaves in and out of the forest around the edge of a marshy meadow. Moving counterclockwise, a portion of the unpaved trail is wheelchair accessible, from the trailhead to the spur trail that branches off to the left into the Longmire Meadow with a view of Mount Rainier. There are low wooden benches at the terminus of the spur trail. The trail is approximately 6 feet wide with a small-sized gravel surface bordered by a split-rail fence. Just past the spur trail on the right is a mineral spring well encircled by a low rock wall with a short path bordered by low rock walls. Continue on the main trail, which has gentle elevations changes. The trail over looks a small pond on the left at the far end of the meadow before entering forest, with some trees showing evidence of beaver activity. Sections of the trail may be broken by tree roots. At the far end of the loop is a replica of a small single room wood cabin. Next to the cabin, down a short slope is another mineral spring, framed by a horse-shoe shaped rock walls. Water sediment from this spring is bright orange with oxidizing mineral deposits. Past the spring, the trail crosses over a small creek with a wood footbridge, then starts to encircle back on the other side of the meadow. There is a stretch of wood boardwalk through a marshy section, and the trail weaves along the edge of the forest. A short spur trail with boardwalk on the left goes to a third mineral spring with travertine deposits and view of the meadow. Rampart Ridge Trail starts from the right just past the travertine spring. The trail then crosses two more creeks with wood footbridges at the bottom side of the meadow and parallels the road for a short distance as it returns to Longmire. The Shadows of the Past exhibit panel is located in front of the cabin on the north side of the Longmire Meadow. The panel is next to the trail to the right of the cabin in a free-standing metal frame.

Your bones support your body, protect your organs, and store minerals. Trees provide the structure and support for multiple habitats. They protect the landscape and store nutrients.<br /> <br /> <b>Secondary Text</b><br /> Protection – Fallen trees may remain on the ground for hundreds of years protecting the soil from erosion. Decaying dead wood continually renews the soil with tons of organic matter, which helps to keep the forest healthy and resilient.<br /> <br /> Support – The life cycle of this old-growth forest generates multiple layers of trees. Each layer, from the canopy down, supports the habitats of thousands of animal and plant species.<br /> <br /> Structure – Alongside the tall trees, snags (standing, broken, dead trees) are an essential structural component of an old forest. Still rooted in the ground, snags are platforms for birds and mammals to move up and down through the forest. They provide habitats and protect the soil from eroding<br /> <br /> Storage – Tall trees collect and process the sun’s energy through photosynthesis. Energy and nutrients are stored in the trees and eventually recycled back into the ecosystem. Healthy forests also store carbon by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing the effects of climate change.<br /> <br /> “The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness.” – John Muir<br /> <br /> <b>Exhibit Panel Description</b><br /> A close-up photo of Western red cedar bark, grey with long reddish cracks in the bark, fills the exhibit panel and serves as a background.

Western hemlock and western red-cedar, some as old as 850 years, are the dominant trees in Mount Rainier's old-growth lowland forests. These large, old trees live together with others of different ages. This diversity creates a rich understory and canopy of vegetation, which provides habitat for a variety of animals.<br /> <br /> Some of the last extensive stands of old-growth forest left in the United States are the lowland forests of Mount Rainier. Old-growth lowland forests can be found in many areas of the park including Ohanapecosh, Longmire, and Carbon River.<br /> <br /> <strong>Secondary Text</strong><br /> Old-growth forests also contain snags - standing dead trees - and \"nurse\" logs that provide shelter for a variety of plant and animal life. Nurse logs provide ideal places for young plants to sprout. Eventually, the snags and nurse logs decompose and become new soil.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A large photo fills up the right two-thirds of the exhibit panel. The photo shows several large evergreen trees reaching up towards the sky, branches interlocking in a dense canopy with a few glimpses of blue sky.

    "audioDescription": "The exhibit panel is set in a metal frame attached to a short stone base at the edge of a large paved pullout along the two-lane Paradise Road. Both sides of the road is surrounded by dense forest, including some very large old-growth trees and some tree snags. Snags are standing tree trunks with the tops broken off. To the left of the exhibit panel the Twin Firs trail starts with a series of stone steps leading into the forest.

In fall, the orange-red foliage of vine maples creates pops of color among the tall conifer trees.

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Season: Summer Only </b><i>(May - November)</i><br /> Westside Road to the Dry Creek Trailhead is open to vehicles during the summer season only, typically May-November. During the winter, snowshoers and crosscountry skiers can still use the closed road. NOTE: From May 24 - September 2, 2024, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/timed-entry-reservations.htm\">timed entry reservations</a> are required to enter the Paradise Corridor, which includes Westside Road, between 7:00 am and 3:00 pm. <br /> <br /> Westside Road is one mile from the Nisqually Entrance, in the southwest corner of the park. Westside Road was originally envisioned as part of an “around-the-mountain” network of roads encircling Mount Rainier but was never completed. Frequent flooding and debris flows by Tahoma Creek closed all but the first three miles of the road to vehicles. There is a small parking area at Dry Creek at the end of this three-mile section. From Dry Creek, the gravel road climbs to Round Pass, descends into the South Puyallup River Valley, then climbs to Klapatche Point, where the road terminates. From Dry Creek to Klapatche Pass, the road is 9.25 miles long with an elevation change of approximately 2,100 feet. Please note that due to danger from rock fall, vehicles must park south of the barricade at Dry Creek. Hikers and bicyclists should travel through the area with caution and avoid lingering in the hazard zone. There are no restroom facilities along Westside Road. The closest comfort station is at Kautz Creek, approximately 5.5 miles from the Dry Creek parking lot on route to Longmire. Westside Road closes during the winter at the Nisqually to Longmire road junction.<br /> <br /> <b>Bicycling</b><br /> Westside Road is one of only two roads closed to vehicles that remains open to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/bicycling.htm\">bicycling</a>. The other former road open to bicycling is the Carbon River Trail, in the northwest corner of the park. Many mountain bikers park at Dry Creek and bike to various trailheads along the road, or to the road’s terminus at Klapatche Point. Only E-bikes possessing a motor of less than 750 watts (1 h.p) on which the motor only assists with pedal propulsion are permitted. Bicycles are not allowed on any trails. All trailheads along the road have bicycle racks.<br /> <br /> <b>Hiking</b><br /> Several trails branch off of Westside Road. <br /> <br /> <b>Lake George & Gobbler’s Knob Trail</b> begins at <b>Round Pass</b>, 3.8 miles from Dry Creek. The trailhead is to the west side of the pass next to a wide pullout. The hike to Lake George is easy with a gradual incline over 0.8 miles through the forest. Lake George is a pristine mountain lake nestled in the northwest shoulder of Mount Wow. There is a backcountry campsite and restroom facility. Lake George Cabin is one of the park’s historic patrol cabins. Continue an additional one mile to reach Gobblers Knob Fire Lookout, one the park’s four historic fire lookouts. The final stretch of the trail is very steep, with rocky switchbacks to reach the lookout, which has spectacular views of Mount Rainier’s southwestern slopes and the Tahoma and Puyallup Glaciers. Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, and the Olympic Mountains can be spotted on clear days.<br /> <br /> Round Pass is also the location of the <b>Marine Memorial</b>, which remembers the death of 32 U.S. Marines that died when their plane crashed into the South Tahoma glacier on Mount Rainier on December 10, 1946.<br /> <br /> On the north side of Round Pass a 0.5-mile trail provides a short cut down to the <b>South Puyallup Trailhead</b>, or continue following Westside Road 1.2 miles (approximately 4.2 miles from Dry Creek). The <b>South Puyallup Trail</b> follows the South Puyallup River valley through forest to a backcountry campsite, then connects to the Wonderland Trail after 1.6 miles.<br /> <br /> Continue about three miles on Westside Road from the South Puyallup River trailhead, or approximately 7.2 miles from the Dry Creek parking area, to the <b>St. Andrews Creek Trailhead</b>.

    "bodyText": "<p><b>Season: Winter Only </b><i>(November-April)</i><br /> Westside Road is closed to vehicles during the winter season at the junction with the main Nisqually-Longmire Road. During the summer, Westside Road is open to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/westside-road-dry-creek-trailhead.htm\">Dry Creek Trailhead</a>, typically May-November. Westside Road is one mile from the Nisqually Entrance, in the southwest corner of the park.<br /> <br /> Westside Road was originally envisioned as part of an “around-the-mountain” network of roads encircling Mount Rainier but was never completed. Frequent flooding and debris flows by Tahoma Creek closed all but the first three miles of the road to vehicles. There is a small parking area at Dry Creek at the end of this three-mile section for vehicles to park at during the summer, but in winter the entire road is closed to vehicles. At the winter trailhead, vehicles can park on either side of the turnoff to Westside Road, but do not park in front of the closed gate and block access for emergency vehicles. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">Pets</a> are <b>not permitted</b> on Westside Road. There are no restroom facilities along Westside Road. The closest comfort station is at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/kautz-creek.htm\">Kautz Creek</a>, approximately 2.4 miles from Westside Road along the main road to Longmire.<br /> <br /> From the winter access trailhead, the road gradually climbs approximately 670 feet over three miles through the forested Tahoma Creek valley to reach the Dry Creek summer trailhead. The hillsides along the road can have numerous ephemeral waterfalls in spring as the snow melts. Depending on snow levels, this portion of the road is suitable for hiking, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing.<br /> <br /> Traveling beyond Dry Creek requires experience with avalanche terrain and winter navigation. Just past Dry Creek is an area with a high risk of avalanches and rock fall. From Dry Creek, the gravel road climbs to Round Pass, descends into the South Puyallup River Valley, then climbs to Klapatche Point, where the road terminates. From Dry Creek to Klapatche Pass, the road is 9.25 miles long with an elevation change of approximately 2,100 feet. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/westside-road-dry-creek-trailhead.htm\">Westside Road: Dry Creek Trailhead</a> page has more information about hiking trailheads located along the road.<br /> <br /> <b>Bicycling</b><br /> Westside Road is one of only two roads closed to vehicles that remains open to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/bicycling.htm\">bicycling</a>. The other former road open to bicycling is the Carbon River Trail, in the northwest corner of the park. Only E-bikes possessing a motor of less than 750 watts (1 h.p) on which the motor only assists with pedal propulsion are permitted. Bicycles are not allowed on any trails. All trailheads along the road have bicycle racks.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "As you travel uphill along the Nisqually Road, the Westside Road turns off the road to the left. A short section of road is paved, then the road is blocked by a metal gate during the winter, and the road behind the gate is gravel. Hikers can skirt around the gate to access the road during the winter. Vehicles are permitted to park along the road in front of the gate, but should not park in front and and block access through the gate. The road is bordered by dense forest, with a forested hillside climbing up steeply along the left side of the road while a small creek cuts through the forest on the right and goes under the main Nisqually Road through a large culvert. Westside Road is an unpaved gravel road. It can have potholes and uneven terrain and in winter the road can be muddy, icy, or snow-covered. The road has significant sections of elevation climb and descent once past the Dry Creek Trailhead.",

The <strong>White River Wilderness Information Station</strong> (WIC) is located just inside the White River Entrance. Stop for a climbing or wilderness camping permit, or information. Restroom facilities are located next to the WIC.<br /> <br /> As you follow the road to the west trails lead hikers to subalpine wilderness or to the moraine of the Emmons Glacier, the largest American glacier outside of Alaska. From the junction of the White River Campground, continue on toward Sunrise. Along the way look for outcrops of columnar lava, hillsides of wildflowers, and breathtaking vistas at Sunrise Point. </p> <p><br /> <b>Sunrise Road Geology – White River</b><br /> The road from White River up to Sunrise is a journey through the geologic history of Mount Rainier. The road carves through the slopes of a lava ridge that was shaped by ancient glaciers, leading to impressive views of not only Mount Rainier but also the surrounding region. Volcanoes and glaciers have dramatically shaped the landscape. As you travel up the mountain to Sunrise, discover geologic evidence left behind by these two forces that have molded Mount Rainier and still do so today. <br /> <br /> While we encourage you to enjoy the impressive views while traveling up the road, please stay aware of the road and drive safely. The Sunrise Road is steep and winding. Watch out for bicyclists and other drivers on the road, as well as wildlife. </p>",

This picnic area features eight tables and eight grills dispersed throughout the picnic area. Picnic tables closest to the parking lot are wheelchair accessible, and the remaining picnic tables are along a dirt path leading to the Wonderland Trail trailhead. Most picnic tables are individually placed, accommodating groups of six each. A paved path at the west end of the parking lot provides wheelchair access to the restrooms and water faucets, however there are no designated accessible parking spaces. </p> <p paraeid=\"{295e64ca-c806-46ba-bc8a-56dd245c1d79}{254}\" paraid=\"1451053606\">Like much of the area surrounding Mount Rainier, White River has had a long history of human use. Evidence indicates that native peoples have been visiting and using areas like this for at least 7,000 years. About 200 years ago, European Americans began coming to White River to mine for copper, gold, and silver. With unsuccessful mining prospects, the area became more suitable for recreation and in 1921, the concession Rainer National Park Company developed a campground at White River. Two years later, the park opened a smaller campground nearby, and by 1925 decided to expand and take over all operations of camping in the park. This meant that in the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps was able to redevelop the now-public campground along with a designated picnic area. Today, the picnic area remains in use as a stopping point on the way to Sunrise, a destination for campers and hikers, and a gathering place for climbers and Wonderland Trail hikers. </p> <p paraeid=\"{329cd6cf-4f00-464b-89d5-ee26ff2bb8cc}{9}\" paraid=\"1871109469\">As you enjoy a picnic here, please be mindful of your impact to the landscape, wildlife, and other visitors. Trash cans are located near the west end of the parking lot for you to clean up and dispose of all waste. Never feed any wildlife or leave food unattended to avoid wild animals getting food that could make them sick or cause them to act aggressively. Please empty wastewater in sinks and deposit any solid food waste into trash cans. While there are grills throughout the picnic area, open fires are not allowed outside of the grills, and you must follow any fire restrictions in place. Pets must be on a leash, not more than six feet (1.8 meters) in length or in a crate/cage at all times. Pets are allowed along the road and paved sidewalks and may join you at your picnic at tables. Pets are not allowed on any trails in Mount Rainier National Park. Potable water is located near the restrooms. There are maintained paths to get to and between picnic tables. Stay within the established pathways to reduce impact on the forest floor. If you choose to play music, please be aware of volume out of respect for other visitors and wildlife. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Five miles west on the White River Road past the White River Entrance Station, a three-way junction provides the option to continue to Sunrise, as well as a left turn to the White River Picnic Area and Campground. Take the left-hand road, which parallels the White River to reach the campground with information signs and a campground check-in kiosk on the right side of the road. Continue past the campground loops on the right to reach the parking lot on the left. The parking lot has an entrance on either end and space for approximately 50 vehicles. The picnic area extends off this parking lot, with several picnic tables and grills as close as 10 feet from the parking lot after a 1–2-inch drop from the pavement. At the west end of the parking lot, a paved path leads to the restrooms heading toward the river (south). The restroom building is dark brown with tan windows and doors to separate areas for men and women. From the paved restroom area, a few rock steps lead to a dirt path broken by roots and rocks that descends closer to the river and continues to a trailhead for the Wonderland Trail. More picnic tables and grills are scattered along this path.",

Further up the glacier are a series of ice domes formed by ice breaking over bedrock, creating numerous crevasses. </p> <p>During the Evans Creek glaciation of the Pleistocene epoch (22-15 thousand years ago), Winthrop Glacier extended 14 miles (22 km) north of the summit, where it merged with several small glaciers from tributary valleys north of the mountain.

About 1.9 miles along this section, the trail meets the junction for Rampart Ridge, a moderate trail that connects back to Longmire through the Trail of the Shadows. Past this junction, the Wonderland Trail continues to Indian Henry’s Hunting Ground and eventually to Golden Lakes. </p> <p paraeid=\"{51ee4bdf-f915-4eba-a9d3-d10aac867e33}{63}\" paraid=\"2034725488\">To the east, the Wonderland Trail meanders parallel to the Nisqually River with a gentle incline.

Due to high demand during the summer season, it is strongly recommended to make a wilderness permit reservation if you are planning to hike the Wonderland Trail. Permits and current trail conditions are available park-wide from wilderness information centers, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Hikers doing the complete Wonderland Trail are limited to camping in designated camps only - the use of cross-country zones is not permitted. The closest camps for the Wonderland Trail traveling clockwise are Pyramid Creek, followed by Devil’s Dream. Traveling counterclockwise, the closest camps are Cougar Rock Campground followed by Paradise River Camp. Treat water before drinking. Fires are prohibited. No pets on trails. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "The main park road transects the Longmire Area, with the Longmire Meadow and Trail of the Shadows on the left and the developed area on the right. The National Park Inn, a two-story wood building with a wraparound porch, faces the road. A network of paved trails leads to the front of the Inn. Parking is located behind the inn. Next to the inn is a small pull off road that provides access to a historic old-fashioned gas station, now converted into an exhibit, and the public restroom building. Past the inn, turn right to enter the main Longmire area. To the left of the road is the Longmire Administration Building, a large two-story wood and stone building with a small lawn in front and framed by tall trees. Across the road from the Administration building are several smaller wood buildings, housing the Longmire Museum and library. The Wonderland Trail trailhead in Longmire is located parallel to the Paradise Road, about 100 feet in front of the Longmire Wilderness Information Center and Administrative Building. The trailhead begins from a break in the rock border of the road, where a sign next to the road indicates the trailhead. There is a large patch of flat gravel surface before reaching several stone steps. Facing the trail, there is a water fountain at the base of a tree to the left, and trash cans to the right. Continuing up the steps, the trail becomes dirt broken by tree roots and rocks, climbing moderately steep up to a trail junction. From the junction, the Wonderland Trail continues in either direction. Moving east (the righthand fork of the trail) on the Wonderland Trail towards Cougar Rock Campground, the trail ascends gently though dense conifer forest. The roughly 3-foot-wide path weaves through the trees and meanders closer and farther away from the Nisqually River. Occasional breaks in the trees near the riverbank reveal views of the Nisqually River, a braided river with a wide channel of sand and large rocks carried by previous floods. Continuing north (the lefthand fork of the trail), the Wonderland Trail connects to the Rampart Ridge Trail in 1.9 miles and to Indian Henry’s in 6.9 miles. This section leads downhill briefly to cross the Paradise Road, a two-lane paved road. Once across the road, the trail crosses a short section of board walk, then climbs steeply through dense trees, and across small streams on a roughly 3-foot-wide path with sections of log and stone steps. After about 5 miles, the trail ascends out of the trees and into subalpine meadow.",

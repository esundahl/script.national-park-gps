As you approach the Anhinga Trail, the interpretive trailhead sign on your left informs you of the trail length and identifies the area as a popular nesting spot for anhingas. A sign on your right informs hikers to respect wildlife and give them at least 15 feet of space when encountered. The beginning of the trail is an accessible paved trail that leads straight along the water. At various distances on the paved trail, strangler fig provides shade for a bench and, further down, a shelter covers benches on the right side of the trail. The paved trail continues straight, dead-ending where two boardwalks begin. Continue straight for a short boardwalk that ends at a popular spot for alligators to rest. After, follow the other boardwalk to travel over the freshwater slough, the deepest part of the freshwater wetlands of the Everglades. The water is often clear enough to see the vegetation growing on the bottom. A shelter along the trail provides shade for two benches as well as an interpretive sign indicating that this habitat is the slough and is home to wildlife such as alligators, turtles, fish, and even North American river otters. As you continue along the boardwalk, an offshoot to the right will lead you to a secluded vista over the slough. Continuing straight along the boardwalk leads you along the sawgrass prairie where there interpretive signs with information about the history of Royal Palm on the right of the path and benches on the left. At the end of the boardwalk, turning right will lead you back down the pavement towards the beginning of the trail.",

The NPA Board of Trustees was filled with prominent American conservationists, including Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.</p> <p paraeid=\"{386eba4a-ecc6-4cce-bd3f-d7e5035f43df}{221}\" paraid=\"805996790\">By 1928 the campaign for a park in the Everglades got rolling, with Jr. focusing on the park’s functions and purposes rather than specific prohibitions, as many Florida Representatives wanted. In 1931, William P Wharton joined the fight for a national park in the Everglades.</p> <p paraeid=\"{386eba4a-ecc6-4cce-bd3f-d7e5035f43df}{225}\" paraid=\"10292663\">Wharton was involved in the Massachusetts State Park System, National Association of Audubon Societies, and the American Forestry Association, a perfect match to join Olmsted Jr. in crafting the report for a proposed national park in the Everglades. Olmsted Jr. and Wharton would spend ten days walking extensively in the Everglades region, speaking with fisherman, guides, hunters, and trappers.</p> <p paraeid=\"{386eba4a-ecc6-4cce-bd3f-d7e5035f43df}{229}\" paraid=\"1947744284\">After their adventure, the two concluded the Everglades not only had all the qualities necessary for a national park but was also so different from any other in existence, having a “special force of novelty”. Olmsted Jr. and Wharton believed that coastal mangrove forests and “the abundance of many species of wild bird life not commonly found in other parts” made the Everglades highly desirable for a national park.</p> <p paraeid=\"{386eba4a-ecc6-4cce-bd3f-d7e5035f43df}{233}\" paraid=\"166938486\">Despite not proposing any specific recommendations for park development, they firmly believed believing “that the primitive character of the region should be protected to the utmost.” Not only did they see the Everglades as providing recreational enjoyment, they also saw the importance it would serve as a study site for botanists, zoologists, and geologists.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "One of the trailheads for the Everglades Paddling Trail is located at the Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch. The Everglades Paddling Trail is 120-miles long from the Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch to the Flamingo marina in Everglades National Park. Wilderness permits are required for any overnight stay. The parking lot for the Gulf Coast boat launch is an unmarked, grassy area. The grass is worn and shows tire tracks from vehicles. There is a sandwich board sign in front of the boat launch with three signs taped to it. The first sign reads, “Stop! No parking pass this point. Loading and unloading only.” A second sign reads, “All park visitors are required to pay an entrance fee. Passes are not available at the visitor center while it is temporarily closed. Please visit recreation.gov and search for ‘Everglades National Park’ to purchase a pass.” A third sign reads, “Please complete a wilderness permit by the visitor center before any overnight trip.” The boat launch is located approximately northwest of the visitor center. On the south side of the boat launch is a green chain-link fence. On the other side of the fence is a National Park Service building with no public access to it. On the north side of the boat launch is a water spigot labeled “Drinking Water.” There are various canoes and kayaks stored on the south side of the boat launch. At the launch are five posts, three wooden and two metal, to prevent people from parking past them. North of the boat launch is a dense line of mangrove trees. On the south side of the boat launch is a black hose visitors can use to wash their boats. The ramp at the boat launch is made up of concrete squares 1’ x 1’. The ramp can be completely submerged by water at high tide and almost entirely exposed at low tide. There are many jagged, dark rocks with small mangrove trees shooting up between them on the south side of the ramp as you approach the water. Chokoloskee Bay is just west of the ramp. The bay is shallow and a ½-mile wide. Across the bay is a long, continuous line of mangrove trees. There are various navigation aids and channel markers in the bay visible from the boat launch. Some of the channel markers are brightly colored and shaped like triangles, others are green and shaped like squares.",

It can be confusing and difficult to navigate as the mazes of mangrove–lined creeks and bays all begin to look the same. With proper planning, you can avoid the frustration and hours wasted from getting lost. The 99-mile Wilderness Waterway attracts interest because it connects Flamingo and Everglades City. Most paddlers allow at least eight days to complete the trip. This route is recommended for experienced paddlers only. Paddlers traveling in one direction only need to make arrangements in advance for a vehicle shuttle from a friend or private company. There are many areas of very shallow water that may be encountered along the Wilderness Waterway. Powerboats over 18' long may have to detour around Alligator and Plate Creeks. The “Nightmare” and Broad Creek are passable only to paddlers at high tide. To prevent prop dredging, which results in increased turbidity and the destruction of sub-merged natural features, boats with drafts of two feet or more, including the propeller, should not use the waterway.",
    "audioDescription": "One of the trailheads for the Wilderness Waterway is located at the Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch. The Wilderness Waterway is 99-miles long from the Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch to the Flamingo marina in Everglades National Park. Wilderness permits are required for any overnight stay. The parking lot for the Gulf Coast boat launch is an unmarked, grassy area. The grass is worn and shows tire tracks from vehicles. There is a sandwich board sign in front of the boat launch with three signs taped to it. The first sign reads, “Stop! No parking pass this point. Loading and unloading only.” A second sign reads, “All park visitors are required to pay an entrance fee. Passes are not available at the visitor center while it is temporarily closed. Please visit recreation.gov and search for ‘Everglades National Park’ to purchase a pass.” A third sign reads, “Please complete a wilderness permit by the visitor center before any overnight trip.” The boat launch is located approximately northwest of the visitor center. On the south side of the boat launch is a green chain-link fence. On the other side of the fence is a National Park Service building with no public access to it. On the north side of the boat launch is a water spigot labeled “Drinking Water.” There are various canoes and kayaks stored on the south side of the boat launch. At the launch are five posts, three wooden and two metal, to prevent people from parking past them. North of the boat launch is a dense line of mangrove trees. On the south side of the boat launch is a black hose visitors can use to wash their boats. The ramp at the boat launch is made up of concrete squares 1’ x 1’. The ramp can be completely submerged by water at high tide and almost entirely exposed at low tide. There are many jagged, dark rocks with small mangrove trees shooting up between them on the south side of the ramp as you approach the water. Chokoloskee Bay is just west of the ramp. The bay is shallow and a ½-mile wide. Across the bay is a long, continuous line of mangrove trees. There are various navigation aids and channel markers in the bay visible from the boat launch. Some of the channel markers are brightly colored and shaped like triangles, others are green and shaped like squares.",

    "bodyText": "Florida Bay is a large (approximately 2,200-square-kilometer), shallow lagoon bounded to the north by the Florida peninsula and to the south and east by the Florida Keys (see map below). Though connected to the Gulf of Mexico to the west, a series of shallow banks, typically covered with and stabilized by seagrass communities, limits the exchange of water between the gulf and the bay. These banks separate the bay into basins, each with its own physical characteristics. These basins provide unique habitat for many plants, invertebrates, fishes, birds, mammals, and reptiles, including several threatened or endangered species such as the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) and species of special concern such as the roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja). Approximately 1,625 square kilometers of Florida Bay are located within Everglades National Park and protected by the National Park Service. Boating in the Florida Bay is a task for the skilled. Treacherous passes cut through long banks of mud and seagrass that separate the shallow basins that make up Florida Bay. Safe boating requires the ability to \"read the water\" as well as a chart. Shallow areas are not always marked, so polarized sunglasses are a key to reading the water. Having a weatherproof copy of NOAA chart #11451 is highly recommended. Visitors should know the limits of their boat. On average, the bay is less than 3 feet deep, so knowing the draft (depth) of your boat is important.",
    "audioDescription": "Florida Bay is marked by long banks of brown mud, green seagrass, shallow blue white basins, and mangrove covered keys. With overall clean to murky blue waters, depths vary but average about three feet. Manatees, sea turtles and dolphins are fairly common sights as well as pelicans and other migratory birds. This body of water encompasses 800-plus square miles directly south of Everglades National Park’s Flamingo developed area and north of Islamorada island.",

    "bodyText": "Non-motorized boat launch available 24 hours a day, every day. No fee charged for boat launch. Vehicles cannot pull right up to the water. Canoes and kayaks must be carried the short distance from the parking area to the water. Parking is on a dirt / grassy area. A wilderness permit is required for all overnight stays in Everglades National Park. Wilderness permits are available at the nearby Gulf Coast Visitor Center. A park entrance pass is required if entering the waters of Everglades National Park. Passes are sold at the visitor center and online. The boat launch provides access to the Ten Thousand Islands and to the northern end of the 99-mile Wilderness Waterway.",
    "audioDescription": "The parking lot for the boat launch is an unmarked, grassy area. The grass is worn and shows tire tracks from vehicles. There is a sandwich board sign in front of the boat launch with three signs taped to it. The first sign reads, “Stop! No parking past this point. Loading and unloading only.” A second sign reads, “All park visitors are required to pay an entrance fee. Passes are not available at the visitor center while it is temporarily closed. Please visit recreation.gov and search for ‘Everglades National Park’ to purchase a pass.” A third sign reads, “Please complete a wilderness permit by the visitor center before any overnight trip.” The boat launch is located approximately northwest of the visitor center. On the south side of the boat launch is a green chain-link fence. On the other side of the fence is a National Park Service building with no public access to it. On the north side of the boat launch is a water spigot labeled “Drinking Water.” There are various canoes and kayaks stored on the south side of the boat launch. At the launch are five posts, three wooden and two metal, to prevent people from parking past them. North of the boat launch is a dense line of mangrove trees. On the south side of the boat launch is a black hose visitors can use to wash their boats. The ramp at the boat launch is made up of concrete squares 1’ x 1’. The ramp can be completely submerged by water at high tide and almost entirely exposed at low tide. There are many jagged, dark rocks with small mangrove trees shooting up between them on the south side of the ramp as you approach the water. Chokoloskee Bay is just west of the ramp. The bay is shallow and a ½-mile wide. Across the bay is a long, continuous line of mangrove trees. There are various navigation aids and channel markers in the bay visible from the boat launch. Some of the channel markers are brightly colored and shaped like triangles, others are green and shaped like squares.",

The surface of the nature trail is grassy and undeveloped. The western trailhead is along the seawall. To access the west trailhead, you walk past the picnic pavilion by the marina and follow the seawall south. You go beyond the pavement and follow an unimproved single-file path to reach the western trailhead of the nature trail. Along the single-file path you see dense vegetation to your east including sea grapes and mahogany trees. To your west is Chokoloskee Bay, a ½ -mile wide body of water. At the trailhead there is a Y in the trail, you can go left or right. If you go right, there is another Y only a few feet from the last Y. If you go right again, there is another Y immediately after the second Y. The direction you take at this Y does not matter because it is a loop. The eastern trailhead to the nature trail is across the lawn from the visitor center parking lot. The south side of the visitor center trailer is visible from the trailhead. The trailhead is unimproved and there is no signage. It is grassy and there is dense, green vegetation on both sides of the trailhead. There are five tall palm trees in the lawn west of the trailhead, and a utility box and electrical panel to the trailhead’s northeast.",

First, if there were a mistake with one of the missiles, the distance provided some protection of the people “up-range.” Second, this is where the radar towers stood, now gone. Five towers were here, both to track incoming aircraft and to track any missiles launched from the base. If the radar tracking the missiles were less than 3000 feet (about 1 km) from the launching missile they were to track, the missile would travel so fast as to be out of the range of the radar before the radar could lock onto it.",

    "audioDescription": "One of the trailheads for the Halfway Creek Canoe Trail is located at the Everglades National Park -Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch. The Halfway Creek Canoe Trail is 7.3-miles long from the Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch to the Big Cypress Swamp Welcome Center in Big Cypress National Preserve. The parking lot for the Gulf Coast boat launch is an unmarked, grassy area. The grass is worn and shows tire tracks from vehicles. There is a sandwich board sign in front of the boat launch with three signs taped to it. The first sign reads, “Stop! No parking pass this point. Loading and unloading only.” A second sign reads, “All park visitors are required to pay an entrance fee. Passes are not available at the visitor center while it is temporarily closed. Please visit recreation.gov and search for ‘Everglades National Park’ to purchase a pass.” A third sign reads, “Please complete a wilderness permit by the visitor center before any overnight trip.” The boat launch is located approximately northwest of the visitor center. On the south side of the boat launch is a green chain-link fence. On the other side of the fence is a National Park Service building with no public access to it. On the north side of the boat launch is a water spigot labeled “Drinking Water.” There are various canoes and kayaks stored on the south side of the boat launch. At the launch are five posts, three wooden and two metal, to prevent people from parking past them. North of the boat launch is a dense line of mangrove trees. On the south side of the boat launch is a black hose visitors can use to wash their boats. The ramp at the boat launch is made up of concrete squares 1’ x 1’. The ramp can be completely submerged by water at high tide and almost entirely exposed at low tide. There are many jagged, dark rocks with small mangrove trees shooting up between them on the south side of the ramp as you approach the water. Chokoloskee Bay is just west of the ramp. The bay is shallow and a ½-mile wide. Across the bay is a long, continuous line of mangrove trees. There are various navigation aids and channel markers in the bay visible from the boat launch. Some of the channel markers are brightly colored and shaped like triangles, others are green and shaped like squares.",

Once inside the premise there is a road that loops around and passes four different structures. Down the road about 300 feet on the left is the Missile Assembly building which still has its original (color?) paint with a mural of a Nike Missile painted by the soldiers that served at the site. The building is rectangular in shape and not showy other than the mural. There is a garage-style door that is opened using a hoist, but that door remains closed most the time. As you continue down the road, about another 200 feet, you make a left and there is a large barn style structure that resembles an airplane hangar. The barn is surrounded by a purpose built berm around three sides that are covered in grass. The barn has large sliding doors made of steel that are on rollers. In front of the barn is a large concrete pad that has markings. Once open the barn has cold war era artifacts that were in use during that time period. Front and center is a 41 foot white Nike Missile with green boosters. The missile has a sharp tip with flared winglets along the side.",

Hidden from historic logging activities, old-growth mahogany trees have grown to record size on the hammock’s higher, drier ground. The boardwalk’s back section rises through the hammock from dense undergrowth up toward the tree canopy, where owls and air plants thrive. The trail terrain is a boardwalk that runs through a sawgrass prairie which gives views of distant tree islands.

    "audioDescription": "At half mile from the turn off at Royal Palm road, the Old Ingraham Hiking trail begins with a drivable section of road running perpendicular to research Road. It is a packed concrete road pocked with pot holes and flanked on either side by thick canopied hardwood hammock and flat shallow grasslands indicating a recent restoration area. The hardwood hammock branches extend over portions of the road to provide shade canopy as well as habitat for songbirds and air plants. The strait road extends south for a mile, before ending at a dead end and parking area. A gray metal gate indicates the beginning of the portion of the trail that is only accessible by foot. Two small brown interpretive signs are to the right of the entrance gate. A small foot path around the gate yields to an approximately 6 or 8 foot wide paved trail/path. Designated as a historic trail, the concrete path is old and there is often vegetation poking through cracks in the gray limestone used for construction over 100 years ago. The trail continues south southwest for almost 4 miles before taking a sharp right west for another 6 miles. The beginning portion of the trail is adjacent to a 15 foot high, ¼ mile long vegetation mound that is part of the restoration area. Thick with succeeding vegetation, it is lush and green, speckled with flowers and pollinators. Thick shrubby vegetation line either side of the path as it gradually moves out into an open prairie habitat which is dotted with green hammocks in the distance. At various times of the year, the road may be inundated with water flowing from north to south. Occasionally the path tunnels through deeper and wetter thick cypress forests or small hammocks.",

    "audioDescription": "As you approach Pay-hay-okee Overlook, you will come across two rows of parking. There is handicap parking as well. Since Pay-hay-okee Overlook is a looped trail, you will start where the trailhead interpretive sign is located. The sign is both in English and in Spanish and it informs you of the distance and provides a short history of this place. The beginning of the trail is an accessible boardwalk ramp that gradually rises to an observation platform. The distance of this trail is 0.2 miles, or 250 meters, so please allow for about 20 to 25 minutes to complete it by walking. As you start walking the trail, you will notice being surrounded by native plants such as Coco Plum, Magnolia, and other trees. The trail is slowly inclining up and then opens up into a clear vista. On the left-hand side of the trail looking north there is an interpretive sign on the boardwalk railing about the bald cypress trees. Since this is an elevated boardwalk, you will be able to clearly observe the height of these cypress trees, as well as the overall area. There is a sheltered overlook that has three interpretive signs in English and Spanish, and there are two sitting benches. The view shows the famed ‘River of Grass’ and you can see many tree islands dotting the landscape. If you continue along the trail, there will be stairs to reach the other half of the boardwalk trail. As you are stepping down the stairs, you will be able to notice sawgrass and other flora closer to you since you have descended from the raised platform. The flat boardwalk allows you to see other things up close, and will eventually lead you back into the parking lot.",

The sign has a background image of a foggy morning at a pine rockland with mature and immature pine tree as a prominent piece to the picture. Below the title is text that reads “This trail loops through one of the most varied habitats in the park. The surrounding sawgrass is a single habitat; this pine island is many. Here the plants are clues to contrasting worlds, from cactus on high ground to the jungle tangle at the edge of a hammock. Pinelands habitats have no fixed borders. Fires and hurricanes shift them and enable these temperate islands to survive in the damp, subtropical environment. Look for charred pine bark and wind snapped trunks.” A picture of a Pileated Woodpecker bird and a picture of a Devil’s Potato plant sit side-by-side below the text. On the opposite side is a map of the trail indicating it is a 0.4 mile trail. The trail should take the average visitor about 30-minutes to complete. The trail is an asphalt trail and is accessible with a wheelchair.",

    "audioDescription": "The trailhead for the Sandfly Loop Paddling Trail is located at the Gulf Coast canoe/kayak launch. The Sandfly Loop Paddling Trail is 5-miles long. The parking lot for the Gulf Coast boat launch is an unmarked, grassy area. The grass is worn and shows tire tracks from vehicles. There is a sandwich board sign in front of the boat launch with three signs taped to it. The first sign reads, “Stop! No parking pass this point. Loading and unloading only.” A second sign reads, “All park visitors are required to pay an entrance fee. Passes are not available at the visitor center while it is temporarily closed. Please visit recreation.gov and search for ‘Everglades National Park’ to purchase a pass.” A third sign reads, “Please complete a wilderness permit by the visitor center before any overnight trip.” The boat launch is located approximately northwest of the visitor center. On the south side of the boat launch is a green chain-link fence. On the other side of the fence is a National Park Service building with no public access to it. On the north side of the boat launch is a water spigot labeled “Drinking Water.” There are various canoes and kayaks stored on the south side of the boat launch. At the launch are five posts, three wooden and two metal, to prevent people from parking past them. North of the boat launch is a dense line of mangrove trees. On the south side of the boat launch is a black hose visitors can use to wash their boats. The ramp at the boat launch is made up of concrete squares 1’ x 1’. The ramp can be completely submerged by water at high tide and almost entirely exposed at low tide. There are many jagged, dark rocks with small mangrove trees shooting up between them on the south side of the ramp as you approach the water. Chokoloskee Bay is just west of the ramp. The bay is shallow and a ½-mile wide. Across the bay is a long, continuous line of mangrove trees. There are various navigation aids and channel markers in the bay visible from the boat launch. Some of the channel markers are brightly colored and shaped like triangles, others are green and shaped like squares.",

A water refill station and ADA accessible restrooms are at the base of the tower, as well as a sign detailing the hydrologic history of the area. The path climbs in a spiral motion, slowly ascending to 45 feet (14m) above the trees to a panoramic observation point. A green and brown patchwork of aquatic landscapes and ecosystems surrounds the tower. Alligators, turtles, and various bird species inhabit the water and trees below. Occasionally, a female crocodile is found nearby. At the top of the tower, several additional wayside exhibits discuss Native Americans and natural features of the terrain surrounding you.",

There is a sandwich board sign in front of the boat launch with three signs taped to it. The first sign reads, “Stop! No parking pass this point. Loading and unloading only.” A second sign reads, “All park visitors are required to pay an entrance fee. Passes are not available at the visitor center while it is temporarily closed. Please visit recreation.gov and search for ‘Everglades National Park’ to purchase a pass.” A third sign reads, “Please complete a wilderness permit by the visitor center before any overnight trip.” The boat launch is located approximately northwest of the visitor center. On the south side of the boat launch is a green chain-link fence. On the other side of the fence is a National Park Service building with no public access to it. On the north side of the boat launch is a water spigot labeled “Drinking Water.” There are various canoes and kayaks stored on the south side of the boat launch. At the launch are five posts, three wooden and two metal, to prevent people from parking past them. North of the boat launch is a dense line of mangrove trees. On the south side of the boat launch is a black hose visitors can use to wash their boats. The ramp at the boat launch is made up of concrete squares 1’ x 1’. The ramp can be completely submerged by water at high tide and almost entirely exposed at low tide. There are many jagged, dark rocks with small mangrove trees shooting up between them on the south side of the ramp as you approach the water. Chokoloskee Bay is just west of the ramp. The bay is shallow and a ½-mile wide. Across the bay is a long, continuous line of mangrove trees. There are various navigation aids and channel markers in the bay visible from the boat launch. Some of the channel markers are brightly colored and shaped like triangles, others are green and shaped like squares.",

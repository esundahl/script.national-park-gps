Today the Burlingham Barn is a multi-use facility that houses seasonal restrooms.</p> <h3>History:</h3> <p>The Burlingham Barn is a typical \"English Barn\" thought to have been built before 1843, when it appeared as an item in William Webb's purchase of the property. However, the barn might date to when the Burlingham House was built (ca. 1775). The Burlingham Barn has a prominent middle door on the barn's side wall similar to other English barns from that time period.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/jaldenweir.htm\">Julian Alden Weir</a> would be inspired to artistically render the barn even when the property was owned by William Webb. He produced a series of etchings that focused on the south-west corner of the barn and the near-by gate. Weir would later acquire the barn as part of his 1907 purchase of the 50 acre Webb property.<br /> <br /> Following the death of Julian Alden Weir and his second wife, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/ellabakerweir.htm\">Ella</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/dorothyweiryoung.htm\">Dorothy Weir Young</a> inherited the Branchville Farm. She gave the adjoining farm property, including the Burlingham Barn to her sister <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/coraweirburlingham.htm\">Cora Weir Burlingham</a>. Between 1932 and 1938 the Burlinghams completed several alterations to the barn. The main doorway was shorted from a height of 12-feet to the current 8-foot 6-inch height. Two additional doors were also built to flank the main doorway. Even after all the renovations, the Burlingham barn still has the original 19th-century post-and-beam timbers.<br /> <br /> Today the Burlingham Barn is a multi-use facility for lectures, gallery talks, workshops, and meetings. There are also seasonal accessible restrooms in the building.<br /> <br /> <em>Restrooms facilities are open daily, 10:00 am - 4:00 pm. They are closed on the following Federal Holidays (observed) in 2023: Monday May 29, Monday June 19, Tuesday July 4, Monday September 4, Monday October 9.</em></p>",

The visitor center is open seasonally. Brochures, self-guided tours, Junior Ranger activities, and the National Park Passport Stamp are available year-round on the front porch.</p> <h3>History:</h3> <p>Julian Alden Weir's Branchville farm was composed of parcels of land from two neighboring colonial farms. Weir first acquired the 153-acre Beers farm in 1882, consisting of property north of Pelham Lane and down to present-day Weir Pond. In 1907, he acquired 50 acres from the neighboring Webb Farm. In total Weir's land eventually encompassed 238 acres.<br /> <br /> The Burlingham House, part of the original Webb Farm, bears the name of Weir's youngest daughter, Cora Weir Burlingham. Educated in both interior design and horticulture, Cora commissioned the broad garden terraces nearby, the Sunken Garden, and the adjacent stone potting shed. Much of the stonework was done by local stone mason and neighbor, Joe Knoche.<br /> <br /> To the south are fields that border the Weir Preserve. In 1969, Cora donated 37 acres of her land to the Connecticut Chapter of The Nature Conservancy, marking the start of the Weir Preserve. The Weir Preserve includes 110 acres of diverse woodland and wetland habitat owned by the <a href=\"https://www.weirfarmartalliance.org/\">Weir Farm Art Alliance</a>, a park partner. <br /> <br /> Today the Burlingham House serves as the park's visitor center where you can talk with Park Rangers, sign up for tours, obtain Junior Ranger program materials, explore museum exhibits, watch the park film, pick up free-to-use art supplies, and visit the Eastern National bookstore. Public restrooms are available seasonally and located in the nearby Burlingham Barn building, just down the accessible path.<br /> <br /> <em>The Burlingham House Visitor Center is open seasonally, Wednesday through Sunday, 10:00 am - 4:00 pm. The entrance to the building is wheelchair <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/planyourvisit/accessibility.htm\">accessible</a>.<br /> <br /> Explore the Burlingham House Visitor center in a <a href=\"https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=zXgqwA6sY3J\">virtual tour</a>!</em></p>",

Sometime around 1915, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/coraweirburlingham.htm\">Cora Weir Burlingham</a>, Caroline Weir Ely, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/dorothyweiryoung.htm\">Dorothy Weir Young</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/ellabakerweir.htm\">Ella Baker Weir</a> all might have had a hand in the creation of the formal garden. It is still unclear who created the garden area. However, a series of historic photographs in the garden show a wide range of activities were enjoyed here.<br /> <br /> When Dorothy and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/mahonriyoung.htm\">Mahonri Young</a> owned the property, the hedgerows became overgrown and the wooden gates and fences would vanish. It was during this time that the garden gained the name the “Secret Garden” because the hedges became so overgrown it hid the garden to those that did not know it was there. The hedges along the outside of the garden are called Deutzia. The plant is native to Eastern and Central Asia, and parts of Central America and Europe, and have beautiful white flowers.<br /> <br /> During the summer of 1995, with assistance from the Ridgefield Garden Club, the Secret Garden was restored. A new fountain and sundial, as well as fencing and plantings, were installed, and 23 non-historic trees were removed. Photos taken in 1915 were used to identify plant materials and help determine the general layout of the garden. The garden has been restored to circa-1940 and can be explored by visitors today.<br /> <br /> Weir Farm National Historical Park works with volunteers, partners, and garden clubs to continue the preservation of the park’s magnificent historic gardens. You can be part of the preservation story by becoming a Garden Volunteer! If you love gardening, spending time outdoors, or want to be part of the preservation of this National Park Service gem, join us in maintaining the beauty of your national park!

Commissioned by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/coraweirburlingham.htm\">Cora Weir Burlingham</a> in the early 1930’s this small, intimate space is defined by the stone retaining walls and curving flowerbeds edged with dwarf boxwood. Blooms of irises, peonies, bleeding hearts, and many more dynamic garden plants offer beauty and inspiration in the Sunken Garden throughout the seasons. It is a favorite spot for painters, as is the nearby stone potting shed. </p> <h3>History</h3> <p>When Cora Weir Burlingham, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/jaldenweir.htm\">Julian Alden Weir's</a> youngest daughter, took possession of the farm in 1931, she found it to be a “shambles,” and immediately initiated ambitious renovations and additions to the house, and had several new gardens designed and installed. <br /> <br /> With her education in landscape design, and a personal interest in gardening, Cora Weir Burlingham had a formal sunken garden commissioned next to her house. This garden was very innovative for the day, and because of its unusual features, it was featured in James M. Fitch and F. F. Rockwell's 1956 book, Treasury of American Gardens.<br /> <br /> Work started on the Sunken Garden in 1932, and was completed in 1940. It was designed by Vera Breed. Although no drawings of the plan have survived, the garden was fashioned in the popular Colonial Revival style. The small, intimate space, defined by stone retaining walls on all four sides, was laid out with curving flowerbeds backed by tall arborvitae and edged with dwarf boxwood, a characteristic feature of colonial-style gardens.<br /> <br /> Cora had the garden redesigned by Friede R. Stege in 1969. Stege would include more spring and summer plantings, such as azaleas, primroses, columbine, foxglove, and lupine, compared to the varietals that Breed installed in the garden.<br /> <br /> In 1995, the National Park Service began to inventory, map and photograph the existing plants in the Sunken Garden. The garden was rehabilitated, with the help of the Wilton Garden Club, based upon the site’s Cultural Landscape Report, as well as the many historic photographs that documented the garden during Cora’s tenure. <br /> <br /> Weir Farm National Historical Park works with volunteers, partners, and garden clubs to continue the preservation of the park’s magnificent historic gardens.

In the years following the war, this garden was phased out, and she had the Terraced Gardens south of the house constructed.<br /> <br /> This area was used primarily for growing raspberries, strawberries, and rhubarb, some of Cora’s favorites. Remnants of a wire trellis system, used to support raspberry plants. and cold frames, used for growing plants in the winter, are still visible. Glass would cover the cold frames during the winter, hay would be laid on top to help keep the warmth in.<br /> <br /> The small meadow surrounding the terraces held plantings of asparagus, a grape trellis and pear trees.

The house and adjacent studio are closed to the public.</p> <h3>History:</h3> <p>William Holsten and his family were the first in a succession of tenant farmers or caretakers to occupy the Caretaker’s House during Julian Alden Weir's life. The Holsten family lived in the Caretaker's House for two years, until he was let go for allowing 500 heads of celery to freeze. Around 1891, Weir hired Paul Remy. Paul Remy was one of Weir Farm’s longest term caretaker, living and working at the farm for almost 15 years. Remy occupied the Caretaker’s House with his wife and young sons, Carl and Willie.</p>   <p>After the death of Julian Alden Weir and his wife, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/ellabakerweir.htm\">Ella Baker Weir</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/dorothyweiryoung.htm\">Dorothy Weir Young</a> inherited the farm, including the Caretaker's House. Around 1929, Dorothy hired George R. Bass as tenant farmer and caretaker. Bass resided in the Caretaker’s House for about 15 years with his wife Bessie, nine children, and his mother in - law. During this period, the Caretaker’s Complex was largely the domain of Bass’s family; however, Dorothy and Mahonri Young kept their car in the former Carriage House. For the most part, the Youngs did their own driving. When they wanted their car, they would call for it, and Mr. Bass or one of his sons would drive it to their gate at the intersection of Nod Hill Road and Pelham Lane.<br /> <br /> The Youngs also shared the small greenhouse attached to the Caretaker's House with the Bass family, using it to start plants for the vegetable garden adjacent to the main farmhouse. The Bass family kept their own vegetable garden on the south side of the carriage house. About 30 - 40 feet from the building were asparagus beds. Beyond the asparagus were cabbages, tomatoes, and other fruits and vegetables.<br /> <br /> Dorothy’s account book records state that the Bass Family left on September 2, 1944. The following October, Spiros Anarjeros moved into the caretaker’s house. Anarjeros was an assistant to Mahonri Young during his execution of the \"This Is the Place\" monument.<br /> <br /> Today, the Caretaker’s House and the nearby art studio is managed by the <a href=\"https://www.weirfarmartalliance.org/\">Weir Farm Art Alliance</a> and is used for the park’s <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/getinvolved/artist-in-residence-program.htm\">Artist-in-Residence</a> program.

The rooms display period farming objects and reproduction animals based on the art of Mahonri Young and Julian Alden Weir, to convey a sense of how the spaces were used by the Weir and Young families in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p> <h3>History:</h3> <p>Weir Farm was once a fully operating farm, with horses, cows, oxen, chickens, vegetables, and numerous gardens. But to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/jaldenweir.htm\">Julian Alden Weir</a>, farming was more of a hobby than an economic necessity, undertaken for aesthetic reasons. Weir's romantic vision of the landscape extended to his use of oxen, carts, and hand tools instead of modern machinery available at the time. Over its long history the barn complex has housed a milking room, a carriage house/wagon shed, a garage, a tack room, an equipment and tool room, hay lofts, a corn crib, and stalls for donkeys, ponies and horses.<br /> <br /> Weir Barn is a typical \"English-barn\" built between 1815 and 1835. The Beer's family, who owned the property until 1880, might have built the original barn and added the wings.The current U-shaped style of the barn was present when Julian Alden Weir bought the 152-acre Branchville farm in 1882. He used the barn as a prominent feature in many of his paintings like \"New England Barnyard\" and \"After the Ride.\" <br /> <br /> After Weir's death, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/dorothyweiryoung.htm\">Dorothy Weir Young</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/mahonriyoung.htm\">Mahonri Young</a> would continue to use the barn for agricultural purposes and as an artistic source of inspiration. As caretakers of the property in the 1940s, the Bass family farmed the land and served as subjects for artwork by Dorothy and Mahonri. The property was continuously farmed until the 1950s.<br /> <br /> The Weir Barn today includes a stable, a pony stall, an equipment room, and a milking parlor. Weir Farm NHP does not have any farm animals.<br /> <br /> <em>The Weir Barn is open seasonally, Wednesday through Sunday. There are no set tours and the experience is self-guided. There are interpretive panels that explain the Weir Barn and its history.</em><br /> <br /> <em>The exhibits at the historic Weir Barn were made possible by generous grants and donations from the </em><a href=\"http://www.amblertrust.org/\">Elizabeth Raymond Ambler Trust</a><em> (Wilton, CT), the </em><a href=\"https://www.ridgefieldthriftshop.com/\">Ridgefield Thrift Shop</a><em> (Ridgefield, CT), and the </em><a href=\"http://www.gandbculturalcenter.org/\">G & B Cultural Center</a><em> (Wilton, CT) to the </em><a href=\"https://friendsofweirfarm.org/\">Friends of Weir Farm NHP</a><em>. Thanks to the support of park partners and visitors, Weir Farm National Historical Park is able to continue preserving special places like the Weir Barn, and to share the stories associated with J. Alden Weir and the three generations of artists that were inspired by the Connecticut countryside.<br /> <br /> <strong>From November 1st to April 30th, all park buildings are closed for the off season, including restroom facilities.</strong></em></p>",

After a visit in 1882, Weir agreed and acquired the 153-acre farm.<br /> <br /> The original structure of the Weir House was built between 1760 and 1780. However, Weir built several additions onto the structure over the years. The house was often filled with family and friends. The Branchville farm was a popular artistic retreat for Weir’s closest friends. The first-floor bedroom, described by Dorothy Young Weir as the \"Ryder Room\", was often housed by artist <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/albertpryder.htm\">Albert Pinkham Ryder</a>. Julian’s three daughters, Caroline Alden Weir Ely, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/dorothyweiryoung.htm\">Dorothy Weir Young </a>and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/coraweirburlingham.htm\">Cora Weir Burlingham </a>were also raised in the house.<br /> <br /> After Julian’s death, Dorothy moved into the Weir House with her husband <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/mahonriyoung.htm\">Mahonri Young</a>. Dorothy converted one of the bedrooms on the second floor to uses as a studio. The last residents of the house were artists <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/sperryandrews.htm\">Sperry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/wefa/learn/historyculture/dorisandrews.htm\">Doris Andrews</a>, good friends of Mahonri Young. Today the house is restored to circa 1940 to tell the stories of all three generations of artists. <br /> <br /> <em>Flash photography, tripods, food, drink, strollers, or umbrellas are not permitted in the Weir House.

Today the area is still used for artistic inspiration and as a hiking destination.</p> <h3>History:</h3> <p>Julian Alden Weir was an avid outdoorsman who loved to fish, hunt, and hike. When his painting, <em>The Truants</em>, won an art competition sponsored by the Boston Art Club, Weir used the $2,500 to purchase ten acres of land and constructed the \"Boston Art Club Pond,\" known today as Weir Pond. He cleared a 3.6-acre area and constructed water from intermittent streams and springs. Weir dug a stone-lined channel to help regulate the pond water level. It allowed him to divert water toward the pond during dry periods, and away from the pond to avoid flooding. He also built boathouse, dock, and stone steps to a viewing area. On the small island, he fashioned a gazebo surrounded by white birches. Most of the structures are gone today, but the pond, the dam, and the small island still exist.<br /> <br /> By the late 1960s, the surrounding landscape has been left unattended for decades, and a second-growth forest took hold. When land near and around the pond was threatened by development, the move for preservation began eventually protecting the entire cultural landscape known today as Weir Farm National Historical Park.<br /> <br /> <em>The Weir Pond trail loop (1.2 miles) winds through the woodlands and wetlands, and is an easy to moderate hike blazed with yellow trail markings. The trail is not accessible. Dogs are allowed if leashed and picked up after. Fishing is allowed in accordance with state regulations, and is catch and release only. </em></p>",

Today, the studio is historically furnished, and visitors can view original and reproduction sculptures, paintings, etchings, artists tools, furnishings, and collections.</p> <h3>History:</h3> <p>Born into a family of artists, Julian Alden Weir studied art at New York's National Academy of Design and later matriculated to Les Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He bought the Branchville Farm in 1882 from Erwin Davis and built his studio shortly after in 1885. While living in Branchville, Weir shifted his artistic style from portrait and still life work to focus on the inspirational nature of the landscape at his Branchville farm. Critical acclaim ultimately brought Weir to the forefront of the American art establishment. He received multiple awards and acclaims in his last years as critics celebrated Julian's contributions to the world of art. Julian Alden Weir died in 1919 having begun an artistic legacy at his Branchville farm that persists to this day. <br /> <br /> Originally, the Weir Studio had brown walls and a light blue green ceiling. However, Weir realized how surface colors can impact the colors on his canvas. To fix this, he painted the whole studio gray. Stars that were placed on the studio's ceiling by Weir, and along with an array of artists’ tools, original objects, and furnishings, can be still seen today. <br /> <br /> After Weir’s death, the studio was primarily used for storage. The Weir Studio has been restored to circa-1915 and is historically furnished. Weir’s paintbrushes, pallets, pigments, and paint boxes have been preserved and are on view inside the studio.<br /> <br /> <i><em>The Weir Studio is not wheelchair accessible.<br /> <br /> The Weir Studio is open seasonally, Wednesday through Sunday.

Today, the studio is historically furnished, and visitors can view original and reproduction sculptures, paintings, etchings, artists tools, furnishings, and collections from both Young and Andrews.</p> <h3>History:</h3> <p>After producing his first sculpture at thirteen, Mahonri Mackintosh Young pursued formal art education in Salt Lake City, New York, and Paris. Mahonri would become quick friends with Julian Alden Weir's daughter, Dorothy Weir. The two shared a love for art, and soon fell in love. Dorothy and Mahonri would marry in 1931. Dorothy and Mahonri Young would move to the Weir family's Branchville farm shortly after their wedding. Throughout his life, Young's work ranged from large monuments; to smaller sculptures of laborers and boxers in the Social Realist style; to intimate sketches of daily life at Weir Farm.</p>   <p>A small pre-existing structure, Caroline Weir Ely's ca. 1915 book bindery, was attached to the western side of the studio. The room uses some of the multi-paned windows that were part of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/weir-studio.htm\">Weir Studio</a> before renovations eliminated their use. Mahonri Young used this room for etching. Initially the exterior of the Young Studio was painted white, with only the southern facade of the former book bindery painted red. The rest of the exterior was painted red to match the former book bindery over the next decade.<br /> <br /> Following Mahonri's death, the Young Studio was used by Sperry Andrews as a workspace. He would create numerous paintings in this studio and found inspiration from the light and surroundings. One of the main alterations the Andrews did to the building was adding the upper balcony on the east wall of the studio. <br /> <br /> The Young Studio has been restored to circa-1940 and is historically furnished. Mahonri Young once owned many of the furnishings and art supplies in the building. However, areas of the studio are furnished with objects once owned and used by Sperry Andrews.</p>   <p><em>The Young Studio is not wheelchair accessible.<br /> <br /> The Young Studio is open seasonally, Wednesday through Sunday.

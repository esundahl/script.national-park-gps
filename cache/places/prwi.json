Directly below the sign title, text reads, \"Forests are like high-rise apartment buildings. Various residents live on different floors. Some residents travel between floors, especially when they eat or go to gather food. Exhibits along this path provide a glimpse of various plants and animals that inhabit three floors in this Piedmont forest high-rise from the treetops up above to the stream down below.\" In bright green to the right of this paragraph on the sign, text reads, \"Top Floor: Canopy. In the spring and summer, oaks, hickories, and other deciduous trees provide a leafy umbrella, or canopy, that shades and cools the Piedmont forest.\" Directly below this paragraph on the sign in dark green, text reads, \"Middle Floor: Understory. Shallow gullies carry rainwater and snowmelt and create habitats that are periodically moist, damp, or dry.\" Directly below this paragraph on the sign in blue, text reads, \" Basement: Forest Floor. Low-lying plants, mosses, leaves, and acorns carpet the ground. In some areas a stream runs through the forest floor.\"",

    "audioDescription": "The trail follows Quantico Creek, a shallow stream about 10 feet in width. This stop is located in a flat, shaded area in the forest beside the creek. The sign has a black bar at the top with the words \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior\" and an NPS arrowhead symbol on the black bar in the upper right corner. The sign is titled \"Coastal Plain\" and a picture of shallow water flowing over gravel underlies the entire sign. Under the title in the upper left corner of the sign is a short paragraph reading, \"As you walk along the trail, notice that the soil is becoming sandy to your right. You are now entering the Coastal Plain, a relatively flat area consisting of an accumulation of sediments washed down from the uplands and mountains. The Coastal Plain is actually a section of the Atlantic continental shelf that is no longer covered by the ocean.\" On the upper right corner of the sign next to the paragraph is a square image of the entire park map which is a large oval-like area of green with the two branches of Quantico Creek and major roadways and trails in the park. A circular enhanced portion of the map is to right of the square map image on the sign. This enhanced circular image shows the mapped waterway of Quantico Creek where you are currently standing. While the creek has tight curves near the top of the enhanced image (in the Piedmont), the curves start to straighten near the bottom of the enhanced image (in the Coastal Plain). A caption of the map image on the sign reads, \"Remnants of hard upland rock force the waters of Quantico Creek to meander around them.\"",

The sign is titled \"Fall Line\" and a background picture of shallow water flowing over small rocks underlies the text on the sign. Directly underneath the sign title at the top are two paragraphs that read, \"You are standing at the fall line, the place where Quantico Creek ceases to be navigable by boat. This area is a transition zone where the creek flows from the mountains and uplands to the relatively level lowlands of the Coastal Plain. Here, the waters of the creek cascade over metamorphic bedrock, which is more resistant to erosion than the softer rock to the east. Over time the creek has cut through soft rock layers and exposed the hard Chopawamsic formation.\" Underneath these paragraphs in the middle of the sign are three pictures spread along a timeline. On the left of the timeline on the sign is a color picture of tree-covered ridges of mountains seen from a high point labeled \"Blue Ridge.\" On the middle of the timeline is a color aerial photograph of several small creeks winding through a forested area labeled \"Piedmont.\" To the right of the Piedmont picture is a break in the timeline labeled \"Fall Line.\" And finally on the right of the timeline is a color picture of shallow grassy marsh at the edge of a large body of water labeled \"Coastal Plain.\" At the bottom left corner of the sign under the timeline is a short sentence reading, \"The topographic profile of eastern Virginia is represented (from left) by the Blue Ridge in Shenandoah National Park, the rolling piedmont uplands in this national park, and the coastal plain at George Washington Memorial Parkway.\"",

Today part of the Washington-Rochambeau Revoluntionary Route National Historic Trail, the trail meanders through the forest following a faint network of old roadways that existed before Prince William Forest Park was created.",
    "audioDescription": "At a bend in the trail is a shaded sign in the forest which is located on an old road that looks like a straight shallow valley between two hills on either side. The sign has a black bar at the top with the words \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior\" and an NPS arrowhead symbol on the black bar in the upper right corner. Most of the sign consists of a large black and white print image underlying all the sign text of a house with a porch and sign out front beside a dirt road on which a 4 horse drawn stagecoach is traveling between fences on the edges of the road. A caption of this large background image reads, \"Stagecoaches carried passengers to and from Dumfries.\" The sign itself is titled \"Historic Routes\" and a paragraph in the upper left under the title reads, \"The old roadbed to your right was a forerunner of today's interstate highways. American Indians made a path through the woods so they could travel between villages and their hunting and fishing grounds along tidewater creeks. European settlers widened it into a roadway - known as the Potomac Path - to transport tobacco and passengers to the port of Dumfries. During the Revolutionary War, American and French troops marched through on their way south to Yorktown. In the Civil War, Confederates attacked Union picket lines along the road. This section of road was abandoned in the 1930s.\" To the right of that paragraph on the sign in the upper center is a square sparsely detailed map of the Washington-Rochambeau Trail route from Virginia to Rhode Island with NPS sites along the route highlighted. The map is captioned, \"The route Rochambeau and Washington's troops took extends more than 600 miles from Newport, Rhode Island, to Yorktown, Virginia.\" To the right of the map image on the sign in the upper right corner is another small image of 13 Revolutionary War soldiers standing in a line wearing tricornered hats, blue jackets, and white pants. A caption of this image reads, \"As they walked toward Yorktown, George Washington's Continental soldiers had to be on alert for surprise attacks.\"",

Look for its rectangular home in a tree trunk.\" To the right of that paragraph is a close-up picture of a large black bird with a red crest, white striped face and long beak perched on a tree trunk. Underneath the woodpecker picture is a paragraph reading, \"Garden Spider: What is a spider doing in the canopy? Spiders travel on their silky strands that drift upward like balloons.

    "bodyText": "Wondering about what lives on the ground in Prince William Forest Park? Learn more about wildlife in the park by hiking the Piedmont Forest Trail and reading about a variety of animals such as insects, raccoons, and salamanders that call the forest floor home. Take in the sounds of the forest by sitting on the deck above a tributary of Quantico Creek and enjoying the rustles of the wind moving through the trees and animals scurrying through the forest.",
    "audioDescription": "The Piedmont Forest Trail passes through a large, wide, shaded circular dark brown deck with 3 benches and a high table wrapped around 4 trees growing up through the deck. The deck overlooks a tributary stream to Quantico Creek in the forest that is occasionally filled with water. The deck is encircled by a dark brown railing. On the left side of the deck near the railing is a slanted sign with information about animals in the forest. The sign has a large color picture on a blue background of a flowing creek beneath a streambank covered in green ferns and is titled \"Life on the Forest Floor.\" A paragraph underneath the sign title reads, \"A steady stream of water flows through the Piedmont forest's basement at this location in the park. The low-lying vegetation is thicker here than in the understory because of all the moisture. Frogs, toads, and salamanders feast on insects that thrive in this wet habitat. Raccoons, deer, and other animals come here to drink and search for food.\" A warning underneath the paragraph reads, \"Graffiti: Cutting into the bark of these beech trees is sentencing them to an early death. Please respect all of the inhabitants of the Piedmont forest - including the trees.\" To the upper right of the main picture and paragraph on the sign are two stacked smaller pictures: the top one of a small brown and red winged insect and the bottom one of a small green cylindrical insect. A paragraph to the right of the pictures reads, \"Aquatic Insects: Dragonfly and Boatman fly larvae are out of sign under the rocks in the stream. Insects help to indicate stream health. Good water quality is important because these waters eventually feed into the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay.\" Underneath the insect pictures is a paragraph that reads, \"Common Raccoon: Raccoons often live in hollow logs or rocky crevices near wooded streams. They feed on aquatic insects, fish, frogs, and snakes. Raccoons appear to wash their food, but they may just be feeling it for inedible parts. Can you spot any tracks in the mud?\" To the right of that paragraph is a color picture of a grey raccoon with a black face and black and grey striped tail standing in water. Underneath and partially overlaying the raccoon picture are two silhouettes of small, five fingered, clawed tracks labeled hind foot and front foot. Underneath the raccoon tracks and picture is a paragraph reading, \"Two-lined Salamander: If you spot a northern two-lined salamander, consider yourself lucky. These amphibians spend most of their time under logs, leaves, rocks, and debris. They feed on beetles, spiders, flies, ticks, and other insects.\" To the immediate left of this paragraph on the sign is a color picture of a small glistening orange salamander with black eyes laying on a green oak leaf.",

    "audioDescription": "Lot D is on the west side of the park’s Scenic Drive and is separated from the road by a small grass barrier. It is paved, accommodates about 20 vehicles, and provides access to North Orenda Road and Pyrite Mine Road, which are both hike and bike trails. The bike lane along the Scenic Drive also begins here. To access North Orenda Road after you have parked your car, walk to the south end of the lot and cross the street to find the trailhead. For Pyrite Mine Road, walk to the north end of the lot and cross the street. Two upright information signs on the western side of the parking lot give more information about bicycling in the park and hiking the Pyrite Mine Road. The left sign is titled \"Bicycling Guide\" and has a large map of the park bicycling trails which consist of unpaved service roads and Scenic Drive loop. Text under the title reads, \"The park offers a variety of bicycling experiences on more than 12 miles of paved roads and 9.2 miles of unpaved fire roads. Approximately 3 miles of the Scenic Drive, from parking lot D to Oak Ridge Road, are set aside as a relatively flat, paved bicycle lane. Ask at the visitor center for a bicycle trail brochure.\" Under the text and map on the bicycling sign is a photo of two people riding bicycles on the road as well as a list of regulations and safety tips. There is also a list of unpaved bicycle routes on the sign which reads \"Burma Road (blue blazes) 1.4 miles, Lake One Road (blue blazes) 0.4 miles, Liming Lane 0.9 miles, Mawavi Road 0.9 miles, North Orenda Road 1 mile, Old Black Top Road 1.6 miles. Pyrite Mine Road 1 mile, South Orenda Road 0.5 miles, Taylor Farm Road (blue blazes) 1.5 miles, West Gate Road 0.6 miles.\" The information sign to the right of the bicycling sign is titled \"Pyrite Mine Road, Cabin Branch Mine Trail\" and hold a map of this 1.5 mile loop trail as while as information about it. The majority of this mine sign is taken up by a historical black and white photo of the mill for the pyrite mine, which is a group of buildings on a hillside with steam shooting up from them and chutes below them. This large background sign photo is captioned, \"The mining operation had more than 70 buildings on the banks of Quantico Creek.\" A smaller inset black and white photo in the bottom right corner of the mining sign shows an old train engine pulling a train car on tracks through a sparse forest. This train photo is captioned, \"A narrow gauge railroad, similar to the one shown, hauled the pyrite ore to barges on the Potomac River.\"",

Drive down park entrance road and turn left before getting to the pavilion; then Piedmont Forest Trail parking will be down the road about 400 feet on the left. 350 feet further down the lot is the Pine Grove Trailhead and more parking. A large upright sign with a large background image of an orange and black viceroy butterfly stands to the left of the paved trailhead. The sign is titled \"Piedmont Forest Trail\" and a paragraph under the title reads, \"Follow the green blazes of this self-guiding, 0.2 mile loop trail and explore the life in the Piedmont forest. This type of mixed hardwood forest once covered the rolling hills between the Coastal Plain and the Appalachian Mountains from New York to Alabama. Agricultural practices and development have destroyed most of these eastern woodlands. This national park protects the largest expanse of Piedmont Forest in the National Park System.\" In the upper right corner of the sign near the title are three short informational paragraphs. The first reads, \"Trail Markers: Trails are marked with colored blazes on trees. Get a trail map and blaze guide at the visitor center. Straps on stone posts not trail directions and distances.\" The second paragraph reads, \"Safety Tips: Watch for tree stumps and slippery rocks. Inspect yourself periodically for ticks; use preventative measures.\" The third paragraph reads, \"Regulations: No bicycles on trails. Keep pets on leash. Do not feed wildlife. Do no disturb or remove an plants, animals, or historic features.\" Under the text and the butterfly image on the sign are three smaller pictures. On the bottom left of the sign is a close-up photo of a brown and tan eight-legged spider on a web captioned \"Garden spider.\" In the bottom center of the sign is a close-up photo of a glistening orange four-legged salamander with brown eyes and a brown stripe down it's back on a green leaf captioned \"Northern two-lined salamander.\" In the bottom right of the sign is a close-up photo of a grey and white backed and yellow breasted bird on a twig with the caption \"Yellow-throated warbler.\"",

    "bodyText": "Standing on this viewing platform, look through the trees across the creek and you can see the hillside site where the old milling buildings were contrusted and operated by the Cabin Branch Mining Company from 1889-1920. Milling the pyrite ore and sorting it by quality and size was an essential part of the mining operation. After sorting by size, the ore would be spread out and hammered until it could pass through a 2 1/2 inch ring. Smaller pieces were ground between wheels and screens until fine. It was then sent down the hill via the vertical structures show on the sign image and put into railway cars.<br /> <br /> When the mine closed down in 1920, the buildings were abandoned and many of the mine tailings were left exposed. Sulfur from the pyrite started to leach into the creek and raised the acidity of the water. While reclamation of the mine land was ongoing since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1970, the largest reclamation project took place in 1995, capping mineshafts, burying mine tailings with lime, building storm-water channels to divert run-off, and planting trees and shrubs.",
    "audioDescription": "The sign has a black bar at the top with the words \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior\" and an NPS arrowhead symbol on the black bar in the upper right corner. The background image underlying the text on the sign is a black and white photo of several large wooden buildings on a hillside with 5 tubes extending from them down the hillside and stream shooting from the roofs of some of the buildings. The background image is captioned in the lower left corner of the sign, \"The Cabin Branch Pyrite Mine in the early 1900s.\" The sign is titled \"Reclaiming the Land\" and paragraphs on the upper portion of the sign under the title read, \"Today Virginia pine trees grow on the hillside where the Cabin Branch Pyrite Mine operated, and Quantico Creek no longer runs orange or smells of sulfur. In 1995 the National Park Service and the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy started a project to reclaim the site, because the land could not heal itself. They built storm-water channels to divert surface water, capped mineshafts with cement, buried mine tailings with lime and soil to reduce acidity, and panted 5,000 trees and shrubs.\"",

Underneath the map on the sign are 3 short informational paragraphs. The first reads, \"Trail Markers: Trails are marked with colored blazes on trees. Get a trail map and blaze guide at the visitor center. Straps on stone posts not trail directions and distances.\" The second paragraph reads, \"Safety Tips: Watch for tree stumps and slippery rocks. Inspect yourself periodically for ticks; use preventative measures.\" The third paragraph reads, \"Regulations: No bicycles on trails. Keep pets on leash. Do not feed wildlife. Do no disturb or remove an plants, animals, or historic features.\" To the left of these paragraphs on the sign are two copies of portraits outlined in gold. The black and white portrait on the left is captioned \"General George Washington\" and depicts a man in a high collared dress jacket with white curled hair looking to the right.

The sign near the water has a black bar at the top with the words \"National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior\" and an NPS arrowhead symbol on the black bar in the upper right corner. The sign is titled \"The Power of Water\" and has a blue color picture of shallow water flowing over gravel underlying the text on the sign. Under the title in the upper left portion of the sign, a short paragraph reads, \"Listen carefully for a few minutes. The waters of Quantico Creek produce the steady sounds you hear as they flow through the valley below the ridge in front of you. Flowing water may not be a dramatic as volcanic eruptions, but it has been a major force in shaping the Piedmont landscape. Day by day over millions of years, runoff has eroded and continues to erode layers and layers of rock and sediments from the Appalachian Mountains and the Piedmont hills.\" Next to this paragraph on the upper right side of the sign is a color picture of a large rock with large smooth depressions on it beside a flowing creek.

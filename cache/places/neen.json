    "bodyText": "<p>The New England National Scenic Trail (NET) is a 215-mile hiking trail route that has been in existence for over half a century. The NET travels through 41 communities in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and is comprised primarily of the historic Mattabesett, Metacomet, and Monadnock (M-M-M) Trail systems.<br /> <br /> The NET  travels through classic New England landscape features: long-distance vistas with rural towns as a backdrop, agrarian lands, un-fragmented forests, and large river valleys. The trail also travels through colonial historical landmarks and highlights a range of diverse ecosystems and natural resources:  mountain ridges and summits, forested glades, wetlands and vernal pools, lakes, streams and waterfalls.<br />  </p> <p>The NET was designated on March 30, 2009 as part of Public Law 111-11 (<a href=\"https://newenglandtrail.org/sites/default/files/omnibuspubliclandmanagementact2009_sec_5202.pdf\">Section 5202</a>). The law references the Trail Management Blueprint described in the report titled the ‘<a href=\"https://newenglandtrail.org/sites/default/files/nps_final_report.pdf\">Metacomet Monadnock Mattabesett Trail System National Scenic Trail Feasibility Study and Environmental Assessment</a>’, prepared by the National Park Service, and dated Spring 2006, as the framework for trail management and administration.<br /> <br /> Since the federal designation in 2009, there have been some noteworthy changes to the historic route, including a 4-mile extension to Long Island Sound in Connecticut and a 22+ mile eastward deviation from the historic Metacomet-Monadnock Trail in Massachusetts.</p>",

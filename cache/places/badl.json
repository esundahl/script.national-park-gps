    "audioDescription": "A parking lot accommodating about a dozen vehicles overlooks an eastward expansive basin of mixed-grass prairie and badlands formations. The prairie extends into the horizon. On the west, a hill covered in grasses and sheering into layered badlands formations extends up 50'. The road continues northward and southward into winding and steep canyons and passes. A single wayside exhibit shares the story of paleo-Indian and other Indigenous peoples who have left behind arrowheads and other implements of their presence. The wayside has examples of bone awls, arrowheads, bone bead, pottery fragments, and stone blades. The text reads: Ancient Hunters: A thousand years ago, a hunter stood where you stand. He watched bison drift like a dark cloud shadow across prairie below. Could the herd be stampeded onto the high prairie behind the cliff on your left, and driven over the edge? If so, injured animals could be butchered on the spot, on the very edge of the camp. The hunter and his companions had pitched their shelters close by the cliff, protected from the cutting wind. Water seeped from the slop. A little digging with a sharp stick had released a spring. How do we know? Bits of pottery, arrowheads, razor-edged quartz flakes used for butchering -- a rabbit jaw and bird bone mixed among charcoal of long-quenched campfires -- and many bison bones have eroded out of the gullies that surround you. Collecting artifacts and fossils is illegal in the park.",

The text of the exhibit reads: The Door Trail leads to the broken landscape that earned this area the name Badlands. Over time, water sliced through the earth around you, exposing sedimentary rock layers. These layers continue to erode today into dramatic canyons and spires. Explore these features up close by passing through a natural door at the end of the boardwalk. \"It's an improbable kind of place, looking like the set of a science-fiction movie,\" James Madsen, Life on the Back Side of the Moon.",

To the west, a worn unpaved trail extending into badlands formation and prairie grasslands. To the east, boardwalk trail approximately a quarter of a mile extends in a loop amid badlands formations and interspersed prairie grasses. A wayside exhibit beside the start of the trail is described as follows, A 75-Million-Year Walk: This trail features seven types of animals that once lived in the area now known as Badlands National Park. Each of these lineages met a different fate as the climate changed. Some moved, some adapted to the changes, and some are now extinct. Walk the trail to learn their stories and discover how this place and its inhabitants have changed over the course of 75 million years. A three piece pie chart is labelled and described as follows in a clockwise progression: Adapt – two horses, and adult and child, are standing next to one another with the text \"As the climate changed, habitats changed. Many animals adapted to new environments. Early horses and dogs were flexible enough to survive in these new environments. These animals are each part of a lineage that evolved into modern horses and dogs. Die – A small creature that looks like a dog with white stipes on its back lays upside down with small flies floating above. The text reads \"Some animals could not adapt to the changing climates and habitats. Four of the groups exhibited along this trail, including the oreodont, went extinct. Move – An alligator stylized as a cartoon is walking on two legs wearing a hat and holding a suitcase. The text reads \"Some animals moved to habitats that were more favorable. Tens of millions of years ago, members of the alligator family used to live all over North Amiercan, including here at what is now Badlands National Park. As the climate cooled and dried, their range shrank. Now they live in places like Florida. The entire exhibit is backdropped by a stylized stack of a layered badlands formation with each layer marked, from bottom to top, as: Pierre Shale, 67 to 75 million years ago Yellow Mounds, 67 million years ago Chardron Formation, 34 to 37 million years ago Brule Formation, 30 – 34 million years ago Fossil Exhibit Trail is Here Rockyford Ash, 30 million years ago Sharps Formation, 28 – 30 million years ago.",

A small wooden sign identifies the location as Hay Butte Overlook. The overlook looks out into a badlands wilderness with buttes that stretch into the horizon for miles. There is a small wayside exhibit with information about the grasses on top of badlands buttes, which reads: High Grassy Tables: Erosion left a few high islands topped with virgin sod, the slopes so steep that homesteaders could not get their stock up to graze. Instead, the homesteaders waited until the grass was ready to cut. Then several got together, took apart a mower, and reassembled it on the top of the table. Once the grass was cut and baled, homesteaders hitched it to a cable stretched from the rim of the lower prairie – and whoosh, the bales slid down. Hence the name Hay Butte for the long table in the horizon. Today the high grassy tables are harvested only by bighorns and deer. The bison which roam the Sage Creek Wilderness are excluded as effectively as were the stock of the homesteaders. (Large black and white photograph of expansive, layered badlands landscape extending into the horizon with markers labeling several areas: \"hay butte,\" \"antler butte,\" and \"hay butte.\" A second image is a smaller inset black and white photograph of a man standing on a way being hauled by two horses.)",

In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the first Homesteading Act into law. Under this initial law, a US citizen could claim a 160-acre plot of public land in the West by filing an application, living on and improving the land for a minimum of five years, and filing for a deed within seven years.<br /> <br /> While the Homesteading Acts offered free land to settlers, this “free” land came at a great cost to Native Americans. Much of the land offered as homesteading plots was seized from the Native Americans who previously inhabited the Great Plains through legislation like the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/dawes-act.htm\">Dawes Act.</a></p>",
    "audioDescription": "On the southwest side of a two-lane, two-way paved north-south highway, a parking lot accommodating approximately a dozen vehicles provides access to expansive views of Badlands geology and prairie ecosystems. A boardwalk extends to a drop-off into Badlands canyons and draws. There is a 6' wide bench at the edge of the boardwalk and metal handrails throughout. Wayside exhibits provide explanation of homestead and ranching history of the region, the text reads: Homesteads and Ranches: Homesteaders poured into the Badlands when the Milwaukee Railroad completed track through the White River Valley in 1907. \"Visualize if you can,\" one observer wrote, \"a tar paper shack tent, or dugout on every quarter section of land...and you will have a minds' eye picture of what the community looked like...\" A checker-board pattern was created, bearing little relationship to the natural lay of the land. And bearing little relationship to the productivity of the land. Most of the homesteads turned out to be \"Starvation Claims\" and were abandoned or sold. Starved-out homesteaders moved on to build towns and cities, or to seek another homestead in a land less harsh. Today the ranches of this valley are measured in thousands of acres, and heavy equipment does most of the work once done by callused hands. Even so, unpredictable drought and economic crisis test ranchers today as severely as they tested homesteaders yesterday.

The wayside is described as follows: Air Pollution: A threat to Badlands National Park. In the heart of a sparsely settled region, far from major sources of industrial pollution, Badlands National Park offers clean air and haze-free views – most of the time. On a clear day, you can see Eagle Nest Butte, thirty miles away. On a clear night, you can see a wealth of distant stars, trillions of miles out in space. But, all too often, polluted air flows in from urban and industrial areas as far as southern California and southern Arizona, as well as from industrial centers in the Midwest – and a mask of pollution veils the Badlands. Is the view as clear today as it should be? Will it be clear tomorrow? You can help to clear the air. Conserve electricity. Carpool. Recycle. And involve yourself in air quality issues. Three images are inset on the exhibit, from left to right: A badlands landscape extending into the horizon under blue skies, a starry night sky, a hazy badlands landscape with gray and unclear sky.",

    "audioDescription": "On the east side of a paved, two-way, two-lane north-south highway a large parking lot accommodating approximately three dozen vehicles contains a tan building for a restroom. A boardwalk extends approximately 50 feet down a small hill out to the edge of a drop-off. The view provides an opportunity to see a dramatic Badlands landscape consisting of layered, jagged rock and extending into the horizon dropping down into mixed-grass prairie. Three wayside exhibits provide information about badlands acreage, birds and junipers, and volcanic influences on the geology. The three exhibits are described as follows: The first exhibit reads, The Big Badlands: Badlands National Park – 244,000 acres A few hundred yards to the west, turn left on the Sage Creek Rim Road for Roberts Prairie Dog Town and the Sage Creek Primitive Campground. Wildlife, particularly bison, is often seen near this gravel road. The Sage Creek Rim Road overlooks the Badlands Wilderness Area – more than one hundred square miles of roadless mixed-grass prairie – set aside under the Wilderness Act of 1964 to preserve forever its primeval character. You may continue down this road to reach Sheep Mountain Table, the White River Visitor Center, and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation via State 44 west and B.I.A. 27 south. (a stylized illustration of a bison heard has a combination of bison adults and calves, the rest of the wayside is a series of park maps showing locations throughout the park and highlights therein. There is a caption under one of the maps: \"watch for wayside exhibits (like this one) beside park roads.\"). The second exhibit reads, Birds and Junipers: A cliff juniper grows in a natural garden featuring twisted trunks and sculpted rocks. Badlands birds seek out these pleasant places both in summer and in winter. Here they find nest sites and song perches, and hiding places from predators and mean weather. Bluebirds, solitaires, robins, waxwings, and many other eat juniper berries, sweet with the flavor of gin. It is the birds which plant the juniper gardens. Flying far after a good meal, they drop seeds at random. Some of those seeds grow up, and in time shelter other birds. (a series of stylized illustrations show several different birds, titled: Long-eared owl, Townsend's Solitaire, Field Sparrow, Mountain Bluebird, Brown Thrasher, Logger-headed Shrike, Rosy Finch, Tree Sparrow, Bohemian Waxwing, Northern Shrike.) Born of Volcanos: Thirty-seven million years ago, the ancient crystalline core of the Black Hills had already been exposed by erosion. The long blue profile of those mountains, visible to the west, looked much as it does now. About that time, streams flowing from the west began to deposit sediments in this area. Most of the sediment was wind-blown volcanic ash which had settled into the watershed which fed the streams. Occasionally the rivers brought gravel and stream-worn rocks from the Black Hills themselves. The ash weathered into clay, and turned into rock. Erosion did not begin to gully the Badlands layers and foretell the present landscape until quite recently, perhaps only half a million years ago. (A black and white photo of expansive badlands formations extending into the horizon, with several parenthetical markers showing the locations of Sage Creek Wilderness Area, Harney Peak, Mt. Rushmore, Rapid City, and the Black Hills).",

The North American <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/prairie-ecology-badl.htm\">prairie ecosystem</a> is separated into three major components, based on which type of grass dominates the ecology: short-grass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, and tall-grass prairie. The short-grass prairie runs along the rain shadow of the Rocky Mountains, where short grasses receive little moisture. The tall-grass prairie ecosystem Badlands hosts the largest preserved mixed-grass prairie in the United States.  Today, the native prairie only retains about 2% of its original range. Invasive plants further threaten what little is left, pushing out native plants virtually unchallenged. Badlands National Park does what it can to manage these invaders with various tactics, including prescribed fires and spraying herbicides.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "On the northside of a two-lane, two-way, east-west paved highway, a small parking lot accommodating less than a dozen vehicles is nestled within a vast prairie landscape stretching into all directions. A meandering boardwalk extends into the prairie, ending in a hexagonal platform with a bench in the middle. Three wayside exhibits provide information about prairie ecology and the significance of fire to the health of an ecosystem. They are described in order: The first exhibit reads, The Geography of Hope: Here you stand between wilderness and civilization. In the distance before you lie Interstate 90 and a neighboring ranch. Behind you, beyond the Loop Road, Badlands Wilderness stretches out across 64,000 acres. The prairie around you was once part of a vast ocean of grass covering more than half of the continent. Today, less than two percent of North America's native prairie remains. The 1976 Congress designated 64,000 acres of Badlands as wilderness, making this wilderness a part of what author and environmentalist Wallace Stegner (1913 – 1993) characterized as the \"geography of hope.\" (Miles of layered, jagged badlands formations extending into a horizon.) Second exhibit reads, Alien Attack: The field before you is under attack. Waging an aggressive campaign of propagation, such non-native plants as yellow sweet clover and Canada thistle squeeze out native plants. The resulting loss of plant diversity makes the prairie more susceptible to natural disasters and less hardy overall. To combat this invasion, park staff employ the triple threat of bio-control, chemical retardants, and native plant restoration. (Background image shows a field of purple flowers with the text \"Planted by early settlers to beautify the prairie, yellow sweet clover and Canada thistle (below) threaten to overtake native prairie plants. Two other photos, a human hand holding a container with small white slivers and a black and white photo with a man and horse holding various large containers, are accompanied by the text: \"Park staff release bio-control insects that target non-native plants for reproduction and food. Over time, these insects kill off their host plants. The insects then die off as their food source disappears. Motorized vehicles are not permitted on these delicate lands. Pack horses provide the muscle to carry heavy chemical retardant equipment needed for the fight against non-native plants.\") The third exhibits reads, Cleansed by Fire: Fire routinely sweeps across the prairie. Though a terrifying spectacle, fire can help rejuvenate the prairie. Native grasses survive prairie fires, but non-native grass species such as smooth brome do not. Native grasses grow quickly, their roots holding the rich soil, keeping it from blowing away in steady prairie winds. Early settlers feared wildfires and sought to supress them. Today park staff plan prairie burnings to help eliminate non-native grasses and stimulate the growth of native species. In a few days after a prairie fire, green shoots of native grasses spring from the rich soil. Then wildlife quickly returns to feed on the tender plants. (Prairie fire with half grass and half ashen earth, and small inset image shows green grasses with the text: \"non-native smooth brome grass is eliminated through the use of prescribed burning in the park.\"",

Afterwards, they decided to explore the area, and Mr. Carney found some bones exposed just off the edge of the road. He took a photo of his find and reported the discovery to park staff.

    "audioDescription": "Two wayside exhibits and a lone game trail meanders through badlands buttes and prairie grasses. It lies on the eastside of a busy paved, two-lane north-south highway, with the badlands wall to the north and expansive prairies to the south. The two wayside exhibits are described below: The first one reads, \"Stuck in the Mud: Thirty-three million years ago, this area was an oasis during a drought. It attracted animals looking for water, food, and shelter. Some animals became stuck in the mud and died. Their carcasses were trampled, crushed, and buried. This cycle repeated until the watering hole dried out. After millions of years, erosion and the work of paleontologists exposed these buried remains. (a color, stylized illustration shows a variety of animals – rodents, felines, large mammals, birds – in a watering hole amid prairie grasses and forests in the distance. The animals are labeled by their names: \"Mesohippus, three-toed horse,\" \"Aves, bird,\" \"archaeotherium, pig dig namesake,\" nimravid, cat-like predator,\" \"subhyracodon, extinct rhinoceros,\" \"ishyromys, squirrel-like rodent,\" \"daphoenus, commonly known as a 'bear dog.'\").\" The second one reads, \"The Pig Dig: This site name, Pig Dig, comes from the discovery of what was thought to be an ancient pig-like creature, Archaeotherium. The large number of bones found in this one small area makes this a significant site nationally and internationally. For 15 years, paleontologists from Badlands National Park and the Museum of Geology at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology uncovered nearly 20,000 bones. Excavations revealed clues about a 33 million-year-old watering hole used by animals during a drought. This was not a common discovery. Typical fossil finds reveal isolated bones or skeletons. Fieldwork ended in 2008 and the site was reburied, but research continues. Discovery! Two visitors discovered this site in 1993. They did the right thing and reported it to park staff. Please follow their lead. If you find a fossil, look, but please don't touch. Note the location and take a photography and a GPS reading if possible. Then fill out a Visitor Site Report, available at the Ben Reifel Visitor Center and all park entrance stations. (A background image of a woman using a small brush on rocks. two smaller inset photos show, respectively, a map showing the location of the exhibit relative to the surrounding area, and a person in a room full of boxes. Additional text reads \"Scientists uncovered and mapped the Pig Dig fossils, then prepared them for transit by encasing each in a cast-like 'jacket' of burlap and plaster. For each hour of work at the site, ten hours were spent in the lab.\").\"",

The site was monitored by park paleontologists for the next several weeks. After a few rainfalls, more of the fossil was exposed, revealing the tips of saber teeth.

About 500,000 years ago, ancient rivers began eroding this area, leading to the present day landscape. Modern rivers, rain, and wind continue to sculpt the land by washing away soft rock at a rate of about one inch a year. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Differences in the composition of each layer reveal what the climate was like when the sediments were deposited. The oldest layers, not visible from here, represent a marine environment. The top layers are the most recent, representing a cool, dry savannah.

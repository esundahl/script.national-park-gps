    "bodyText": "In 1670, King Charles II granted a Royal Charter to “the Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson Bay” a corporation that would eventually come to be known as the Hudson’s Bay Company. The Hudson’s Bay Company, whose headquarters by the time of The Pig War was this building in London, shipped European trade goods and technology to North America, where they were sold to Native Americans for animal fur which was then resold in Europe and Asia, hence their corporate motto “Pro Pelle Cutem” which in latin means “A pelt for a skin”. Unlike the corporations we are familiar with today, the Hudson’s Bay Company fused governmental power, military capabilities, and diplomatic functions with its quest for profit. It operated throughout Canada and was especially powerful in the Pacific Northwest, where the Hudson’s Bay Company was the most potent non-native force in the region in the early days of European colonization.<br /> <br /> The Hudson’s Bay Company’s global trading business and the strategies that made it successful relied upon a diverse workforce. Acquiring fur required Native American participation and the company hired Native American employees and carefully stocked trade goods that catered to Native American consumer preferences. Company operatives often married high ranking Native American women and their alliances helped encourage trade and cooperation; children of these cross-cultural marriages often worked for the Hudson’s Bay Company, where they acted as cultural mediators who understood the needs of indigenous people and the company’s commercial empire. In the Pacific Northwest, the company found itself short on labor and hired Hawaiian men as laborers, farmers, seafarers, and fur trade adventurers.<br /> <br /> The Hudson’s Bay Company built a string of trading posts throughout the Pacific Northwest in the 1820s-1850s at a time when the United States and the British Empire both claimed the Oregon Country (the future states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Wyoming and Montana). These posts became centers for settlement, economic development, and imperial power at a time when few U.S. citizens inhabited the Oregon Country. It was only in the 1840s, as masses of U.S. emigrants used the Oregon Trail to settle in the Pacific Northwest that the Hudson’s Bay Company and British imperial power were contested. When the Oregon Treaty of 1846 gave the states of Washington and Oregon to the United States, the Hudson’s Bay Company was forced to wind down operations at its bases in Washington and Oregon, which included at one time parts of the future <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fova\">Fort Vancouver National Historic Site</a> <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/whmi\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/lewi\">Lewis and Clark National Historical Park</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/nepe\">Nez Perce National Historical Park</a><br /> <br /> Still, the Hudson’s Bay Company remained powerful within British territory; one way that they demonstrated this power was by founding a massive operation on San Juan Island. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/belle-vue-sheep-farm.htm\">Belle Vue Sheep Farm</a>, established in 1853, grew into a massive agricultural complex with over 4,000 sheep and more than a dozen Hawaiian and native employees. It was a Hudson’s Bay Company pig that rooted through Lyman Cutlar’s potato patch on June 15, 1859, sparking the Pig War. During the joint occupation of San Juan Island, American Camp was established adjacent to Belle Vue Sheep Farm headquarters and the farm wound down operations on our island.<br /> <br /> Though the Hudson’s Bay Company is no longer on our island, it remains a major corporation. No longer in the fur trade, it is now one of Canada’s largest department stores. It’s unique contribution to our region’s history and to global history is crucial to understanding how San Juan Island developed.",

    "bodyText": "The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/hudson-s-bay-company.htm\">Hudson’s Bay Company</a>'s (HBC) established their Honolulu agency offices in 1829. Hawaiians had been working in the Pacific Northwest since 1787 and over time became an increasingly pivotal part of the fur trading workforce. At this office, the HBC recruited Hawaiian workers, sold British goods and Pacific Northwest agricultural products, and resupplied its ships headed from Hawaii to China and American whaling ships which regularly stopped in Honolulu. By the mid 19<sup>th</sup> Century, the Honolulu Agency was a vital part of a global trading empire that encompassed London, North America, and Asia.<br /> <br /> Hawaiians’ importance to the HBC can be seen in the writings of Chief Factor John McLoughlin who in 1830 asked the Honolulu agency to “Sen[d] us as many of them [Hawaiians[ as possible.” These workers filled numerous vital positions for the HBC; many worked on its ships as sailors. Others, like the sixteen Hawaiians who landed on San Juan Island in 1853, were agricultural workers who grew crops and herded sheep. Still others served as construction workers whose labor helped establish fur trade outposts or as teamsters, carrying goods hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles to trade with Native Americans in the extensive network of fur trade forts that the HBC operated throughout the Pacific Northwest. It is estimated that by the mid-1800s, approximately 1/3 of the HBC’s Pacific Northwest labor force were Hawaiians.<br /> <br /> Hawaiians were hired on time-limited contracts that specified their pay and term of service. In 1844, a Honolulu newspaper claimed that “they are generally engaged for a period of three years and gain $10 per month.” Though little documentation exists, it is likely that many of these migrant workers sent wages home to their families in Hawaii. Many Hawaiians regularly renewed their labor contracts and worked for decades in the Pacific Northwest either with the HBC or as independent settlers who homesteaded after leaving HBC employment. Hawaiian migrants also worked at other National Park Service sites that were once HBC establishments, such as <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/lewi\">Lewis and Clark National Historical Park</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/fova\">Fort Vancouver National Historical Site</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/whmi\">Whitman Mission National Historic Site</a>. On San Juan Island place names like Kanaka Bay and Friday Harbor (named after a Hawaiian man who settled there whose English name was Peter Friday) and Eastern Oregon place names like Kanaka Creek, Kanaka Bar, Kanaka Glen, and the Owyhee River demonstrate the longstanding impact of Hawaiians in the Pacific Northwest.",

Marcus Whitman proposed that it instead be built at the Weyíiletpuu mission for two reasons: first, Marcus was a doctor and not a reverend, and he argued that placing the blacksmith shop at his mission would free up the reverends at the other mission stations to focus on their specialty as men of the ministry; second, Dr. Whitman could better serve the ever growing numbers of immigrants flooding into the Columbia Plateau from the United States if he had a blacksmith shop.<br /> <br /> When the measles epidemic hit weyíiletpe, crowding at the mission surely did not help any attempts to contain the spread. As winter approached, the Whitmans allowed many immigrants to take shelter at the mission for the season before moving on in the spring. That winter, about 75 people were living at the mission station including eight people staying in this small blacksmith’s shop.</p>",

He was continually unhappy with being a laborer for the mission and instead wanted a mission station of his own. Year after year, at the annual mission meetings, Gray requested his own station and year after year he was denied.

Many weyíiletpuu families planted small fields of crops and used the grist mill, but agriculture did not fully replace the traditional Seasonal Round as the Whitmans had hoped.</p> <p>In 1842, the gristmill was accidentally burned down by the son of Tamsucky, a Cayuse leader. Around 1844, the gristmill was rebuilt, and the millrace was expanded into the millpond, further changing the natural landscape.</p> <p>Today, you can see the trench where the gristmill stood from the walking trail, just to the right of the replicated mill pond. The pond is fed by water from a nearby creek similar to how it was fed during the mission years.</p>",

They arrived here that fall after a long journey overland.</p> <p>With winter fast approaching, Marcus enlisted help and began building a house. Unlike missionary practice at the time, the Whitmans were unwilling to live in the style of their weyíiletpuu hosts. Most weyíiletpuu families at that time lived in large lodges or smaller tipis. Because tamaalwit shaped where weyíiletpuu families lived throughout the seasons, these homes were mobile and allowed them the freedom to travel. The permanent and immobile adobe structure built by the Whitmans was in sharp contrast to the local lifestyle.</p> <p>The First House would not be the last house. The home was built very close to a channel of the Walla Walla River. Though the channel was already beginning to dry up at that time, flooding became an issue and the Whitmans quickly began planning a second, larger house. Today, you can still see the slope of the old river channel to the left of the First House foundations. To the right are apple trees similar to what the Whitmans had planted here.</p>",

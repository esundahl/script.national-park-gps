The water is surrounded on both sides by cliffs, rocks, and rock spires. Walk over the cement and stone dam to your left to sit on some rocks for lunch. The reservoir is dark in color but on a sunny day, the reflection of the rocks can be seen in the water. Snakes, frogs, birds, and countless insects call this reservoir home.",

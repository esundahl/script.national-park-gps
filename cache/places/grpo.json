Living history interpreters demonstrate seasonal crafts and several types of birchbark homes. These may include building a bark canoe and bark basketry, processing wild rice, boiling maple syrup, tanning hides, finger-weaving, drying, cooking and smoking fish, and growing <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/historic-gardens-at-grand-portage.htm\">heirloom vegetables</a> in the Three Sisters garden.</p> <h3><b>Familiar Location</b></h3> <p>Fur traders constructed their posts near Native villages for survival and convenience. By the 1760s, a summer rendezvous was already a well-established tradition on Grand Portage Bay. As well as trade, activities included socializing, marriage, ceremonies, dancing, and music. Perhaps 1,000 or more Native peoples (Anishinaabeg Ojibwe, Cree, and Assiniboine) gathered or visited the Bay during the summer.</p> <h4>Long Habitation</h4> <p>Archeological investigations during the early 1960s revealed Native habitation in the Grand Portage Bay area at least 2,000 years ago. Lithics or stone artifacts such as notched projectile points, two small end scrapers, an oval blade knife, chert and small flakes of native copper were discovered in two areas close to Grand Portage Bay. The artifacts were located just above a post-glacial lake beach pre-dating Lake Superior. Point styles and beach dates connect the sites to the late Archaic and early Woodland periods 4,000-2,100 years ago (ca. 2,000 B.C.-100 A.D.).</p>",

It was built on a poor site which necessitated the use of pilings to level the foundation. Archeologists speculate that it belonged to an independent trader because adequate space still existed for additional NWCo. warehouses inside the stockade. It may have housed trade goods and supplies destined for Athabasca country in the far Northwest. These goods, packed in 90-pound bales, were carried from here to canoes waiting at Fort Charlotte, 8½ miles distant at the far end of the Grand Portage. From there they headed west through today’s Boundary Waters and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/voya/index.htm\">Voyageurs National Park</a>, and beyond to the fur country of the far west, the famed <i>Pays d'en Haut</i>, where the company’s fur posts awaited new supplies.</p> <h3>Historical Building Trades and Canoes</h3> <p>Today you can watch interpreters inside demonstrate woodworking, coopering, lathe work, basketry, carving, and canoe works. The warehouse also houses a collection of bark canoes to protect them from damaging sunlight. Two of them – a 38-foot Montreal Canoe (<em>canot du maître</em>) and a 26-foot North canoe (<em>canot du Nord</em>), both constructed by Bill Hafeman – hang from the rafters. These are the two main types of canoes in the trade that came from the East (Montreal) and went to the West (interior of the continent). Another, a ricing canoe donated by a local family, is over 80 years old.<br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/canoes-of-grand-portage.htm\">The role of canoes during the Fur Trade.</a></p>",

When a day's business finished, tables were pushed aside for dancing and socializing to make up for long winters of isolation.</p> <h3><strong>Today's Great Hall</strong></h3> <p>The four partners' bedrooms are set up as exhibit spaces to further explain the story.

After delineating the stockade the previous summer, Brown discovered foundations inside the stockade constructed from fine-grained sandstone. Measuring 95 by 30 feet, the foundation is the largest inside the stockade.

Another picnic style table is set at one end with Blue Willow ware for the Clerks and at the other end with pewter plates and spoons for the interpreters and guides. At both ends of the room are fireplaces made of local stone. The four corner rooms hold exhibits. Clockwise from the north door: an exhibit about making a beaver hat, a gentleman's bedroom, an exhibit about a London Street showing products made from fur, and a typical trade post. In the north corner of the building hand hats and blanket coats (capotes) to dress up in period clothing for photos.",

To celebrate this reunion, a professional chef and baker joined the numbers who traveled here in the summer months from Montreal. He would employ local Native women to prepare elaborate five course meals that included soups, stews, fancy roasts and fish, scones and shortbread, and even fresh roasted coffee. Livestock such as cows, pigs, and chickens came aboard ships to create European-style fare. The menu also featured specialty dishes like haggis, blood pudding, and syllabub (a frothy cream and wine dessert popular at the time).</p> <p>Look around to see kitchenware of the time, watch staff prepare food on the hearth or bake bread in an outdoor bread oven. While you’re there, learn what the voyageurs ate on their journey and see what Native goods made it on the menu.</p> <h3><strong>Evidence of Use</strong></h3> <p>Archeological excavations of the kitchen area during 1970-71, yielded almost 14,500 artifacts. The remains of a fireplace were also discovered and behind it a small stone-lined dry well or cooler with its wooden floor still in place. The fireplace and cooler were exactly centered on the mess house. This strongly implied the kitchen and mess house were associated with each other.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Next to the parking lot there is a gravel pathway between picnic tables that leads to a staircase where the Mount Rose trail begins. Two interpretive signs tell about the area. The first is titled: Bears! Moose? Red Squirrels. What Else Lives Here? and reads: What animals live in the forest and along its rivers and lakeshores? Were they here 200 years ago? A changing environment and the presence of people affect the lives of all creatures. During the fur trade era, many animals disappeared due to over-hunting. Today, the forests about with deer, wolves, and small animals such as squirrels and grouse, but moose are rarely seen. Caribou once roamed here but moved north, while cardinals are recent are recent arrivals. Coyotes are new too, eking out a living between wolves and foxes. Why is it a bad idea to feed wild animals? Feeding animals what we eat can make them dependent, less able to survive on their own, and more likely to stalk or attack people. The other, titled Boreal Forest, reads: Can you see the difference between evergreen and broadleaf trees in the background photograph? Two major forest types overlap at Grand Portage: the boreal forest, which covers the entire globe at northern latitudes, and the eastern broadleaf forest, where maples, white pines, and cedar are common. For centuries, the Ojibwe and other native peoples depended on forest resources for canoes, shelter, and food. During the fur trade era, Europeans relied on Native know-how to range far into the boreal forests to trade for beaver hides. Later, settlers saw value in the forest's timber, cutting vast swaths. Due to human and natural forces, today's forests have greatly changed from the forests of 1800.",

Bonjour! </em>Welcome to the Depot! </p> <p>The North West Company built the Depot in this strategic location at the beginning of <em>Gichi Onigamiing</em> (the Great Carrying Place), <em>le <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/trailhead-for-gichi-onigaming-the-grand-portage.htm\">Grand Portage</a></em>. In the days of the fur trade, a great variety of people passed through these gates to do business with the North West Company. Inside, the Great Hall was the site of the company’s annual shareholder meeting. Men of wealth from Montreal and Scotland conferred with men of action – partners who spent the winter on the frontier and negotiated trade for beaver and other pelts destined for European markets. The partners also met with leaders from nearby Anishinaabe (Ojibwe), Cree, and Assiniboine villages to formalize trading relationships. Within the Depot walls, there were also a company store, tradesman shops, and storehouses for trade goods, furs, and supplies for the summer. The company’s partners, as well as clerks and canoe guides, all lived here during their stay. Come inside the palisade and travel back to the time when Grand Portage was the center of the fur trade world! </p> <h3>The Function of the Gatehouse</h3> <p>Ascend the stairs to the Gatehouse lookout tower. Look east for Montreal canoes rounding Hat Point laden with trade goods. The view to the west watches over the Grand Portage trail. Keep a close eye on cook fires outside the palisade!</p> <p> </p>",

    "bodyText": "<strong>Description of Wayside:</strong> Low-profile wayside that is 42 x 24 inches. It has a brown rectangular base with two short rectangular pillars anchored into a stone wall supporting the wayside panel. The panel is framed in brown metal. The wayside is located at the far northern end of the North Overlook Trail overlooking the North Platte River.<br /> <br /> <strong>Wayside Layout</strong>: At the top of the wayside is a thin black banner with white text. Aligned to the left is \"Scotts Bluff National Monument\". Aligned to the right is the text \"National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior,\" and finally the National Park Service arrowhead. The title of the wayside is below the black banner in large black font. The panel has a light blue background. Black text is arranged in three columns on the upper half of the wayside. Below the text are three images. <br /> <br /> <strong>Wayside Title</strong>: Two Sides of the River<br /> <br /> <strong>Text:</strong> The Platte River served as a buffer between people.<br /> <br /> Emigrants followed the Platte River for up to 650 miles (1,046 km) depending on where they first joined it. Many traveled on the south side while others stayed on the north side. What determined their decision? Usually it was a matter of where they started along the Missouri River. If they began their journey south of Council Bluffs, they stayed on the south side of the river. For those who embarked from Council Bluffs, as did most Mormons, the north side was their route. Traveling on the north side of the river also reduced the amount of harassment from non-Mormon “Gentiles.”<br /> <br /> Council Bluffs Road, the early name for the trail, served most of the Mormon emigrants as the path to Zion. To escape persecution in the States, Brigham Young, the leader of the church, decided that the valley of the Salt Lake in Utah Territory was far enough from other settlements to be safe. Handcart companies were formed to accommodate European converts with little money to cross the continent. For each group of approximately 20 handcarts, one covered wagon carried extra supplies and tents. The wagons also served as traveling commissaries, transporting food for the emigrants’ meals. Of the 70,000 Mormons who crossed the country to Utah, ten handcart companies brought almost 3,000 emigrants to Utah from 1856 through 1860.<br /> <br /> Each side of the river had its challenges. Since the forts were built on the more-heavily traveled south side of the Platte River, people on the north side had to make dangerous river crossings to visit the forts. Larger numbers on the south side meant poorer sanitation, more disease, and more competition for grazing and campfire fuel.<br /> <br /> What determines your route when you travel?<br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> A watercolor painting of a large group of emigrants crossing a river. Some of the emigrants push handcarts, while others walk beside covered wagons being pulled by oxen.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> This watercolor shows the mix of handcarts and covered wagons that made up a typical handcart company. Credit: “Mormon Party near Fort Bridger” by William Henry Jackson; Scotts Bluff National Monument Collection<br /> <br /> <strong>Image:</strong> Two women push a handcart with a small cover protecting its contents. <br /> <br /> <strong>Image Caption:</strong> A handcart was pushed rather than pulled, since the crossbar was pushed against.

    "audioDescription": "Ash Hollow State Historical Park. 322 words<br /><br />The parking lot for the visitor center at the Ash Hollow State Historical Park sits on top of a hill. From here you can look out over the surrounding rolling terrain. The countryside is covered primarily with low vegetation - grasses and meadow plants. Dark green conifers are scattered across the landscape with an occasional grove of deciduous trees.<br /><br />A median sits in the middle of the parking lot with a Nebraska Historical Marker. The sign reads, \"Ash Hollow was famous on the Oregon Trail. A branch of the trail ran northwestward from the Lower California Crossing of the South Platte River a few miles west of Brule and descended here into the North Platte Valley. The hollow, named for a growth of ash trees, was entered by Windlass Hill to the south. Wagons had to eased down its steep slope by ropes.<br /><br />\"Ash Hollow with its water, wood and grass was a welcome relief after the arduous trip from the South Platte and the travelers usually stopped for a period of rest and refitting. An abandoned trappers cabin served as an unofficial post office where letters were deposited to be carried to the â€˜States' by eastbound travelers. The graves of Rachel Pattison and other emigrants are in the nearby cemetery.<br /><br />\"In 1855 a significant fight, commonly called the Battle of Ash Hollow, occurred at Blue Water Creek northwest of here. General Harney's forces sent out to chastise the Indians after the Grattan Massacre of 1854 here attacked Little Thunder's band of Brule Sioux while the Indians were attempting to parley, killed a large number and captured the rest of the band.\"<br /><br />The visitor center is a one-story building set lower than the level of the parking lot. The sidewalk slopes down to the door. The building has vertical, beige-colored siding with tan accents. Restrooms are located along the outside wall to the right of the entrance.",

    "audioDescription": "Ash Hollow State Park- Windlass Hill Area. 400 words<br /><br />Where the entrance road to Windlass Hill turns off the highway is a turnout with access to a reconstructed sod house. From the road, a pass through the fence leads across a small pasture and through a gate shaped like a wheel to the house itself. The house, although open to visitors, is deteriorating and there is loose debris on the floor. To the left of the house is a Nebraska Historical Marker in the middle of a group of large, roughly shaped stones. The sign tells us that the stones are the remains of the homestead dwelling of Reverend Dennis B. Clary. Using a horse-drawn cart, he hauled stone to this site for a two-room house. For years, it marked the location of Windlass Hill. The area around the house was used by early travelers to repair damages caused by the hazardous trip down Windlass Hill.<br /><br />From the parking lot a sidewalk leads around to the left along the base of the hill through tall bushy junipers. Standing where it curves to the left, several rutted trails can easily be seen coming down the hill to the west. From that point, just behind you another sidewalk leads to a stylized wagon made of two parallel stone walls topped with metal arches. There may be a lip at the top of the concrete ramp leading up into the structure. On one side are two large information signs. The one on the left is titled \"Rough Going.\" It tells us that many stories are built around the idea that wagons were let down this hill using a windlass or, perhaps, a snubbing post. No historical or archeological evidence has been found for the use of such a device. At the lower left corner of this sign is a model of a rough-lock wagon brake. Feel free to touch. By hooking this through the spokes, it slowed the wagon by making the wheels drag on the ground.<br /><br />The other sign is called \"Wagons in the West.\" It has line drawings of several wagon styles. The Conestoga was a heavy freight wagon, not much used on the Oregon Trail. Another style was the six-mule Army wagon. Another drawing shows a smaller covered wagon pulled by a team of 6 oxen commonly used by the emigrants. The wagons all have similar shapes.",

    "audioDescription": "Bedlam Ruts. 363 words<br /><br />From the parking lot, a path leads up a slight slope through scrubby pastureland. The path is fairly smooth, although it is dirt with fine gravel mixed in. Along with mixed grasses and yucca plants, there are tiny prickly pear cacti with flat, rounded pads covered with spines. The path ends at the top of the rise where a small fenced enclosure protects a small sign. Large logs on either side of the path here serve as benches. On the far side of the fenced enclosure, a swale crosses from right to left, about 10 feet wide and perhaps 3 feet deep. Feel free to move past the fence on the left side and into the swale.<br /><br />The sign is titled, \"The Journey West Continues.\" Text reads, \"'We proceeded westward from Fort Laramie and encamped outside the boundaries of Uncle Sam.' So wrote Dr. J.S. Shepard in 1851 as he began the second leg of his journey west. â€˜To leave Fort Laramie was to cast off all ties with civilization. It was an alien land,' he noted.<br /><br />\"The emigrants' elation at reaching the civilization of the fort after 650 miles of monotonous, difficult overland travel was soon tempered by the realization that even more troublesome trail conditions lay ahead over the final two-thirds of the journey. â€˜Here comes the ascent to the Rocky Mountains,' wrote an apprehensive Cornelius Conway at mid-century.<br /><br />\"To lighten their loads many travelers cast off thousands of dollars worth of food and equipment. This was especially true of the â€˜49ers' who, in their haste to reach the gold fields often invested little effort in planning their trip. Joseph Berrien reached Fort Laramie early, May 30, 1849, yet still referred to it as â€˜Camp Sacrifice' because of the large quantities of abandoned gear and foodstuffs he saw nearby.<br /><br />\"Between 1849 and 1854 an annual average of some 31,000 overlanders passed through or near the fort on their journey to Oregon, California, or Utah. Most passed on a trail marked by the ruts before you. Wagon travel near the Platte River, just to the north, was difficult due to seasonal high water and progressively more difficult terrain.\"",

The emigrants visited the village, which required fording the Des Moines River. The wrote about Bonaparte in their journals, taking note of the \"splendid Mill,\" a hotel, and several other buildings. Unfortunately, in 1886 a devastating fire along the north side of First Street burned down many of the Bonaparte's original buildings. Afterwards, the village rebuilt many of these buildings. But there are still a few \"survivor\" buildings. One is the the Farmers & Traders Bank building. Located on the south side of Main Street, it was far enough away from First Street to survive the fire. Constructed in the late 1840s, this building was standing when the Mormon pioneers visited the village. Several of the 1886 rebuilt buildings still remain as well.

    "audioDescription": "You are in the tiny, rural village of Bonaparte, Iowa, next to its paved main road and just past the buildings at the village's center. Many of these ornate, red brick and white trim buildings are 150 years old or older. They are part of the Bonaparte Historic Riverfront District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Riverfront District also includes Riverfront Park, the location of the wayside. This small city park is along the banks of the Des Moines River, a major river that is between 650 and 700 feet wide as it flows past Bonaparte. The park consists of grass lawns, remnants of a riparian forest, and human development including concrete paths and a gravel parking lot. The park, and the village, is located at the base of a small bluff created by the river's movement. This constrains the view to the river corridor. Riparian forest lines the corridor on both of the river's banks and both upstream and downstream of the park. On the opposite bank, the forest extends all the way to the top of the bluff. Sounds are primarily natural and come from the river, birds, and insects. Secondary sounds of human activities, including traffic, are also sometimes heard. They wayside is just a very short walk on a dirt away from the parking lot. The wayside is comprised of a panel made from a high pressure laminate material that contains printed text and colored images. The panel is inside a metal frame and has a metal base with a low profile form that does not block the view. The view looking out from the front of the wayside is primarily of forest in the distance, the river in the mid-ground, and the backs of the historic buildings in the foreground. Also in this view is a concrete bridge with a paved road that stretches across the river. This is what you used to enter the village of Bonaparte. In 1846, the Mormon Pioneers were not so lucky. They had to ford the Des Moines River in order to visit the village.",

The hollow bristled with brush and its boulder-choked bottom was too narrow for wagons to pass. The Donner-Reed wagon party grubbed a dangerous sideling trail along the sloping bank before dropping, exhausted, into their first camp beyond the Weber River. Mormon pioneers improved the rough track, but despite their efforts, many wagons over the years tumbled sideways off the trail. Dixie Hollow narrows and becomes impassable to wagons.<br /> <br /> Broad Hollow, which drains into Dixie Hollow near the Donner-Reed campsite of August 11, provided a detour around the Dixie Hollow chokepoint.

    "bodyText": "<p>Burnt Ranch, known historically as South Pass Station and Last or Ninth Crossing of the Sweetwater River, is located at the center of the South Pass landscape of Wyoming on the shared corridor of the Oregon, California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express National Historic Trails. The Lander Cutoff, a government wagon road explored and developed in 1857-1860 by topographical engineer Frederick W. Lander, diverged from the primary route of the California Trail at present-day Burnt Ranch, following older paths used by American Indians and trappers of the fur trade. Western historian Will Bagley estimates that more than 100,000 overland emigrants crossed this region by way of the Lander Cutoff. The graves of two known overland emigrants (Joseph Barnett, d. 1844, and Charles H. Miller, d. 1859) and as many as six unidentified burials of the trails era are located on the ranch. Many more emigrant graves are believed to exist at and around the site.<br /> <br /> During the 1800s, this location was the site of extensive Shoshone Indian villages; trading post, stagecoach, mail, and telegraph operations; a military outpost; emigrant and military encampments; and armed conflicts between the US Army and the Sioux and Cheyenne. In fact, Burnt Ranch takes its name from the burning of a stage station at Ninth Crossing during the Utah War in 1857, and by Sioux warriors in 1866 and 1868. It has been the headquarters of cattle ranching operations since the 1880s and remains so today.<br /> <br /> Trail remnants and historical remains of the developments and activities at Burnt Ranch have been determined to be nationally significant and eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Located approximately 8 miles SE South Pass City, Wyoming)<br /> <strong>Available Facilities</strong><br /> No cell service.  Poor roads.  Prior Planning with an organized group is a must.<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "audioDescription": "California Hill. 304 words<br /><br />Along the side of the road is a Nebraska Historical Marker metal sign. It reads, \"California Hill. The large hill to the north, which became known as 'California Hill,' was climbed by thousands of covered wagon emigrants heading west between 1841 and 1860. Many were bound for Oregon. California became the destination of a majority of travelers after gold was discovered there in 1848.<br /><br />\"The most important crossing of the South Platte River during this period was south and a little east of here. After fording the river and ascending California Hill, the emigrants traveled northwesterly to the North Platte River via Ash Hollow. The terrain restricted the route wagons could take up the hill, causing deep ruts still visible about two-thirds of a mile north-northwest of this marker.<br /><br />\"Before 1867 as many as half a million emigrants passed through what became Keith County. The natural migration corridor from Fort Kearny to Fort Laramie became known as 'The Great Platte River Road.' California Hill was donated to the Oregon-California Trails Association by Malcolm E. Smith, Jr., in memory of trail historian Irene D. Paden, and by the association to the Nebraska State Historical Society.\"<br /><br />Just past the marker a narrow dirt road leads to the right up a hill, pastures spreading on the rolling hills as far as the eye can see. The road is marked as \"Minimum Maintenance\" and may be too rough for most cars. Hiking up the road, it is possible to see gentle troughs leading up along the right side. Up near the top of the hill, a fence walk-through on the left side with attached logos for the Oregon Trail and the California Trail leads into the pasture. Please note, livestock and equipment may be present. Swales in the pasture are very difficult to discern.",

I had some curiosity to see this . . . Imagine a pyramid standing alone though surrounded by rocky precipices some 150 feet high & at its base 20 feet through . . . No conception can be formed of the magnitude of this grand work of nature until you stand at its base & look up. If a man does not feel like an insect then I don't know when he should.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (1.5 miles south of Highway 92 on Chimney Rock Road near Bayard, Nebraska)</p> <p>The Nebraska State Historical Society now manages Chimney Rock as part of a historic site. Viewing the rock is available from several places, including from the site's visitor center. This center houses a museum with interpretive and interactive exhibits about this natural feature and the emigrant trails. It also contains a small theater with a video presentation about the great migration West and a bookstore. Modest admission is charged. </p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://history.nebraska.gov/rock\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/oreg/index.htm\">Oregon National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2>",
    "audioDescription": "Chimney Rock National Historic Site. 231 words<br /><br />The visitor center here consists of a long, central rectangular building with its peak in front and it long axis running away from you as you approach up the wide sidewalk. Two wings stair-step off the right side and a longer, flatter wing extends to the left. The entrance is reached by moving under an open wooden-truss supported by six sandstone pillars, three on each side. A small sign at the edge of the sidewalk warns of rattlesnakes in the area. Please stay on sidewalks.<br /><br />Entering through the double doors you will be in an open hallway that extends to the rear of the building where another set of doors exits to a patio with seating. The information desk is about halfway down the 40-foot hallway on your left. The gift shop may be found by turning to the left just before you reach the desk. An exhibit area is found on the right side of the hallway.<br /><br />Chimney Rock itself is behind on the far side of fenced pasture land where cattle may be grazing. Towering over the surrounding landscape, it may be easily seen both from the parking lot and from the patio behind the visitor center. The formation is shaped like a large cone, wide at its base, and topped with a narrow finger of rock projecting upwards like a steeple.",

    "audioDescription": "Courthouse and Jail Rocks. 273 words<br /><br />Although called \"rocks,\" these are two striking landmarks, visible at great distances. At the edge of the gravel pullout is a Nebraska Historical Marker that reads, \"Courthouse and Jail Rocks are two of the most famous landmarks of westward migration. Nearby passed the Oregon-California Trail, the Mormon Trail, the Pony Express Trail, and the Sidney-Deadwood Trail. The rocks were vanguards of unforgettable scenic wonders that travelers would encounter farther west, including Chimney Rock's curious spire and the rugged heights of Scott's Bluffs.<br /><br />\"Hundreds of overland emigrants mentioned Courthouse Rock in their diaries. Often called a 'castle' or 'solitary tower,' the name Courthouse was first used in 1837. One 1845 traveler described the rock as â€˜resembling the ruins of an old castle [which] rises abruptly from the plain... It is difficult to look upon it and not believe that art had something to do with its construction. The voyagers have called it the Courthouse; but it looks infinitely more like the Capitol.'<br /><br />\"Courthouse and Jail Rocks, rising some 400 feet above the North Platte Valley, are erosional remnants composed of clay, sandstone, and volcanic ash. The rocks are listed in the National Register of Historic Places and in the Nebraska Natural Areas Register.\"<br /><br />Looking westward, past the sign, the two formations can be seen rising out of the surrounding pasture land. Courthouse Rock, on the right, is larger, looming over the prairie like a squat cylinder with a smaller circular layer sitting on top. Jail Rock, on the left, is the same height but only about one-third as wide. It is also cylindrical, but has more sloping sides.",

For the Mormon militia, this seemed a strategic location to stop or delay approaching federal troops. Defensive Breastworks (Echo Canyon) positioned along the rim of the cliff to the right are barely visible in several places from the canyon floor. Mormon militiamen, fearing an attack on Salt Lake City by the U.S. Army, built the low rubble walls above the emigrant road in 1857. The breastworks would protect the defenders as they fired down on approaching federal troops. Because they are made of local sandstone from the cliffs and were meant to be unobtrusive, the structures can be difficult to see.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Echo Canyon, Utah)</p> <p>Pull into a turnout on the right side of the road to view a large wooden sign that describes the Mormon defense preparations in Echo Canyon. Continue to the next turnout, 1/4 mile beyond, and pause at Summit County’s brown tour sign No. 7 for Billboard Bluff. From the turnout, look up at the base of the cliff face to see 19th century roadside advertisements painted directly onto the rock. (These are unassociated with the Utah War.)<br /> <br /> Travel 1/10 mile, watching for brown Summit County tour sign No. 6 on the left. From the tour-stop sign, face the cliff to the right of the road and look along the rim to see a low stone wall. Then turn and look east across the freeway to the bluffs on the opposite side of the canyon. Just below the alignment of telephone poles that crosses the slope, a faint horizontal line in the earth is sometimes visible, depending on the quality of the light and vegetation. The line is what remains of a defensive trench dug by the Mormon militia. Approaching federal troops were to be caught in crossfire from between the cliff-top breastworks and the entrenchment.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

On your right a granite ridge extends across the view. Near the right end a deep, broken-V-shaped notch can be seen, slightly wider than it is deep. The left side of the notch slants steeply toward the unseen river below. The right side of the notch descends vertically about halfway through the ridge, then slopes to the left. Text on a wayside sign tells us that the notch is called Devil's Gate, a 370-foot high, 1,500 feet-long fissure carved over the centuries by the Sweetwater River.<br /><br />To the right of the notch, the granite slopes down gradually to a pass where a small road winds its way.<br /><br />A half dozen wayside signs are spaced along the paved walkway. They cover topics such as the trails that passed this way, and local landmarks such as Martin's Cove, where Mormon emigrants sheltered from a winter storm, and Sun Ranch. One sign, titled \"A Tribute to Hardship,\" discusses the deaths along the trail, many caused by cholera. It mentions that up on this ridge, safe from the wagon trails below, are over 20 known American Indian and emigrant graves.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Donner HIll hammered yet another nail into the Donner-Reed coffin. For 12 days the emigrants had gnawed a track through the rugged Wasatch wilderness, and now, at the very edge of the Salt Lake Valley, limestone outcrops and dense willows blocked their exit from the mouth of Emigration Canyon. The discouraged travelers pulled to the left out of the creek bottom and up the 200-foot-high ridge that thereafter would bear their name. The effort nearly used up the strength of their oxen. The next year Brigham Young’s vanguard pioneer party, having more men for the labor, opened a road through the blockage, avoiding the hill climb, in just 4 hours’ time. The current roadbed approximates their route.<br /> <br /> Today, Emigration Canyon is widened and the top of Donner Hill has been leveled to make room for residential development. But the hill is still impressive and Emigration Creek, edged by willow and scrub oak, still runs along the south side of Emigration Canyon Road. Visitors can easily envision how this spot looked in 1846-47.<br /> <br /> The evening of their arrival on July 22, the Donner-Reed Party encamped a short distance beyond the hilltop with the broad Salt Lake Valley stretched at their feet. A grassy park along the ridge, adjacent to Crestview Drive, is named Donner Park in commemoration of that campsite. The next day the emigrants descended the ridge and traveled across the valley to the Jordan River. From there, the Donner Reed Party continued along the south shore of the Great Salt Lake.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (Emigration Canyon, near Rotary Glen Park)</p> <p>On the right at odometer mile 20 is another small sign for Donner Hill. A stone monument commemorating Donner Hill is on the left where the road curves to the south. At that location the hill is in front of you, easy to see, with a condominium at the top. Use caution when crossing the oncoming lane to enter or leave the widened road shoulder at the monument. Then continue down Emigration Canyon Road around the S-curve. If traffic permits, turn left at odometer mile 20.6 into an unmarked entrance for Rotary Glen Park. If you miss the entrance, turn left onto the next paved road, Crestview Drive, and turn around at a safe location to return to the intersection. Turn right and make an immediate right turn into Rotary Glen Park. Now go left across the parking lot and follow the dirt access road to the east. End at a gravel parking lot.<br /> <br /> Look across the small reservoir toward Donner Hill, the ridge to the northeast. The emigrants ascended the ridge on the north side of the condominiums. From this vantage, the steepness of the climb is evident. Take the opportunity here or at the picnic area to the west to explore Emigration Creek.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>For several years, emigrants on their way to California corralled their cattle and camped here during their stay in Salt Lake City. Later, the livestock pens were moved outside of the city. The 1894 City and County Building occupies the site today, and a monument commemorating the Mormon pioneers is located at the northwest corner of the square. (The monument is erroneous in stating that the vanguard Mormon pioneers camped at this location — the 1847 vanguard pioneer company camped on the banks of City Creek, southwest of what is now Exchange Place, the nights of July 23-25, 1847. The area is now occupied by buildings and the creek is channeled through an underground conduit.)<br /> <br /> As the Mormon pioneers approached the Salt Lake Valley, they split into four groups: a party of scouts at the front; a party of roadbuilders; the main camp of pioneers; and then Brigham Young, who was sick with Mountain Fever, with a caretaker, two days later. The scouts, roadbuilders, and main camp merged at the mouth of Emigration Canyon, where they had to break through the limestone ledge that had forced the Donner Party to crawl up out of the canyon. They entered the valley together the following day, July 22, and then moved to City Creek (downtown) on July 23. Brigham Young didn’t reach the valley until July 24.<br /> <br /> Curbside parking is available on the streets bordering Washington Square.<br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.25px; text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align);\">Site Information</span></p> <p><b>Location</b> (400 South Street and State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah).</p>   <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/mormon-pioneer-trail-salt-lake-city-itinerary.htm\">Mormon Pioneer Trail: Salt Lake City Itinerary</a></h2> <p>This site is on the Salt Lake City Itinerary.

It was also built of timber at an expense of $40,000 about a year ago by Louis Guenot. . . . It was impossible to touch the squaw's supper: the tin cans that contained the coffee were slippery with grease, and the bacon looked as if it had been dressed side-by-side with 'boyaux'.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br /> The Pony Express also established a station at this complex. Pony riders crossed the North Platte River on Guinard's Bridge, but the route stayed close to the north bank of the river until reaching Red Buttes Crossing, where another Pony Express station was located. In 1862, Lt. Col. William O. Collins sent one company of the 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry to protect the telegraph line at \"Guinard's Bridge.\" The soldiers moved into Guinard's station complex, and named the garrison \"Platte Bridge Station.\"<br /> <br /> The post was renamed in honor of Lieutenant Caspar Collins after his death in the Battle of Platte Bridge in 1865. The fort continued to protect emigrant trails and the transcontinental telegraph line until it closed in 1867. All salvageable materials were transferred and used to build Fort Fetterman.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (4001 Fort Caspar Rd, Casper, Wyoming)</p> <p>A 1936 reconstruction of the fort is furnished as it was in 1865.

    "audioDescription": "Fort Kearny State Historical Park. 402 words<br /><br />The park is an area of mowed lawns dotted with tall trees surrounded by flat crop land. A wide sidewalk leads from the parking lot to the visitor center, a low building with two wings extending back at a 30-degree angle on either side of the central lobby area. The walls are made of tan bricks with red-brown wood trim. Medium gray shingles cover the gently sloped roof. A short ramp with railings leads up to the front door.<br /><br />Restrooms are housed in a separate building to the right of the visitor center, at the end of the parking lot.<br /><br />As you enter the visitor center, the six-sided information desk lies directly in front of you, in the middle of the room. To the left is a small gift shop area with doorways that leading into exhibit areas in the adjoining room. Another door at the rear of the lobby, behind the information desk, leads out into the grounds.<br /><br />Behind the visitor center, the sidewalk passes a wagon with a canvas cover off to the right, then curves to the left and enters a reconstructed blacksmith and carpenter shop. The building is long and low, its walls made of rectangular blocks of grayish-tan sod. The roof is formed by wooden poles laid on crossbeams and covered with soil where grasses and other plants grow.<br /><br />Behind the blacksmith/carpenter shop the sidewalk leads to a grassy area where short cement posts mark the locations of buildings that have not been reconstructed. Faded wayside signs identify the various structures.<br /><br />To the left of the blacksmith/carpenter shop is a reconstructed fort surrounded by a palisade made of upright logs set in the ground topped with sharpened ends. Just to the rear and slightly to the left of the blacksmith/carpenter shop is another wagon, this one without any covering. A sidewalk to the left of the shop leads back towards the parking lot. Along this sidewalk is a tall metal sign which is a Nebraska Historical Marker. The sign outlines the history of Fort Kearny from the first post established in 1848, through its service as a waystation along the Oregon and California Trails and home station for the Pony Express, until it was discontinued as a military post in 1871, two years after the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. The site is on the National Register of Historic Places.",

On either side are some buildings that have been restored and others that exist only as foundations or ruins. Most of the structures are of concrete or adobe and tan in color with gray shingle roofs. Other buildings are wood frame and painted white.<br /><br />Along the sidewalk are a couple of wayside signs with information about the park and the surrounding area. About halfway to the visitor center is a tall stone monument with multiple plaques on its sides commemorating the Pony Express and Transcontinental Telegraph and identifying Fort Laramie as being on the National Register of Historic Places. On front a stone marker reads, \"Fort Laramie, a military post on the Oregon Trail, June 16, 1849 to March 2, 1890. This monument is erected by the state of Wyoming and a few interested residents, 1913.\"<br /><br />The walkway then crosses a dirt road and continues on over the lawn, crossing a shallow ditch over a short wooded bridge. A small sign in front of the visitor center building reads, \"Commissary Storehouse. This building was completed in 1884. It was built as a commissary storage facility. As such, it would have been primarily divided into two large storerooms: one for meat and one for flour, rice and beans. Three or four smaller rooms would have been used as offices, an â€˜issue room' and a storage room for canned goods. This building also had a partial cellar with a trap door for use with a hand-operated elevator. Rations and other official army food items were issued from this building. A commissary officer and sergeant ran the operation.\"<br /><br />The entrance is located about 30 feet from the right end of the building. The small wooden porch in front of the door may be reached by a set of 5 stairs on the right side or by a ramp that zig-zags up on the left side. At the right end of the building a small sign indicates that restrooms are located in the rear of the building.<br /><br />As you enter the building, the information desk is straight ahead of you against the opposite wall.

The area is rural with homes spread far apart. The landscape is covered by farms, fields, and deciduous forest. The view is primarily of rolling hills, and ravines. The parking lot is on the north side of the road. A short, improved dirt path takes you to the wayside. You are walking through a grass meadow at the top of a hill. Views stretch far and are of deciduous forest, meadows, farm fields and rolling hills. Sounds are natural- birds, insects, and leaves rustling in the wind. The wayside is comprised of a panel made from a high pressure laminate material that contains printed text and colored images. The panel is inside a metal frame and has a metal base with a low profile form that does not block the view. The view from the wayside is of an open, grass meadow with a few small deciduous trees in the foreground and a forest in the background. The grass meadow in the foreground contains mounds of raised grass in straight lines of approximately 10 to 20 feet. They connect and form rectangle and squares shaped outlines or borders with shorter grass both on the inside and outside of the borders. These raised mounds of grass are growing where the foundations of cabins and homes built by the Mormon Pioneers in the late 1840s once existed.",

    "bodyText": "<p>When the first company of Mormon pioneers reached the banks of the Missouri River, they discovered the river was too deep for their wagons to ford and the only crossing was by a single ferry company with one raft. As this ferry could not meet the high demand, Brigham Young tasked a crew of 100 men to build a new boat and improve three river landings. Despite their best efforts, it eventually became too late to continue any further west for the year. Continuing into the mountains beyond was too risky as few European American emigrants had gone this far before, leaving the Mormon Pioneers uncertain as to what lay ahead. This, a section of land stretching for 12 miles east of Council Bluffs, is where the Saints would spend the winter of 1846. Hundreds of wagons and thousands of emigrants formed 33 temporary settlements. Low on food and supplies, exhausted, and with disease running rampant, these temporary settlements became the permanent, final resting place for hundreds of emigrants.<br />  <br /> The Center's website is www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/historic-sites/nebraska/mormon-trail-center-at-historic-winter-quarters?lang=eng</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Iowa School for the Deaf, 3501 Harry Langdon Blvd, Council Bluffs, IA 51503)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities </strong><br /> Today the site of the Grand Encampment is part of the Iowa School for the Deaf's campus.

    "audioDescription": "You are on the extensive grounds of the Iowa School for the Deaf located near Council Bluffs, Iowa. The area is suburban with the large metropolitan area of Omaha-Council Bluffs just a few miles away. Small business and commercial buildings are the primary structures. An interstate highway borders one side of the School's grounds. The land is primarily flat with human development and grass meadows comprising the scene outside of the School's boundary. Following the paved road past the School's boundary and into its ground, the scene changes and is now of buildings with ornamentation, grass meadows, deciduous forest and a small park with paved paths. Close to the park is a paved parking lot. The wayside is a short walk from the parking lot on a concrete path. Sounds are a mixture of traffic, human activities, and the natural sounds of birds and insect. The wayside is comprised of a panel made from a high pressure laminate material that contains printed text and colored images. The panel is inside a metal frame and has a metal base with a low profile form that does not block the view. The view from the wayside is of grass meadows, human-made structures, and the interstate highway, which sits much lower in elevation, revealing the School has been built on a bluff. For miles along this bluff, the Mormon pioneers built temporary shelters in 1846 when it became necessary to spend the winter here.",

The Donner-Reed Party was the third emigrant wagon party to pass through the canyon.<br /> <br /> Today Echo Canyon is still a busy transportation corridor, occupied by I-80, the Union Pacific Railroad, a segment of the Old Lincoln Highway (the nation’s first coast-to-coast automobile highway), and modern communications and utility lines. More than 160 years of development have altered the canyon, but fascinating traces of 19th century uses still are visible.<br /> <br /> As you enter I-80, look ahead and to the right toward the bare rampart of Castle Rock, an emigrant landmark near the head of Echo Canyon. The Mormon pioneer company headed by Brigham Young, who had taken ill with a tickborne infection, camped near here on July 14, 1847. The combined California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express Trail ran between the two modern railroad grades, and a Pony Express and stage station once stood on the grounds of the “old automobile graveyard” that is visible from the freeway. <strong>The site is on private property, not open to the public.</strong></p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><b>Location</b> (between Wahsatch and Echo, UT; Westbound I-80 enters Echo Canyon between mileposts 188 and 187 southwest of Wahsatch.)</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></p> <h3>More Site Information</h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express National Historic Trail</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

The first wagons, belonging to the Donner-Reed Party, crossed this divide in 1846, followed in 1847 by Brigham Young's vanguard party of Mormon pioneers. Imagine those emigrants' despair upon reaching this spot and seeing the jagged, blue-gray peaks of the Wasatch Mountains on the horizon ahead. From here, both wagon companies had to grub a rough track over divides and mountains and down a series of willow-packed canyons and creek bottoms in order to reach the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. The effort cost the Donner-Reed party 13 days, one of a series of troubles that caused the group to be trapped by blizzards in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (Utah Highway 65, about 5.5 miles southwest of Henefer, Utah)<br /> Hastings Cutoff and Mormon Trail Wagon Ruts at Hogsback Summit (southwest of Henefer), marked by white fiberglass trail posts, are clearly visible along the right side of the road beyond the fence line at the Summit and Morgan County boundary. Just ahead at Hogsback Summit, the pioneers looked west and saw a discouraging jumble of mountains. An interpretive sign at the turnout tells the story.<br /> <br /> Look for the swales on the right near the Morgan County sign at odometer reading 5.7 miles.<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit</strong></p> <p>\"40 Miles to Fort Bridger\"</p> <p>\"The country west looks rough and mountainous,\" wrote William Clayton, describing this panorama of the Wasatch Mountains. Modern historians have dubbed this summit \"Heartbreak Ridge\" to describe the feelings of many early Mormon Pioneers who crested this ridge. After months on the trail, traveling over 1,200 weary miles, it was heart- wrenching to discover that the most difficult part of the journey still lay ahead. Some people must have broken down and wept. Others gritted their teeth with determination and moved southwest down off Hogsback Summit to challenge the mountains and canyons that lay ahead.</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“...arrived [July 19] on the suummit of the dividing ridge and put a guide hard up, \"80 miles to Fort Bridger\"... The descent is not very steep but exceedingly dangerous to wagons being mostly on the side hill over large cobble stones, causing the wagons to slide very badly.” -William Clayton</i></p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cali/index.htm\">California Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer Trail</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/poex/index.htm\">Pony Express Trail</a></h2>",

    "audioDescription": "Independence Rock State Historic Site. 408 words<br /><br />Parking for Independence Rock is at a rest area on the side of the highway. The large gray granite mound can be seen across the rangeland surrounding it. Cement sidewalks lead past the restroom and other buildings to a large stone marker with a metal relief sculpture of a wagon and ox team. Feel free to stop and touch. From there, the entrance to the fields around Independence Rock is just across a paved access drive.<br /><br />The covered entrance is made of tan brickwork, with metal fencing on the back side. There are a couple of wayside signs here that show a map of the trails that encircle the rock and that ask visitors to be respectful of the area. There is also a warning that rattlesnakes live in this area.<br /><br />To reach the rock itself, proceed through the pass-through in the fence and follow the cement side walk across the grassy prairieland. Other signs along the walk describe the Sweetwater River Valley, discuss the geology of the granite outcrops in the valley, and provide information on the historic trails that passed this way, naming the rock, hardships along the trail, history of the area in the last 150 years, and the signatures that were carved in the rock. From the signs, we learn that this mass of granite is 700 feet wide, 1,900 feet long and 136 feet high.<br /><br />Swales from the wagon ruts can also be seen through the pasture, the most prominent one being crossed by a wooden foot bridge.<br /><br />The sidewalk ends at a metal gate close to the base of the rock. Once through the gate there are benches along the fence to the left. The sidewalk continues up to the base of the rock itself then continues in either direction around the base. The cement will change to gravel and then to dirt if you continue to follow the trail. From the path around the rock it is easy to feel the rock or even to climb the steep slope; however there are no fixed paths to the top of the rock. At the end of the rock to the left there is one section that is protected by a metal fence. Here there are carvings in the stone and a group of metal memorial plaques and other markers, including one that identifies the rock as being \"Wyoming Place number 1 on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",

    "bodyText": "<p>In February 1846, the first party of emigrants faced nearly 300 miles of winter-bare prairie stretching between Nauvoo and the Missouri River gateway to the Oregon Trail. As the ground warmed and thawed, and spring rains set in, the Mormon Pioneers found themselves trying to travel cross land that was somewhere between a liquid and a solid. Axle deep mud combined with narrow wagon wheels eventually brought the company to halt, forcing them to wait for drier conditions. In total, it took a month for the emigrants to go 100 miles, a distance that should have taken only 10 days to travel.<br /> <br /> Their hardships brought the people together, forging their faith, group identity, and sense of destiny. The spirit of these Mormon pioneers rings in the lyrics of their now-famous anthem, “Come, Come, Ye Saints.” It was written by William Clayton during one miserable, muddy night at Locust Creek campsite in south-central Iowa. He wrote it upon hearing that his wife had given birth to a healthy baby boy back in Nauvoo (she could not travel with him due to the pregnancy) and that both were doing well.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Tharp Cemetery is open to the public.

The nearest town with a population of 1000 or more is 15 miles away. You are in Tharp Cemetery, an open to the public cemetery that is not related to the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail. However, it shares a boundary with privately own land that does contain an important Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail site- Locust Greek Campsite. From the graded gravel and dirt parking lot, Locust Creek Campsite is located along the ridge west of the cemetery and south of Locust Creek. Views are of grass meadows, deciduous forest, rolling hills, and ravines. Sounds are natural- birds, insects, wind, and running water. The wayside is a short walk away from the parking lot and is reached by following a dirt path. The wayside is comprised of a panel made from a high pressure laminate material that contains printed text and colored images. The panel is inside a metal frame and has a metal base with a low profile form that does not block the view of the ridge where Locust Creek Campsite was located. It was here in 1846 that the hymn that would become the anthem for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was written.",

Two years later, Mormons fleeing Missouri arrived and took shelter in the old barracks while building houses across the river in Nauvoo. According to one witness, on Aug. 6, 1842, it was at Montrose that Joseph Smith prophesied that the Latter-day Saints would be \"driven to the Rocky Mountains\" by their enemies, and that they would go on to build settlements and cities and \"see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains.\" Latter Day Saints regard this as a prediction of their emigration to the Great Salt Lake Valley. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{65375692-511d-4ac4-8203-b75b8369dde0}{96}\" paraid=\"1522246607\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The Saints fled Nauvoo in February 1846, some crossing the Mississippi River by ferry and others walking or driving across the ice after the river froze. They landed at Montrose and along the nearby riverbanks before proceeding to the Sugar Creek campground, about 6 miles west of Montrose. Some of the poor and ill people who had no means to follow Brigham Young west ended up camping about 1.5 miles north of Montrose along \"Potter's Slough.\" Young later sent back wagons to retrieve them and bring them west. </p> <p><br /> The pioneers landed in Montrose, on the west shore of the Mississippi River, during their exodus from Nauvoo in 1846. The first wagon, belonging to Charles Shumway, was ferried across the river on February 4.</p> <blockquote> <p>Orson Pratt recorded his crossing on February 14: \"The falling of the snow and the cold northwest wind have made the weather very disagreeable... We found the ferryman and his man standing in the open air around a small fire. We prevailed upon them to venture across and in a short time we found ourself safely landed on the West bank of the great Mississippi.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Mormons continued their exodus from Nauvoo through September, when the last members of the church were run out of town by hostile mobs.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Montrose Landing, Lee County, Iowa)<br /> <br /> <em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em><br />  </p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/montrose-riverfront-park-exhibit-audio-description.htm\">Exhibit Audio Description available</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

Most converts were limited to what they could carry because of weight restrictions set by the Mormon Church and the capacity of the handcart.<br /> <br /> Across the front of the cart was a cross bar that allowed the cart to be pushed or pulled. Some carts also sported a canvas top resembling miniature covered wagons. Since carts were often made entirely of wood they were often noisy and subject to frequent breakdowns.

    "bodyText": "<p>The story of the Mormon Trail is rooted in the beginnings of a unique American religion. In 1827, 21-year-old Joseph Smith announced that he had unearthed a set of golden plates, inscribed with the tenants of God’s true church. Smith said that he had been directed to the plates by an angel named Moroni, who also had given him divine tools for translating the ancient inscriptions into English. Smith used these to produce new Scripture called the <em>Book of Mormon</em>. In 1830, in western New York, he organized a legal entity that would become The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His followers, who regarded Smith as a prophet, became known as Mormons.</p> <p>Important differences between mainstream Christianity and Mormon doctrine quickly emerged, but it was primarily hostilities over land, business, and politics that caused Smith repeatedly to move church headquarters. Driven out of Missouri in 1838, the Mormons finally settled along a bend of the Mississippi River in Illinois. There they established a community they called Nauvoo, a Hebrew word meaning “beautiful place.” It was at Nauvoo that Smith cautiously began introducing the Old Testament practice of “plural marriage,” or polygamy, among select church leaders.</p> <p>Thousands of converts flocked to Nauvoo, soon making it the largest town in Illinois. Neighbors initially welcomed the orderly, industrious settlers despite their religious differences. But relations gradually soured, with complaints centering on Mormons’ clannish business practices, accusations of theft, their electoral sway, and Smith’s political aspirations. Meanwhile, dissent emerged within the church as rumors leaked of secret plural marriages. After an opposition newspaper publicly accused the prophet and other leaders of polygamy, Nauvoo’s city council and Smith declared the paper a public nuisance and Smith ordered destruction of its press. For that he and others were arrested and jailed at Carthage, Illinois. On June 27, 1844, a mob broke into the jail and murdered Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum. Other vigilantes attacked Mormon farms around Nauvoo in an attempt to expel them.</p> <p>Brigham Young stepped up as Smith’s successor and began planning an orderly, spring 1846 evacuation of some 15,000 faithful to the Great Basin, Mexican-held territory beyond the Rocky Mountains. However, as anti-Mormon violence heated, Young decided to organize a vanguard of church leaders to depart in late winter, hoping that would pacify the vigilantes until the main body of Mormons could start west in April. On February 4, 1846, the first wagons ferried across the Mississippi to Iowa. This group halted after five miles and set up camp at Sugar Creek for a lengthy wait as Young and his associates concluded business at Nauvoo. Meanwhile others, anxious not to be left behind, drifted over to join the Sugar Creek camp. Young’s vanguard company unexpectedly swelled from his intended 1,800 emigrants to around 3,000—many without their own wagons and provisions.</p> <p>On March 1, 1846, some 500 Mormon wagons lurched northwesterly across the winter-bare Iowa prairie toward the Missouri River. Their route is the Mormon Trail.</p> <p><strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Mt. Pisgah was a semi-permanent settlement or waystation on the Mormon Pioneer Trail located in southcentral Iowa between Nauvoo, Illinois, and the Missouri River. Parley Pratt was sent ahead on the trail to locate waystations for the saints who didn’t have enough food or were sick. The largest of these was Mt. Pisgah, near the banks of a branch of the Grand River<br /> <br /> The Mormon pioneer Vanguard Company arrived here in mid-May 1846, on the edge of the United States’ settled land. With a nearby spring for drinking water, Mount Pisgah was an ideal location for a second camp and resting place. A group of men were sent ahead of the companies to plow a great field, plant seeds, and build shelters for those that would be left at this location. In the first four days these men had planted nearly 1000 acres of crops. They planted corn, buckwheat, beans, potatoes, peas, cucumbers, pumpkins, and squash in a great field protected by a split rail fence. Over 2000 Mormon travelers lived temporarily in dugouts and cabins at the Mt. Pisgah waystation. Some stayed for a matter of months while others called Pisgah home for several years. <br /> <br /> The waystation was available for Mormon Travelers between 1846-1852. Many of the new settlers never were able to leave this site for their new home in the west and are buried in unmarked graves at the site. The site is marked today by a monument which was placed there in Fall of 1888 and was to memorialize the more than three hundred saints who lost their lives at Mt. Pisgah.<br /> <br /> The site is now a mix of privately and publicly owned lands. The county park area has wayside exhibits, historical markers, a monument, and a pioneer cemetery. Much of the village site itself is located on adjacent private pasture lands, which the owner opens to interested visitors and tour groups. Traces of wagon roads and outlines building footings are visible in places.<br /> <br /> Visiting Mt. Pisgah today permits you to feel and visualize all that Parley Pratt when he trotted his horse down this slope for the first time on May 1846. These were his words in 1846,</p> <blockquote> <p>“Riding about three or four miles through beautiful prairies, I came suddenly to some round and sloping hills, grassy and crowned with beautiful groves of timber, while alternate open groves and forests seemed blended in all the beauty and harmony of an English park, while beneath and beyond, on the west, rolled a main branch of Grand River”. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(1741 Mt Pisgah Rd, Thayer, IA 50254)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities </strong><br />  Currently, Mt. Pisgah contains three sections:<br /> 1. <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/historic-sites/iowa/mount-pisgah-monument?lang=eng\">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints monument and cemetery</a>: open to the public.<br /> 2. <a href=\"https://www.mycountyparks.com/county/union/Park/Mt-Pisgah.aspx\">Mt.

    "audioDescription": "You are in Union County, Iowa at Mount Pisgah, a place containing remnants of the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail. The area is rural, with homes spread far apart. The landscape is primarily farms and fields in all directions. The land is rolling hills covered with farm fields and deciduous forest. Small creeks and other waterways are abundant. You are travelling on a graded dirt and gravel road. The parking lot is also gravel, located near to the top of a small hill. The land slopes down in front of the parking lot. The two waysides are located a short distance from the parking lot. They are reached by following a concrete path through grass meadows with open views of the site and views of dense deciduous forest. The waysides are located next to the concrete path, with the hillside sloping down behind the waysides. On all sides, the view is of grass meadows and forest, with very few human-made structures. Sounds are natural- birds, insects, wind, and running water. Both waysides contain a panel made from a high pressure laminate material that contains printed text and colored images. The wayside titled \"Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trails\" contains a very large panel that is inside a metal frame that has an upright base. The wayside titled \"On The Brink\" contains a large panel inside a metal frame with a low profile base and does not block the view. While looking at the wayside, the view is of a downward sloping hill covered by grass meadows and small trees. Within this view is a cemetery and a monument dedicated to the Mormon Pioneers who perished at this site in 1846 to 1847.",

    "audioDescription": "National Historic Trails Interpretive Center. 322 words<br /><br />Seen from the parking lot, the building is a low, one-story, circular structure, almost blending in with the prairie vegetation surrounding it. A series of shiny, royal-blue wall segments stair-step out from the center of the building and extend to the left. The sidewalk leads to the left, then curves back to the right, around the blue wall to reach the front of the building. Along the left edge of the sidewalk are four tall panels, one for each of the trails commemorated here: the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, the Pony Express Trail and the Mormon Trail, each associated with a different color, which is then echoed in bricks placed in the sidewalk along with flat stones engraved with quotes from emigrants.<br /><br />At the front of the building, a large triangular patio extends to the left, dotted with stone benches. To reach the entrance, follow the rough stone wall on the right side of the walkway. This wall then becomes a tunnel, with a dark green wall on the left and topped with a covering supported by semi-circular metal beams, echoing the shape of a covered wagon. Spaced randomly in the stone wall are larger stones with images of prominent geographical features along the trails, such as Chimney Rock, Natural Bridge, Laramie Peak and Fort Laramie.<br /><br />Entering the front doors brings you into a large, open lobby space. In the middle of this space is a welcome kiosk with a map of the facility. The exhibit space may be reached through an opening in the wall beyond the kiosk or by following the curving hallway to the right. Restrooms are also along the right-hand hallway.<br /><br />The information desk is off to the left of the kiosk. From the desk, the gift shop will be to your left. To your right at that point is stone wall with names of donors carved into the blocks.",

The town was named Nauvoo - reportedly from a Hebrew word meaning beautiful place.<br /> <br /> Nauvoo was the Mormon headquarters for seven years during which time the church flourished, and the settlement quickly became one of the largest cities in Illinois. Hostility, suspicion and trouble increased in direct proportion to the community's growth and success, and the Mormons were forced to flee their homes during the winter and spring of 1846. On April 24, 1846, Newel Knight, who departed with the spring exodus, lamented:</p> <blockquote> <p><br /> \"We all halted & took a farewell view of our delightful City. . . . We allso beheld the magnificent Temple rearing its lofty tower towards the heavens . . . we allso took a farewell look of our Comfortable homes we had labored so hard to rear for the Comfort of our families . . . my heart did swell within me.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(Parley Street, Nauvoo, Illinois 62354)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities </strong><br /> This site contains 1,100 acres of authentically restored homes and shops, including Brigham Young's home.

    "audioDescription": "You are in the town of Nauvoo, Illinois, a community of 950 people that has a small-town feel. Nestled next to the Mississippi River, Nauvoo was built by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in 1839. Many of the original roads, homes, and stores they built still remain and the town is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a Historic District. The now paved road entering the site, Parley Street, is one of these original items. This short street travels through riparian forest and grass meadows as it goes from Nauvoo to it end at a boat launch on the Mississippi River. The paved parking lot is located next to this boat launch. A small park surrounds the area. The landscape is flat and views are primarily of the riparian forest next to the parking lot; human development in the form of sidewalks, a monument, buildings, and fences; and of the Mississippi River. The boat launch and access to the river, is a short walk on a dirt path away from the parking lot. Views looking upstream and downstream the Mississippi River are extensive and show a mixture of human development, forests, and wetlands. Sounds are a combination of human activity and of nature- water, wind, birds, and insects. The wayside is a short distance back from this viewpoint and is in between Parley Street and an improved dirt walking path that goes to Nauvoo. The wayside contains a panel with printed text and colored images that is made from a high pressure laminate material. The panel is inside a metal frame and has a metal base with a low profile form that does not block the view. Looking out from the wayside, you see Parley Street, riparian forest, a small meadow, and the boat launch, which is also called a landing. This landing, Parley Street landing, is where the Mormon pioneers departed when they were forced out of Nauvoo in 1846.",

    "audioDescription": "North Platte River Crossing. 431 words<br /><br />This historic bridge lies just east of the modern highway bridge. This one-lane bridge has three spans, each a low arch about 15 feet high, made of iron, now rusty-brown in color. There are \"I\" beam piers at the beginning and end of each arch. The flooring is formed by broad planking, now a weathered gray. The bridge is much longer than the current width of the river. Only the northern span still has water underneath.<br /><br />At the southern end of the bridge, at the edge of the dirt parking lot, is a wayside sign titled, \"Spanning a Century: End of an Era.\" A historic photograph on the sign shows the bridge in 1877 when the water stretched from end to end of the bridge. Text reads in part, \"Once broad and turbulent, the North Platte River posed a formidable obstacle to 19th century travelers. High water made it nearly impossible to cross the river for several month each year. The crossing became less dangerous by 1850 when ferry service was established to meet the growing volume of military and emigrant traffic.\" It goes on to tell us that after the Great Sioux Reservation was established in 1868, huge amount of supplies were needed to be transported to supply the Indian agencies, leading Congress to fund construction of a bridge. Text at the bottom of the sign reads, \"The King Iron Bridge Company built bridges with speed and efficiency by standardizing the manufacturing process and maintaining stockpiles of prefabricated parts. The triple-span Fort Laramie Bridge was constructed between August 1875 and February 1876 for $15,000. Rubble-filled log ice breakers protect the unique I-beam piers supporting the bridge. Spanning 400 feet, this bridge is the best-preserved King paten tubular bowstring iron bridge still in existence.\"<br /><br />To the right of the bridge, a trail leads down to the water's edge, then proceeds eastward along the bank. Another wayside sign by the river tells of initial skirmishes between the military and the Lakota Sioux, the beginnings of the Northern Plains Indian wars, which finally ended in 1890 at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.<br /><br />At the northern end of the bridge are 2 markers. One identifies the bridge as a Wyoming Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The other marker, protected by a metal rail fence, reads, \"Old Army Bridge over the Platte River, erected in 1875. This bridge was a vital link between Cheyenne, Fort Laramie and the military outposts, Indian agencies and gold fields of the Black Hills Dakota Regions. Placed by the Historical Landmark Commission of Wyoming, July 1951.\"",

    "audioDescription": "O'Fallon's Bluff at Sutherland Rest Area. 365 words<br /><br />From the parking area at this rest stop, a sidewalk leads around the rest room building on the right side, loops behind it, then turns right, away from the building, out to where swales can be seen running roughly parallel to the highway. About halfway out a small loop to the left passes a low brick wall with a sign on top. The metal sign, which has raised lettering, is titled \"The Great Platte River Road.\" It reads in part, \"This is the Platte River Valley, Americas great road west. It provided a natural pathway for westward expansion across the continent during the nineteenth century. Here passed the Oregon Trail, following the South Platte River along much the same route as the highway over which you now travel. Beginning in 1841, nearly 250,000 travelers crossed the plains to Oregon and California over this important overland route. Here at O'Fallon's Bluffs, the wagon trains faced one of the most difficult and dangerous spots on the trail. The Platte River cut directly against the bluff, making it necessary to travel the narrow roadway over O'Fallon's Bluffs.\"<br /><br /> A stone bench is on a low wall at the right side of this loop. <br /><br />At the far end of the sidewalk is another sign with raised lettering. This one is titled, \"Crossing the Overland Trail.\" It reads in part, \"Beneath this platform, evidence of the great westward migration still remains. These shallow depressions were once deep ruts created by thousands of hooves, shoes and wheels. The Overland Trail is often visualized as a single, well-defined roadway. However, except in narrow spots such as this, the actual route through the Platte Valley during any given year varied considerably, depending upon such factors as soil conditions and the availability of grass for the animals.\"<br /><br />Looking both right and left from this sign you can see shallow swales coming up the slope from the left. Large iron wagon-wheel shapes have been mounted in several places to clearly mark the shallow depressions in the grassy slope. Two sets of four wheels are off to your left and two more sets are off to the right.",

When visiting the museum, inquire about a map and directions to the campsite, which requires traveling on unpaved and unsigned roads.<br /> <br /> <strong>Locus Creek Campsite History at the Museum</strong><br /> As the Mormon pioneers headed west, the route continued to test the determined travelers. Heavy rains made the roads impassable. For about two weeks in early April, a group of about 300 wagons camped nearby at Locust Creek. Everything they owned was damp and supplies were running low. Warming weather increased their risk of rattlesnake bites and fire.<br /> <br /> At Locust Creek, poet and camp clerk William Clayton received good news. He learned that his wife had given birth to a healthy baby boy back in Nauvoo, Illinois. In honor of his son’s arrival, Clayton wrote the lyrics to the Latter-day Saints’ beloved anthem “Come, Come, Ye Saints” (originally titled “All is Well”). This song celebrates their faith and brought joy during the difficult journey.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(515 E Jefferson St, Corydon, IA 50060)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities </strong> <br /> Currently, the museum is open mid-May to mid-October, six days a week (closed on Mondays) and charges a modest admission.

    "audioDescription": "You are in the town of Corydon, Iowa, population 1500, and the largest town for miles in all directions. The landscape has a rural feel; just past the towns boundaries, large farms on rolling hills and flat valley floors surround the town on all sides. Prairie Trails Museum is located next to the main road for the town, a paved, non-divided, four lane state highway. The view from the museum is of grass lawns, paved roads and parking lots, small business buildings, and the homes of people. Birds and insects can be heard above the traffic noise and the sounds of human activity. The museum's paved parking lot is located directly off of the highway. The wayside is a just a short distance away from the parking lot, and reached by walking on a concrete sidewalk. As you walk, you are looking at numerous historic artifacts that are on the museum's grounds including ancient farm equipment, a steam driven tractor, and a windmill. Also in the view are the museum's multiple buildings. In the background is a very large, red sided, wood barn. Next to the wayside is a very large red brick building with a white roof, which is the museum's main building. The wayside is comprised of a panel made from a high pressure laminate material that contains printed text and colored images. The panel is inside a metal frame and has a metal base with a low profile form that does not block the view of the Prairie Trails Museum's buildings and grounds.",

Among the over 350,000 emigrants that went through Rattlesnake pass between 1840 and 1870, was Frederick Richard Fulkerson. 18 year old Frederick was following the Trail to Oregon with his family. While crossing the Platte River, he became chilled and exhausted when he swam the river in an effort to keep the families stock animals from being carried downstream. Frederick passed away several weeks later while the Fulkersons where camped at Rattlesnake Pass.

    "audioDescription": "Rattlesnake Pass. 250 words<br /><br />A narrow, abandoned, broken paved road goes through the pass here south of Devil's Gate, curving around the end of a granite ridge on the north side. Some of the boulders are close to the edge of the road and emigrant inscriptions can be seen carved in the rock. On the south side of the road is a pioneer grave enclosed by a metal fence. One large stone sits at the end with carvings on it and the grave itself is piled with stones. At the west end of the enclosure is a wooden post with a crosspiece, forming a rough cross. At the other end a sign tells us that the grave of Frederick Richard Fulkerson was noted by forty-niner J.G. Bluff on July 26, 1849, as he traveled through what he termed \"Pass of the Rattlesnake Mountain to the left of Devil's Gate.\" The survival of the large granite boulder used as the Fulkerson headstone and the sketch made by Bluff allows us to locate this grave precisely. It goes on to tell us that the current carving on the boulder, which reads, T.P. Baker, 1864, is believed to be the graffiti of a passing traveler. Baker, whoever he was, left another, nearly identical, inscription on a rock face a half-mile farther on at the bank of the river.<br /><br />Looking both ways through the pass from the graveside, you can see the narrow, white post markers indicating the historic trace of the Oregon Trail.",

    "audioDescription": "Register Cliff Historic Site. 433 words<br /><br />The parking lot here sits parallel to the cliff, which stands about 30 feet high and extends in both directions. The vertical cliff face has clear horizontal layers, some thick and a couple in pinkish tan very thin. In places the mud nests of cliff swallows are clustered. <br /><br />A gravel path runs along the foot of the cliff. Going right, it leads past a pioneer cemetery surround by a stone wall topped with the palings. Old broken gravestones can be seen through the fence. At the far end of the cemetery is a small building housing restrooms. <br /><br />To the left, the path extends to the end of the cliff and then follows as it curves away from us. At the point where the path reaches the far end of the parking lot, there is a large brown sign discussing the cliff markings on the left. It tells us that, although now eroded, dates as early as 1829 and even one from 1797, were once visible and judged to be authentic. At one time Indian pictographs and petroglyphs were also visible.<br /><br />A few yards farther on the right side of the path is a covered kiosk with three large signs. They are titled \"Trail Register,\" \"Register Cliff State Historic Site,\" and \"Homesteaders.\" The last sign explains that a short tunnel blasted out of the base of the cliff, visible to the right of the sign with its entrance protected by a fence, was used as a root cellar by local settlers.<br /><br />Close by is a stone slab monument with two metal plaques on its face. The one on top, about 3 feet up, is circular with a relief carving of a covered wagon and a team of oxen and reads, \"Oregon Trail Memorial.\" Feel free to touch. Below that is another plaque which reads, \"Dedicated to the pioneers of Wyoming. Register Cliff, acquired by the State of Wyoming through gift of the Henry Frederick family, 1932.\"<br /><br />Farther down the path, where the cliff face begins to curve away from you, a side path leads closer to the base of the cliff to a chain-link fence which protects this section of the cliff. Here are some of the oldest carvings, both large and small. Dates easily seen range from 1852 and 1859 to 1928. From this area, a narrow rock trail leads back closer to the cliff base up a small rise to a small lookout with a bench.<br /><br />The main path continues around the end of the cliff where additional carvings, still protected by the metal fencing, can be seen.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Richardson’s Point gravesites contain the graves of the first two of three deaths on the Mormon Trail of the Brigham Young-led Vanguard Company that left Nauvoo, Illinois, in February 1846. The approximately 500 wagons camped in this area due to sickness and the terrible weather conditions. <br /> <br /> Leaving Nauvoo in late February of 1846, approximately 500 wagons and 3000 people led by Brigham Young crossed the Mississippi River into Iowa and traveled into Van Buren County. Due to thawing conditions and rain, the roads became difficult to traverse and the main Mormon group stopped to make camp at a spot known as Richardson’s Point. Located near the Van Buren/Davis County line, the Saints stopped and stayed in this region from March 7th<sup>t</sup>to March 19th. The Saints broke camp on the 19th<sup>h</sup>and continued their journey westward. <br /> <br /> Richardson’s Point was used as a stopping spot for many as others fled Nauvoo. One would have thought the two graves would have been forgotten due to the location of the grave placements deep within the timber, but they weren’t. The local community seemed to have never forgotten them. As early as 1910-1915, it has been recorded that local school children would go to the graves with their teacher and pick Mayflowers to put on them. One of these children, Harold Brown, lived approximately a mile from the graves and made this his home until his death in the 1980s. Harold could always find the graves to show interested people. In 1963, Hazen Bonar and his brother tried unsuccessfully to find the graves for a pair of Mormon missionaries. The missionaries returned in 1965 and, again with the Bonar brothers, the graves were discovered. The Bonar’s grandparents had homesteaded nearby properties in the 1840s and undoubtedly witnessed the large Mormon camps firsthand. In 1981, Wallace and Jane Maugar, with help from Wallace’s cousin Ila Garrett and her husband Bud, began searching for the graves themselves. Wallace was actually Edwin Little’s great-great-great grandson. The Maugars did not physically find the graves until 1983 and returned in 1985 with two funeral home markers and two headstones for the graves. The Maugars and Garretts should be given credit for their diligence. They carried bags of concrete, rock, water and tools into the woods by hand to accomplish their deed. Before, the only original visible markers were a granite headstone and limestone footstone on the Tanner grave. <br /> <br /> Clarence Klodt purchased the 240-acre farm that the graves were located on in 1970 from the Bonar family, an unbelievable acquisition even by today’s standards as some of the land was virgin prairie and a plow had never touched it. There was never a clear path to the graves. The only marker to the graves was a piece of tin stuck in an oak tree about 500 feet from the graves. As time went on, interest slowly picked up about the graves. <strong>Read more...</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/richardson-s-point-additional-history-mormon-pioneer-trail.htm\">Additional History & Information</a></h2> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location </strong>(11251 County Road J40, Milton, IA, Van Buren County)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.traveliowa.com/destination/richardson-s-point---mormon-trail/13476/\">More Site Information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mopi/index.htm\">Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "audioDescription": "South Pass. 401 words<br /><br />There is a wayside sign here at the intersection of a rough dirt track and the main gravel road. The land stretches away in all directions, sagebrush-covered prairie as far as the eye can see. Cement posts, one to the east along the dirt road and one to the west, mark the path of the Oregon Trail. To the north a distant mountain range can be seen. To the west is the slanted end of a butte, which extends away to the south. Another butte is visible in the distant south.<br /><br />The sign at the intersection reads, \"To the south stand the Oregon Buttes, a major trail landmark. The name is significant because the buttes were roughly the beginning of the Oregon Territory and also helped keep emigrants encouraged, even though there were still hundreds of miles of rough going ahead. Today the Oregon Buttes are an Area of Critical Environmental Concern because of their cultural significance and important wildlife values. <br /><br />\"About twelve miles to the southwest of Oregon Buttes is the Tri-Territory site. This site is the location where the Oregon Territory, Mexican Territory and Louisiana Purchase had a common border. The large landmark, just to the south of where you are standing, is Pacific Butte. The great height and mass of the butte, combined with a ridge to the north paralleling the emigrant trails, helps to create a visual channel through which travelers migrated on their way through South Pass.\"<br /><br />Following the dirt road to the west leads to another wayside sign and a fenced area with two stone markers. Parallel wagon swales are barely discernable through the sagebrush on both sides of the road. The sign tells us the South Pass was first discovered in 1812. Bonneville took the first wagons over the pass in 1832 and Fremont widely publicized the route after his expedition in 1842. Thousands of Mormons, future Oregonians and Californians would use the trail in the following twenty years.<br /><br />The two stone markers are on the north side of the dirt road. The larger one is a five-foot tall rock slab, reddish-tan in color, roughly rectangular with carved lettering that reads, \"Old Oregon Trail, 1843-57.\" The other stone slab marker is about 3 feet tall and is charcoal gray. It reads, \"Narcissa Prentiss Whitman, Eliza Hart Spalding, First white women to cross this pass, July 4, 1836.\"",

    "audioDescription": "South Pass Overlook. 233 words<br /><br />On the south side of the dirt parking area is a paved loop overlooking the wide pass below. Wayside signs are spaced along the walkway. To the southeast lies the long flat ridgetop of Pacific Butte, as identified by a map on one of the signs. Directly south are the more distant peaks of Oregon Buttes. Turning back to the northeast, the southern end of the Wind River mountain range is visible in the distance. In all directions, as far as the eye can see, the land is covered with short sagebrush, prairie vegetation.<br /><br />The wayside signs cover such topics as the path of the trails west of this point, the role of South Pass as a corridor westward, and the fur trade.<br /><br />One sign has a drawing of the landscape, labeling the prominent features. It reads, \"South Pass, on top of the world. From where you're standing South Pass doesn't look all that remarkable. But compared to the rugged Wind River Mountains, it can easily be recognized as a type of gateway. Nevertheless, crossing the Continental Divide into 'Oregon Country' was a task for all westward-bound travelers and many described their feelings about the event. In 1852 Lucy Rutledge Cooke, a young woman with 'California Fever' wrote, 'This morn we arrived at the South Pass after which all rivers we see will be running to the Pacific.'\"",

The low vegetation consists primarily of grasses and sagebrush. On the other side of the narrow valley are granite ridges and outcroppings. Several wayside signs are located along the path. <br /><br />One tells us that Split Rock was a well-known trail landmark and navigation aid. Emigrants were guided by the rock for an entire day's travel from the east and it remained in view behind them for another two days. Travel time from here to South Pass was about 6 days. The granite rocks seen in front of you are the side view of Split Rock. Photographs on the sign show the view of the notch from the trail, which passes east of this location. One picture shows a pair of ruts running away from you into the distance. At the upper right is a flat-topped granite hill. On the left side of the flat ridge, is a notch, almost a perfect \"V\" shape.<br /><br />Other signs discuss the Pony Express, wild horses in the west, and the westward trails. Along the trail near the parking lot is a small stone marker with a panel indicating that Split Rock in on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /><br />Restrooms are located at the other end of the parking lot.",

Emigrants who used the Oregon Trail settled in numerous places, including throughout Nebraska. This amount grew as land was increasingly claimed in Oregon. Soon, towns formed along the Trail in several locations and they used the Oregon Trail for local transportation.<br /> <br /> As time passed in this part of Nebraska, trains replaced wagons and parts of the Oregon Trail became a railroad. Later still, automobiles replaced trains and the Oregon Trail became a road. First, it was the rugged Lincoln Highway and then it was further developed and turned into today's Interstate 80.<br /> <br /> The Archway tells this story of 170 years of westward movement with detailed displays, family activities, education programs, and more. Amenities include a gift shop, a theater, and a snack bar.

    "audioDescription": "The Archway. 382 words<br /><br />From the parking lot the arched building can be seen extending over the Interstate highway with squat, square towers at either end. The entrance building extends out in front of the tower, with wings on either side. The building is made of large, horizontal logs with light-colored caulking. Broad stone pillars anchor the corners of the lobby and of the wings. The structure is covered with a green metal roof. On top of each of the towers is a gleaming metal sculpture of a leaping horse with huge, fan-shaped wings. <br /><br />Between the building and the parking lot is a fort structure containing a maze. Continuing past that is a large sculpture of a bison by Nebraska artist Gary Ginther. Feel free to touch. In front of the entrance is another sculpture, this one surrounded by a chain fence. The sculpture is of two boys on horseback in full gallop, their bodies pinned together by an arrow. A nearby sign tells us that this work was commissioned by Fred A. Bosselman and sculpted by David L. Biehl in 2011. Titled \"A Narrow Escape,\" it depicts the Martin brothers running from an Indian attack. Both boys survived.<br /><br />In front of the sculpture a circular garden surrounds a flagpole. There are benches along the sidewalk around the garden area. Beyond that, on the other side of the entrance road, is an iron foot bridge over a narrow lake. There are more exhibits and a walking path on the other side.<br /><br />At the right end of the building is an old sign for the Hammer Motel. A wayside sign along the sidewalk there tells us about the Lincoln Highway, an ambitious project to create a highway from coast to coast in the early 1900s. The Hammer Motel was one of the motels that grew up along the highway.<br /><br />The building entrance leads into a large two-story lobby paved with flagstones. To the left is a dining area. Directly ahead is an escalator leading up to the exhibits in the arch itself. Costumed docents are stationed there to take tickets and provide information. To the right is a large gift shop where tickets may be purchased. There are benches along the wall on either side of the entrance doors.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Commemorates the arrival of Mormon (Latter Day Saints) pioneers in the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. Mormon tradition holds that when Brigham Young first gazed on the valley from this vicinity on July 24, 1847, he experienced a heavenly vision that led him to declare, “It is enough. This is the right place.” Inside the 450-acre park is the National Pony Express Monument with a replica Pony Express station, a dramatic Avard Fairbanks sculpture of a relay rider changing horses, and several interpretive wayside exhibits. Statuary Walk east of the Pony Express monument includes other sculptures and the 60-foot high This Is the Place Monument, with bronze figures of Brigham Young and other early church leaders.<br /> <br /> Around the monument base are <em>bas relief </em>depictions of significant figures in Utah history. Beyond the nearby visitor center is Heritage Village, a reconstructed village of original pioneer-era buildings where costumed docents and historical interpreters share history and demonstrate early crafts and trades. Young visitors can ride ponies and trains, make crafts, and pet farm animals here.<br /> <br /> This Is the Place Heritage Park, near the location where Brigham Young first surveyed the valley in July 1847, represents the Mormon arrival. But as the City of the Saints grew from a rustic frontier village to a bustling territorial capital, many California-bound travelers paused here for a layover to rest, re-supply, or spend the winter — or, as in the case of English adventurer Sir Richard Burton, to satisfy their curiosity about Brigham Young and the Mormons.

    "bodyText": "In late July of 1804, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark arrived in present-day Council Bluffs. The Western Historic Trails Center, located on the banks fo the Missouri River in Council Bluff, Iowa, details their journey from St. Louis to the Pacific. Known as the Loess Hills region, unique deposits of windswept loess soils left behind by the last Ice Age rise 200 feet above the plains along the river. <br /> <br /> The Western Historic Trails Center is the perfect place to spend an afternoon learning about history, enjoying a musical performance, or even just to stretch your legs. The building itself was designed and built by the National Parks Service as a center of exploration in 1997. Here, visitors have the opportunity to retrace the steps of pioneers who came after Lewis and Clark, walking not only the trail blazed by the two intrepid explorers but also the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, and the Mormon Trail.<br /> <br /> Exhibits include sculptures by Timothy Woodman, photos, maps, and quotes pertaining to the trails and America's history of Westward Expansion. Outdoor picnic areas offer a tranquil place to enjoy the sunshine and scenery. Walking and biking paths wind through 400 acres of prairie along the scenic Missouri River, offering a glimpse into what the two explorers and the Corps of Discovery observed more than 200 years ago. <br /> <br /> Admission is free. School and group tours are available, but require advance scheduling by calling the center at (712) 366-4900. Visitors are also encouraged to check the center's website and calendar for upcoming events at https://iowaculture.gov/history/sites/western-historic-trails-center. ",

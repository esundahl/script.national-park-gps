    "bodyText": "A.H. Anderson owned 1,000 acres along Washington’s Strait of Juan de Fuca, which he used as a fishing and hunting retreat. Olmsted Brothers partner James Frederick Dawson recommended a preservation and enhancement plan for the native vegetation, as well as a practice golf course and pools, but Anderson never requested the firm to draw any plans.<br /> <br /> While little was done at Anderson’s estate, it shows how much Olmsted Brothers, particularly John Charles Olmsted, appreciated the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest. In 1909, Anderson did consult with Olmsted Brothers on landscape improvements, with Dawson making a visit that summer. Dawson wrote that “Mr. Anderson’s house is beautifully located, nestled into the edge of the timber land and commanding fine views looking out across the sea.”<br /> <br /> Respecting the natural setting Dawson recommended “development in a modest way, such as properly arranging drives, court yards and walks, together with planting…of the native sort such as the Dogwood, wild roses and syringas [mock orange]…to strengthen the character of the present growth.” Known today as Graysmarsh Farm, it is used as a commercial berry farm and private hunting retreat, far more rustic than Anderson ever envisioned.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=2192,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157677334762037/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/03723\">Olmsted Online </a><br />  ",

    "bodyText": "The idea of preserving portions of Mount Desert Island to be made into a public park was first proposed by senior Olmsted Firm member Charles Eliot. After Eliot’s untimely death, his father and Harvard University President Charles W. Eliot worked to secure the land donations to honor his late son.<br /> <br /> In 1916, the year Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.’s Organic Act would be signed into law, land in Mount Desert Island was acquired by the federal government. From 1908 until this point, automobiles were banned on the island due to a disagreement between permanent residents and summer visitors.<br /> <br /> Summer resident John D. Rockefeller, seeing the inevitability of automobile use in the park with increased visitors, would help finance a loop road that would keep automobiles off the carriage roads and away from the park’s interior.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers joined the park in 1929 to recommend routes, locate scenic overlooks, and prepare engineering details for the loop road, with Olmsted Jr. taking the lead on this project. The National Park Loop Road Olmsted Brothers created provides automobiles access to numerous trails and attractions, like glacial lakes and Cadillac Mountain, the highest peak on the Atlantic Coast.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit: <br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=1058,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157665835628973/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/09138\">Olmsted Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/acadia-national-park\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/acad/index.htm\">Acadia National Park</a>",

    "bodyText": "To celebrate and publicize the development of the Pacific Northwest, it was decided a world’s fair would be held in Seattle. In October 1906, the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition Company hired John Charles Olmsted to design the grounds, believing he would create a breathtaking design like his father had at the World’s Columbian Exposition.<br /> <br /> John Charles faced two major constraints in his work for the exposition. The first was that the budget, which would cover the clearing of 200 acres, grading slopes, and planting grounds was only $350,000, which was a tough deal considering his father Olmsted had gotten over triple that amount to design his world’s fair sixteen years earlier. The second constraint was that once the fair was finished, the buildings and grounds would be given to the University of Washington.<br /> <br /> John Charles developed a plan that would serve both the needs of the fair and of the university. As opposed to other world’s fairs of the time, the design of the A-Y-P relied on the natural scenery, including nearby Mount Rainier, Lake Washington, and Lake Union, as focal points to lay out buildings, roads, and paths around.<br /> <br /> Incorporating the surrounding landscape, adapting to the topography of a site, using native vegetation and water features are all characteristic of Olmsted designs. John Charles' design of the A-Y-P would be dubbed the “Rainier Vista” and is the central core of the University of Washington campus, still cherished today.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=4459,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157647001708047/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/02739\">Olmsted Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/\">University of Washington</a>",

    "bodyText": "For fifty years, the Olmsted firm was involved in the improvement of Amherst College, starting with Frederick Law Olmsted Sr., and continuing to his sons John Charles and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. in 1870, Olmsted Sr. created the firm's first plans to improve the grounds, partnering with Calvert Vaux. To manage a growing campus population, Olmsted suggested school buildings be centered around a common green, like he had done in many towns and city designs and be connected via a circular path system.<br /> <br /> In the 1890s, with his father’s health beginning to fail, John Charles took over at Amherst, with the help of firm member Herbert Kellaway. During this time John Charles also collaborated with the architecture firm McKim, Mead, and White for the location of a new science building. By 1906 it was time for Olmsted Jr. to take over work at Amherst, with the college’s trustees creating the Commission for Improvements to Amherst College, with Olmsted Jr., McKim, Mead, Daniel Burnham and sculptor Augusts Saint-Gaudens all being appointed.<br /> <br /> That year the group submitted a report, making recommendations to acquire more land for the growing student population, while still following Olmsted Sr.’s original plan. In 1916, Amherst Trustees agreed to continue to honor Olmsted Sr. 's plan, with Olmsted Jr. and firm member Edward Whiting overseeing development until 1925. Today, Amherst College, at one thousand acres, retains much of Olmsted Sr.’s original design concept.<br /> <br /> For more information and resource, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=2798,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157651957810521/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/00605\">Olmsted Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/amherst-college\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.amherst.edu/\">Amherst College</a>",

    "bodyText": "Located on the Annapolis Peninsula bordering the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, by 1926 Annapolis Roads was to be a resort community designed by Olmsted Brothers. John Charles and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. had already designed the nearby communities of Wardour and Gibson Island.<br /> <br /> In April of 1926, Olmsted Brothers had already begun work on grading plans for the main road. The firm’s naturalistic design for Annapolis Roads sought to “suggest and imply leisure, contemplativeness, and happy tranquility”.<br /> <br /> Like in many Olmsted communities, they used deed restrictions to aid in the protection of their designs. Olmsted Brothers also expected homeowners to plant trees in their front yards, providing some shade to the houses.<br /> <br /> To create interesting views, Olmsted Brothers mixed colors and textures by implementing a clump of cedars at lot lines, and clumps of deciduous trees between the proposed curbs and sidewalks. This design provided both isolation for families and opportunities to join together as a community and share amenities.<br /> <br /> For more information and resouces, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=5436,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157675751413314/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/07591\">Olmsted Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://annapolisroads.net/\">Annapolis Roads</a>",

Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army and civil engineer Montgomery Meigs was tasked with developing Arlington National Cemetery.<br /> <br /> Meigs, who respected Frederick Law Olmsted, wrote him a letter five years after the end of the Civil War, asking his advice for landscaping national cemeteries. In an August 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1870 letter to Meigs, Olmsted said the design “should be studiously simple… [with] the main object…to establish permanent dignity and tranquility”.<br /> <br /> Meigs would resist Olmsted’s advice for a simple design, instead choosing to lay out the cemetery according to Victorian and Gilded age style standards. Olmsted also suggested “a sacred grove- sacredness being expressed in the enclosing wall and in the perfect tranquility of the trees within.”<br /> <br /> Meigs chose to take Olmsted’s advice, but not at Arlington. Instead, an area resembling sacred groves, graced by trees, and enclosed by walls would take form at Danville National Cemetery. From Olmsted’s advice, Meigs used trees indigenous to the cemetery’s region.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsF.IDC,SPECIFIC=377,DATABASE=FILEUNIT,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157651896315646/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/00184\">Olmsted Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/arlington-national-cemetery\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/#/\">Arlington National Cemetery</a>",

William Aspinwall entirely owned the top of the hill while Boston University owned the land surrounding the hill. In 1857, a civil engineer created a plan for Aspinwall Hill subdivision, however it was never carried out. It was Aspinwall himself who decided to subdivide most of his land, and commissioned Olmsted to do it.<br /> <br /> It was Aspinwall himself who decided to subdivide most of his land, and commissioned Olmsted to do it. At the time Aspinwall and Boston University weren’t on the best of terms, with BU unsure if it wanted to partner with Aspinwall. Regardless, Olmsted’s original plan was a joint development, ignoring all property boundaries.<br /> <br /> Using a topographical survey to base his whole plan off, Olmsted created a spiral road system for the community. However, at Aspinwall Hill, Olmsted never made it past the study stage. There was a disagreement between landowners and Olmsted, leading to his services being suspended. Despite his plan not being implemented, the current design of Aspinwall Hill is a reworking of Olmsted’s original design. The most obvious left-overs from Olmsted’s design are the S-shaped roads, most visible on Addington Road and Colbourne Crescent.<br /> <br /> Olmsted was always thinking about how his landscapes would be enjoyed in the future, so he imagined the hill and how he would arrange homes on it, and what views would result from their placement. While many during Olmsted’s time complained of his curving roads, it created rhythm between open and intimate views, fostering a country feel.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=155,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157673230512554/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/00622\">Olmsted Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://brookline.com/aspinwall-hill/\">Brookline</a>",

    "bodyText": "In 1898, John Charles Olmsted undertook his first solo project for his family’s firm, the design of Audubon Park. Olmsted was tasked to transform the swampy, divided flatland into greenspace. Olmsted’s preliminary plan conformed to the topography, grading and drainage of the site.<br /> <br /> Like his father, Olmsted ensured any architecture in the park wouldn’t dominate, and expressed the idea that any structures in the park be built to conform to the history and traditions of the city. Work on Audubon park echoed the earlier work done at the Back Bay Fens: unifying a site and solving drainage problems by developing a varied watercourse.<br /> <br /> In the northern section of Audubon Park, Olmsted used fill from the stream bed to grade the flat site into a rolling meadow, which became part of a golf course. Olmsted also included numerous picnic shelters and diverse plantings along the stream banks and curving paths.<br /> <br /> Today, the 340-acres of Audubon Park follows much of Olmsted’s plan, though his planting recommendations were not implemented. A zoo was developed in the 1930s, with design advice from Olmsted Brothers.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=4384,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157651828557080/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/02001\">Olmsted Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/audubon-park\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://audubonnatureinstitute.org/audubon-park\">Audubon Parks</a>",

In the 1930s, he partnered with Alexander Mackenzie, a golf course architect, to create Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia.<br /> <br /> Marquis’ designs had already established a reputation for his notable placement of ponds in poorly drained areas, emphasizing a design that balanced utility with aesthetic values. At Augusta, Marquis was responsible for the landscaping of the grounds, as well as lots for housing.<br /> <br /> In his October 1932 Report on his trip to Augusta, Marquis wrote that he “studied Dr. MacKenzie's pitch and putt course on the ground and concluded very definitely that the course as planned is impracticable, as it would require cutting out too much of the wooded area and the playing of shots across the service road would be dangerous.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=5539,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157644264817951/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/09275\">Olmsted Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/augusta-national-golf-club\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a>",

Significantly filled and altered during the 20th century, the Back Bay Fens now provides a variety of recreational opportunities, from gardening, to concerts, to sports. The Fens is surrounded by some of Boston's major cultural and educational institutions. <br /> <br /> The first step in Olmsted’s design process was analyzing the site, its features, conditions, and potential challenges. Olmsted accepted the challenge, for he saw an opportunity to create <em>“scenery of a winding, brackish creek within wooded banks...numerous points and coves softened in their outlines by thickets with much delicate variety in tone and color...picturesque elements emphasized by a few necessary structures, strong but unobtrusive”.</em> The Back Bay Fens we enjoy today are thanks to Olmsted’s ability to combine sanitary engineering and landscape architecture to provide for the needs of a dense community.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=2792,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157645484755902/\">Flickr </a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/00916\">Olmsted Online</a> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/back-bay-fens\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.emeraldnecklace.org/park-overview/back-bay-fens/\">Emerald Necklace Conservancy </a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmsted.org/olmsteds-explanation-of-the-back-bay-fens/\">Olmsted Network</a>",

Spanish Mission style has strong Native American and South American influences, with stone exteriors and red tile roofs.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b10bb24f-7d00-4a89-a2ed-7d2c48a8f148}{169}\" paraid=\"236425422\">For the grounds of the Exposition, the Building and Grounds Committee constantly changed their wants and expectations, forcing Olmsted Brothers to restructure their designs. The final straws that broke the brothers’ back was the recommendation that, not only should the entire location of the site be changed, but that a railroad should cut directly through it.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b10bb24f-7d00-4a89-a2ed-7d2c48a8f148}{173}\" paraid=\"746366132\">Olmsted Brothers were unwaveringly opposed to both changes, especially the addition of a railroad, because this would eliminate all possibilities of creating a semi-rural respite from a city. The brothers had learned well from their father, as Olmsted Sr. believed that was the main function of a large urban park.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b10bb24f-7d00-4a89-a2ed-7d2c48a8f148}{177}\" paraid=\"1559987098\">On September 2nd, 1911, a telegram arrived in San Diego from Olmsted Brothers in Brookline, stating that “our professional responsibility as park designers will not permit us to assist in ruining Balboa Park.” Ouch. It appears San Diego’s leaders were so focused on the Exposition and the potential real estate development that would follow, that they couldn’t envision a time when people would desperately need open space.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b10bb24f-7d00-4a89-a2ed-7d2c48a8f148}{185}\" paraid=\"1412068363\">Despite Olmsted Brothers’ self-removal from the Exposition and Balboa Park, years after the project’s completion, people still flock to Balboa Park seeking the same things Olmsted Brothers wanted to prioritize: open green space, fresh air, respite in nature, relaxation.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=2076,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157662633564074/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/04051\">Olmsted Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/balboa-park\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.sandiego.org/\">San Diego</a></p>",

Discussions arose about what should be developed on the land; with nearby steep ravines, it would be unsuitable for agricultural use.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers were solicited to study the land and determine what should be developed on it. Firm member George Gibbs Jr. visited the site in 1915, submitting his concept for a suburban development months later. Commanding views of the nearby lake helped guide the plan, with more valuable lots being sited at higher points on the hill. Plantings were carefully curated to frame picturesque views.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers continued to improve their design over several years, with John Charles and Frederick Jr. weighing in on various aspects. The firm designed Barton Shore Drive, parallel to Barton North Drive, which would \"undoubtedly prove the most attractive when built as it will follow com­paratively near the water and will command an uninterrupted view over the pool.\"<br /> <br /> Much of the development of Barton Hills was realized in the mid-1920s, when the first holes of the local golf course and country club were opened. Despite rapid development, Olmsted Brothers carefully planned the community to preserve and emphasize the land’s natural forms.",

The land was acquired by and named for John G. Baxter, Louisville’s mayor at the time. In 1887, a movement was started by prominent men of the area to develop three large suburban parks for Louisville.<br /> <br /> Olmsted was commissioned to design Baxter Square in 1891 though plans weren’t completed until 1901, well after Olmsted’s retirement. Olmsted Brothers took over at Baxter Square and proposed a planting plan to the city. Today, Baxter Square is still surrounded by its original stone wall and contains the original park shelter and mature vegetation. Looking at other Louisville parks, Baxter Square is a bit more formal, with simple, curved, shaded walkways with benches going around the perimeter.",

    "bodyText": "Between Audubon and Cleveland Circle, the Brookline section of Beacon Street runs, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted in the mid-1880s as a centerpiece for the urban development of the town. Olmsted’s design, which remains largely intact today, included a landscaped median for streetcar tracks, broad sidewalks and allées of trees.<br /> <br /> Of all of Olmsted’s early plans, “the Great Beacon Street Widening” was perhaps the one that most radically changed Brookline for the better. In 1886, Brookline Park Commissioners asked Olmsted to draw plans for widening Beacon Street to a two-hundred-foot avenue.<br /> <br /> As the fashionable Back Bay residential district expanded, widening Beacon Street was a logical extension. Olmsted was influenced by contemporary city planning in France; like the boulevards in Paris, Beacon Street was both the principal way to travel the district, and an avenue for pleasure driving, riding, cycling, and walking.",

    "bodyText": "The Franklin Park Zoo was opened in 1912. When the zoo opened, its first official exhibits were the aviary and the bear dens, designed in 1911 by Arthur Schurcliff. Holding a variety of bear species, purchased from Germany and Yellowstone National Park, as well as a badger held in a nearby cage, the bear dens attracted thousands of people to the zoo everyday.<br /> <br /> On October 3, 1912, at least 10,000 people came to the zoo and visited the bear dens, bringing in a total of $10,000, a very large amount in the early 1900s. The dens became so popular that when funding became scarce, Boston schoolchildren started a campaign to collect pennies to keep them open.<br /> <br /> In 1954, due to the growing popularity of many other local and national zoos and attractions, the lack of safety, and the large distance between the bear dens and the rest of the zoo, Schurcliff suggested closing the bear dens. The zoo officially closed in 1960 but has since been reopened as a new attraction for future generations. Over the years of abandonment, the Old Bear Dens have become overgrown and vandalized. In 2014, part of the rusting iron work went missing from the dens and was presumed to have been stolen for scrap metal use.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "In 1881, wealthy cattle trader James Beardsley gifted 100 acres along the Pequonnock River in northeast Bridgeport, Connecticut to be designated as a public park. Frederick Law Olmsted and John Charles Olmsted assessed the scenic advantages of the large trees, hilltop views, boulder outcroppings, and sloping meadows of the site, and suggested that even more land should be donated.<br /> <br /> In their 1884 report, the two Olmsted’s suggested thinning woodlands into open glades for a parklike character, while also encouraging native shrub growth. Also suggested in the report was enhancing hillside areas for distant views while utilizing natural boulders to create a vine-covered courtyard for carriages. Aware that not everyone had a carriage, the plan for Beardsley Park included a railroad station for public access.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s vision for Beardsley Park is remarkably similar to what you would see today, despite the transformation of many meadows into ball fields and other athletic facilities, as well as the addition of a zoo in 1922. Looking at Beardsley Park, the Olmsted’s believed that \"It is just the place for a day's outing. It is a better picnic ground than any possessed by the city of New York after spending twenty million dollars for parks.\"",

    "bodyText": "In 1881, Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. was commissioned by the city of Detroit to transform a small island in the Detroit River into a park. Initially, Olmsted wasn’t too happy with the site selected, stating “conditions could not be more favorable to the breeding and nursing of mosquitoes…[In] the pools…I found discolored, and covered by bubbles and a green scum; and there was a putrescent organic matter on their borders…”<br /> <br /> Olmsted was contracted by the Detroit for three years, being paid $7,000 for his design. The challenge at Belle Isle was creating a design that would allow for public gathering and recreation while maintaining the natural state of the island. The solution was to place a ferry dock at one end, concentrating all the public facilities at the end. This allowed Olmsted to leave the rest of the island in as natural a state as possible.<br /> <br /> To remedy the marshy land forming on the low-lying island, Olmsted proposed a system of underground pipes that would lead into canals, which had a dual purpose of being used for pleasure boating. From the start, Olmsted put more investment into Belle Isle than many Detroiters, even waving his normal visitation fees. He hoped to capitalize on the island’s existing wooded area to serve as the park’s central attraction.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Olmsted’s design was deemed too elaborate and, due to disagreements on funds with Detroit’s Park Board, Olmsted resigned from the project and Belle Isle was never carried out to its full extent. Elements of Olmsted’s plan were carried out, like wooded areas and the ferry landing.<br /> <br /> All of Olmsted’s park designs include three zones- a formal zone, and active zone, and a natural zone, present in Belle Isle Park. The formal zone includes Scott Fountain and Sunset Point, the active zone encompasses cultural attractions and athletic fields, while the natural zone is dominated by the wetland forest.",

In addition to a shelter and gravel playground, thick plantings screen Bennett Park from the streets, concealing from the visitor that the park is extremely small.",

Olmsted had already done several projects for the Vanderbilt family when George approached him in 1888, asking for advice on the 120,000 acres of North Carolina property he’d just purchased.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{25}\" paraid=\"1441380893\">At the age of 66, Olmsted made his first journey to Asheville to visit George Vanderbilt, then 25 and the recent inheritor of $13 million (around $350 million in 2020). Unlike many projects Olmsted had worked on, Vanderbilt had the money to carry out his designs, and he knew exactly what he wanted: an English manor style estate.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{29}\" paraid=\"951711357\">“The soil seems to be generally poor. The woods are miserable, all the good trees having again and again been culled out and only the runts left. The topography is most unsuitable for anything that can properly be called park scenery. My advice would be to make a small park in which you look from your house, make a small pleasure ground and gardens; farm your river bottoms chiefly and…keep and fatten livestock with a view to manure and…make the rest a forest”</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{33}\" paraid=\"1046770178\">-Frederick Law Olmsted in his letter of recommendation to George Washington Vanderbilt</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{37}\" paraid=\"1982123716\">Olmsted was able to convince Vanderbilt that the land would be better suited with a grand garden area close to the house and turn the remaining acres into a forest, providing the home with spectacular views.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{41}\" paraid=\"44035524\">In Olmsted’s final project, he built a nine-mile arboretum that went from the house, to the French Broad River, and back up to the house again. He also planned the entry way to the Biltmore as a pleasure drive, passing through a “natural forest”. That natural forest contained clusters of trees that purposely blocked the view so that visitors would be shocked when the curtain of the forest was pulled back and you could finally see the house.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{45}\" paraid=\"800903396\">Despite ill health and the pressure of the Chicago World’s Fair, Olmsted traveled by rail several times to Asheville, ensuring his designs were being followed. He felt the transitions between formal and natural gardens were important to differentiate, as was the use of native plants, and a balance of small trees and large shrubs.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{49}\" paraid=\"854138470\">Following Olmsted’s suggestions, Vanderbilt hired trained forester Gifford Pinchot to develop a management plan for his land. Together with Olmsted, they founded America’s first large scale managed forest, and the cradle of U.S. forestry.</p>",

Published a year later, the report called for parks within easy walking distance for all residents, regardless of socio-economic or racial group, that would serve both active and passive recreation.<br /> <br /> From his father, Olmsted Jr. learned how important parks were to the spiritual refreshment and physical welfare of stressed city dwellers. Prior to Olmsted Brothers involvement at Birmingham, the city had only 600 acres of park to serve 200,000 citizens, a wholly inadequate number.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers’ report recommended the creation of beauty spots and athletic fields, and the reservation of vast lands in undeveloped areas critical for the protection of the area’s domestic water supply. The plan also included building parkways along ridge tops to offer the community impressive outlooks, as well as offering recreational amenities for the thriving industrial center Birmingham had become.<br /> <br /> Wanting immediate park improvements, from 1924 to 1926, Olmsted Brothers would design plans for three parks as well as reviewing plans for others. At the core of Olmsted Brothers philosophy in Birmingham was a resource-based plan that would be carefully coordinated with engineers in order to lay out beautiful and usable open spaces.",

    "bodyText": "After the Civil War, James Blaine served as Secretary of State under three United States Presidents and became a dominant figure in American politics. After his death and burial at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C., Blaine, and his wife, who were highly revered by the people of Maine, were reinterred at Blaine Memorial Park.<br /> <br /> In 1920, Carl Rust Parker of Olmsted Brothers was asked to design the three-acre site situated just one mile from Blaine’s home, and was an area he and his wife enjoyed for strolling and meditation.<br /> <br /> Parker, who instead of college began work at Olmsted Brothers in 1901, served as a draftsman, planting designer and construction supervisor. Though Parker would attempt to start his own firm in Maine around 1910, he would return after World War One in 1919. In 1950, Parker became a partner of Olmsted Brothers, where he remained until his retirement in 1961.<br /> <br /> For Blaine Memorial, Parker’s plan included almost 2,800 plants in a horseshoe-shaped design with elms and two gravestones on the border. Parker also included a stone terrace overlooking the picturesque cemetery, accessible by granite steps going gently down the hillside. While many of the plantings have died, most of the design features remain.",

Manning created an interconnected series of parks in the Greater Boston Area that was known as the Metropolitan Parks System. That same year Eliot would acquire Blue Hills Reservation, believing the landscape's wildness would counter Boston’s intentionally manicured parks of the time, like the Public Garden.<br /> <br /> After the new Metropolitan Park Commission purchased the land, one Commissioner declared that “there will be no attempt made to beautify them. We shall not even own a lawn mower.” Eliot envisioned carriage riders enjoying the paths of Blue Hills, coming around corners to reveal scenic vistas. At 125 miles of trails, traversing forests, meadows, swamps, pond edges, and marshes, Eliot achieved his goal of “affording widespread panoramic prospects in all directions.”",

One of the first of Louisville’s parks, Boone Square, is also one of the smallest in the city. Nestled in the Portland neighborhood, Boone Square only takes up one city block, about four acres.<br /> <br /> Due to its small size, Boone Square is truly a neighborhood park, with space for recreation, picnic areas, and shaded walks, all still largely in place today. By the 1930s, Boone Square had grown in popularity, with a wading pool and volleyball courts being added. After WWII, Boone Square was left alone until the 1970s, when the park was updated to include basketball courts, playgrounds, fountains, and a picnic shelter. Surrounding Boone Square is a low stone wall with entrances at each of the park’s four corners.",

Richardson and Charles Sprague Sargent. Olmsted had already worked closely with Sargent on the design of the Arnold Arboretum, and was a good friend of Richardson’s. Another connection was that Sargent had been serving on the Board of Trustees for B&A since the 1860s and had been a Harvard classmate of Richardson.<br /> <br /> Before Richardson’s death at the age of forty-seven, he had completed nine stations. His successor firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge completed another twenty-three. Of the Olmsted/Richardson collaboration, Wellesley Farms is their best surviving example.

    "bodyText": "In 1903, a group of philanthropic citizens joined forces to promote “the improvement of Boulder in health, growth, cleanliness, prosperity and attractiveness.” The group they formed was known as the Boulder City Improvement Association (BCIA) and four years after their founding, they sought the services of Olmsted Brothers.<br /> <br /> Writing to Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., the BCIA wrote that “we are a small but ambitious little town…situated 30 miles northeast of Denver. We want advice, and the best obtainable, as to how to improve our city as to Parks, Boulevards and general plans for Civic betterment.”<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers’ first prepared report for the city, The Improvement of Boulder, Colorado, came out November 1908, six months after Olmsted Jr. had made a brief visit to the area. The BCIA received thirty pages of dense text including an illustrated map. The report covered details like street trees and light, as well as the broad idea of limiting manufacturing in the city and the use of fine homes.<br /> <br /> Besides work on the landscape, Olmsted Jr. also addressed the progressive era themes of a good government, the appropriate use of police power, and taxation to support the development of infrastructure. Olmsted Brothers’ plan also included planting plans for public schools, work on sewers and drainage systems, and a grand scheme for park improvements that would stretch over eighty city blocks, with work continuing into the 1920s.",

    "bodyText": "During the Civil War, the area that would become Branch Brook Park was serving as an encampment for several regiments as they prepared to fight in some of the most important battles of the war, from Antietam to Appomattox.<br /> <br /> In 1867 the war was over and New Jersey State legislature established the Newark Park Commission to locate grounds for a city park. The Commission would ask Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. to visit Newark and recommend the best possible site for park; he choose the Branch Brook area.<br /> <br /> While Olmsted Sr, along with Calvert Vaux, would envision Branch Brook Park as the Central Park of Newark, it was Olmsted Brothers who would take over the project in 1898, and create a plan for the park.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers faced challenges immediately, for in the years since Olmsted Sr.’s original recommendation, another landscaping firm had taken over the design, opting for a more gardenesque style with numerous architectural elements, something Olmsted hated and taught his sons to as well.<br /> <br /> Adapting to these changes, Olmsted Brothers cleverly designed a plan splitting Branch Brook Park into three divisions. The Southern division would incorporate the elaborate gardenesque elements brought in by the previous firm. The Middle division would serve as a transitional zone, mixing exotic plantings with those more natural to the area. The Northern division was the largest, and most naturalistic of the divisions.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers took some time off from Branch Brook Park but were called in again in 1927 to lay out the two thousand Japanese flowering cherry trees donated to site to rival the trees in Washington, D.C. Laying the trees out on tiered slopes along the river ensured that none would dominate the other, but flow together in harmony.",

Immediately, Canby sought the advice of Olmsted.<br /> <br /> Olmsted took a trip to Wilmington where he viewed several possible sites for the new park. Upon seeing Brandywine Creek, he enthusiastically recommended the land along the water be obtained for a park.<br /> <br /> With Olmsted as his teacher, Canby made sure to embrace and enhance the natural beauty of the land. Also, from Olmsted, Canby blended roads, pathways, and walkways to make them inconspicuous within the park landscape.<br /> <br /> Not only is Brandywine Park the largest urban park in Delaware, it was the first park established in Wilmington, fulfilling the growing city’s need for public recreational space.<br /> <br />  ",

On January 31<sup>st</sup>, 1894, Olmsted Brothers wrote to Cooper stating that they would be making a preliminary visit to the site, to better work out a plan as well as determine what their fees would be. By March, John Charles Olmsted had made his visit to Taunton, and they began planning. In June they informed Cooper that planting of the grounds would begin that Fall.<br /> <br /> By November of that year, Taunton Commissioners had made changes to the Olmsted plan, including hiring their own nursery for the plants. Olmsted Brothers were not made aware of this change until Cooper wrote to inform them. On November 24<sup>th</sup>, Olmsted Brothers wrote to Cooper stating “If you will send us a copy of the contract and specifications as signed by the Commissioners and the nursery company, we will, if the Commissioners desire it, visit the ground in order to see whether, in our opinion, the contractor is living up to the contract. If we are not asked to do so, we do not see that we are in any way connected with the work now going on,”. Planting at Bristol County Superior Courthouse followed Olmsted Brothers plans, and the Olmsted’s formed a close bond with Cooper, even helping landscape Cooper’s own property the following year.",

Olmsted Brothers were tasked with designing the grounds to be as artistic, memorable, and unique as his resort, The Broadmoor.<br /> <br /> John Charles Olmsted took lead on the design, with Edward Clark Whiting and James Frederick Dawson assisting. Utilizing native grass, flowers, and trees, the team designed elaborate gardens and walkways that both beautified and unified the hotel to its surroundings. Penrose spared no expenses, acquiring fountains and other details from New York.<br /> <br /> While focused on the landscape, Olmsted Brothers also designed some architectural features, including metal lamp posts and terra-cotta vases still featured around the lake. For plantings around the site, Olmsted Brothers used 800 plants in the front garden alone, with pansies being the most planted flower at 828.",

Of his plans for the community, only Brookland Parkway was realized. Originally named Brookland Park Boulevard, Olmsted planned it as the spine for the Richmond suburb, flowing diagonally through the city grid, creating a scenic centerpiece for the neighborhood.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s earliest plans for Brookland Parkway included a broad, tree-lined parkway with irregular curves that would be large enough to accommodate a central median for streetcars that wouldn’t disrupt horse-drawn carriage traffic. In the end, the streetcars were never implemented, and the horse-drawn carriage roads would be transformed for vehicular traffic.",

    "bodyText": "At the request of Bryn Mawr’s second president, Martha Carey Thomas, Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. made his first visit to the college in the spring of 1895. Olmsted’s one-time partner, Calvert Vaux, had developed the campus’ original plan 11 years earlier, but Thomas saw it as outdated, with populations and buildings growing in the years since.<br /> <br /> In association with the campus architects, Olmsted began working out a general plan for the campus. The focus of Olmsted’s plan would be to place buildings around the perimeter of the property, allowing for open space in the center intended for outdoor activities and attractive, unobstructed views.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s ability to work closely with architects on the placement of larger buildings, such as the library, ensured his landscapes would compliment those structures. One of Olmsted’s final additions to the campus was a quarter mile oval bike path, lined with trees and looking in on that open recreational space.<br /> <br /> After Olmsted’s death, the firm would be inactive at Bryn Mawr until April of 1908, when Thomas again called on an Olmsted to help update an outdated plan. John Charles Olmsted would take over work at Bryn Mawr after his fathers’ death, and during his time working on the project, he received many letters from Thomas.<br /> <br /> While John Charles gets much of the credit for continuing the Olmsted work at Bryn Mawr, it was Martha Carey Thomas who was the driving force behind their involvement. In a letter to John Charles in November of 1908, she writes “of course we cannot afford to do much in any one year, but what we do ought to be done right”. Spoken like someone who has spent a good amount of time around the Olmsted’s.<br /> <br /> Thomas was involved in every detail of planning and execution for Bryn Mawr, a place she truly cared about and wanted to see succeeded. She even sketched a version of Olmsted’s 1897 plan that could be reproduced inexpensively, raising funds to complete the project.",

    "bodyText": "Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux prepared the planting plan for the Buffalo State Asylum in 1874, while Henry Hobson Richardson produced the architecture plans. Paths and spaces around the asylum were arranged according to the Kirkbride Plan.<br /> <br /> Dr. Tomas S. Kirkbride was superintendent of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane and created a plan to incorporate the design of the asylum into patient treatment plans. The Kirkbride plan included sufficient space for exercise, leisure activities, and outdoor work, all critical aspects of mental health treatment.<br /> <br /> The front side of the Buffalo State Asylum grounds were a park-like open greenspace, surrounded by winding walkways. Olmsted and Vaux supported Kirkbride’s belief that a park-like setting with spacious and tree-shaded lawns would have a therapeutic and calming effect.<br /> <br /> Today, many fragments of the Olmsted landscape remain at the Buffalo State Asylum, including sections of walks and drives, as well as some original plantings. Between the main Richardson building and Forest Avenue is the portion of the landscape most intact.<br /> <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "In 1853 Reverend Horace Bushnell, motivated to improve access to nature for the city’s poor working class, persuaded the Hartford City Council to acquire the land to create a park. In November of that year the Council voted unanimously to spend $105,000 to buy the land that would become Bushnell Park. When Hartford voters approved the spending, it was the first time in the United States that a municipal park was to be conceived, built, and paid for by citizens through a popular vote.<br /> <br /> Frederick Law Olmsted would have been a logical choice on who to lead this project, with his local roots and a lifelong friendship with Bushnell. Olmsted would recommend Jacob Weidenmann, a Swiss-born landscape architect and botanist, to design and build the park. Weidenmann’s 1861 plan had a distinctive natural style, featuring smoothly sculpted contours and graceful paths, as well as informal clusters of evergreen and deciduous trees.<br /> <br /> After Weidenmann’s death, John Charles Olmsted took over advising at Bushnell Park, where he improved drives, terrace alignment, plantings, and various monument placement. After John Charles’ death, Olmsted Brothers continued working on Bushnell Park, with Edward Whiting and James Dawson taking over. Olmsted Brothers would continue work at Bushnell Park until 1947, where they would address regrading the site so a pond could be constructed.",

Firm partner Charles Eliot prepared the preliminary plan for the park on land at the center of the city. Eliot’s plan included enlarging the 6-acre pond and creating an expansive meadow leading up to the edge of the water. Eliot also suggested space for tennis and ball games, a children’s playground, and a carriage road around the site that would limit vehicular traffic within the park.<br /> <br /> Both lawn and pond expansion were partially implemented on Buttonwood Park’s 97-acres of land. With its deciduous tree, the open lawn serves as a gathering space while the pond allows for boating, swimming, fishing, and ice skating. While the baseball diamond was added in 1896 and tennis courts in 1909, various other facilities were placed in the park, like a zoo, which submerged the natural setting with buildings.",

John Charles also noted that Black “does not want to be secluded by hedges or plantations or walls or parapets and wants everyone to enjoy views over the place”, so he recommended street trees that wouldn’t grow too tall.<br /> <br /> John Charles faced very little challenges while working on the estate, because he and Black had similar ideas in keeping the landscape open but informal. While plantings have changed over the century since John Charles’ involvement, defining landscape features like the graceful driveway, hidden garage, retaining walls, open lawn and unobstructed views still remain.",

    "bodyText": "Frederick Law Olmsted visited Trenton, New Jersey in April of 1891 to view the proposed site for Cadwalader Park, determine if it was suitable and take the job, all of which he did. It would become Olmsted Sr.’s last great urban park. Olmsted’s plan for Cadwalader Park relied on the creation of long open views and rolling meadows that contrasted with the more densely planted edges of the park.<br /> <br /> Design proceeded rapidly with John Charles Olmsted assisting with supervision of the park. The first changes at Cadwalader involved a looping carriage drive, pathways, and plantings. The mansion that had been on the property, the focal point of the design, was repurposed into a refectory. A vine covered terrace and concert grove complemented the refectory, providing outlooks to the lawn beyond.<br /> <br /> Park progress continued to follow the broad outlines put in place by Olmsted’s plan, however, monuments and zoo enclosures were placed into the pastoral landscape against the firm’s recommendations. By 1892, political changes in Trenton resulted in decreased support for the parks, ending Frederick Law Olmsted Sr.’s work on Cadwalader Park.",

    "bodyText": "In the late 1920s, after a fire had devastated a popular summer resort, a group of Camden, Maine patrons purchased the empty half-acre site and hired Olmsted Brothers to design a green for the village. Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. would be the firm member tasked with leading this project.<br /> <br /> The patrons of Camden requested a simple, unadorned village green that would complement the land's awkward topography and lack of trees. Olmsted Jr. recommended the re-grading of the site, which would allow for a larger area of lawn that would be visible from downtown Camden. Trees and shrubs of various heights were also planted to shelter the green from neighboring buildings.<br /> <br /> What began with just a wooden fence evolved into rough granite posts with heavy chains, which are still present today. While Camden followed a majority of Olmsted Jr.’s plan, they did alter some of his recommended plantings. The people of Camden must have been pleased with the Olmsted Firm’s work, because twenty years later Camden once again hired Olmsted Brothers, this time to design a memorial flagpole to honor World War II soldiers.",

The Committee, which would chart the course for all war-related construction that would follow, was joined by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.</p> <p paraeid=\"{43bdbc95-6ab5-4663-a823-b0feaa7d5b20}{182}\" paraid=\"888407791\">The Committee’s main responsibility was selecting sites, plans, and contractors to erect training facilities for the U.S. military. With the help of civilian engineers recruited by Olmsted, site selection boards made rapid progress in finding appropriate sites for training facilitates</p> <p paraeid=\"{43bdbc95-6ab5-4663-a823-b0feaa7d5b20}{188}\" paraid=\"754591691\">The Committee used cost-plus contracts, where contractors would be paid in full for all expenses, plus additional payments to allow for profit. A disagreement arose in the Committee, with some arguing that cost-plus contracts would open the doors for inefficiency and fraud.</p> <p paraeid=\"{43bdbc95-6ab5-4663-a823-b0feaa7d5b20}{194}\" paraid=\"1049809381\">Jr. told the Committee during the Spring of 1917 that “on the whole, the wise thing to do in the case of the cantonment work with its extraordinary urgency” would be to implement cost-plus contracts. Those cost-plus contracts would require $10,000,000 to be spent in the first three months at Camp Blanding, a new training facility in Florida.</p> <p paraeid=\"{43bdbc95-6ab5-4663-a823-b0feaa7d5b20}{200}\" paraid=\"1855001951\">Camp Blanding would be such a big undertaking, the Committee was scared to put anybody on the job except large, well-known contractors. A naturally wooded and swampy area, contractors were first alarmed by the area’s poor topography.</p> <p paraeid=\"{43bdbc95-6ab5-4663-a823-b0feaa7d5b20}{206}\" paraid=\"27371010\">As construction began, heavy Florida rains turned unfinished roads into seas of muck, and a site with naturally poor drainage like Camp Blanding suffered. The first military groups trained at Camp Blanding faced the similar conditions Union soldiers had endured during the Civil War, with lack of proper restroom facilities. Like his father before him, Olmsted Jr. worked to eradicate these problems.</p>",

Preservation of “the irreplaceable and unvalued domains of the past” was an overarching design principle.<br /> <br /> The firm also ensured other historically significant features were preserved, including an 18<sup>th</sup> century bridge and the configuration of the main road. By preserving the land, they were able to offer wide views of the mountains.<br /> <br /> This 92-acre community would be worked on between 1928 and 1934, and Olmsted Brothers would produce over eighty drawings and plans to ensure the area stayed true to its origins.",

An air of mystery is created by a hillock in the center of the Carriage Turn, planted with a Canadian Hemlock, creepers, and vines. The Carriage Turn is a miniature version of Olmsted's larger parks, which often feature formal gates, followed by a promenade leading to a more rustic scenery.</p> <p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">When Olmsted purchased the property, the Clark family's driveway was linear, leading through what is now the South Lawn to a barn on the southwest corner of the property. To create a more practical, beautiful landscape, Olmsted moved the barn closer to the farmhouse, removed the old driveway, and built the Carriage Turn.</p> <p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">Horse-drawn carriages could enter and exit through the Carriage Turn without having to back up, dropping passengers right at the Olmsted's doorstep. The Carriage Turn also illustrates Olmsted's design principle of \"separation\"- creating a landscape element that divides the rustic and picturesque Hollow from the gently flowing, pastoral South Lawn. This small drive is \"art in the round\"- allowing visitors to catch glimpses of the Rock Garden, Hollow, and South Lawn.</p> <p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">The same spruce pole used in the archway is repeated in the fence surrounding the property. Malleable and made from natural materials, the fence provides what Olmsted deemed \"the first and most essential element of a home...domestic seclusion.\" The loose-fitting poles create an airy screen that gives the yard both privacy and openness to the neighbors.</p>",

    "bodyText": "Between 1890 and 1907, Baltimore, Maryland began acquiring portions of land around the Mount Clare Estate to provide a large park for the city’s southwestern neighborhoods. In 1904, Olmsted Brothers were hired to develop a master plan for what would become Carroll Park. The plan for Carroll Park was developed to protect the historic house as well as providing grounds for passive and active recreation.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers worked on Carroll Park from 1904 to 1915, and their design includes a curvilinear path system throughout the park, with the eastern section of the grounds used for active recreation while the sloping terrain near the center of the park is designed for leisurely use, with trees complimenting the existing hilltop mansion and terraces.",

He named his estate Caumsett, which in the local Matinecock Tribe, translates to place by sharp rock. Field chose architect John Russell Pope to design his Georgian Manor house, with Pope turning to Olmsted Brothers to assist in landscaping the mansion’s surroundings.<br /> <br /> Percival Gallagher was chosen to lead this design, and beginning in 1925, he began planting a courtyard and northern terrace edges with massive specimen trees. To the west, Gallagher created a circular garden with broad steps leading to another garden, this one focused on flowers enclosed by hedges. Gallagher also transformed a natural ravine into a picturesque pond, adding a shrub lined path leading to the water.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/genb.idc\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157663353585763/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://parks.ny.gov/parks/caumsett\">Caumsett State Historic Park Preserve</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmsted.org/job-7359-olmsteds-influence-on-caumsett-state-historic-park-preserve/\">Olmsted Network</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/caumsett-historic-state-park-preserve\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation </a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/07359\">Olmsted Online </a>",

While Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. suggested a single lakefront park, Buffalo Park Commissioners instead purchased two inland sites in 1891, one of which would become Cazenovia Park.<br /> <br /> In April of 1892, Olmsted submitted his design of Cazenovia Park. 76 acres of low, fertile land that had previously housed a village of Seneca Tribe’s Buffalo Creek Reservation would now become parkland. Handling the problematic seasonal flooding of the area, Olmsted, who developed plans for Cazenovia Park from 1892 to 1896, proposed damming the creek to create a 20-acre lake with three islands and a boathouse overlooking the water from the north.<br /> <br /> By August of 1892, construction on Cazenovia Park had begun. The principal features Olmsted designed for the park was a large play area, a winding drive that would cross a stream, and pass through the park overlooking the playground. Additionally, there was a grove of trees for concerts and a large shelter house.",

    "bodyText": "Like many city dwellers in the 19th century, New Yorkers only chance for fresh air and pastures were graveyards. Thankfully the city had begun acquiring land, about 843 acres of it, removed from the built-up areas of New York, and in 1853, New York State Legislature approved the establishment of Central Park.<br /> <br /> In 1857 the Central Park Commission was founded, and Olmsted was encouraged to apply for the position of superintendent of the park, which he was appointed to that same year. To address the rapidly expanding city, the Commission held a design competition for the park. Olmsted teamed up with Calvert Vaux, who he would rely on heavily to the sketch plan.<br /> <br /> Of the 33 submissions being considered, Olmsted and Vaux’s Greensward plan won over the Commission for its notable combination of formal and natural settings, mixed with architectural details like bridges. The most revolutionary of their design elements was the transverse roads, allowing vehicular traffic and pedestrians to cut through the park simultaneously, without anything detracting from their park experience.<br /> <br /> After the Greensward Plan was adopted, Olmsted was appointed Chief Architect of Central Park, which he served from 1858 to 1861, allowing him to supervise construction. Unfortunately, from the start, there was a lot of political infighting at Central Park, with Tammany Hall politicians wanting their voters and friends to get jobs at the park, instead of those qualified. There was also Andrew Green, leader of the Commission, whom Olmsted butted heads with over Green keeping the purse strings tight.<br /> <br /> Central Park was Olmsted’s first great project as a landscape architect, though it certainly wouldn’t be his last, but with every new park or estate you see bits of Central Park in it, for it’s where Olmsted got many of his trademark designs. Besides inspiring Olmsted, Central Park would go on to influence the development of urban parks nationwide, as well as serve as the set for many films.",

    "bodyText": "Located along Boston’s Esplanade, Charlesbank Park allowed Frederick Law Olmsted to design the first open air gymnasium and exercise facility of its kind in a public park. Olmsted’s move to Brookline in 1883 allowed him to design the park four years later. A waterside park, Charlesbank acted as the Beacon Street entrance to Olmsted’s Back Bay Fens.<br /> <br /> Working with fitness pioneer Dudley A. Sargent, Olmsted created a linear park with features like a promenade, boat landings, running track, trapezes, swinging rings, jumping and pole vaulting, shot putting, and more, separated by gender and age. Olmsted requested that Boston Park Commissioners provide equipment, maintenance, and instruction to the community, free of charge.<br /> <br /> While Olmsted supported facilities for exercise, he favored parks that encouraged individual sports, not team ones. That is why Charlesbank didn’t include a baseball diamond or football field. Opening in 1889, Olmsted’s original plan would get a redesign in 1910 after the construction of the dam, by Olmsted firm member Arthur Shurcliff. Due to increased vehicular traffic, most of Olmsted's design was removed in the 1930s.",

    "bodyText": "In 1891, Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. addressed a group of Louisville civic leaders about establishing a park system in their city. Olmsted’s proposed three park designs around the city’s perimeter: Iroquois, Shawnee, and Cherokee.<br /> <br /> Each park would reflect one of the region’s distinct native landscapes and at Cherokee Park, that landscape was devoted to more relaxing activities like walking, hiking, and horseback riding. With Olmsted, the Louisville Parks Commission created a network of parks and boulevards and is one of two park systems worked on by all three Olmsted’s.<br /> <br /> Anchoring this network of parks and boulevards were the three large parks around Louisville’s perimeter, with Cherokee taking up the eastern section. After Olmsted Sr.’s tenure at the firm was over, Olmsted Brothers worked on Cherokee Gardens, Seneca Gardens, and the Alta Vista subdivision, which benefited from borrowing the scenery Cherokee Park offered.<br /> <br /> In 1974, a tornado struck Louisville and resulted in the loss of thousands of mature trees at Cherokee Park. A massive replanting effort was undertaken, however, to qualify for federal funding, the park had to be restored to its pre-tornado design. To do this, the original Olmsted plants were consulted for the park’s “rebirth”, with 2,500 trees and 4,600 shrubs planted in the restoration effort.",

    "bodyText": "Chestnut Farm, the 472-acre estate of Robert Winsor, was once the second largest home in Weston. In 1883, Winsor purchased the land that would house his estate, and built a shingle style home on it. Between 1887 and 1890, Winsor acquired more property in the area.<br /> <br /> Beginning in 1910, Winsor began thinking of the possibilities of building a subdivision on his property. That year, Winsor hired Olmsted Brothers to make a general plan for his property. Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. took the lead at Chestnut Farm, stating that Winsor “wants to keep place quiet and natural; but wants to build some woods-roads and gradually improve the place with the idea in mind of subdividing it as time goes on…into smaller places of (say) ten acres and upwards”.<br /> <br /> Winsor asked Olmsted to create a road system not only convenient for his personal use but would also be useful when the property was subdivided. Olmsted Brothers made sure to place those roadways based on topographical and geological features, taking advantage of the natural landscape.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers also designed a four-acre pond at Chestnut Farm, with seventy-five workers arriving to the swampy site, removing unneeded land to make the pond deep enough for swimming. To this day, the pond left by the Olmsted's is used for skating in the winter.<br />  ",

This created a loop with the previously laid out Chestnut Hill Driveway, which Olmsted dubbed the Chestnut Hill Circuit, but is also known as the Chestnut Hill Loop.<br /> <br /> In his 1887 plan for the Boston Park System, Olmsted believed the Chestnut Hill Loop would connect the Reservoir to other park areas in Boston. After the completion of Commonwealth Avenue, and a redesign of Beacon Street, Olmsted believed the Loop leading to the pleasure grounds at the Reservoir should be part of Boston’s municipal park system.<br /> <br /> After Olmsted Sr.’s death, Olmsted Brothers took over all his work. Olmsted Brothers produced plans for a courtyard in front of the Chestnut Hill Reservoir Pumping Station. Additionally, Olmsted Brothers performed the layout and grading for the proposed pipe yard site adjacent to the pumping station.<br /> <br /> The Chestnut Hill Driveway was one of the most popular pleasure drives in the Greater Boston area in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It inspired other cities, like nearby Cambridge, to create pastoral landscapes and pleasure drives around their municipal reservoirs.<br />  ",

Bogart had been an engineer on staff at both Central Park and Prospect Park, while Culyer, also an engineer at both Central Park and Prospect Park, also followed Olmsted to D.C. to help form the United States Sanitary Commission.</p> <p paraeid=\"{4138246a-d15c-4940-9f93-f96c9a0d17e4}{10}\" paraid=\"1935096040\">While in New Orleans, Bogart took notes on the sites condition and created a plan for the City to reference. The two engineers received the first half of their fee, but the Park Board refused to pay the rest, believing that their plan was inadequate.</p> <p paraeid=\"{4138246a-d15c-4940-9f93-f96c9a0d17e4}{14}\" paraid=\"39338141\">Obviously frustrated, Bogart and Culyer sued for the remaining money. Despite loosing in a lower level court, they prevailed and received their compensation after brining it up in Louisiana’s Supreme Court.</p> <p paraeid=\"{4138246a-d15c-4940-9f93-f96c9a0d17e4}{18}\" paraid=\"739285309\">The lawsuit certainly took some excitement out of citizens and the prospect for a new park. It wouldn’t be till the early 1930’s that the Olmsted name would return to City Park, this time as Olmsted Brothers.</p> <p paraeid=\"{4138246a-d15c-4940-9f93-f96c9a0d17e4}{22}\" paraid=\"2119516052\">Among their work at City Park, Olmsted Brothers focused heavily on designing the area surrounding Popp Fountain, a memorial to local lumber tycoon John Popp. Though the Popp family donated the money to the City of New Orleans, they requested Olmsted Brothers assist in its design, wanting the best for their namesake.</p>",

The key feature of the grounds was the Fine Arts Garden, framed one both ends by the lagoon. Other features include tree groves and walkways.<br /> <br /> The formal garden consists of two outdoor rooms that travel along a central axis bookended by the museum’s southern terrace. Completed in 1928, the Fine Arts Garden at the Cleveland Museum of Art still contains much of the original Olmsted design.",

In 1904, Olmsted Brothers submitted their first comprehensive report for Baltimore, which included reworking Clifton Park, which they saw as one of the city’s major parks that would anchor the whole system.<br /> <br /> At Clifton Park, Olmsted Brothers added recreational facilities and reorganized roadways. Their first addition was an athletic ground on the southern section of the park, with a stone wall that remains today. Also in the Olmsted Brothers’ design was a swimming pool, which, when placed, was the largest concrete swimming pool in the country. Unfortunately, a section of Clifton Park would be destroyed in 1916 to make way for a golf course, Baltimore’s first public course.",

The York Municipal League raised the required funds, and League secretary R.Z. Hartzler visited Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. at his Brookline office to ask him to look at park possibilities, as well as other needed improvements, such as a sewer system and paved streets.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s fee for York was $600, almost $20,000 today. Olmsted arrived in York on April 10<sup>th</sup>, 1907, meeting with League members and taking a tour of the city. Olmsted believed sewage treatment should be top priority, though he was also pleased with the potential park sites. Looking at Codorus Creek, Olmsted wanted his design to be able to handle the area's frequent floods.<br /> <br /> Olmsted had been told by a local that ““not too many years ago, the Codorus was a pretty natural park with boating,” and if the sewage was handled, flooding addressed, and boundaries of the Codorus were wide enough on the banks to keep people from dumping, and erecting buildings, boating could once again return. Even though the rail trail has made the Codorus embankment walkable, it still is far from the “water park” that Olmsted envisioned.",

    "bodyText": "Colman Park is located within a steeply sloped area that John Charles Olmsted referred to as the Rainier Heights Landslide Section in his 1903 Seattle Parks Report. In that report, John Charles proposed acquiring the entire length of steep slope for park purposes, warning against using the land for subdivision development because “Houses will probably continue to be moved gradually on to adjoining land owned by someone else, and there will be no end to the trouble, expense and inconvenience due to the continuation of the slide if it is allowed to become occupied by houses… On the other hand, the movement of the land would be of small consequence if the ground is turned into a public park.”<br /> <br /> Additionally, Olmsted proposed a parkway that would run along the top of Colman Park’s slope, providing views to Lake Washington and the mountains further in the distance. Due to the ambitiousness of the plan, the parkway was never realized. However, some parcels within the area that would have been the parkway were either donated or purchased for parkland for Seattle.<br /> <br /> Within Colman Park, four bridges allow pedestrians to move, removed from vehicular traffic. Located at the North edge of the Mount Baker neighborhood, the forested hillside park features paths, community gardens, forests and lawns. Colman Park epitomizes John Charles’ goal: “to secure and preserve for the use of the people as much as possible of these advantages of water and mountain views and of woodlands.”",

    "bodyText": "Charles McKim of McKim, Mead & White, was chosen to design Columbia’s master plan. Because landscape architecture was such a new profession, many of these brilliant minds ended up working together quite often. McKim had apprenticed with Olmsted Sr.’s close friend H.H. Richardson for two years before leaving in 1879 to work with Mead and White.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Sr. had already worked with McKim at the World’s Columbian Exposition, where the two had introduced the City Beautiful movement to America with well-designed and maintained grounds. Olmsted Jr. would also end up working with McKim again, when in 1901 they were both chosen to serve on the Senate Park Commission, which would redesign the core of Washington, D.C. The two Harvard alums would also go back to do improvement on their alma mater, with McKim carrying out Olmsted’s plan.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Sr. noted of McKim’s design that “these courts and quadrangles are entirely cut off one from another, they are entirely independent of each other”<br /> <br /> -Frederick Law Olmsted Papers: School Buildings and Grounds, Columbia University (1893).<br /> <br /> McKim’s entire campus was a rectangular, symmetrical design that conforms to the natural topography of the site while taking advantage of the campus’s high position in New York. Olmsted trusted McKim in his arrangement of the campus, praising McKim’s ability to remove trees and replant them in more favorable locations.<br /> <br />  ",

By May 1867, Cornell and White were disagreeing on what their campus should look like, and so White contacted Frederick Law Olmsted to consult on the appearance for a new campus.<br /> <br /> Cornell pushed for a design around a quadrangle, which Olmsted recommended they abandon. Olmsted urged the University to lean towards a freer disposition with the buildings. Olmsted didn’t want to fight with the rugged topography of the site but rather worked it into his plan.<br /> <br /> As with many of his designs, Olmsted predicted that Cornell University would continue to grow, and that the campus they made today needed to handle the unforeseeable demands of later generations. As is sometimes the case, Olmsted’s recommendations came in too late, as planning was already underway with Ezra Cornell’s plan around a quadrangle.<br /> <br /> After learning the building site he recommended wasn’t chosen, Olmsted wrote to White stating “The site of your second building having been determined against my judgement, it seems to me to be very important that nothing should be done which shall make the suggestion which I offered to you in regard to a terrace impracticable”.",

Four years later, while construction was underway on the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, Cowen donated the land to Seattle, and John Charles was asked to create a preliminary plan for a park.<br /> <br /> John Charles’ design included a “Little Children’s Lawn”, covered shelter, a plaza, four footbridges crossing the stream channel, and other small structures. At the request of the city, John Charles also designed an entrance gate for the park. Despite significant alterations due to the dumping of excess material at the park for the construction of Interstate 5, the overall shape and placement of feature’s reflects John Charles’ original design.",

    "bodyText": "Between 1926 and 1928, Olmsted Brothers were working to landscape the site of Christ Church at Cranbrook in Birmingham, Michigan. Because of prior commitments, neither John Charles nor Frederick Jr. was able to work at the site, so work was left to firm member Percival Gallagher.<br /> <br /> After his first visit to Birmingham, Gallagher wrote that ““We are building a church and rectory in the Bloomfield Hills district. We have laid out a complete plan showing roads, walks, walls, etc. but we are anxious to get some idea of what planting would be suitable for this locality. We wonder if you would care to act as a consultant on this problem and perhaps furnish us with a planting plan and let us know what your fee would be for such service”.<br /> <br /> From 1926 to 1927, Gallagher worked through his site plan so that grading work on the foundation of the church could begin. At the end of 1927, Gallagher was working on the adjustment of plantings, needed after it was decided to widen the road leading to the Church.<br /> <br /> Limited to selecting and ordering plants, and supervising the execution of their plans, Olmsted Brothers’ role at Cranbrook ended over a fee dispute. Another reason behind the limited scope of the Olmsted involvement is because the Church was, and remains to this day, a separate entity, physically separated by roads, from the rest of Cranbrook.",

    "bodyText": "The Olmsted Brothers designed a series of Italian gardens for the Crane Estate, all enclosed by evergreens, the same one’s you see lining the Grand Allée, where Daryl Van Horn chooses to have lunch.In 1910, Richard T. Crane, Jr. was also a man of exorbitant wealth, though he didn’t move to Ipswich to stir up anything. Crane inherited the top post in his family’s manufacturing company and expanded it into modern bathroom fixtures. Crane even had an exhibit at the Chicago World’s Fair, where he displayed “the world’s largest shower”.<br /> <br /> Crane purchased the 165-acre plot of land and knew exactly what he wanted: a bowling green, tennis court, maze, log-cabin playhouse, golf course and deer preserve. Crane and his family also ran a self-sustaining farm with livestock, an orchard, and dense vegetable and rose gardens, which space needed to be made for.<br /> <br /> Crane was building his summer getaway during the country place era, a period of landscape architecture design where wealthy Americans commissioned extensive gardens at their country estates, emulating European gardens. To this day, Crane Estate is one of the last surviving, intact American estates from this era.<br /> <br /> Crane brought on the most prominent landscape architects of his time: Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and John Charles Olmsted, of the Olmsted Brothers firm, and Arthur Shurcliff, who had left the Olmsted firm in 1904 to start his own. Shurcliff was mentored by Charles Eliot, who like himself, left the Olmsted firm to open his own.<br /> <br /> Though the Olmsted Brothers started work on the Grande Allée, they were dismissed by Crane and work was handed over to Arthur Shurcliff. From 1913 to 1915, Shurcliff worked on the half-mile long formal mall leading from the Crane Mansion to the Atlantic Ocean.<br /> <br /> In 1949, the Crane family donated the land to the Trustees of Reservations, which was founded by former Olmsted firm employee and mentor to Arthur Shurcliff, Charles Eliot.<br /> <br />  ",

    "bodyText": "Built in 1881 by architect Henry Hobson Richardson and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, the Crane Library was one of several collaborations between the pair. Olmsted’s first task was re-grading the site, making it level with the street to create a flat canvas for the construction of the library. As the landscape architect, it was Olmsted’s job to showcase the red and stone façade of the building, so the planting plan for Crane Library included an open green turf, with scattered shrubbery along the grounds.<br /> <br /> An 1883 edition of Harper’s Weekly called the Crane Library, “the best Village library in the United States,”. Olmsted Brothers would get a chance to add to the library grounds when the City of Quincy reached out in 1913, asking them to advise on “the adjustment of the library grounds to the proposed widening”.",

On the island, Olmsted found untamed natural beauty that needed no engineering to be perfected. Integrating design aspects Olmsted commonly used at parks and subdivisions, he chose to set aside idyllic places for common use.<br /> <br /> A year later Olmsted created his first report for Cushing Island, proposing the island shouldn’t be developed as a typical resort, which Cushing agreed with. Olmsted developed areas for recreational activities, as well as a network of walks and a curvilinear carriage drive, offering the best views of the ocean.<br /> <br /> Olmsted was able to seamlessly integrate a design for summer cottages with park planning. Despite much of his plan not being implemented, Olmsted’s road system was followed, as well as the large open areas he set aside and unobstructed ocean views.",

As the city did with their large parks, they turned to Frederick Law Olmsted for their small ones. In April 1887, Olmsted submitted his plan for Day’s Park. The park was named for Thomas Day, a wealthy early settler of Buffalo who gifted the land for the park in 1859, under the condition the land be made into a park bearing his name.<br /> <br /> At Day’s Park, Olmsted’s plan provided “a long plat of turf studded with trees, with a fountain in the center…” the fountain was an uncommon feature for one of Buffalo’s Olmsted-designed parks, with Day’s Park being the only one Olmsted designed in Buffalo to include one. Despite the removal of the original fountain in 1923, Day’s Park remains the way Olmsted envisioned it.",

Construction would last from 1870 to 1874, and the 350-acre park was bordered by seven miles of footpaths, bridle paths and carriage drives.<br /> <br /> In 1886, Delaware Park was expanded by twelve acres, with Olmsted drawing up plans for the addition.

With John Charles Olmsted taking the lead, and working closely with architect Ernest Flagg, it took two years to create their General Plan for the University. John Charles wanted buildings to be in harmony with the area’s dramatic elevation changes, so he created a series of terraces along existing curves, placing the academic quad at the heart of the campus.<br /> <br /> After John Charles’ death in 1920, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and Edward Whiting took over the design. They implemented retaining walls and bridges in road planning to adjust to the area’s steep land.

    "bodyText": "In December of 1911, representatives from three Denver civic groups came together, and invited Olmsted Brothers to help make their Rocky Mountain town more accessible to tourists and locals by creating a chain of parks, as well as well-built roads. Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. accepted the commission and traveled to Denver to inspect the 250-square-miles of remote and mountainous landscape.<br /> <br /> In Olmsted Jr’s first report of 1912, he recommended acquiring large parcels of land to protect scenery, the construction of an interconnecting system of roadways, and the development of facilities for active and passive use. One year later, in his second report, he recommended the acquisition of 41,320 acres of land.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. 's work on the Denver Parks was an early example of sensitive and scenic road building techniques that would soon be used all over the National Parks. In October of 1913, Olmsted Jr directed that “the smaller the extent of obviously artificial and manhandled surface, whether in the roadway or adjacent to it, the better it is for the mountain scenery.”",

    "bodyText": "In 1826, Manuel Dominguez built his estate on 75,000 acres of land gifted to his uncle from the King of Spain, as a thank you for his military service. By the late 1800s, massive tracts of land were being gradually sold off. In 1911, real estate developer Jared Sydney Torrance purchased over three thousand acres to carve out the city of his namesake.<br /> <br /> Torrance hired Olmsted Brothers to design his new South Bay community in 1911, with Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. taking lead on this project. Olmsted Jr. was known for integrating structures into a landscape, never wanting those structures to dominate a landscape, instead perfectly fitting in.<br /> <br /> The open green expanse of the tree lined El Prado was laid out at an angle, leading a spectator’s eyes towards the towering mountains in the distance. El Prado reflects Olmsted Jr.’s deliberate attempt to work green space and natural beauty into his urban designs.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s plan for Torrance was creative, dividing the town into three distinct districts: the business district at the city’s core (now known as Old Torrance), the industrial district to the North and East of the city’s core, and the residential district to the West.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. chose modern architect Irving J. Gill to design Torrance’s original buildings, including the city’s railroad bridge. Olmsted Brothers likely suggested Gill as architect because they had already worked together on the Panama-California Exposition.<br /> <br /> As is often the case with Olmsted designed landscapes, the plan for Torrance came out of a different plan, one for a park on the other side of the country. The 1906 plan for Forest Hills Garden in New York is based on the garden city principles, that humans should live in harmony with nature. The Forest Hills plan included streets radiating out from a railway station, which would form the basis for Olmsted Jr.’s Torrance plan.",

Newburgh, New York offered the commission to Olmsted and Vaux, who delivered their plans in 1889. The pair provided their design for free, on the condition that the park be named after their mentor, who had lived in Newburgh.<br /> <br /> Olmsted and Vaux had already gained prominence for creating open spaces that promote well-being of the public, favoring naturalistic, rustic, and curving landscape designs. Olmsted and Vaux brought everything they’d learned through their partnership to Downing Park, like “circulation”, which landscape architects describe as a sense of continual discovery.<br /> <br /> Originally, Downing Park was to lay on a hillside, however Olmsted convinced Newburgh Park Commissioners to add the nearby flat land, providing land to create Polly Pond and grassy meadows for family picnics and larger community events.<br /> <br /> Walking through Downing Park today, visitors enjoy changing views of varied natural features. Many of the trees present today were originally planted by Warren H. Manning, Superintendent of planning for the Olmsted firm. Not only would Downing Park be the final collaboration between Olmsted and Vaux, but it is also the only known commission where both their sons, John Charles Olmsted and Downing Vaux, assisted in the design.",

To gain public support for his proposal, Hurt reached out to Atlanta’s most prominent families, including Coca-Cola founder Asa Candler.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{121}\" paraid=\"139859724\">Frederick Law Olmsted first came to Atlanta in the late 1880s, on the invitation of Hurt, where Olmsted listened to his comments on the physical developments of the growing city. In his earliest proposal for Druid Hills, Olmsted stated the land had “roads of moderate grace and curves, avoiding any great disturbance of the natural topography.”</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{125}\" paraid=\"1608851042\">Olmsted agreed to take on Druid Hills and began developing a plan to unify the community by unifying the landscape, transportation, and people. After several visits to Atlanta, financial setbacks halted the project for several years. Before work resumed, Frederick Law Olmsted had retired, and the work was passed on to Olmsted Brothers.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{129}\" paraid=\"171853766\">Though development on the 1,300-acre plot of land began after Olmsted’s retirement, his designs are still a prominent part of the community. Olmsted designed a stretch of land following Druid Hills central roadway, Ponce De Leon Avenue, where 6 narrow public spaces were incorporated to separate vehicular traffic from pleasure traffic.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{133}\" paraid=\"1440937267\">Frederick Law Olmsted and his sons created a magnificent urban neighborhood that became Atlanta’s first suburb. The powerful combination of structure and natural elements created a relaxing effect on the tensions of urban life.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{137}\" paraid=\"769122319\">Druid Hills was completed in 1905 and represents a major innovation in suburban design, one that influenced suburbs all over Atlanta.</p>",

Duke promised his university to be a beautiful, elite Southern campus to rival the colleges of the Northeast. While Duke had to whittle down a lengthy list of architects to one, Horace Trumbauer, there was only one landscape architecture firm he wanted designing his campus: Olmsted Brothers. Corresponding constantly with Trumbauer, Olmsted Brothers worked with the architect on the layout of buildings.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ccb64d08-aacf-4a91-ad23-b36c14f394dd}{32}\" paraid=\"2062849730\">Olmsted Brother’s plan was heavily influenced by Beaux Arts style design, with long vistas and strict axial designs. A part of their axial design would be Campus Drive, a forested thoroughfare serving as the spine of the campus, centering everything together.</p> <p paraeid=\"{ccb64d08-aacf-4a91-ad23-b36c14f394dd}{36}\" paraid=\"20204458\">At Duke University, Olmsted Brothers were responsible for grading the land, establishing patterns of canopy trees, designing, and planting both quads, as well as the paths and roadways for the rest of the campus. Olmsted Brothers left Duke with a commitment to excellence in design and planning that still exists today, with the campus retaining a parklike setting of two thousand acres of open space along with six thousand acres of forest.</p>",

Unfortunately, lack of funds and public health concerns ended this addition. Today, little of the original Olmsted design remains, though Dyker Beach remains a popular destination.",

    "bodyText": "While the Olmsted firm made their first report for Essex County parks in 1884, praising the scenic opportunities of the Eagle Rock area, it wasn’t until 1898, when the firm had been renamed Olmsted Brothers, that a guide for developing the area as a reservation was put forth. John Charles took lead on this project, working with engineers to plan well-graded but subtle drives, bridle paths, and trails throughout the steep slopes and valleys.<br /> <br /> John Charles recommended planting hemlocks and pines to enrich the boldness of the valley, with native rhododendrons, laurels, and ferns used as texture for the trails. Shelters were placed around the park for people to stop and capture stunning views across the river, using stones as walls to blend naturally.<br /> <br /> Spanning over 400 acres, Eagle Rock Reservation was left wild except for its overlook of Manhattan. John Charles Olmsted helped provide the area with a nuanced landscape plan, which would maintain the existing maple and red oak woodlands while supplanting some existing species with pine and hemlock.",

In his lengthy report that year to the Civic Planning Committee of New Haven, he wrote that “If the people of the city… are to have the benefit of a place where they may habitually get a little healthful recreation out of doors under agreeable and refreshing surroundings… if the children are to be able to make such use of a playground; if their elders are to get with tolerable frequency even a little walk in the park or square for air and for refreshment from the dulling routine of life in factory, store, office, and cramped dwelling house or flat; if the mothers are to get out occasionally to a pleasant park bench with their sewing or what not, while the children play about them: then facilities for this sort of recreation must be provided within easy walking distance of every home in the city. Any plan that deliberately stops short of such provision…. Is in so far illogical, unjust, undemocratic and unwise.”<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr., as his father taught him, was committed to provide refuge and recreation away from city life. When Edgewood Avenue, with its busy traffic, began creeping too close to the park, Olmsted Jr. believed “its inharmonious character should be modified by properly planned grading and planting of its slopes.”",

Only after this step could rich black soil be brought into the area through thousands of loads. Olmsted Jr. spent the next five years working diligently with his team to plant a mix of native and exotic plants that would thrive in a humid climate, lending a tropical feel to the native oak hill.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. carefully selected plants that would provide a hearty supply of food and shelter for migrating birds and other wildlife in the area. In total, Olmsted planted 1,000 large live oaks, 10,000 azaleas, 100 sabal palms, 300 magnolias, and hundreds of fruit shrubs like blueberry and holly.",

While working in Colorado Springs, Olmsted Jr.’s Organic Act was passed, and the National Park Service was created.<br /> <br /> The beauty Olmsted Brothers left at El Pomar still exists today and will continue to benefit generations of Coloradans.

Wanting to fix their mistake, the United States Housing Corporation was assembled to build accommodations for wartime industrial workers.<br /> <br /> Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. was tasked with heading the Town Planning Division of the US Housing Corporation and, in this position, he brought about an unprecedented mobilization of landscape architects, architects, and engineers to provide plans for new communities, one of those communities being Grand Canyon Village.<br /> <br /> Though Jr. did trust the landscape architects he brought on, every single person working for the Housing Corporation received a rough plan and suggestions from Olmsted for each community. However, El Tovar Hotel was a true Olmsted Brothers project.<br /> <br /> El Tovar Hotel followed Olmsted Sr.’s belief that any structure in a park drawing attention away from the works of nature was inappropriate. Following the training of this father, Jr. insisted that planning of the hotel should be done through consultation of topographical and other natural features.<br /> <br /> Grand Canyon Village epitomized the most skillful planning techniques of its day, perhaps because its early planners understood the effects of a relatively unobtrusive building in the middle of wilderness.",

While their design included a tree-lined drive meandering through curves, the centerpiece of their design was the Italianate Garden.<br /> <br /> Elm Bank was occupied by families until the 1940s, when a religious organization bought the property to use for seminary housing and as a summer camp. It was used very briefly for this purpose, and after which it remained empty and neglected for over thirty years.<br /> <br /> Despite the neglect, the landscape elements designed by Olmsted Brothers still help historic significance, and in 1987, Elm Bank was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1999, Elm Bank became home to the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, leasing thirty-six acres of land within Elm Bank.<br /> <br /> In the years since Olmsted Brothers’ work on the Italianate Garden, it has seen some deterioration. Like many Olmsted designs that meet this fate, restoration work is based on the original plans still stored at Olmsted NHS. To restore the Italianate Garden at Elm Bank, numbered plant lists and receipts from the original trees and flowers planted in the garden were reviewed.",

From 1910 to 1918, the firm consulted extensively on Elm Park, directing improvements like the addition of bridges and walking paths, new curbing for the ponds, more plantings, and new locations for recreational activities.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers also helped Worcester acquire nearby Newton Hill, which became an addition to Elm Park, requiring new paths. Despite Olmsted Brothers not beginning work till the early 1900s, the land was purchased in 1854 using public funds, and is often recognized as one of the first purchases of land for a public park in the U.S.<br /> <br /> After the Great Depression, Olmsted Firm came back to Worcester to work on Elm Park. Between 1938 and 1941, Olmsted Brothers landscapes the triangular plot at the base of Newton Hill that became the site of the Rogers- Kennedy Memorial.",

    "bodyText": "After their work on Central and Prospect Park, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were invited to Newark, New Jersey in 1867 to explore potential parkland around the area. The first park the pair would develop in the area would be Branch Brook Park, due to its scenic potential.<br /> <br /> Olmsted and Vaux had originally proposed acquiring a 420-acre tract, though the county rejected the land acquisition, which would be too costly for a single park. At the same time Essex County rejected the proposal, Charles Eliot’s concept for a metropolitan-based park system had just emerged in Boston, giving Essex a feasible model to base their work off.<br /> <br /> In 1895, the Essex County Park Commission again reached out to the Olmsted firm, though this time it would be John Charles Olmsted of Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot who took lead on the project. John Charles submitted a comprehensive report to the Commission, detailing both the public health and economic benefits of a park system.<br /> <br /> In the end, the Olmsted plan of a network of connected parkways was only minimally implemented, with most of the land being acquired by state highways. Despite this, by 1895 20 of the 26 parks and reservations in Essex County were designed by the Olmsted firm.",

Nims wanted his property divided into lots, and bridle paths created through surrounding shrubs. Nims also wanted his vegetable garden moved closer to his house, integrating the steep eastern bluff, the house, and the surrounding land.<br /> <br /> From Olmsted Brothers, L.H. Zack was tasked with beginning the survey of the property and taking photographs, used by firm members who couldn’t travel to the site. As requested, the plan divided the property into six lots, with a second driveway added to access neighboring lots.<br /> <br /> Zack also used topographical maps to decide where bridlepaths were to be done. Zack also suggested that one path go along the edge of a nearby pond, just below the house to the East. Over time the paths were cut, though it is unknown if the edge of the pond was as densely packed with vegetation as Zack suggested. Except for the minimal staking of the paths, nothing of Olmsted Brothers’ plan was executed.",

Olmsted Jr. and Wharton believed that coastal mangrove forests and “the abundance of many species of wild bird life not commonly found in other parts” made the Everglades highly desirable for a national park.</p> <p paraeid=\"{386eba4a-ecc6-4cce-bd3f-d7e5035f43df}{233}\" paraid=\"166938486\">Despite not proposing any specific recommendations for park development, they firmly believed believing “that the primitive character of the region should be protected to the utmost.” Not only did they see the Everglades as providing recreational enjoyment, they also saw the importance it would serve as a study site for botanists, zoologists, and geologists.</p>",

I am going to live here.”<br /> <br /> Olmsted would purchase the foursquare style home from the Clark sisters, though neither sister wanted to leave so the two families struck an agreement. The Clark’s sold their home and 1.75 acres of land, and in return, John Charles Olmsted built them a home, free of charge, overlooking Fairsted, where they would live rent for the remainder of their lives.<br /> <br /> A large open lawn, known as the South Lawn, provides a point of contrast to the dense planting along the perimeter, which bordered Isabella Stewart Gardner’s summer estate. Vines were meant to dominate the façade of the house, creating a sense of wilderness. Today, any groundwork done at Fairsted references historic images and plans, to keep the landscape as close to original as possible.",

It was Mary who asked her son Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. to build the family a summer retirement home.<br /> <br /> In 1897, Olmsted Jr. contacted Boston architect William Ralph Emerson, known for his shingle style home designs in Maine, to build Felsted. Emerson’s landscape plan was intended to stimulate Olmsted Sr.’s decreasing mental abilities.<br /> <br /> The Olmsted’s spent one single summer at Felsted, at the end of which they were unhappy and Olmsted Sr.’s health continued to deteriorate. After Felsted, the family decided to commit Olmsted Sr. to McLean Hospital, where he would spend the rest of his life, passing away in 1903.",

Completed in 1897, the couple didn’t just hire the best in landscape architecture, but also in architecture, with the home being designed by McKim, Mead, and White.<br /> <br /> Olmsted set the mansion on a hill that would overlook the Passaic Valley and Black Brook meadows. When giving his suggestions about the property to Twombly, Olmsted told him that “you have a sweep of landscape to an infinitely remote…obscure background…as much so as if you owned the state of New Jersey”.",

    "bodyText": "Originally the site for several forts used for the Revolutionary War, after conflict had ended the citizens of the surrounding land began instinctually using the area that would become Fort Greene Park for open space, free to the public.<br /> <br /> Twenty years after being designated as a parkland, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were engaged in 1867 to prepare a new design for the park, as well as a crypt for the remains of the 11,500 prison ship martyrs; brave men and women who died while imprisoned during the Battle of Long Island.<br /> <br /> Olmsted and Vaux were likely hired to design the new park because of their growing involvement in creating the parks and open spaces of Brooklyn. Their design approach at Fort Greene called for a park of rural character, consisting of “a series of shady walks that will have an outlook of open grassy spaces at intervals”.<br /> <br /> In addition to winding pathways and open lawns, there was a designated area for social gatherings, two playgrounds, an observatory, and room for a monument to the prison ship martyrs. While some of these design elements weren’t included at Central or Prospect Park, Olmsted and Vaux included them here, seeing them as appropriate to the site and neighborhood.<br /> <br /> Though Olmsted and Vaux always intended for a formal monument to the prison ship martyrs, a lack of funding would interrupt its realization. After Olmsted and Vaux had both passed, the architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White were brought in to complete it.<br /> <br /> Today, the park retains much of Olmsted and Vaux’s original characteristics, with winding pathways, sloping lawns, and mature trees, including on 135-year old English elm.",

In 1910, John Charles Olmsted of Olmsted Brothers began preparing a plan for Fort Lawton. John Charles felt obtaining public access to Fort Lawton was important, and he urged Park Commissioners to “secure and preserve for the use of the people as much as possible…of water and mountain views and of woodlands,”.<br /> <br /> While designing Fort Lawton’s boulevards, parade grounds, and building alignments, John Charles was able to take advantage of the terrain’s dramatic topography and expansive views. Starting in 1968, the military cut back on using Fort Lawton. The City of Seattle was able to acquire the land without cost, promising to turn it into a public park. Now known as Discovery Park, Fort Lawton fulfilled John Charles’ desire as the anchor of the city-wide system.",

In 1914, Baltimore’s then Mayor wired Olmsted Brothers for advice on preserving Fort McHenry, as the firm had already been consulting the city on municipal park matters. On April 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1914, Olmsted Jr. visited Fort McHenry and began preparing a report on the issues of the site, as well as the proposed memorial building.<br /> <br /> The focus of Olmsted Jr.’s report dealt with many of the architectural features of the park like statues and monuments. The proposed design placed memorial elements like monuments, statues, flagpoles, and the historic fort into a rigid order. A meandering circuit drive and perimeter plantings help screen off the outside world while creating open space to focus attention on the fort.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. recommended removing any non-historic structures from the site to keep attention on the Fort. As a member of the Fine Arts Commission, Olmsted Jr. was placed in an uncomfortable position with the Francis Scott Key memorial. Not only did Olmsted Jr propose a design for the monument, he also passed judgement on it.",

    "bodyText": "Before being known as Fort Tryon, the area known as Mount Washington served as a battle site along the Hudson River during the Revolutionary War. British troops stationed there had named the site after William Tryon, the last British governor of colonial New York City. After the Americans won the war, they re-appropriated the name and referred to the area as Fort Tryon.<br /> <br /> In 1917 John D. Rockefeller had purchased much of the land Fort Tryon sat on, with the vision to develop it into a park. Ten years later Rockefeller Jr. contacted Olmsted Brothers to develop that park, with Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. taking a particular interest in the project.<br /> <br /> Jr. spent four years transforming Fort Tryon’s rocky soil and topography into a manicured landscape. He designed Fort Tryon Park with promenades, terraced, wooded slopes and eight miles of paths for pedestrians.<br /> <br /> Rockefeller Jr. had his own visions for the park, believing it should provide striking views of the rock ridges in the distance. Olmsted Jr. agreed, for his design was careful to preserve open areas and included an abundance of colorful plants to compliment the expansive views of the Hudson River.<br /> <br /> Over the years, restoration on Fort Tryon Park has constantly referred to the original Olmsted Brother’s design. Today, photos from the Olmsted Archives are used for restoration of the Alpine Garden at Fort Tryon Park.",

    "bodyText": "Fort Wetherill would serve as a military outpost from the beginning of the Revolutionary War, to the final days of World War II. In addition to watching out for enemy ships coming through Newport Harbor, Fort Wetherill would also serve as a training camp, allowing for U.S. soldiers to practice artillery spotting, signaling, and observation.<br /> <br /> As World War II was about to break out, new construction began at Fort Wetherill and nearby Fort Getty, with Olmsted Brothers serving as landscape architects for both projects. Many of the men stationed would care for mine fields and submarine nets between Jamestown and Newport, waiting for a war that never came.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers would work on new barracks and provide room for training, but much of what they left at Fort Wetherill was used to indoctrinate German prisoner of wars who had displayed “anti-Nazi feelings”. The goal was for to instill a desire to attain a democratic way of life back into the Germans, and pass on methods to achieve this democracy. Germans who completed the program would return home, leaders now ready to rebuild local communities.<br /> <br /> After the threat of World War II passed, the best line of defense along the coast of New England, and the most heavily armed, was abandoned for nearly a quarter of a century. In 1970, the 61.5 acres of land Olmsted Brothers had worked on became property of the State of Rhode Island, to be used for open space and recreational uses, just as Olmsted would have wanted.",

    "bodyText": "This \"country park\" is the largest park- almost 500 acres- and crowning jewel of the Emerald Necklace. Named for Benjamin Franklin, the park was to provide \"<em>complete escape from the town</em>\" and brings together rural scenery, 200 acres of woodlands, and active recreation facilities. These include tennis and basketball courts, baseball fields, the region's premier cross country track, and an 18-hole golf course. A 72-acre zoo is also part of what the park has to offer, along with miles of some of the best walking trails in the city. <br /> <br /> At Franklin Park, design was done by subtraction; removing existing plants while keeping most of the old trees. Olmsted believed that decisions relating to Franklin Park would be “<em>of greater lasting consequence</em>”, determining the quality of life in the city for years to come.  While Boston evolves, so does Franklin Park, with a public golf course being added in 1896, to Olmsted’s dismay, and a zoo in 1912. Though it has developed past the “country park” Olmsted envisioned, its purpose as a place for quiet enjoyment of the natural scenery remains.",

    "bodyText": "While work on Fresh Pond Parkway is credited to Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot, Charles Eliot is deserving of most of the credit for Fresh Pond and Fresh Pond Parkway, and many of the Olmsted designs in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Eliot would be a crucial character in providing a guiding hand for the early activities of the Cambridge Park Commission.<br /> <br /> In 1893, after Cambridge acquired Fresh Pond to preserve its water supply, Eliot was invited to inspect the site for a possible park. Eliot observed that “On the west is Fresh Pond, with an area of one hundred and fifty-five acres. Along the whole length of the southern boundary of the city stretches the Charles River … Here is a total of eight hundred acres of permanently open space provided by nature without cost to Cambridge. . . If Cambridge is to invest money in public recreation grounds, a just economy demands that such money shall first be placed where it will bring into use for public enjoyment these now unused and inaccessible spaces with their ample air, light, and outlook.”<br /> <br /> Though it happened after Eliot succumbed to spinal meningitis in 1897, Fresh Pond and Fresh Pond Parkway were brought into the public domain. Today, Fresh Pond Parkway is still lined with oaks, as Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot recommended.",

    "bodyText": "In his 1903 report on Seattle’s Parks, John Charles Olmsted proposed the ambitious undertaking of acquiring an entire length of steeply sloped area for park purposes, cautioning locals of the land’s unsuitability for a subdivision development. John Charles believed that “Houses will probably continue to be moved gradually on to adjoining land owned by someone else, and there will be no end to the trouble, expense and inconvenience due to the continuation of the slide if it is allowed to become occupied by houses. . .. On the other hand, the movement of the land would be of small consequence if the ground is turned into a public park.”<br /> <br /> The land John Charles was working with occupied a wooded ravine with a stream channel winding throughout it. The proposed plan curved along Lake Washington Boulevard, fitting into the slopes as it wound through the park, with John Charles creating a small waterfall as a focal point. Additionally, John Charles placed a network of paths throughout the park, as well as benches and pools. The land was renamed Frink Park to honor the donor who had made the park possible.",

After New York City was chosen as a burial site, the next task would be deciding where in the ever-expanding city.<br /> <br /> While many favored Central Park, a location at Riverside Park was chosen after Frederick Law Olmsted’s close acquaintance Samuel Parsons Jr. convinced Grant’s widow Julia that the Hudson River setting, with its sweeping panoramic views, was superior.<br /> <br /> Shortly after the burial, anxiety began to grow regarding the site of Grant’s Tomb, that it was inappropriate and would lend an unfortunate funerary air to this section of Riverside Park, which had been considered a gala promenade. Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were particularly concerned.<br /> <br /> Nestled within the picturesque landscape of Riverside Park, Grant’s Tomb was designed to be approached by rail, water, carriage, and by foot. Grant’s Tomb is located atop one of the highest points along Riverside Drive, with surrounding formal walkways and parklands designed by Parsons and Vaux.<br /> <br /> To ease Olmsted and Vaux’s concerns, Vaux and Parsons proposed that the grounds of Grant’s Tomb be separated from the rest of Riverside Park with a newly cut road, which was done, ensuring Grant’s Tomb and Riverside Park could coexist in Olmsted’s vision of providing open park space unobstructed by the outside world.",

    "bodyText": "Part of the Rochester Park System, which Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. and his successor firm designed from 1881 to 1912, Genesee Valley Park was originally named South Park. Divided by the Genesee River, Olmsted chose the 543-acre site for its ability to naturally incorporate water with wooded, rolling terrain. Despite five years of public opposition to the park, the Board of Park Commissioners exerted considerable pressure on Olmsted to make recommendations and begin his landscaping work.<br /> <br /> Olmsted wrote that any advice on how to utilize the land was dependent on the topography of the site. He deliberated over designs, preferring to study topography and other aspects of the land before making a final decision. In the end, Olmsted’s design included land bordering both sides of the Genesee River.<br /> <br /> On the West side of the river, recreational facilities were placed while on the opposite bank, there was a pastoral setting that included a meadow, deer park, and picnic groves encircled by carriage routes. Between 1889 and 1898, 62,500 trees were planted, while shrubs and willows were rooted along the riverbanks and within the woods.<br /> <br /> John Charles Olmsted would assist his father at Genesee Valley Park, overseeing the placement of additional recreational facilities, including a golf course. In 1908, a donation of 120-acres expanded the park, though when it was divided by the Erie Canal in 1908. Olmsted Brothers mitigated the damage to the site by creating a bridge that reunited the landscape.",

With John Charles taking the lead on the design, his plan emphasized the island’s natural topography while incorporating the native vegetation of the area.<br /> <br /> While Olmsted Brothers was responsible for the landscape, they also had ideas about the architecture of the community and called for a separation of areas depending on the style of the home, so that no styles mixed poorly, causing a dilution of the intended effect. Homes around Gibson Island are built in numerous differing styles: French and Spanish Eclectic, Gothic, Colonial, Tudor Revivals, Mission, and Art Deco.<br /> <br /> Around Gibson Island, roads take the form of paved, meandering paths, accommodating the 423 residential plots and two eighteen-hole golf courses Olmsted Brothers called for. However, financial constraint left the idea of the second golf course abandoned and trees were cut to increase views of the water, all to Olmsted's objections.<br /> <br /> While the Great Depression would alter the size of the development, to this day Gibson Island remains true to Olmsted Brothers’ vision for a recreational community, and their design provides a showcase for the Island’s 190 residences.",

    "bodyText": "After moving to Brookline, Massachusetts in 1883, Frederick Law Olmsted would design three subdivisions for his new community, Fisher Hill being one of them. A pair of landowners wrote to Olmsted in February 1884 stating they were combining their properties, and requested Olmsted create a plan for the land. As always, Olmsted referenced the topographical survey to ensure his curving roads would fit into the natural scenery.<br /> <br /> Despite curved lines not being a popular choice at the time, Olmsted did have a reason to include them. Fisher Hill lies between two major streets, Beacon, and Boylston, however, only one road connects the two within Fisher Hill, and it lies on the border of the subdivision. This means that those curving residential streets aren’t shortcuts to anywhere. They only travel within Fisher Hill, which discourages outside traffic from cutting through the neighborhood, leaving Fisher Hill a peaceful, quiet area.<br /> <br /> The neighborhood has remained, for the most part, unchanged, making it Olmsted’s most intact subdivision in the country. That cohesiveness of the plan is partly to do with Olmsted’s sensitive layout, as well as the fact that most homes were built under a short time, and under deed restrictions.",

    "bodyText": "In 1870, Hartford native Frederick Law Olmsted began drafting a plan for a network connected parks for the city. While Olmsted worked on several Hartford parks, by 1895 his health had begun failing him, forcing him to cut back on work, pushing his sons and partners into more projects. As partners in Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot, John Charles Olmsted and Charles Eliot created their design for Goodwin Park, part of the Hartford Park System.<br /> <br /> Initially named South Park, it was renamed in 1900 to honor Hartford Park Commissioner Revered Francis Goodwin, a critical player in getting Hartford its parks. The 200-acre park consists of woodlands and meadows, with Great Meadow being its most prominent feature, a 90-acre, gently sloping lawn surrounded by native tree groves. Recreational elements like children’s play area, outdoor gymnasium, and a wading pool were placed along wooded edges, providing privacy.<br /> <br /> Despite the addition of a golf course and the park being used as an airfield throughout the 1920s and during WWII, Goodwin Park retains much of its original design. Now surrounded by residential neighborhoods, the park serves the community, providing mental and physical health benefits.",

Though Olmsted Sr. would pass away, Burnham still had ideas for parks that would need the famous Olmsted touch.</p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{92}\" paraid=\"2039795894\">Burnham had been working on a park, then known as Lake Park, since the mid-1890s. The city was in possession of the land, however after seeing the success of the South Park Commission at the World’s Columbian Exposition, the city transferred the land to them. After the transfer, the commission changed the name of the proposed park from Lake to Grant, honoring former president Ulysses S. Grant.</p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{96}\" paraid=\"861420569\">In 1903, the South Park Commission hired the Olmsted Brothers to assist Burnham. By 1907, the Olmsted Brothers had developed an entirely new plan, calling for a more formalized park structure based off French landscaping principles. This would include symmetrical spaces, along with well-defined paths and plantings.</p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{100}\" paraid=\"351601788\">There was a debate over what the centerpiece of Grant Park should be. Burnham had already been chosen as the architect for a new natural history museum, thanks to a $1 million donation from department store owner Marshall Field, and he felt the museum would be a perfect centerpiece. Though Field wanted the museum in the Sr. Olmsted’s Jackson Park, the younger Olmsted sons agreed with Burnham, and the Field Museum was forever placed in Grant Park.</p>",

As with many of the Olmsted Brothers projects in the Northwest, John Charles Olmsted took the lead on designing many of Seattle’s parks, like Green Lake Boulevard.<br /> <br /> Work on Green Lake began in 1908 by merging aesthetics with function. John Charles’ vision was to provide a sanctuary where residents could enjoy nature and partake in a peaceful moment away from the hustle and bustle of life. John Charles placed trees and shrubbery along the boulevard’s outer edge, many of which survive today.<br /> <br /> Additionally, John Charles included a graceful parkland meandering along the shores of Green Lake. By covering this area with grass, John Charles predicted that it would “be one of the most attractive places for crowds to ramble and sit under the trees.” John Charles also recommended “sufficient space be provided for field sports, and also for a formal garden.” An earlier movement stressing the importance of outdoor recreation for children prompted John Charles to include a playground in his plan.",

Bok likely hired Olmsted Brothers as they were currently working on subdivision and bird sanctuary in Florida for her husband. With Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. taking the lead, he was tasked with reworking the two-acres of land.<br /> <br /> To emphasize framed views, Olmsted Jr.’s design needed to employ a strategic grading plan. Curved walking paths take visitors from the street to the shore, with lush planting beds blocking views of nearby homes and stores. Olmsted Jr wanted native plants like American juniper, blueberry and lilac shrubs to flourish, many of which still do as Olmsted Jr.’s plan was carried out.",

Olmsted’s 1870 planned would be designed in the picturesque style by himself, his sons John Charles and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., his firm partner Charles Eliot, and others.<br /> <br /> To accommodate the growing metropolitan area, parks dense with trees would provide a lush oasis and recreational facilities. Due to their father’s failing health, Olmsted Brothers acted as Hartford’s parks consultants from 1895 through to the 1940s. While Olmsted Sr. 's plan focused on passive parks, Olmsted Brothers focused on active neighborhood parks and playgrounds, most used by the nearby public schools.<br /> <br /> The Hartford Park System allows the Olmsted legacy to span several decades and generations. All three Olmsted’s worked on parks in Hartford, from the smaller squares and greens to large scale municipal parks, nothing was off limits in Hartford, a city who trusted their native son to do the best for them.",

Olmsted Brothers were hired by the company to design the neighborhood.<br /> <br /> Unique from the onset, Laurelhurst had already set aside land for a park, school, and women’s home. The neighborhood took shape around the natural topography of the land. While many subdivisions use the easiest road methods, a grid format, Olmsted Brothers utilized a curving, tree-lined plan following the natural contours of the site.<br /> <br /> Green space was preserved for the common enjoyment of the community, and special care was given to the views a resident would get while walking through Laurelhurst’s streets. The idea that harmonious living could be achieved through landscape design can still be seen in Laurelhurst’s entrance arches, the tree-lined blocks and circular street patterns.",

Highland Park sits by Pinnacle Hill, the highest point in Rochester, which Olmsted planted with pine trees and shrubs.<br /> <br /> Though planned and planted as an arboretum, Olmsted expertly designed Highland Park to seem like a natural occurrence of trees, shrubs, and flowers. Originally, Olmsted wanted nothing to do with this park. The area didn’t have any water features often featured in his landscapes, though Olmsted had already agreed to design Rochester’s Parks, and that meant all of them.<br /> <br /> In 1902, John Charles Olmsted visited Highland Park to view the new gatehouse at the reservoir. John Charles objected to the addition due to its blocking of the sidewalk. Regardless of his dislike, John Charles was unable to change the plan as work had already progressed too far. John Charles also objected to the use of pale, yellow brick, seeing it as out of harmony with the park scenery.",

Olmsted Brothers began their relationship in Dayton around 1894, after being contacted by John H. Patterson, founder of the National Cash Register Company.<br /> <br /> Patterson wanted Olmsted Brothers to study his land and see if it was suitable to develop a park and suburb on it. In 1903, John Charles and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. began work on Hills & Dales, with firm associate Percy Reginald Jones. They wanted a park that fit seamlessly with the neighborhood it surrounded, providing passive and active recreational features with open meadows, bridle paths, fishponds, and campgrounds. In the end, Patterson gave 289 acres of parkland to Dayton, leaving the rest to develop a subdivision.",

Gallagher performed the original assessment of the property, praising the natural scenic views provided from the wooded hill site, with good views of neighboring land.<br /> <br /> Gallagher suggested that clearing and grading should be done with a view to preserving and protecting the land's memorable characteristics. Monuments were to be designed with tasteful details to avoid monotony and an excess of ornamentation. As for plantings, trees and shrubs would be spread out among the plots and monuments, with rock outcroppings reserved for scenic views.",

    "bodyText": "Work on the Hinckley School in Maine was first begun by Charles Rust Parker in 1914, when the school hired him for a campus extension. Parker began his career with Olmsted Brothers after graduating from Phillips Andover Academy in 1901. Parker stayed with Olmsted Brothers, learning everything he could until 1910, at which point he left Brookline to open his own practice in Portland, Maine.<br /> <br /> Wanting a home-like campus, Parker implemented a curvilinear road system, stone entrance gates, an artificial pond, and outdoor athletic fields. He also chose the location for new dorms, a dining hall, gymnasium, and the school’s administrative building. Parker also wove paths through woods and meadows, and spaced-out stone monuments across the campus, many of whom were leaders in the outdoor movement.<br /> <br /> During WWI, Parker closed his practice, choosing to lend his talents to the United States government. In 1919, he returned home to Maine, but this time as an employee for Olmsted Brothers. The Hinckley School reached out to Olmsted Brothers in 1926, and with his extensive knowledge of the site, Parker led the design, working until 1928.",

    "bodyText": "<p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">The Hollow is a lush, green, secluded area, deliberately tucked in a shaded, sunken corner between the office wing and the street. Fairsted's Hollow is a miniature version of the lyrical and naturalistic \"secret gardens\" Olmsted used in his designs for larger public parks. The Hollow is designed for contemplation- a hideaway in which to receive spirit and briefly forget the daily stress of life.</p> <p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">An early incarnation of the Hollow existed when Olmsted arrived in 1883. As with his park projects, Olmsted determined which natural or found aspects to respect, and which to change. It is possible he was referring to the Hollow when he wrote, \"I don't object to the cutting away of certain bramble patches if bramble patches are to take their place...Less wilderness and disorder I object to.\"</p> <p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">The Hollow provided Olmsted with a place to practice landscape art in the \"picturesque\" mode- a wild, romantic, and rugged style that mirrors the site's natural topography and builds on what English essayist Alexander Pope called \"the genius of the place.\" Olmsted graded and filled some of the irregular topography here, while respectfully adapting his design to the existing framework- to the mysteries and glories of nature.</p> <p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">The gentle slopes that surround the Hollow- from the vine entangled ledges to the banked plantings of trees, shrubs, perennials, and bulbs- teem with layers of greenery in various forms, textures, and values of color, with no single planting demanding attention. What one sees today reflects what journalist Hazel Collins observed in 1903: \"the little dell...is planted with bushes, shrubs, wild flowers and ferns in picturesque confusion.\"</p>",

While Bouton was heavily involved, in 1924 he enlisted Olmsted Brothers to plan the suburb. Olmsted Brothers plan ensured sensitivity to the area’s existing landscape.<br /> <br /> A chain of stream-fed ponds already dug were retained and enhanced, becoming a defining feature of the community, with curving roads along the water. Olmsted Brothers also included a street hierarchy, where broad boulevards ran through the neighborhood, serving as gateways, with smaller streets insulating residents from the city’s noise and traffic.<br /> <br /> Lining the streets were sidewalks and large canopy trees, with hoses set back to create ample front lawns. Additionally, parcels were set aside for community uses such as parks, schools, and churches. In combination with careful street planning, Homeland also had underground conduits for telephone and electric cables, streetlights, and separated sewers from stormwater and sanitary water.",

    "bodyText": "When Walter Hubbard was preparing to donate 1,800 acres of land to Meriden, he knew he wanted to have a heavy say in the layout of the future park. Hubbard also knew the importance of bringing in a professional, so he enlisted Olmsted Brothers to help plan the park that would be his namesake.<br /> <br /> Hubbard worked specifically with John Charles Olmsted, inviting him to visit the land and make recommendations on its design and layout. After visiting, Hubbard and Olmsted would exchange several letters between 1898 and 1899, and it’s clear that Hubbard seriously considered Olmsted’s recommendations, evidenced by the fact that letters describe in detail the present situation of the park.<br /> <br /> In their correspondences, the two discussed numerous details like water flow, tree placement, ravines, and ridges, as well as the best areas to take in the views, and settle in for a picnic. Hubbard relied heavily on Olmsted to give the park its rustic style, the trademark of the park.<br /> <br /> At times, Olmsted and Hubbard butt heads on the design of the park. While both propose a shelter at the east end of the park, Hubbard believes it should be made like a Greek temple, while Olmsted protested that it should be built roughly, with local stones. In the end, Olmsted prevailed in convincing Hubbard of the design.<br /> <br /> Though Hubbard never worked with Olmsted Sr., he was certainly inspired by the creation of Central Park. When Hubbard gifted the land to Meriden, he specified that everything connected with the park was to remain free of charge. Unlike Olmsted, Hubbard had difficulty planning a park that would have permanent effects.<br /> <br /> While Olmsted Brothers may have never prepared any plans for Hubbard Park, their suggestions for road and walkway designs live on.",

    "bodyText": "The story of the I.W. Bernheim Arboretum and Herbarium is a rags to riches story. In 1867, eighteen-year-old Isaac W. Bernheim immigrated to the United States from Germany with only $4 in his pocket. After several years struggling to make a living as a peddler, jumping from New York, to Pennsylvania and New Jersey, finally moving to Kentucky to go into the distilling business.<br /> <br /> Over the years he achieved great wealth and success through his Bernheim Brothers Distilling Company and their famous bourbon. His love of sculptures and the community in which he made his fortune manifested in several gifts: a statue of Abraham Lincoln for the Louisville Free Public Library and Thomas Jefferson in front of the Jefferson County Courthouse.<br /> <br /> In 1929, Bernheim bought and endowed the land that would become the I.W. Bernheim Arboretum and Herbarium, which now stretches over 16,000 acres, as a gift to the people of his new homeland. Bernheim’s goal was to provide a place where the bond between people and nature could be renewed and restored. His vision included an arboretum and natural forested areas infused with the arts, providing a unique site to experience nature.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers would begin work on a site plan for the Arboretum and Herbarium in 1931, and their original landscape design was adopted in 1935. Work continued until 1950, as the land was prepared to Bernheim’s intentions. Following the Olmsted Brothers plan, three small lakes and a road traversing the land were built before any of the collection was planted.",

Working at the University for a total of seven years, Olmsted Brothers developed 161 plans for the campus.<br /> <br /> In a June 1936 letter to Indiana University’s Board of Trustees, Olmsted Brothers sent photographs of two models done for schools, one for Phillips Andover Academy, the other for Phillips Exeter Academy. Olmsted Brothers believed the University could seriously benefit from studying the model, particularly regarding the future development of the campus.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers wanted the University’s trustees to understand how much easier it would be to experiment with models when deciding sites for new buildings, specifically its size, form, and character. Models allowed everyone to visualize the problem, leading to conclusions with clearer understanding.<br /> <br /> After having already placed some buildings on campus, Olmsted Brothers noted that had a model been available, they likely would have chosen a different site, one less crowded. Olmsted Brothers also encouraged the University to place a potential model in a highly trafficked part of campus, so people would frequently see it, and get enthusiastic about the new design.<br /> <br /> Though Olmsted Brothers warned Indiana University that purchasing a model may seem like a large expenditure, one could reasonably call it insurance for the development of a well-organized and efficient plan.",

This potential change upset many in the campus community, with an appeal from Iowa State’s alumni stating that “this change from the natural or English-park style so carefully planned, and tried for nearly forty years on our grounds, to the formal or French style, so artificial and as we believe so unsuited”.",

As a result of this meeting, the Louisville Park Commission was formed to create a network of parks and boulevards, the last major park system of Olmsted Sr.’s career.<br /> <br /> Three large parks would anchor the system along the city’s perimeter, with Iroquois Park, laying at the Southern edge. Louisville’s mayor Charles Jacob personally purchased the property that Iroquois Park would sit on. For Iroquois Park, Olmsted envisioned a scenic reservation on a rugged, steep, heavily wooded hillside.<br /> <br /> Built on 739-acres, Iroquois Park is the largest in Olmsted’s Louisville Park System. The hillside Iroquois Park sits on is covered with an old-growth forests, prompting Olmsted to call it “Louisville’s Yellowstone”. Olmsted designed paths through the park to dramatize the forested landscape to achieve changing, panoramic, scenic vistas from overlooks.",

    "bodyText": "In the Summer of 1890, Frederick Law Olmsted was hired to design the grounds of the Chicago World’s Fair. One year later in July, Marquette, Michigan resident John Longyear wrote to Olmsted, asking him to come to Marquette at his earliest convenience to create plans for his estate.<br /> <br /> Longyear was anxious to have the grounds landscaped. After his first visit in 1891, Olmsted agreed the following year to create a model of the plantings he envisioned at the estate. The uneven terrain of the area presented a challenge for Olmsted, which he chose to fix by covering the grounds with creeping plants, shrubs, and vines. Olmsted wrote that “We believe that in general it is not advisable to keep such steep banks in turf, as it is very difficult to mow…and almost impossible to keep the turf in perfect condition…”, though with bushes, vines and trees, the area would be more picturesque and interesting.<br /> <br /> With the Chicago World’s Fair occupying much of his time, Olmsted sent firm member Warren Manning to supervise plantings at the site. To begin, Olmsted believed that the three acres to be planted should first be dug up and prepared with muck and stable manure.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the severe winter climate presented a challenge to the plantings. After the first Winter, Longyear wrote Olmsted reporting that some plants had not survived the cold months. Olmsted and Manning recommended replanting some of the area with wild roses and huckleberries. In 1897, Longyear and Olmsted began wrapping up their correspondences, with suggestions to expand the gardens to include tulips, crocuses, daffodils, and many species of fruit trees.",

    "bodyText": "In 1895, James Walker Tufts of Boston, Massachusetts commissioned Olmsted, Olmsted, and Eliot to design a planned resort community in North Carolina. Later named Pinehurst, it was one of the earliest planned resort communities in the United States. While the plan for Pinehurst was conceived by Frederick Law Olmsted, it was Warren Manning who carried it out.<br /> <br /> For Pinehurst, Olmsted introduced a system of curvilinear roads in the picturesque style, which he also applied at Riverside, Chicago, and many of his planned communities and subdivisions. Like Riverside planning, curved roads in Pinehurst creates an abundance of green space within the plan, as well as discouraging traffic, providing a quiet, peaceful neighborhood to locals.",

The year is 1869, the Civil War has been over for four years, and Chicago’s South Park Commission has just been established to oversee the development of the city’s green spaces.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{160}\" paraid=\"31800513\">Immediately, Central Park’s great duo of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux are contacted. Chicagoans were already familiar with the pairs work, since they had designed Riverside village. Olmsted always made sure his designs incorporated natural features of the site, and Jackson Park was no different. Water was meant to be the unifying feature of Chicago’s parks, and was a big reason why Olmsted chose Jackson Park as the site of the World’s Fair: the view of Lake Michigan.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{164}\" paraid=\"544569347\">When writing about where both the park and fair should be, Olmsted said “There is but one object of scenery near Chicago of special grandeur or sublimity, and that, the lake, can be made by artificial means no more grand or sublime. The lake, may, indeed, be accepted as fully compensating for the absence of sublime or picturesque elevations of land”</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{168}\" paraid=\"19870530\">Olmsted was able to begin designing the inland portion of the park before The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 hit, which put all developments on hold as Chicago worked to rebuild itself. Construction on Jackson Park wouldn’t begin again until 1890, at which point Olmsted began splitting his time between Chicago, and the Biltmore in North Carolina.</p> <p paraeid=\"{c33850f5-7168-4e9e-93b0-cd9547911a70}{172}\" paraid=\"1708335305\">Before Olmsted arrived in Chicago, the site of Jackson Park was a marshy, uninviting, wind-swept dune. However, out of this environment Olmsted was able create a series of basins and lagoons along the shore, protecting visitors and creating a more peaceful environment. Olmsted’s objective in the environment he created was to elicit the intense emotion that nature and beauty cause.</p>",

Visitors can fish (by permit), and the pond is stocked each year. A beautiful 1.5-mile path around the pond is a favorite of strollers and runners alike. In October, the annual Lantern Festival brings thousands of people, some in full Halloween costume, for a walk around the pond to create their own \"<em>flickering half-lights</em>.\" <br /> <br /> When Olmsted began work on the Necklace, Jamaica Pond was laying in waste with a contaminated water supply. Olmsted urged the Boston Park Commission to incorporate the pond and surrounding area into the Emerald Necklace, believing he could save this “<em>natural sheet of water, with quiet, graceful shores, rear banks of varied elevation and contour, for the most part shaded by a fine natural forest growth</em>”. Olmsted’s work at Jamaica Pond can be described as a minimalist design, adding vegetation to compliment the natural scenery he so admired. Olmsted’s greatest designs always showcased pre-existing points of interest at the scene, and current restoration ensures those vistas remain.",

On a stump-studded open space, John Charles recommended clearing the level land and developing it into ball fields bordered by already existing trees and shrubs. Additionally, John Charles suggested adding two pleasure drives and a boulevard for vehicles and several walks, all branching off from a main circuit walk around the perimeter of the park for pedestrians.<br /> <br /> John Charles proposed that “at suitable places vistas between the plantations should be arranged to command the distant views of Lake Washington.” First known as Beacon Hill Park but later renamed Jefferson Park, was meant to be linked to other Seattle parks through boulevards. John Charles suggested Board of Park Commissioners build a drive from the far corner of Jefferson Park to Lake Washington Parkway.<br /> <br /> At Jefferson Park, John Charles’ preliminary 1912 plan included a golf course, ballfields, playgrounds, a running track, and shelter serving as an overlook. A walkway encircled the reservoirs and allowed pedestrian access to the views out over the city and the bay on the western and northern sides of the reservoirs.",

While John Charles Olmsted usually handled designs in the Pacific Northwest, his death four years earlier gave associate partner James Frederick Dawson a chance to lead a design. Dawson had already done extensive work in Seattle, with John Charles, and he created several preliminary plans for the Jefferson Park Tract.<br /> <br /> The subdivision would encompass land next to Jefferson Park Golf Course, so Dawson explored several possibilities for the land. A preliminary plan of March 17<sup>th</sup>, 1925 included the nine hole golf course, a clubhouse, and an additional 101 lots for homes, many bordering the golf course. One month later, a new plan had lots along curved drives on hillsides, and straighter streets in the valley area.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Dawson’s plan was never carried out and the hillside portion of the tract was acquired by the City of Seattle. Today, what would have been Jefferson Park Tract is part of the Cheasty Greenspace, the largest wooded parkland located in the Rainier Valley.",

    "bodyText": "When entrepreneur and philanthropist John Hopkins donated money for both a university and a hospital, he likely knew the medicinal benefits the hospital provide. Hopkins never knew the health benefits his University would provide to students, thanks to Olmsted Brothers.<br /> <br /> In 1904, Olmsted Brothers were asked to design a myriad of plans for the University, which they worked on till 1917. The plans established two quadrangles for the campus, as well as grading around academic buildings.<br /> <br /> In their 1904 report, Olmsted Brothers proposed dividing the University’s large land, keeping most for the campus, but others to be used as parkland. The University agreed with Olmsted Brothers, which is why you can find Wyman Park walking distance from campus.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers identified Wyman Park as one of the finest single passages of scenery so close to a major city they had ever seen. With Olmsted Brothers adding more green space on campus, as well as another retreat off campus, both the hospital and the university at John Hopkins provides good health and wellness.",

    "bodyText": "Prior to the 1920s, Kansas City, Missouri, had erected few public memorials, however, the Liberty Memorial of 1925 was stylistically unlike the statues, plaques, fountains, and columns of earlier commissions. With close to 400,000 U.S. casualties of World War One, and 441 coming from Kansas City, their sacrifices were deserving of a structure that would stand for generations.<br /> <br /> Built on over forty-seven acres, the 217-foot-tall limestone-clad tower emits steam that, at night, is illuminated by red and orange light to create a flamelike effect. The central shaft is decorated with four sculpted figures symbolizing Sacrifice, Honor, Courage, and Patriotism. While the structure was completed by 1926, landscape work continued until 1938.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers was hired to design the landscape of the Liberty Memorial, with Frederick Law Olmsted Jr and Percival Gallagher taking the lead. Olmsted Jr. outlined a memorial with rows of maple and oak. At the Southern End of the memorial, there are two groves of trees with memorial plaques. Olmsted Brothers had recommended more elaborate planting plans, but they were never executed.",

Now Olmsted Brothers, John Charles Olmsted based his plan for Keney Park off Charles Eliot’s originals. They intended for the park to have a series of regional landscapes like meadows and forests.<br /> <br /> Firm associate Percival Gallagher was tasked with overseeing the construction of the park’s pastoral scenery, supervising the transportation of over half a million yards of earth, and planting native foliage.

While Ohio architect Frank Andrews designed the building, the grounds were left to Olmsted Brothers, making it one of the eleven capitol buildings the Olmsted firm worked on.<br /> <br /> Receiving over one million dollars in federal funds, as reparations for damages suffered during the Civil War as well as compensation for services rendered during the Spanish-American War, Olmsted Brothers began their involvement on the project in 1905.<br /> <br /> Between 1908 and 1910, Olmsted Brothers generated several plans for the Kentucky State Capitol, before its completion in 1910. Like other capitol buildings the Olmsted firm had worked on, the Kentucky State Capitol was situated on a peninsula overlooking a hill.<br /> <br /> The neoclassical building is oriented on a north-south axis and set on a pedestal rising above a paved terrace, allowing for expansive views. The Kentucky State Capitol is nestled within expansive sloped parkland, with trees all along the perimeter.<br /> <br /> Renovations in 1984 led to the reestablishment of the original Olmsted design, including a circular entry drive and brick terraces surrounding the building. As with many Olmsted-designed landscapes being reworked, the plans stored at Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site were crucial to its completion.",

He contracted Olmsted Brothers to create the layout for the residential development.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers respected the natural topography of the land, which was accentuated with rock outcroppings. With irregular parcels of land ranging in size from less than one acre to over four, Olmsted Brothers chose to include circular roadways, to give more depth to the land.<br /> <br /> Khakum Wood was planted with mountain laurel, dogwoods, azaleas, and evergreens, with a lake as the centerpiece.

    "bodyText": "In 1888, the Swampscott Land Trust purchased 130 acres of the Mudge Estate, the summer home of a wealthy Boston family. The Trust commissioned Frederick Law Olmsted to plan the North Shore’s first residential subdivisions.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s vision, like in many of his designs, was to encourage the full utilization of the area’s natural topography, which he did by creating curvilinear roads to go around the landscape. As always, he didn’t want decorative elements to take precedence, and made sure to harmonize the man-made structures with the picturesque landscape.<br /> <br /> For New Englanders in the late 19th century, Swampscott, an esteemed seaside resort community, was the perfect place to spend summers. From all over New England peopled flocked to Swampscott for the town’s fresh ocean air, picturesque scenery, and warm hospitality.<br /> <br /> In 1895, the Olmsted firm was contracted to begin improvements on King’s Beach. Despite the hundred plus years since work on the beach and residential neighborhood commenced, the area is exceptionally well preserved. So, the beach you see behind Jennifer Lawrence is exactly the way the Olmsted firm left it, with the addition of a few buildings.",

After the 1921 death of John Charles Olmsted, the year the park was commissioned, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. would take over and finish the park, which took over three years to complete.<br /> <br /> From the outset, frequent flooding was a major concern for the site. Olmsted recognized the effect a flood might have on the land and designed two plans for Kirby Park, one to be implemented if a levee were built before the park, and one if the park was built first.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. was determined to develop an uninterrupted, pleasant rural and sylvan scenery for his successful country park. As development occurred, an additional donation from Kirby allowed Wilkes-Barre to acquire an additional one hundred acres, expanding the park’s land.",

In 1916, Atlanta City Council adopted John Charles’ master plan for Grant Park.

Olmsted enhanced viewpoints to exaggerate distance and scale, making the park seem much larger than it is. Lake Park’s boundary is thickly planted to shut out the city and by preserving the forest and enhancing streams, Olmsted made the park seem as natural as possible.",

Glencoe was a rural village connected to Chicago by train, which made developing in the area attractive to those who desired a quiet place away from the city to relax, socialize, and enjoy the outdoors.<br /> <br /> One year after that idea became a reality when 127 acres of mostly muddy scrubland was purchased. John Charles and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. were hired to develop the property and worked with the architect to ensure didn’t obtrude onto the landscape but matched perfectly.<br /> <br /> The Olmsted’s were heavily involved in the planting treatment of the overall property, and the intention of their design was to make visitors more conscious of their natural surroundings. The Clubhouse was built to maximize natural light, with large doors leading to an expansive terrace, with views of a vast lawn and Lake Michigan.",

It would scarcely be possible to solve the problem in a more hideous manner than has been done in this case.”<br /> <br /> During the planning stages of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, Lake Washington Boulevard was intended to serve as the vehicular entry to the Exposition grounds, showcasing the beauty of Seattle’s scenery along Lake Washington.",

Writing in his Preliminary Plan, Olmsted recognized that “the distant landscape is not only sublime in its vastness, but full of delicate ethereal beauty”. Olmsted was faced with the challenge of designing a community in a dry mountainous region lacking proper irrigation.<br /> <br /> Developers didn’t give up and gave the community their water source by damming Bear Creek and creating Lake Wauconda, which is also what they wanted to name their subdivision. Despite planning around large formations of stones which dominated the landscape and sketching several designs, Lake Wauconda subdivision never came to be. Ownership was passed around until the area was developed as a resort community.",

Additionally, the Waverly Fairgrounds horse trotting track was also acquired.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers, led by John Charles Olmsted, were hired to transform the mosquito-ridden Weequahic Lake and its surrounding land into a naturalistic landscape with broad lawns, forested groves, and an 80-acre lake. Finishing his plan in 1901, Weequahic Park was influenced by the City Beautiful movement, which originated at Frederick Law Olmsted Sr.’s design of the World’s Columbian Exposition of Chicago in 1893.<br /> <br /> In addition to the lake, Weequahic Park contains various pavilions, structures, and sports facilities like the now demolished grandstand, a half-mile racetrack, a golf course and tennis courts. A residential neighborhood developed along the western edge of the park with architecturally significant middle-income housing and mansions.",

Baltimore purchased six acres of land to create a park, hoping to serve the residents of this heavily industrialized area. Olmsted Brothers were soon hired to design the landscape, which would include playgrounds and venues for active recreation.<br /> <br /> Situated on land that slopes down, Olmsted Brothers chose to establish three distinct, generally flat areas, that would be separated by slight elevation changes. Primary access to Latrobe Park is along the northern border, lined with mature canopy trees. A brick and concrete staircase leads to a central promenade that traverses an open lawn.<br /> <br /> The center of Latrobe Park includes a grove of trees at the end of the central path which is flanked by playgrounds and open lawn. While this area once afforded views of the river, a dense tree canopy now screens the nearby highway and maintains the pastoral atmosphere of the site.",

With only a budget of $20,000, and working in harsh winter conditions, Olmsted Brothers tasked partner Henry Hubbard with the design.<br /> <br /> Hubbard was tasked with transforming the “nose of a little hill” into a spiral of two terraces climbing up the hill’s slope. When it came to construction for the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, the Civilian Conservation Corps were commissioned, working until 1940.<br /> <br /> When development began, Hubbard created a clay model of two semicircular stone block terraces hugging the face of the hill, connected by steps leading to a lookout. Models were created at the request of a client and were almost immediately taken apart after completion of the design. After Hubbard created his model for the Spelman Memorial, he took a light and tracked the path of sunlight, to ensure that light shined on the memorial. This extra attention to detail is what helped make the Olmsted firm so prolific.",

Olmsted’s goal was to foster a vibrant academic community in a parklike setting.<br /> <br /> As always, Olmsted worked closely with the architects on the project, this time Peabody & Stearns, to choose an appropriate place for the dozen school buildings. The plan for the all-boys boarding school was inspired by great English institutions, with buildings arranged around a central green.<br /> <br /> At Lawrenceville School, Olmsted created a living museum for students, with 371 different species of trees planted throughout the landscape. Many of the trees Olmsted planted were only four to five feet tall and were left over from his work at the Arnold Arboretum.<br /> <br /> Olmsted was in constant contact with the headmaster at Lawrenceville, sending him various letters during the planning and execution of the design. In the 1920s, Lawrenceville expanded to accommodate its growing population. Olmsted Brothers served as the consulting landscape architects at that time. A walk around Lawrenceville School today will still show you Olmsted Sr.’s original vision.",

    "bodyText": "Twice in his career, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. issued reports on Baltimore’s park resources, both times recommending expanding existing parks and creating new ones. Olmsted’s goal for Baltimore was to achieve a “roughly equitable distribution” or park amenities for everyone.<br /> <br /> The star of Olmsted Jr.’s report, Development of Public Grounds for Baltimore, was the concept of the stream valley park, which according to Olmsted Jr., had several advantages. Those advantages included the fact that the scenery along the streams was one of the city’s greatest assets, lowlands could be purchased for a modest price, and in Olmsted Jr.’s own words, a stream valley “cannot be built on, it cannot be left in irresponsive private hands, but it can be used to great advantage for park purposes.”<br /> <br /> In 1939, Olmsted Jr. reported to Baltimore that he had examined the roughly hundred sites the city had put as the next park and had chosen Leakin Park. He reminded Baltimore officials that Leakin Park must be in a neighborhood where recreational space was lacking, and that the park should provide diverse activities for people of differing ages and social classes.<br /> <br /> In addition to supporting Leakin Park, Olmsted Jr. explained why certain parts of the city shouldn’t be considered for a new park. Acquiring land in the inner city would be too costly, and while the eastern portion of the city needed a park, declining population was the reason Olmsted didn’t believe a park could work there. In the end, Olmsted Jr. was correct in picking Leakin Park, which became Baltimore’s largest park, and one of the largest wilderness woodland parks on the East Coast.<br /> <br />  ",

A picturesque park with rolling terrain and broad vistas, all framed by trees, Fulton Park is home to meadows punctuated by ponds and streams, woodlands filled with stone walls and hiking paths, lush gardens, and recreational facilities.<br /> <br /> It was William E. Fulton, President of the Waterbury Farrel Foundry and Machine Company, who in 1919, after acquiring land no longer being used by the city, contacted Olmsted Brothers to begin designing his park. Fulton Park embodies the democratic Olmsted approach to designing parks- provide an escape for city residents where they could nourish their physical, social, and emotional needs.",

When John Charles and firm member James Frederick Dawson first visited the site that would become Liberty Park, they were thoroughly impressed with the area’s hills, valleys, and basalt outcroppings.<br /> <br /> After viewing the land, John Charles thought it was unsuited for development, but would be the ideal location for a park. Liberty Park was developed under John Charles’ recommendations, with structures like an arbored terrace and a promenade. Liberty Park was meant to fit into its surroundings, and in 1908, the plan for Liberty Park was approved and construction began.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Liberty Park would be changed forever in 1968 when Washington State placed I-90 directly through the heart of Liberty Park. The Interstate took nearly 19-acres of Liberty Park’s land, pond, and lakes. Construction on the interstate took at least two years, and once completed, one of Spokane’s prettiest parks envisioned by Olmsted Brothers was lost forever.",

When Olmsted Brothers first started work in 1907, their preliminary plan included a centrally located open green space, roughly in the shape of an ellipse, surrounded entirely by a roadway with lots for homes along the road. Olmsted Brothers also included a network of trails and interior roads that wound through the park.<br /> <br /> In addition to the mineral springs, Licton Springs Park was meant to include two ponds linked by streams, a forested interior, with paths and bridges. Unfortunately, the organic layout of the community, with its curving streets, homesites, and rustic park interior were never fully realized. From 1935 to 1960, the land had several different uses, from a farm to housing a small spa. In 1960 the park site became public land, with remnants of Olmsted Brothers scheme still present.",

Their hope was to create a special place for a burial, worthy of the wealth they had acquired in life.<br /> <br /> The group hired Olmsted Brothers to design a place of beauty and tranquility. As their father had taught them, Olmsted Brothers used the land generously to create a serene, parklike setting. When walking down the meandering paths, visitors see no graves, only towering oaks, maples, and endless rhododendrons.<br /> <br /> Only when you step off the path do you arrive at the grassy, intimate settings. These sections are family plots of 6 to 20 graves, all nestled in clusters of flowers and shrubs, with curved lines separating each grave.<br /> <br /> Over a hundred years later, those at Locust Valley Cemetery still work to preserve the landscape elements set forth by the Olmsted Brothers. The challenge is taking esthetic standards and applying them to modern, efficient land uses.",

While Olmsted Brothers had originally envisioned a Spanish or Mexican style design for the university, Link designed the campus with stucco walls, red-tiled rooftops, and extensive porticoes to emulate the Italian Renaissance style.<br /> <br /> Despite dropping the Olmsted Firm, the plan they had created for LSU was meant to be expanded, which is exactly what Link and future landscape architects did. To this day, the campus remains faithful to the Olmsted Brothers design.",

    "bodyText": "In 1891, Frederick Law Olmsted was invited to Louisville, Kentucky by a group of prominent citizens who formed the Salmagundi Club. They asked Olmsted to survey the land the Club had already acquired, creating one of five Olmsted systems in the country where parks and boulevards connect, creating a network of green space. The final design of the type for Olmsted Sr., it was one of two park systems designed by all three Olmsteds.<br /> <br /> Louisville’s Park System is anchored by three large parks along the perimeter of the city: Iroquois, Cherokee, and Shawnee. Each park takes advantage of the unique natural features in the area, such as diverse topography, riverfront views, and native woodlands. In addition to designing the city’s park system, the Olmsted firm also helped plan the city, residential subdivisions, estates, cemeteries, institutional and religious grounds, country clubs, and gardens. In all, the Olmsted firm designed eighteen parks, squares, and playgrounds throughout the city, as well as six parkways.",

    "bodyText": "After damming a nearby pond, a group of Lynn recreationists formed a public trust to help preserve the local forest. By 1882, the state legislature had already passed the Massachusetts Park Act, enabling any town in the state to establish a park commission and acquire land.<br /> <br /> In 1889, Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. was hired as a design consultant at Lynn Woods. In his recommendations, Olmsted stated that the area should be kept in its natural state as a rugged and wild forest. Design elements included in Olmsted’s design was a circuit system of carriage roads and walking trails. Additionally, Olmsted recommended street railway routes be extended, providing easy access to the woods for Lynn’s urban residents.<br /> <br /> As Greater Boston continued to grow, many scenic natural areas were being lost to development. By 1890, Lynn was one of the few communities in the area with protected municipal parkland. Olmsted firm member Charles Eliot praised Lynn for creating not only a large municipal park, but also a uniquely protected water supply.<br /> <br /> Describing Lynn Woods to the Boston Metropolitan Park Commission in 1893, Eliot wrote that “To-day the Lynn Woods embrace some two thousand acres, and constitute the largest and most interesting, because the wildest, public domain in all New England… Thus for the small sum of seventy thousand dollars the “city of shoes” has obtained a permanent and increasingly beautiful possession which is already bringing to her a new and precious renown.”",

Due to limited funding, only planting areas and fencing were installed. In 1984, a landscape rehabilitation project led to the construction of Parker’s formal entrance.

    "bodyText": "Community leaders of Maplewood, New Jersey (originally part of South Orange) were eager to create a recreational area for their residents. In 1922, community members reached out to Olmsted Brothers, requesting a general plan for their new park. The plan for the new park included a pond, playfields, tennis courts, and a memorial to those lost in WWI.<br /> <br /> Planting at Maplewood Park began in 1923 and was completed two years later, the only aspect of the Olmsted design that was implemented. The relationship between Olmsted Brothers and Maplewood was strained by differing opinions on design choices. One example of this is that Olmsted Brothers preferred a simple piece of granite for the base of the War Memorial, while the Memorial Committee preferred a large boulder, which was eventually chosen.",

    "bodyText": "When the Lincoln Administration passed The Morrill Act of 1862, it required all states to provide public lands for Land Grant Colleges. The Morrill Act promoted the “liberal and practical education of the industrial classes for the benefit of Agricultural & Mechanical Arts.”<br /> <br /> In 1864, six Amherst farms of 310 acres were purchased for the site of the new Massachusetts Agricultural College. In 1866, the board of Trustees for the future college asked Frederick Law Olmsted to submit a proposal for the campus and some buildings.<br /> <br /> Instead of siting the building as requested, Olmsted recommended that the entire college be located on the Eastern slope and be modeled after a typical New England village. Olmsted believed that “the individuality of an agricultural college lies in its agricultural setting, not in its buildings, which is a mere piece of apparel to be fitted to the requirements of the agricultural trunk.<br /> <br /> In his report, Olmsted recommended that a village green be constructed at the center of the farmland campus. This was the only recommendation of Olmsted’s the Board of Trustees took; they viewed his response to building placement to be an improper response to the assignment and fired him. The Board of Trustees then chose to site the college on the Western plateau.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s vision for a Campus Pond and its extensive surrounding lawns was accepted and is a great example of the early use of ecological principles in landscape architecture as well as a central gathering place and focus feature of the campus.",

    "bodyText": "In April of 1887, Frederick Law Olmsted submitted his designs for several parks falling under Buffalo’s Board of Park Commissioners control. Included in those plans was the design for Masten Place, which would be constructed on what was then Potter’s Field, a burial ground for Buffalo’s lower class. Construction of Masten Place began in the Spring of 1887 and was substantially completed that same year.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s design for Masten Place called for winding diagonal walks ten feet in width crossing the site from its corners, leaving an open turf playground area at the center. During the construction process, the site required considerable regrading to make it suitable for park purposes. Characteristic of similar Olmsted parks, thick plantings screened the site from the bustle of street traffic.<br /> <br /> In 1895 Masten Park became the focus of considerable local controversy when it was proposed as the site of a new high school. Despite strong opposition from Buffalo Park Commissioners, the school was built at the center of the plot. Although the new building destroyed its continued suitability as a public pleasure ground, the remainder of the site remained in the charge of the Park Board.",

A “once bucolic campus found itself an island in an industrial wasteland.” Unsure where to relocate, the Board of Trustees hired Frederick Law Olmsted to choose their new site.<br /> <br /> Evaluating various properties with an eye towards their atmospheric, structural, and moral conditions, in 1872 Olmsted landed on 107-acres of land in nearby Belmont. In a report to the Trustees, Olmsted wrote that “the wooded land of Belmont, judiciously thinned to groups and glades, opened by walks of long curves and easy slopes, would, by the time your buildings were ready for occupancy, afford what is chiefly wanted in this respect better than it would be possible to provide it, with the most generous use of all available means, in many years, either at the Arlington, Waltham or any other locality with which I am acquainted in the suburbs of Boston.\"<br /> <br /> Olmsted saw a clear advantage of the site, with the large numbers of well-grown trees that would spark a picturesque interest in the landscape. At McLean, Olmsted argued for villagelike groupings of cottages as opposed to a centralized hospital, as popularized by Dr. Thomas Kirkbride at the Pennsylvania Hospital in the 1850s. Olmsted thought this would make the landscape look more like a college campus, and less like a hospital.<br /> <br /> While the Trustees endorsed Olmsted’s plan, he was not hired to lay out the grounds. He would return to McLean at the end of his life, not for work, but to be institutionalized, as his family felt they could no longer care for him. Arriving in Belmont, Olmsted looks around and says “they didn’t follow my plans. Confound them.”",

Not only did Olmsted assist on the siting of buildings and roads, he also made recommendations for parks. To honor his commitment to D.C., McMillan Park was created and named in 1906 to honor the man so instrumental in shaping D.C.<br /> <br /> A result of the McMillan Plan and City Beautification Movement, McMillan Park was a collaboration between Olmsted Jr and architect Charles Platt. The 92-acre park was built as a water treatment plant, with only 25-acres being used for a leisure park.

    "bodyText": "In June of 1884, Frederick Law Olmsted was hired by a local from New London, Connecticut to design a park for the community. Olmsted’s concept for what would become Memorial Park emerges from his sketch studies. With the library sitting high on the site providing a commanding view of the city below, walking paths connect it to the area below. Olmsted wanted existing knolls and depressions excavated to accentuate grading changes and emphasize the upper lawn and terrace area.<br /> <br /> To connect paths, Olmsted planned for sequences of stairs, with low plants and vines covering the slope. On May 9<sup>th</sup>, 1885, Olmsted wrote to the New London Park Commission that “The outlook towards the Sound is not to be improved by producing superficially any suggestion of the 'natural' or existing conditions. (It would be very greatly improved by the purely artificial arrangements that have been suggested.) I can think of nothing better and nothing less costly to be done with the quarry district than to handle it as I have proposed, making a defile by excavating a considerable amount of rock; building the terraces so as to increase the effect of depth and abruptness or declivity in this defile; establishing pockets and making deposits of soil from which to grow vines and rock plants by which to tie the rock in place artificially to the rock set up, and soften the asperity, hardness, and coldness of the material, and by opening a convenient circuit of communication through the defile by which this otherwise intractable part of the property would be utilized and seem by contrast to give value to the other part in which there is a possibility of obtaining gracefulness of surface and more tranquility of character.”",

    "bodyText": "The grounds that would become Miantonomi Memorial Park were used as picnic grounds throughout the nineteenth century, until 1881 when Anson Stokes purchased it for farmland. After Stokes’s passing in 1913, his wife Helen inherited the property. Around that time, the Newport Improvement Association commissioned Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. to prepare a plan for overall improvements for the city. Within Olmsted’s Newport Plan, he urged the city to acquire Stokes’s property for a park.<br /> <br /> Olmsted submitted his plan to Newark in January of 1921. It included a main gated park entrance and a drive leading from the main entrance to a second, gated entrance. Also included in Olmsted’s plan was parking spaces, playing fields, and a small children’s playground in a regraded lawn area.",

    "bodyText": "In November of 1880, the newly formed Middlesex Fells Association reached out to Frederick Law Olmsted, to see if he would advise and plan a four-thousand-acre rural park in the rocky hills north of Boston. Olmsted had already visited Middlesex Fells before, and drawing from that experience, noted the importance of “distinguishing characteristics of each particular property”.<br /> <br /> Olmsted agreed to help design the Fells, which came “from an appreciation of the beauty & use of absolutely wild sylvan scenery it is most desirable to avoid complicating the purpose of preserving and developing such scenery”. Regarding the topography of the area, Olmsted advised to “take it as it stands, develop to the utmost its natural characteristics, and make a true retreat not only from town but from suburban conditions” and that “every inducement should be offered visitors to ramble and wander about.”<br /> <br /> After retiring in 1885, Olmsted would stop work on Middlesex Fells. However, his protégé Charles Eliot began putting together the nation’s first metropolitan park system. After the park system was established in 1893, Charles Eliot included the Fells, with Olmsted Brothers continuing their landscape work in the Fells Reservation.",

In 1892, Eliot wrote to Youngstown Park Commissioners stating that “your gorge is one of the finest park scenes in America and deserved more careful handling”.<br /> <br /> Until his untimely death in 1897, Charles Eliot assisted in laying out drives and trails highlighting the most dramatic natural elements of the 440-acre gorge. A close friend of Eliot’s, Warren H. Manning would be the next consulting landscape architect at Mill Creek Park.<br /> <br /> After being a member of the Olmsted Firm for nearly eight years, Manning left to start his own landscape architecture practice, and would be called on by Youngstown from 1920 to 1932. Manning’s design would extend the park significantly to include Bear Dens and abandoned sandstone quarry sites. Manning also included two more sandstone bridges and a shelter for the park.<br /> <br /> In 1948, Olmsted Brothers was again called on by Mill Creek Park, this time to add a second active sports area, which would be over 65-acres. In their design, Olmsted Brothers included open play areas surrounded by wooded margins.",

The Boulevard first served as the grand automobile entrance for the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, with John Charles hoping that the Boulevard would continue by the water’s shore, instead of cutting through a residential neighborhood.<br /> <br /> At Montlake boulevard, John Charles’ design called for cement sidewalks and trees separating those sidewalks from the street. For trees he suggested four rows of tall Tulip trees in line with the trolley polls. He envisioned the streetcar tracks would be set into the turf of the central \"parking strip.\"",

    "bodyText": "In 1880, Frederick Law Olmsted was commissioned to design over two hundred acres of depleted farmland for businessman John Charles Phillips. Instead of a well decorated country estate, Olmsted urged Phillips to use the surrounding landscape to his advantage, enhancing the natural beauty of nearby woodlands, meadows, and bodies of water.<br /> <br /> Collaborating with Peabody and Stearns, the Boston architects Phillips had chosen to build his mansion, Olmsted created a massive stone terrace overlooking Lake Wenham. In addition to lawns, hedges, rustic stone walls and a magnificent meadow, Olmsted integrated the latest advances in scientific farming and forest management.<br /> <br /> Just like in Back Bay, where Olmsted suggested the inclusion of Fens in the name, which described what the landscape was previously like, he left something in the name for Phillips. Olmsted suggested Moraine as the name for the estate, which in geology, is a ridge of glacial debris. Using the moraine as an elevated vantage, Olmsted created paths and carriage drives that looped through the seventy-five acres of forest, providing views of the lake and meadow.",

    "bodyText": "After having such a tumultuous relationship with Central Park’s Comptroller Andrew Haswell Green, it’s interesting that Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux would be so willing to work with Green again. However, differences were put aside to give New York City another park, though it wasn’t easy going.<br /> <br /> Andrew Haswell Green conceived the idea for Morningside Park in 1867, and four years later a plan proposal was submitted by New York Parks Engineer-in-Chief M.A. Kellogg, though it was rejected. In 1973, Olmsted and Vaux submitted their plan, but that was also rejected. Seven years later, architect Jacob Wrey Mould, who had also worked on Central Park, was hired to rework Olmsted and Vaux’s original plan.<br /> <br /> Fourteen years after their original proposal was rejected, and one year after Mould’s 1886 death, Olmsted and Vaux were once again hired to develop Morningside Park. Their second plan included expansive lawns, dense plantings of trees, and meandering paths- all meant to enhance the area’s natural beauty.<br /> <br /> Despite his death, even some of Mould’s designs were included, like the monumental entrance to Morningside Park. Old plans were also recycled in 1998 for the construction of the Kiel Arboretum, which was modeled on an 1858 Olmsted and Vaux design for Central Park that was never implemented.",

Overlooking Lake Washington, John Charles developed a subdivision that left the shoreline untouched from development, later being used as a park and boulevard, which John Charles had suggested in his 1903 plan.<br /> <br /> Aside from saving land and views for residents, Mount Baker Park accomplished other aspects of the 1903 plan. By connecting the subdivision to several boulevards in Seattle, wide, winding swaths of green space were set aside for the community.<br /> <br /> John Charles saw the potential in Seattle to thoughtfully integrate a subdivision with open green space. Writing to one of his contacts in Seattle while discussing Mount Baker Park, John Charles stated that \"I can say, and I do it with pleasure, that the project as a whole seems to be intelligently conceived, and if the proposed park features are finally adopted, it will certainly be to your credit in respect to the liberal treatment of the public in park matters, as well as in providing for future residents lands to be used in common, and in which remarkably beautiful views of and across Lake Washington, not to mention views of the Olympic Mountains in the other direction, can be enjoyed.\"",

    "bodyText": "In November of 1874, Frederick Law Olmsted would make his first official visit to Montreal and view the difficult conditions of Mount Royal. He warned Montreal Park Commissioners almost immediately that the land made it very unlikely a park could be built. Olmsted believed “rugged and broken ground is the last that should be chosen for a public recreation ground in the immediate vicinity of a large city”.<br /> <br /> The future park was located at a unique site. At the time, Montreal was 200 years old, with a population of 120,000, situated at the foot of a looming pile of rocks a mile long and a half mile wide. Calling it a mountain was generous, as it was only 735 feet high, but some of its sides could get incredibly steep, and surrounded by a countryside with a flat valley, it loomed over Montreal.<br /> <br /> In his first report to the Montreal Park Commission, Olmsted stressed “the power of scenery to eliminate conditions which tend to cause nervous depression or irritability”. He claimed that a charming natural scenery “acts in a more directly remedial way to enable men to better resist the harmful influences of ordinary town life”.<br /> <br /> Olmsted truly believed his parks would have a therapeutic effect on all who entered them, where people could enter a cheerfully musing state where the mind is left unoccupied. At Mount Royal Park, Olmsted thought that the mystical effect of this natural landscape would provide city dwellers with a therapeutic release.",

    "bodyText": "The Muddy River is a part of a system of brooks and ponds that run through sections of Boston's Emerald Necklace into the Charles River. Flowing north, it connects Jamaica Pond, Willow Pond, and finally Leverett Pond. At this point is a narrow channel that flows between Brookline and Boston eventually passing through the Back Bay Fens towards the Charles River. Before Olmsted, the river was a narrow, winding, and tidal and it was the tide that helped keep the stream relatively clean. By 1800 though, the pressures of an increasing population were changing the Muddy River from an inoffensive little stream into a source of disease, and its surroundings from a pleasant valley into a potential slum. Roads, railroad tracks and a tidal basin (built to generate power) all helped to interfere with the natural tidal action that twice a day, flushed the area out. The filling of the Back Bay at mid-century also helped to make sure that the 100 acres of marshland the river flowed through would be \"the filthiest marsh and mud flats to be found anywhere in the State of Massachusetts\" unless a pollution solution was found.<br /> <br /> Frederick Law Olmsted took the challenge of cleaning the Muddy River and redesigning it starting at the Back Bay Fens and continuing up to Jamaica Pond. He successfully cleaned out the dirty water and did away with the horrifying and putrid smell. Bridges played a critical role in his design. Not wanting to stop the flow of people across the city, multiple bridges were provided. Some were designed by Olmsted firm members, others by local architects including H.H. Richardson, and along this stretch of the Muddy River his successor firm, Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge. The Longwood Avenue Bridge is the largest of these bridges.<br /> <br /> Since the fall of 1996, the Muddy River has flooded three times, damaging local neighborhoods. This flooding called the city and state into action with the assistance of the Army Corps of Engineers. The Muddy River Restoration Project aims to improve flood control, water quality, wildlife habitat, and historic landscape treatments. The project is currently focusing on flood control and water quality to both recover from past damage and prevent future damage. The Army Corps of Engineers is leading this part of the project.",

President of the Museum of Art, Robert de Forest, worried about the planning of the neighborhood, and called on Olmsted Brothers in 1927 to improve the planning.<br /> <br /> Focusing on the area’s natural conditions and need of a community-centric design, Olmsted Brothers partner Edward Whiting created an efficient, aesthetically pleasing plan. To celebrate the connection to the Museum, tree-lined streets were named for artists, curving around the natural topography, designed with minimal access to the highway to avoid cut-through traffic.<br /> <br /> Within the Munsey Subdivision, five parks, a school, and three businesses were incorporated. By 1930, 162 homes were completed in the Colonial Revival style and work on a shopping center was underway. An attempt to put an eighteen-hole golf course failed and the land was returned for residential development.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/PAGE.IDC\">Olmsted Research Guide Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157665695952605/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/07435\">Olmsted Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/munsey-park\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation </a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.munseypark.org/\">Munsey Park</a>",

    "bodyText": "Remembering a President lost, all that he stood for, and how he evolved into the man he became, residents of Spencer County, Indiana recognized that Abraham Lincoln’s mother, Nancy Hanks had been a formative piece of Lincoln’s life. It was decided that a suitable memorial should be erected for Nancy.<br /> <br /> From 1922 to 1938, the State of Indiana hired Olmsted Brothers to design a memorial site. Frederick Law Olmsted Jr ensured the landscape retained a strong North/South axis, allowing for processional and contemplative experiences. This axis would connect the gravesite of Nancy Hanks to a visitor center and open court.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. took the lead in developing a plan to simplify the area around Nancy Hanks’ gravesite, whose landscape had been through many design changes over the years. A cruciform arrangement combining a main allée with plant beds was established, providing a “strong spiritual imagery”.<br /> <br /> Before briefly leaving, Olmsted Jr. proposed reforesting part of the site to provide a backdrop for the design. By 1983 Olmsted Jr. was called back to Spencer County, Indiana. The site needed a building facility and so Olmsted Jr proposed placing those buildings at the southern end of the allée.",

    "bodyText": "On the slopes of Rock Creek Park sits the 163-acre National Zoo, with Frederick Law Olmsted serving as the site’s landscape architect. Olmsted envisioned the zoo having a picturesque, park-like setting with a wide, gently curving path with rustic buildings nestled into the landscape. Using the flattest area to center the development, Olmsted believed the design should fit, as best it can, into a “consistent scheme for the future”.<br /> <br /> In 1892, Olmsted urged that \"the hardy grazing animals particularly should have the most ample possible paddocks,\" with his early design calling for extensive pastures. Olmsted Sr.’s work was advanced by John Charles and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr in 1905. Today, Olmsted Walk in the National Zoo takes visitors through a historic pedestrian promenade, just as planned by Olmsted Brothers.",

The 138-page document described an ambitious plan to construct wide boulevards and a new public plaza.<br /> <br /> In the opening paragraphs of the report, Olmsted Jr. described how he would transform New Haven from a “pleasant little New England college town” to a “widespread urban metropolis of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.” Olmsted Jr. called for more small parks for local purposes and warned against crowded tenements, which would result in filthy, ignorant people.<br /> <br /> In 1913, the City Plan Commission was established, and the next year, Olmsted Jr. was asked to provide landscape designs for the city, this time for the town Green, where he planned to plant double rows of elm trees. “A generous open space is needed” in New Haven, where visitors will have their first impression. The result is a benchmark of American urban planning and a perfect example of what a new city would look like in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.",

Olmsted had already shaped the grounds for some of Newport’s wealthiest residents in the early 1880s, their most important projects in the area were development conglomerates, using large swaths of land for residential enclaves.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr.’s design and plan for Newport was to enhance the existing setting and characteristics of the area. By emphasizing the natural assets of the area, and the borrowed views that are shaped by its topography, Olmsted Jr. was able to push for targeted designs for several other areas of Newport. Additionally, Olmsted Jr. felt the need to safeguard scenery found throughout the city, so he recommended building codes and street improvements that wouldn’t alter his design.",

    "bodyText": "While designed under the Olmsted Brothers firm, Newton City Hall was directed by Henry Vincent Hubbard, a firm employee, starting in 1931. Once clients, architect, and landscape architect agreed on a plan for the layout of the site, Hubbard then advised on an exact location for the building, as well as all matters relating to the grading, planting, road construction, or supervision of the site.<br /> <br /> Hubbard’s design for the grounds of Newton City Hall was elegant and dignified, fitting for the grand Georgian Revival building it surrounded. Hubbard turned the existing swamp and brook at the east end of the site into a link of picturesque ponds, offering dramatic reflections of the building.<br /> <br /> Debates between the City, architects, and Hubbard about how to maximize that reflection of City Hall in the water came up. Throughout the project Hubbard pressed for the creation of a basin and spillway to retain sand and silt, preventing the water from getting clogged. Although the city considered the idea, no basin was constructed.<br /> <br /> The landscape composition, which called for an expansive open lawn, was segregated from its surrounding by borders of trees and shrubs. Carefully planned vista openings were implemented, allowing framed views of City Hall and the nearby War Memorial.<br /> <br /> Hubbard described the area around Newton City Hall as “simple but dignified and impressive”, with open lawns, specimen elms, formal pathways, and evergreen plantings enhancing the dominance of the building.",

    "bodyText": "Though Frederick Law Olmsted surely didn’t loose it when he first saw Niagara Falls, he was shocked by the landscape, upon which were “mills and factories everywhere, hovels, fences and patent medicine signs”. The Industrial Revolution of the early 19th century had taken the natural beauty of Niagara Falls and abused it, with buildings going up along the river to harness its power.<br /> <br /> Olmsted took his first trip to Niagara Falls in August 1869, while working on the Buffalo parks and parkway system. He was accompanied by William Dorsheimer, the district attorney for northern New York and the man who headed the Buffalo parkways commission as well as H.H. Richardson, a friend of Olmsted’s who was working on Dorsheimer’s estate. All three men were appalled with this marvelous view of nature being obscured.<br /> <br /> In the late 1860s, a small band of early environmentalists who were concerned over the river’s decreasing flow, founded the Free Niagara movement. Intellectuals like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Charles Darwin joined Olmsted in the Free Niagara movement. The movement believed that the natural beauty of the land surrounding Niagara Falls should be protected from commercial exploitations and remain free to the public.<br /> <br /> The breakthrough at Niagara Falls came in 1883 when Dorsheimer’s close friend, Grover Cleveland, became governor of New York, and signed a bill calling for the establishment of a state park at Niagara. The Niagara Appropriations Bill was signed into law in 1885, creating the Niagara Reservation. Park commissioners first began by clearing out structures that had blocked views along the upper rapids, limiting the number of factories in the areas downstream.<br /> <br /> Olmsted and Vaux began the landscaping that gives the American side of Niagara Falls its distinct character— ambling walkways and idyllic glades for visitors to contemplate the beauty of nature. Though the view looking into Canada has changed over time, if you’re willing to work for it, you can find certain spots where you’d see the same view Olmsted first did.",

    "bodyText": "While Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux worked on many aspects of the Buffalo Park System together, after breaking up their partnership in 1872, Olmsted was left to design Niagara Square on his own. Two years after the breakup with Vaux, Olmsted presented a report to the Buffalo Park Commission, rejecting their idea of transforming the square into a public garden. Instead, Olmsted suggested planting trees and providing seating along the square, as well as a fountain at the square’s center.<br /> <br /> Buffalo’s Board of Park Commissioners hired Henry Hobson Richardson to design an arch at the square, serving as a memorial to soldiers of the Civil War. For the placing, Olmsted requested the arch be “on one side of the Square and so as to span one of the wheel-ways…In this position it would be seen in its best aspect…The best light will then fall upon it; its inscriptions will therefore be more legible and its sculpture will have the best effect.” While Olmsted’s plan was approved, construction never commenced due to lack of funding, and today, the McKinley monument stands at the center of Niagara Square in memory of the President.",

The North Easton Railroad Station would feature the same architectural details often found in other train stations in the area designed by Richardson. Olmsted’s simple landscape provided harmony between the built and natural world.<br /> <br /> The landscape around North Easton Railroad Station is a longstanding part of the town’s history, with sycamore trees standing tall outside. The station was in active operation from 1883 to 1959 and has since been converted to the Easton Historical Society and Museum.",

Having spent some time running his own farm on Staten Island, Olmsted viewed himself as an experienced farmer, and was particularly interested in designing Ophir Farm.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s time spent as a farmer shaped his approach to Ophir farm. Unfortunately, Olmsted had created such an elaborate design for the barns, that when the Reid’s opened their grand estate in 1892, the barns were still not completed.<br /> <br /> Reid had already acquired the professional help of architects McKim, Mead & White, who he wrote to at the end of 1892, stating that his “fear is that under the inspiration of Mr. Olmsted and with general tendencies of architects, he may be giving me a much finer thing than I want or rather much finer than I want to pay for”.<br /> <br /> Six years after Reid had asked Olmsted to choose a site and sketch plans for the farm building, construction of the barn began. Through 1895 the work proceeded without any delays, in part because Mead took over as chief architect when Olmsted fell ill. Today, remnants of Olmsted’s grand barn still exist.",

Working with architect Bertram Goodhue, Olmsted designed the grounds for the estate, known as Ormston, from 1912 to 1918. Aldred requested the land to be modeled after an English garden, with one hundred and twelve acres to work with.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers’ plan included a covered bathhouse, “two tennis courts…just south of a clump of oak trees”, and a greenway extending from the vicinity of the bathhouse across the field to a point where it enters the woods.” In 1944, the Tudor-style home and grounds were purchased by the Ukrainian Catholic Rite Basilian Fathers Josaphat, and now serves as a monastery.",

Designing the fieldstone school was Kirtland Cutter, who frequently collaborated with the Olmsted’s. Three years later in 1911, Olmsted Brothers drew up preliminary plans for the landscape of the school, creating separate play areas for boys, girls, and younger children.<br /> <br /> In Olmsted Brothers’ design for the school, they created a circular entry drive, lawns fenced in to protect the children, and trees planted along the perimeter. Unfortunately, the landscape crafted by Olmsted Brothers was lost in 1923 when the school burnt down, and a replacement was built on the site.",

One can make out the original stone steps, an archway, water fountains, benches, and other architectural features.Though a fire in the 1940’s wiped out most of the building, the path around the two-story structure stills offers the original “Overlook” view down onto the Playstead sports area. Despite being only ruins, in 1966 Boston activist Elma Lewis revived the ruins as a concert venue, offering free musical performances to her community.",

Originally both John Charles and Frederick Jr were working on the project, however World War One caused years of delays, and by the time work resumed in 1920, John Charles had died, and the development of Palos Verdes was left to Frederick Jr.</p> <p paraeid=\"{43bdbc95-6ab5-4663-a823-b0feaa7d5b20}{23}\" paraid=\"1732776118\">Jr. was assigned the task of replicating a Mediterranean oasis in Palos Verdes, and it would become one of Olmsted Brothers largest and most complex projects. Taking input from scientists, engineers and horticulturists, Jr. transformed Palos Verdes from a rugged, hilly terrain to 16,000 acres of homes, country clubs, resorts, golf courses, and parks.</p> <p paraeid=\"{43bdbc95-6ab5-4663-a823-b0feaa7d5b20}{27}\" paraid=\"273588745\">In a 1923 report explaining his decisions on the entrance to Palos Verdes, Jr. would \" advise against a large plaza or any other marked demonstration at the property line where it would be liable to be spoiled by developments in contact with it outside the property. I think the most effective treatment at the entrance will be… passing through this sylvan gateway for a considerable distance then widen out into an impressive demonstration where the view of the valley and hills and sea can burst upon one.”</p> <p paraeid=\"{43bdbc95-6ab5-4663-a823-b0feaa7d5b20}{39}\" paraid=\"1716992846\">Even though the entirety of Olmsted Brothers’ plan was never realized, the concept they brought to Palos Verdes of a controlled, exclusive, Mediterranean-style community lives on, and has influenced the development of surrounding communities.</p> <p paraeid=\"{43bdbc95-6ab5-4663-a823-b0feaa7d5b20}{43}\" paraid=\"1668769451\">The sweeping views and vistas of the rocky coast and Pacific Ocean Jr. provided for so many residents of Palos Verdes was just too enticing for him, and in 1925, Jr. would move his family to a home in Palos Verdes, where he could continue to work.</p>",

It was John Charles Olmsted who would respond to that initial request, and he was joined by Olmsted Jr, and firm assistants Herbert j. Kellaway and George Gibbs.<br /> <br /> The Olmsted firm developed a plan that would allow for campus expansion west of Main Street, integrating academic and residential areas with gently curving walks that responded to the natural topography of the campus.<br /> <br /> The work that began in 1891 would carry over five decades, with projects of diverse size and purpose, but always being respectful of the historic character of the land while ensuring an aesthetically cohesive campus plan as a learning environment. The Olmsted’s advised on the locations of buildings like the heating plant, archaeology museum and gymnasium, as well as the grading and planting of roads and paths.<br /> <br /> In 1908 John Charles took a step back from Phillips Academy, with the project now being supervised by firm member Percival Gallagher. While in charge, Gallagher sited new academic buildings and dormitories, an infirmary, and gave advice about tree care. Over many decades, the Olmsted firm would refine and expand the campus landscape as it grew.",

In a thorough evaluation of the site, John Charles argued that certain properties must be acquired, regardless of cost, and that the elm trees already in Exeter should be preserved to provide an appropriate setting for the school’s library.<br /> <br /> While the first plan created was initial sketches for the location of the library, John Charles was determined to create an overall plan that would best serve the interests of the school. John Charles’ plan was met with mixed reactions, and work stalled. Olmsted Brothers continued to offer guidance at Phillips Exeter until 1952.",

During the late 1880s and early 1890s, this land was the venue for numerous fairs and expositions.<br /> <br /> In 1895, the site was chosen for the Cotton States and International Exposition, at which point Olmsted Sr. was consulted on the layout of the exposition, influencing elements of the plan. After the extravagant exposition, Atlanta was unsure of what to do with the 187 acres of forest.<br /> <br /> The City of Atlanta was hesitant about buying the land, believing the park was too far away from the city. However, in 1904 Atlanta purchased the land that would become Piedmont Park, and even extended its city limits to encompass the park acreage.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{162}\" paraid=\"76405201\">In 1909, Atlanta elected to transform the decaying fairgrounds into a park. They wanted their own Central Park, though its designer, the Sr. Olmsted, had passed years before. So, Atlanta got the next best thing; they hired the Olmsted Brothers to develop its master plan.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{166}\" paraid=\"1404630820\">The Olmsted Brothers plan would utilize already present stone stairways as access paths between the different levels of the park’s grounds. Despite the City agreeing to pay $1,800 for the plan, Olmsted Brothers were concerned Atlanta may not have enough money to make necessary improvements as they came up.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{170}\" paraid=\"822705061\">As the Olmsted Brothers worked on Piedmont Park from 1909 to 1912, the design they implemented reflected the picturesque style and design principles they had learned from their father. The Piedmont Park the Olmsted Brothers designed featured broad grassy lawns and playing field, shaded woodland with over 15 miles of walks, drives, and bridal paths.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{174}\" paraid=\"837028613\">Due to budget constraints, some, but not all, of the Olmsted Brothers’ plan was realized. Nevertheless, the Olmsted Brothers plan greatly influenced the development of Piedmont Park. Much of the landscape and vistas remain today, providing green space for the urbanized neighborhoods surrounding the park.<br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8aa88aa9-c7c9-40f5-8b5d-1c8c95a3162a}{178}\" paraid=\"1382105481\">Though the Olmsted Brothers plan wasn’t fully realized, the current master plan for Piedmont Park, adopted in 1995, honors the brothers’ original vision for the park.</p>",

    "bodyText": "Although many of the parks, places, and private residences designed by Frederick Law Olmsted reflect nature shaped dramatically by the human hand. It was at Jamaica Park that the real landscape architect was Mother Earth. Crafted not so much with shovels and surveying equipment but rather by the slow drag of glaciers, Jamaica Pond's natural perfection brought out a side of Olmsted that people are not as familiar with: Olmsted the conservationist. Here, standing under the overhand of pine and hemlock that, \"darkening the water's edge\", brought \"beauty in reflections and flickering half-lights,\" stood not the man who moved earth and blasted rock to create Central Park, but instead the philosopher who have words to the belief that the government had an obligation to protect the untouched beauty of America in the future national parks such as Yosemite. With this philosophy in mind, Frederick Law Olmsted left Jamaica Pond the lease changed of all the parks in the Emerald Necklace.<br /> <br /> Prior to it becoming part of the Emerald Necklace, Jamaica Pond was used in a variety of ways. First as a water source, eventually becoming an economic tool used in the production of ice- a process that contaminated the pond's water. It also was used for recreation in a variety of ways: fishing, swimming, and especially skating in the winter, saw people from across the city come to visit the pond. Bostonians from all backgrounds could gather and enjoy the water. Over time however, the accessibility for all Bostonians to get to Jamaica Pond was curtailed as the rich began buying the property around the pond for summer homes. This caused the value of the surrounding land to skyrocket. In fact, the land outside of Jamaica Pond has become so expensive that when the Park Commissioners were looking to buy land for the modern Jamaica Park (Jamaica Pond taking up about half the area of the park), they were only able to buy a small ring around the water, along with the property of the Perkins family.<br /> <br /> Overlooking the pond, this estate, known as Pinebank, saw three generations of the family build three separate houses, each constructed upon the wreck or the burnt-out ruins of the last. After incorporation into the park, the Pinebank mansion served multiple purposes: from a restaurant, to Boston's first children's museum, to a location to exhibit the works of the city's new and emerging artists. After more than a century of serving Boston and after being gutted by multiple fires, defaces by vandalism, and left to the whims of nature, the Pinebank mansion was placed on the list of the top ten most endangered historic places. Eventually, after much debate, it was demolished in 2007. It is now commemorated by a granite memorial that traces the home's outline.",

Olmsted Brothers worked closely with the architects of the estate to create a proper setting for the house. They even transplanted two forty-foot copper beech trees from Coe’s wife’s childhood home in Fairhaven, Massachusetts.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers created a series of charming vistas on the downhill slope of the property. Vistas were created by artfully scattering oaks around the property. Huge trees were already growing in abundance on the property, so Olmsted Brothers incorporated those into their design as well.<br /> <br /> Despite being the second landscape architects to work at Planting Fields, Olmsted Brothers had the longest lasting contribution, including key landscape features such as the greenhouses, Surprise Pool, Italian Garden, and the original entrance drive.",

In their design, Olmsted Brothers included road alignments, specimen plantings, and naturalistic features like stone walls, all of which are still present today.<br /> <br /> Even with the razing of Eel River Farm during the construction of the museum, many additional built features from Olmsted Brothers were retained, such as a garden circle on a hillside overlooking the river, a ninety-foot-long wall leading to the tea house, as well as ramps and paths made from dirt leading down to the water’s edge.<br /> <br /> The garden Olmsted Brothers built for Hornblower, unlike many other deteriorated portions of the estate, has not been impacted by the development of the museum and today remains largely intact.",

    "bodyText": "In 1920, real estate developer Duncan McDuffie, who had already hired Olmsted Brothers to design his estate in Berkeley, again reached out to the landscape architecture firm. McDuffie was a member of the Save the Redwoods League and hired Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. to research Point Lobos and report on the most noteworthy areas that needed to be preserved.<br /> <br /> On his first visit, Olmsted Jr. was struck by how unique the landscape was. Olmsted Jr. noted the outstanding nature at Point Lobos and agreed to assist in the creation of a state park by providing analytical surveys and site plans.<br /> <br /> Directing the study and visiting Point Lobos frequently during the two years he spent on the effort, Olmsted Jr. described the area as “the most outstanding example on the coast of California of picturesque rock and surf scenery in combination with unique vegetation”. In 1933, the State of California, with assistance from the Save the Redwoods League, purchased 348 acres at Point Lobos.",

John Charles was already in Portland when the Board made their decision working on the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition when asked to develop a park system for Portland.<br /> <br /> John Charles developed an 18-pint plan for Parkland with various parks and boulevards, many taking advantage of the natural mountain scenery and nearby rivers. John Charles also proposed a scenic drive he called south Hillside Parkway, since renamed to Terwilliger Parkway, the only parkway from the plan fully realized.<br /> <br /> Five years after the decision to expand Portland’s parks were made, the city needed a park superintendent, so John Charles recommended his Olmsted Brothers colleague- Emanuel Mische. With John Charles serving as a visiting consultant, Mische continued the implementation of his plan. Today, Portland’s parks and parkways span 12,500 acres, with much of its land acquisitions following John Charles’ plan.",

    "bodyText": "Frederick Law Olmsted already had his tour of English parks when Calvert Vaux convinced him to rejoin the partnership and submit a plan for the development of Prospect Park. In the 1860’s Brooklyn was its own city, the third largest in the country, and was jealous of the success Central Park was having.<br /> <br /> James S.T. Stranahan, a successful civic leader in Brooklyn led the effort in the creation of a park. Stranahan argued that Brooklyn “would become a favorite resort for all classes of our community, enabling thousands to enjoy pure air, with healthful exercise, at all seasons of the year.”<br /> <br /> Stranahan received the first park design from Egbert L. Viele, the man who had proposed the first layout for Central Park before Olmsted and Vaux’s Greensward was chosen. Stranahan asked Vaux to sketch a layout for the park, who then reached out to Olmsted, finishing up his work with the United States Sanitary Commission.<br /> <br /> Construction at Prospect Park began July 1st, 1866, with Stranahan serving as President of the Prospect Park Commission. Where in Central Park Olmsted and Vaux had to overcome the lands narrow shape and large reservoir at the center, in Prospect Park the two took full advantage of natural elements, such as old-growth forests.<br /> <br /> As the years went by, Olmsted’s desire to keep statues out of Prospect Park was forgotten, and the park now boats dozens, including one of James S.T. Stranahan. In fact, of the many statues across our country of Abraham Lincoln, the first resided, and still does, in Prospect Park.",

By the time Olmsted arrived in Buffalo, Prospect Hill parks was surrounded by a residential community as well as a nearby reservoir. Buffalo transferred the parks to the Board of Park Commissioners, tasked with implementing Olmsted’s plan.<br /> <br /> By then, the grounds of Prospect Hill parks were populated with many mature trees and the grounds were surrounded by a fence, but no paths or other improvements had begun. Olmsted laid out walks allowing visitors to diagonally traverse the grounds without damaging them. The fences were also removed so that visitors were free to enter at any time.",

Being a respected voice in the conservation community, it makes sense the League and California wanted him to shape their vision.</p> <p paraeid=\"{386eba4a-ecc6-4cce-bd3f-d7e5035f43df}{140}\" paraid=\"288311445\">Olmsted Jr’s master plan for saving the remaining 5% of California’s Redwoods was a success, and in 1953 Redwood National Park dedicated Olmsted Grove to the man whose contributions to protect our national parks will forever be as powerful as the trees he fought to protect.</p>",

    "bodyText": "By 1893, Charles Eliot had been trained by Frederick Law Olmsted, left the firm that trained him, and had returned. It was two years later that Eliot was commissioned, as a member of the Olmsted firm, to create a formal design for a new beach in Revere, MA.<br /> <br /> Just five miles north of Boston, Eliot would state that at Revere, “we must not conceal from visitors the long sweep of the open beach which is the finest thing about the reservation\". Olmsted taught all who entered his office to preserve and enhance the existing natural features of the site they’re working at, and at Revere, Eliot’s design called for restoration of the natural contours of the beach.<br /> <br /> Rail accesses introduced in 1875 allowed for easy access to an already popular coastline, though Eliot removed all railroads and buildings that impeded the view of the sea. To remedy the removal, Eliot’s design included a boulevard along the length of the shore for several new structures.<br /> <br /> An already popular coastline began developing as quickly as Eliot could design, with new dance and music halls, hotels, cinemas, and amusement parks popping up. America’s oldest beach, and the first in the United States acquired for the purposes of public recreation officially opened its 4.5-mile crescent-shaped stretch in 1896, with 45,000 people gathering to celebrate.",

The goal at Riverside was to remove residents from the stresses of modern urban life as much as possible, allowing them to live in close harmony with nature while still retaining modern conveniences, such as a twenty-minute train ride to downtown Chicago.<br /> <br /> Riverside’s gently curving streets can be disorienting if you’re accustomed to the standard rectangular grid, and there are no square corners and no cul-de-sacs in the entire community. Olmsted prescribed well-built, well-drained roads with carefully curved lines and generous plantings in the hopes of creating an attractive and highly functional public grounds for rest and recreation.<br /> <br /> Respecting family privacy, Olmsted’s design facilitated interaction between neighbors by providing informal parks and playgrounds, as well as areas for strolling, boating, and other recreational activities. Unfortunately, the combination of the Chicago Fire of 1871 and a financial panic in 1873 ended the flow of funds and led to bankruptcy of the Riverside Improvement Company. Olmsted and Vaux both resigned over fee disputes, though they provided the village with a solid plan and infrastructure to build on.",

That same year, Olmsted Sr. began preparing a conceptual plan for the new park and accompanying road. After 2 years of gathering information, Olmsted Sr. submitted his report, proposing a combined park and parkway adhering to the curves of the landscape.<br /> <br /> In his report, Olmsted Sr. wrote that Riverside Park “presented great advantages as a park because the river bank had been for a century occupied as the lawns and ornamental gardens in front of the country seats along its banks. Its foliage was fine, and its views magnificent”.<br /> <br /> Alongside that river Olmsted Sr. planned Riverside Drive, a treelined roadway winding through the rocky landscape. Though Olmsted Sr. would be out as the park superintendent a few years into construction, his vision lived on in those chosen to take on his work, Calvert Vaux and Samuel Parsons, both of whom had worked closely with Olmsted Sr.",

Encompassing twenty-two acres, Riverside Park overlooks the Erie Canal and Niagara River.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers brought to fruition their father’s long-held vision of a waterfront park. Riverside Park was Buffalo’s first Olmsted designed park with a direct waterfront connection. In their design, Olmsted Brothers chose to restrict planting along Riverside Park’s western edge, providing extensive views along a particularly wide section of Niagara River.<br /> <br /> The design for Riverside Park has suffered considerably from intrusions and neglect since the Olmsted’s worked on it. A senior citizens center, an ice rink, and a set of swimming pools cover much of the formal area of the park, blocking views to the river. The noise from the Niagara Thruway has also caused a significant noise distraction in the park.",

With the assistance of Percival Gallagher, John Charles Olmsted supervised the park’s design.<br /> <br /> Like many of their parks in Hartford and across the country, John Charles designed a picturesque landscape of open lawns surrounded by walking paths, overlooking the nearby river. At the center of the park sat Riverside Pond, with tree groves and native shrubs lining the riverbanks, helping to mitigate erosion.<br /> <br /> When the park opened in 1899 it followed Olmsted Brothers plan, however, over time the original plan degraded, and is no longer evident. A 24-acre subtraction of land has left Riverside Park nestled between a railroad and an interstate.",

The Robbins family funded and built Arlington’s main library, town hall, as well as gifting their mansion to the town. The two surviving sisters, Ida and Caira, oversaw the construction of both the Town Hall and associated gardens.<br /> <br /> In 1938, the Robbins sisters hired Olmsted Brothers to redesign the gardens by Town Hall. Firm members James Frederick Dawson and Leon Zach were the main points of contact for this design. The new design transformed the garden into a secluded, welcoming space that included a circular brick walk through the garden and an “informal, woodsy and rocky environment and a naturalistic planting as a background”.<br /> <br /> Nestled between the Library and Town Hall, the gardens provided a quiet respite for visitors and citizens, something they continue to offer today. Olmsted Brothers’ work would continue till 1941, working to keep many of the key water features intact.",

In 1888, Rochester, New York’s Board of Park Commissioners had acquired land from locals and hired Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux to develop a comprehensive park system. Olmsted and Vaux proposed three large parks, ranging from 20 to 800-acres, with the hope of capturing the area’s landscape characteristics and scenery.<br /> <br /> After their father’s death, Olmsted Brothers would continue work on the Rochester Park System. In 1911, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr recommended additional neighborhood parks, reservations, and parkways. Olmsted Brothers continued to consult on Rochester’s Park development until 1915, when the city parks department was replaced by an independent board of park commissioners. In addition to the Louisville Park System, Rochester is the only park system where all three Olmsted’s were involved in planning and design.",

Throughout his career, Olmsted fought hard to warn anyone who would listen of the dangers that lay in keeping such beautiful land private.<br /> <br /> It wasn’t until Olmsted Jr. was chosen to be part of the McMillan commission, in charge of developing both the core and park system of Washington, D.C., that Rock Creek Park would get its deserved attention.<br /> <br /> Once on the commission, Olmsted Jr. encouraged his colleagues to endorse the acquisition of land for new public parks and scenic drives throughout the city, including the preservation of Rock Creek Valley in its entirety.<br /> <br /> By 1918, Olmsted Jr. and his brother John were busy on the plan for Rock Creek Park. They proposed dividing the landscape into six distinct areas that remain today. The topographical and psychological backbone of the park, their report stated, would be the area along the banks of the creek and its tributaries. This “Valley Section”, as it was described, would be preserved in its natural state, with only the addition of scattered picnic spots.<br /> <br /> Rock Creek Park’s “woodland” would consist of the western hills and plateaus, contained in the South by Military Road. Olmsted Brothers saw the “woodland” area as a spot for intensive use; their report recommended the installation of hiking paths and numerous picnic groves. Olmsted Brothers even saw an area beyond their “woodland”, designated “wilder woodland”, and it was to be preserved to the highest degree.",

    "bodyText": "<p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">Olmsted firmly believed that public parks should provide people with momentary relief from noise, hard pavement, and the bustle of the city. To help solve this problem brought on by urbanization, he created woodland trails in his large parks, transporting the visitor out of the city and into the woods by using \"passages of scenery\" for a sequential experience. Two of Olmsted's most heralded successes with such trails are the 38-acre Ramble in New York City's Central Park and the 64-acre Wilderness in Boston's Franklin Park.</p> <p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">Olmsted crafted his Rock Garden in the manner of his woodland trails. Here, a path meanders around lush plantings and rocks, into areas speckled with shades and light.<br />  </p> <p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">Along the rocky way, the path moves beneath broad magnolia branches, and around a dense variety of shrubs, trees, and ground covers, revealing- then taking away- swatches of scenic mystery.</p> <p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">With little warning, the trail opens into a broad expanse of meadow. The shift from dark to light, from rocky wooded path to gently rolling meadow is intentional: a \"brief passage of scenery\" giving way to \"an unexpected breadth of view\" beckons and engages the imagination.</p>",

Olmsted wrote that “there is no place as near and easily & cheaply accessible from New York as Rockaway Point which is also as far removed from conditions of the same class, barring the liabilities which I have pointed out, conditions exist as favorable for recovery and the working off of malarial and diarrhetic trouble.”<br /> <br /> Preliminary Plans show Olmsted provided a variety of recreation activities like a bath house, pavilion, concert garden, and dancing hall, as well as locations for a hotel and summer cottages. While the area Olmsted proposed now includes several small parks such as Rockaway Park, Breezy Point Tip and Jacob Riis Park, his plans weren’t carried out due to financial problems.",

As learned from his father, Olmsted Jr. believed that a community was an extension of the family. The challenge at Roland Park, Maryland was its challenging terrain.<br /> <br /> The steep slopes around Roland Park, which could have been a liability, turned into an asset for Olmsted Brothers. Olmsted Jr. chose to preserve the surrounding woodlands, citing the houses on slopes while using sensitive grading and construction techniques. Additionally, roads followed the natural curvature of the terrain, minimizing disruptive construction as well as saving some of the cost.<br /> <br /> Embracing the natural topography of the site, Olmsted Jr. created dramatic building lots and respected woodland resources. Cul-de-sacs terminating at the top of hills provided homeowners with spectacular views. By developing in a naturalistic way, Olmsted Jr. was able to enhance the picturesque effect of their design.",

Olmsted Jr.’s goal was to create a restored woodland as a living tribute to the former president.<br /> <br /> The woodland was to be “a real forest closely similar in character to the natural primeval forests which once covered this and other of the Potomac islands”. With the assistance of the Civilian Conservation Corps, clearing of the island's non-native vegetation and planting of about twenty thousand native hardwood trees and shrubs took place between 1934 and 1937, only stopping because of World War II.<br /> <br /> Through Olmsted Jr. and the CCC’s efforts, the island was re-naturalized into a mature woodland.

It wasn’t until 1912, that Conklin asked Olmsted Brothers to transform a sloping bowl on their property into an amphitheater, with semi-circular, turf-covered tiers to seat an audience of nearly three thousand.<br /> <br /> Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. took lead on the complicated engineering project, which Conklin envisioned would be an attractive landscape feature when not used for performances. In addition to the difficult engineering, the significant financing put a strain on Olmsted Jr., who saw this as a problematic commission.<br /> <br /> Conklin took Olmsted Brothers’ plans and chose to construct the amphitheater on his own, with Olmsted Jr. occasionally providing consultation, however Olmsted Jr. did not approve of Conklin’s material selection. After the death of his wife in 1919, Conklin sold the property to the Brooklyn Diocese, who built the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception on the grounds in 1924.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=4744,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157664792914772/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/05526\">Olmsted Online</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/seminary-immaculate-conception\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.icseminary.edu/\">Seminary of the Immaculate Conception</a>",

Olmsted strategically placed trees to provide a sweeping expanse of lawn between the home and cliffs, and an arched stone bridge.<br /> <br /> While Olmsted’s arched bridge was damaged in a 1938 hurricane, it was restored to its original design. Whenever an Olmsted-designed landscape faces deterioration, the first step is often reaching out to Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site and asking to view any files related to the project. This way, no new plan needs to be created, instead you use the original one.",

By 1901, Fall River had established it’s Parks Commission, and with $182,000 (over $6 million today) they hired Olmsted Brothers to design their parks.<br /> <br /> John Charles and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. were hired to redesign Ruggles Park, right in the middle of a working-class neighborhood by tenements and mills. Olmsted Brothers’ design included a ball field, “little folks’ playground”, and gently curving paths. They refashioned exposed ledges into a retaining wall.<br /> <br /> Construction wasn’t always easy, with Olmsted Jr. writing to contractor Thomas J. Kelley in September 1903, sharing some choice words about Fall River Parks Superintendent Howard Lothrop, and the local workers. Regardless, Ruggles Park was built and today is a small marvel with mature and majestic oak trees planted throughout.",

In his design, Olmsted Jr. created streets differentiated by function. Olmsted Jr designed main roadways “for direct, ample, and convenient transportation,” while local, narrow streets were carved out of “quiet, self-contained and garden-like neighborhoods.” This helped to establish an arrangement of varied architecture and views.<br /> <br /> Also in Olmsted Jr.’s plan for Forest Hills were a variety of public green spaces. A central town Green provides a sharp contrast to the Queens landscape across the railroad tracks. Olmsted Jr also designed two smaller community parks for walking, relaxing, and festivals. In partnership with Atterbury, Olmsted Jr. were able to harmoniously mix landscape and architecture.",

Because of this, many cemetery designs began to emulate a park-like setting.<br /> <br /> In the early 1900s, brothers William and Henry DeForest purchased 10 acres of land in the hopes to create their own cemetery in Cold Spring Harbor, NY. The land of their proposed cemetery sat right next to St. John's Church, which already operated its own burial grounds. Both DeForest brothers wanted St. Johns to administer their property but still have it in their name, which St. Johns refused.<br /> <br /> In the end, the DeForest brothers sold 7 acres back to St. Johns, keeping the remainder for personal use. After already hiring Olmsted Brothers to design each of their estates, the DeForest brothers again reached out to Olmsted Brothers.<br /> <br /> While the Olmsted Brothers were hired to design the DeForest brothers’ 3-acre plot, St. Johns realized that the esteemed landscape architecture firm was already in the area, so why not retain them to design their 7 acres of land.<br /> <br /> In the end, Olmsted Brothers continued working on new sections of the cemetery from 1918 to 1958. While these new layouts were much smaller and less park-like compared to the original designs of 1918, some prominent plot owners did like to go over the top with their design.",

    "bodyText": "In 1916, John Charles Olmsted made his first visit to St. Joseph, Missouri. While there was some correspondence in the years between, it wasn’t until 1925 that the park board formally hired Olmsted Brothers to review park development projects for the area. With John Charles involved in several projects across the country, it was firm member and architect Percival Gallagher who traveled to St. Joseph’s for several days.<br /> <br /> By April of 1925, Gallagher had sent a detailed report of his recommendations for St. Joseph, as well as a proposal for Olmsted Brothers to provide working drawings and supervise construction. Almost immediately after receiving this proposal, it was rejected, and another architect was hired to supervise the improvement of the park system.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers were turned down because of their cost of construction; Olmsted and Gallagher calculated that they would need $30,000, while their competition only asked for $11,500. When it came to designing park systems, John Charles believed “A quiet drive or stroll in a large park, or in the country, with perhaps a family picnic under the trees, would be far more restful and therefore more rational than to rush off by train to some Coney Island pleasure resort, with its various artificial attractions.”",

    "bodyText": "Working closely with the architectural firm of Bebb & Mendel, John Charles Olmsted developed the landscaping plan for Samuel Hyde’s Seattle estate. Beginning in 1909, John Charles was in communication with Bebb & Mendel, agreeing to prepare the planting plan, as well as location of walks, offering his opinions on the brick enclosure wall, and advising the approach drive be widened.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers’ planting plan provided several distinct garden areas, such as a small formal garden near the entrance and a rose garden “with white roses in center, then changing to pink, then deep reds on the outer edges”. A large open lawn area was also included, defined by flowering evergreen shrubs along its edges. Over time, the original property was subdivided, though today the original home, adjacent lawn, and brick wall remains.",

After two years of excavation, it was realized that the plan to connect Scarboro Pond to Ward’s Pond in Brookline would never be realized, so Scarboro Pond would remain isolated and stagnant, though quite beautiful. Despite being unable to connect with Ward’s Pond, Scarboro Pond is connected to another nearby waterway, with underground pipes leading from Jamaica Pond to supply water.Next to the pond is a sloping hillside of huge, century old beech trees. Olmsted intended for the hill along the West side of the pond to house a dairy with sheep and cattle, though a growing city would deem open space for recreational purposes more important.",

A multi-use building, it at one time housed the superintendent's office and served as the golf course club house.<br /> <br /> Schoolmaster Hill overlooked a meadow known as County Park until 1896 when the golf course was constructed. It was the second public golf course in the country, and golfer Willie Campbell ran the operations and provided lessons for a fee. When his wife Georgianna took over this role after his untimely death, one could argue she became the first professional woman golfer in the United States.<br /> <br /> Unlike the building on Schoolmaster Hill, the terrace's scenic view is still fully intact, and the golf course, viewed disapprovingly by Olmsted's son John Charles, has replaced County Park.",

Two years after the original purchase, Parks Commissioners purchased the necessary land allowing Seneca Park to connect to Cherokee Park, which Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. had designed years before. Seneca Park would be the last park the Olmsted Firm designed in Louisville, but it would create a connected system of parks, allowing one to travel the city without ever leaving green space.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers objective at Seneca Park was to designate different styled spaces for different activities. That can be seen through the layout of areas between the golf course, tennis courts, playgrounds, and other features. Not only are the features clearly defined, but they also utilize differing styles and variations of plants.<br /> <br /> Another notable design feature Olmsted Brothers included in Seneca Park, inspired by their father’s work at Central Park, was the separation of traffic. Not just on the roads but also in the 1.2 mile loop around the park, there is a clear distinction between pedestrian and automobile traffic to increase the aesthetic of the park, as well as the safety.",

The three-mile park is on both sides of the Genesee River, with the intention to provide public access to the river while also preserving the area from development. The original plan for Seneca Park called for tree-lined carriage drives and a network of paths that would minimize disturbances caused from grading.<br /> <br /> To prevent erosion and reduce the risk of falling debris, Olmsted included dense plantings along the edge of the gorge. Taking nearly ten years to complete, Seneca Park was designed with picturesque elements. In addition to Olmsted Sr. working on the park, John Charles Olmsted oversaw development from 1901 to 1915.",

The design is a perfect example of the Olmsted Brothers’ ecological approach to designing parks, with many woodland and shoreline trails.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{5}\" paraid=\"623943626\">Though the Olmsted plan was never fully implemented, John Charles’ 1912 plan influenced later development at the park, and one of Seattle’s oldest growing native forest, the same that John Charles marveled at, got to retain its habitat</p>",

Louisville's leaders agreed, and Olmsted began working on his last park system. One of three large parks in the system, Shawnee Park is 180-acres of green space on a low-lying plain of river bottomland.<br /> <br /> Shawnee Park, just like Cherokee and Iroquois Park, took advantage of the topographical elements unique to the site. The park features a curving drive with border plantings encircling a 35-acre area, known as the Great Lawn, providing an ideal open site for recreation.<br /> <br /> With river scenery being a central design focus, the curving drive features five areas to view the river, with trees planted to frame these views. Additionally, beaches for swimming and a boat ramp for water access were developed, and Shawnee Park is the only of the Louisville system to have a formal garden.<br /> <br /> Shawnee Park would be the last of the three major Louisville parks Olmsted would work on, because much of the proposed land was privately owned by investors and it took years to acquire.",

In 1891, Oliver Ames II hired Frederick Law Olmsted to design his estate. Due to its location on a meadow plateau, Ames named his estate Sheep Pasture, which was dominated with large boulders.<br /> <br /> The mansion was approached by a horseshoe-shaped driveway, with densely planted trees to hide the house from the street. Olmsted drew inspiration from his previous work at Waltham’s Stonehurst and chose to decorate the back of the house with a rock-faced terrace. Olmsted’s 1892 planting plan shows an intent to plant over one hundred species of trees and shrubs all around the property, except for the southern lawn, which was intentionally left open.",

    "bodyText": "During his three years at Shelburne Farms, Frederick Law Olmsted organized the property into three distinct areas: farm, forest, and park. Olmsted additionally developed a winding road system to highlight the rolling lakeside topography and views.<br /> <br /> Within a month of his first visit in 1886, Olmsted had formulated a basis for his proposal, which he described to Charles Eliot as “a perfectly simple park, or pasture-field, a mile long on the lake, half a mile deep, the house looking down over it”.<br /> <br /> Olmsted was convinced that once Shelburne Farms was completed, it “would be the most interesting and publicly valuable private work of the time on the American continent”. One proposal that Olmsted ardently promoted was that the estate include an arboretum of all the trees and shrubs native to Vermont.<br /> <br /> A great deal of planting was done according to Olmsted’s recommendation, but the arboretum was never completed. This was a huge frustration for Olmsted, because while Shelburne Farm was privately owned, he believed it should have a public purpose.<br /> <br /> With no arboretum in sight, Olmsted began losing enthusiasm for Shelburne Farm. At the end of the summer of 1888, Olmsted handed over work at Shelburne to his sons and associates. Despite leaving, Olmsted helped create an estate which offers some of the most pleasant views of Vermont’s pastoral landscape and dramatic views of the Adirondack Mountains.",

They brought in Frederick Law Olmsted to turn the entire campus into an arboretum.<br /> <br /> Smith College was only twenty years old when Olmsted delivered his first set of plans the following January. Olmsted formed the upper campus in an irregular circle of buildings, which he approvingly characterized as “informal and unpretentious…irregular [and] homelike”.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s views were formed by the New England village setting he grew up in, and when laying out any college campus, he proposed a “domestically scaled suburban community, in a park-like setting”. The founders of Smith shared these views, wanting curved lines, open spaces, and diverse plantings.<br /> <br /> There were several arguments on what would be included in the final design, and after going behind his back and hiring a young botanist to procure all the plantings, correspondence between Olmsted and Smith College stopped.<br /> <br /> In 1897, when the need for expansion became too pressing a matter to ignore, Smith College again reached out to Olmsted, this time, John Charles, and Frederick Jr. Olmsted Brothers was now faced with the difficult task of putting more buildings on a college campus that had grown in every way but acreage. In one of their final correspondences with Smith College, Olmsted Brothers warned against clipping shrubby, instead encouraging it to grow wild.",

Under Olmsted's careful guidance, most of the trees and the old driveway were removed, the barn relocated, and underground drainage systems lain. Finally, inspired by the \"green, dripping. glistening, gorgeous\" scenery of the English countryside, Olmsted graded, reshaped, and replanted the space.</p> <p data-testid=\"Paragraph\">In many ways, the South Lawn at Fairsted is like the Long Meadow that Olmsted designed in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. Both employ the Beautiful, or Pastoral, style to soothe the soul and restore the spirit. Though the area here is fairly small, there is an appearance of spaciousness due to varied values of green, indefinite boundaries, and the delicate interplay of light and color.<br /> <br /> Olmsted's pastoral landscapes often feature elms as a focal point for the contemplation of scenery. Olmsted kept this elm when he redesigned the property in 1883. In 2011, the National Park Service removed the elm when it showed advanced symptoms of decline and structural instability. Today, cuttings taken from the tree are being propagated with the hope that a genetic match can be replanted for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

One tract of land totaling more than 2,000-acres and spanning several townships and multiple jurisdictions, South Mountain Reservation, was designed by John Charles Olmsted and Percival Gallagher.<br /> <br /> Over the next few decades, more land was added, forcing Olmsted and Gallagher to erase any scars of farming, overgrazing, and timbering. At South Mountain Reservation, John Charles implemented what he called “aesthetic forestry”: assisting nature by carefully replanting healthy forested areas and underplanting the upper canopy with appropriate native trees and shrubs. Construction, forestry work, and even land acquisition continued into the 1920s, managed by Gallagher.",

Located a mile inland of Lake Erie, the land that would become South Park was purchased in 1891. The 156-acres of marshy farmland boarded by railways and industrial sites was composed in a roughly rectangular shape.<br /> <br /> In early 1893, Frederick Law Olmsted provided the Buffalo Board of Park Commissioners with a design for South Park, the second of two new parks to be constructed in the southern section of Buffalo. Designed like an English landscape garden, South Park features a 22-acre lake with three densely planted islands flanked by a gently rolling meadow, with the whole park encompassed by a circuit drive and network of footpaths.<br /> <br /> Running along the western and northern sides of South Park were railroads with multiple tracks, which Olmsted noted ““raised upon high embankments so that the trains are in full view from almost every part of the park, and the noise and smoke of the locomotives will always detract from the pleasure and healthfulness of a visit to the park.”<br /> <br /> Between 1894 and 1910, trees adorning the pastoral landscape of South Park were planted. Of Olmsted’s many urban and picturesque water features in parks, South Park’s lake is considered one of the finest examples.",

Always focusing on natural features, Chicago’s Park System was built around a series of water features and included promenades, gathering places, and gardens.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 would destroy Olmsted and Vaux’s drawings, along $5.4 billion dollars’ worth of damage. A new landscape architect, H.W.S. Cleveland, was hired after the fire to develop the Park system, with instructions to minimize any land alterations. Olmsted would have the opportunity to work on Chicago parks again during the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition.",

White, President of Spokane’s newly founded Park Board, discovered John Charles Olmsted was making trips to the Pacific Northwest to oversee other projects, and convinced the landscape architect to make the occasional stopover in Spokane. On trips to Spokane, John Charles explored bluffs, river gorges and forests, issuing an ambitious report one year later calling for four large parks, five smaller parks, eleven playfields, numerous parkways, and improvements to the ten already existing parks.<br /> <br /> White often accompanied John Charles and his associate James Frederick Dawson on outings, going so far as to pay an extra $50 out of his own pocket for as much verbal advice as was possible. In the end, the Spokane Park report from Olmsted Brothers cost the city only $1,000. In the plan, John Charles outlined that every home be within easy walking distance from a neighborhood park, believing \"city life ... has a decidedly depressing effect on the general health and stamina\".",

They were tasked with designing a curvilinear street plan, striking a perfect balance with the preservation of large open areas of nearby parkland.<br /> <br /> Led by firm member James Dawson, Olmsted Brothers laid out the streets to conform to the site’s natural topography. In accordance with McDuffie’s request, all electrical and telephone wires were placed underground.<br /> <br /> St. Francis Wood was designed to be a residential community, with wide streets and sweeping vistas of the nearby Pacific Ocean. As with many Olmsted projects, communication with the site’s architect was crucial. Today, much of the neighborhood remains as it was intended in Olmsted’s original design.",

    "bodyText": "When Leland Stanford Sr.’s son died of typhoid fever at the age of 15, the railroad tycoon felt the best way to honor his son would be to dedicate a new college in his honor. Stanford wanted the best, so for the grounds of his campus, he hired Frederick Law Olmsted.<br /> <br /> From his arrival in the Fall of 1886, Olmsted’s relationship with Stanford would be a tumultuous one. From the selection of the site to determining the orientation of the main quadrangle, Stanford was involved in every major decision on the campus.<br /> <br /> Stanford wanted his school to rival those of New England’s Ivy League campuses, however Olmsted proposed a campus uniquely suited to California’s climate. Stanford dictated much of Olmsted’s design work on the project, envisioning a campus monumental in scale and formal in design, while Olmsted proposed a campus nestled into the hills around the property. However, Stanford insisted the campus be built on flat land, with a grand axial approach in the center of campus.<br /> <br /> As a strong-willed client, and putting in $30 million to the design, many of Stanford’s ideas were largely implemented. Nevertheless, Olmsted won a key disagreement when he proposed the main campus quadrangle be paved and contain plantings of native trees and shrubs.<br /> <br /> While Olmsted’s vision of open, interlocking quadrangles was gradually lost due to campus development, the quad design illustrates a key Olmsted principle-sustainability. Olmsted's recommendation of paved space and native plants over lawns showed an understanding of the resources needed to maintain a landscape.",

Work picked up again in 1939, with Whiting and Olmsted Brothers firm member William Marquis.

After McHenry’s death in 1888, a group of Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore investors formed the Sudbrook Company, purchasing 204 acres of McHenry’s estate to fulfill his goal of a suburban community.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Sr. would work with John Charles on Sudbrook, submitting their plan August 1889. The smallest of the three residential communities designed by Olmsted Sr., Sudbrook artfully manifests Olmsted’s design principles for a suburban community, with his most prominent design feature being the curvilinear road pattern he implemented.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Sr. believed the curved roads would discourage through traffic and “enhance the domestic atmosphere of the village by creating an enclosed, intimate space”. The Olmsted design also included triangles of open green spaces at intersections, intended for gatherings of residents, which it is still used for.<br /> <br /> The approach road to Sudbrook took the community through a distinct entranceway: a narrow bridge, after which five roads fanned out into the community. Additionally, hardwood trees and lush vegetation lined the roads of Sudbrook.<br /> <br /> At Sudbrook Olmsted included sixteen deed restrictions, the most he had ever done, to protect the visual quality of his plan, and preserve the residential character of the neighborhood. The restrictions included single family homes being placed on lots of at least one acre, set back 40 feet or more from the street, and 10 feet or more from the neighboring property, an early form of zoning regulations.",

Olmsted Brothers were hired to create a plan for the proposed park system for Summit County, and the areas recommended for preservation, which they submitted in September 1925.<br /> <br /> The main challenge Olmsted Brothers faced was choosing which places among the many beautiful areas they saw in Summit County to include in their recommendations for a park system. While Seiberling wanted Frederick Law Olmsted Jr to come out to Ohio, there were other projects that took precedence. Nonetheless, Olmsted assigned two of his finest landscape architects to the project — W.B. Marquis and E.C. Whiting.",

    "bodyText": "The 130-acre property, owned by Enoch Reddington Mudge, that would become the Frederick Law Olmsted Historic District in Swampscott, Massachusetts, was purchased in 1843. In 1881, Mudge died, and his properties were administered by trustees, who sold the land in 1887 to the Swampscott Land Trust.<br /> <br /> One year later, the Trust commissioned Frederick Law Olmsted to prepare a subdivision plan. The area, which already had open views of the ocean, was enhanced by Olmsted’s use of natural, curving roads complimented by beautiful houses. Houses in the area reflected popular architectural styles of New England for the times: Queen Anne, Shingle Style, Colonial Revival, Dutch Colonial, Bungalow, and American Foursquare.<br /> <br /> Many of the homes have survived, giving the district its character and significance from its key features and details. Monument Avenue is another Olmsted feature that has survived, with its sweeping symmetrical carriage road. Olmsted used three lot sizes to accommodate three sizes of homes and varying incomes and is one of the first to use deed restrictions to ensure continuity of community.",

    "bodyText": "When John Charles Olmsted laid out his plan to the Portland Park Commissioners in 1903, he planned for three parkways to connect the city, though only one was constructed: Terwilliger Boulevard. After James Terwilliger, one of Portland’s first permanent residents, passed away, his family deeded land that they specified to be used as a boulevard or parkway for the public. This allowed John Charles not only to provide for the community, but to preserve and protect the wooded character of the site, and its unobstructed views.<br /> <br /> Although John Charles sketched for Terwilliger Boulevard, it was completed under the Portland Park Superintendent Emanuel Tillman Mische, who, as a member of Olmsted Brothers, worked with John Charles on several Northwest designs. It was John Charles who recommended Mische for the position.<br /> <br /> Today, Terwilliger Boulevard retains much of its original design. Those traveling through are offered varied natural experiences that include panoramic views to both the city and mountains, immersion into a forest, passive park areas, turf areas, a playground, and forest trails.",

A National Historic Landmark, it is owned by the City of Boston and managed by Harvard University under a 1,000 year lease signed in 1882. A unique blend of beloved public landscape and respected research institution, the arboretum's 265 acres of rolling land include meadows, forest, and ponds. Its collection of over 15,000 trees, shrubs, and vines is one of the largest and best documented collections in world. <br /> <br /> Boston’s very own 3D scientific textbook, it seemed the Arnold Arboretum was meant to be, with “Rocky hill-sides, partly wooded with numerous great trees, and a hanging-wood of hemlocks of great beauty” gracing the area before Olmsted ever arrived. Though 265 acres is plenty of room, Olmsted was skeptical if the scientific and public purposes of the Arboretum could coexist. “Indeed a park and an arboretum seem to me to be so far unlike in purpose that I do not feel sure that I could combine them satisfactorily”. Less than 150 years into its thousand year-lease, they seem to be coexisting just fine.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "The engineer’s office worked hand in hand with those in the photographic records room, for they used the images to base their plans off. With Olmsted having no formal training, the nuts and bolts of each design were taken care of here. Landscape architecture can be broken up into 2 sections: a hardscape and a softscape. Engineers and architects take care of the hardscape while the softscape is handled by the planting department, but make no mistake, one cannot survive without the other. If an engineer designs a park with poor drainage, then the plants there may not be able to survive. Engineers produce the canvas that the planting department paints on. The last addition made to the office; the technical work done here was crucial to the success of every Olmsted designed landscape. Those in this office would conduct surveys in outdoor landscapes, in addition to using this light table to produce tracings, which will become important when blueprints were needed.",

    "bodyText": "Overlooking Lake Erie, The Front was a key part of the nation’s first park and parkway system designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux for Buffalo, New York in 1868. The most formal of the three parks linked by parkways, Olmsted saw The Front as a spot with “a character of magnificence admirably adapted to be associated with stately ceremonies, the entertainment of public guests, and other occasions of civic display.”<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s design for The Front included a playground, grassy fields for baseball and cricket, and an amphitheater, the last of which was proposed by Vaux. Next to the playground is a formal gravel space referred to as “The Terrace”, and a steep slope leads down to the Erie Canal and railroad lines. To avoid park users from seeing these, Olmsted screened them with thick plantations, and benefited from the natural difference in elevation.<br /> <br /> As with many Olmsted designed landscapes, The Front was artfully constructed to enhance nature. Extensive pathways and carriage drives provide accommodation to those walking and driving. When viewing The Front, an early Buffalo Parks Commissioner noted that “In the summer and autumn months it is fanned by a cool westerly breeze, almost constantly blowing from the lake….”",

Though young at the time, Olmsted chose Parker to lead the project, in part because he was a talented landscape architect, but most of all because he was a member of the Masonic Fraternity.<br /> <br /> Like Olmsted Sr. at Biltmore, who had recommended the orientation of the home to provide the most dramatic views, Parker also gave a recommended orientation for the Memorial: east, for ritualistic purposes. Parker created a dramatic entry to the Memorial, including a curvilinear drive and axial stairway, both ending at a grand plaza.<br /> <br /> While some of Parker’s plan, specifically the planting, wasn’t implemented, features that were executed are vital to experiencing the Memorial. While more prominent features include the terrace cascading down the hillside and the stone retaining wall, Parker also dealt with more mundane features like draining, roads, the general maintenance of the grounds, and others.",

Starting as a member of the Senate Park (McMillan) Commission in 1901, Jr. founded and served on the Commission of Fine Arts from 1910 to 1918, and was a member of the National Capital Park and Planning Commission from 1926 to 1932.<br /> <br /> The National Capital Park and Planning Commission was tasked with restoring the National Mall to its original design as Pierre Charles L’Enfant had envisioned it. Olmsted Jr.’s redesign of the National Mall, beginning in the mid-1930s, helped to transform a densely planted Victorian park into formally arranged lawn panels lined with trees. This design would emphasize the importance of the view between the U.S. Capitol Building and the Washington Monument.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. made radical planting changes during his work on the National Mall, removing nearly every tree and replacing them with rows of American elms, following what was described in the 1901 McMillan Plan. Olmsted’s work of many decades, not just on the National Mall but Washington D.C., helped create a city threaded by parks, creating a unified special composition.",

    "bodyText": "In 1863, Oaklands most prominent citizens joined together to establish a cemetery just north of the city. They asked Frederick Law Olmsted to begin his first work in California and design the 209-acre hillside property.<br /> <br /> Olmsted created his initial plan in 1864, though he would refine it over the next two years. He carefully selected drought-resistant plants that would line curving uphill paths, allowing for expansive views of the Bay Area, while also screening the cemetery from heavy winds.<br /> <br /> For his design, Olmsted drew on the philosophy of American Transcendentalism, which was popular at the time. As open space began disappearing in cities, people began flocking to cemeteries, which they saw as a replacement for the forests and fields taken up for development. Mountain View Cemetery stands out from the other cemeteries of its time because of Olmsted’s vision to look at man and nature and their relationship to one another.<br /> <br /> To compliment his winding paths, Olmsted brought in trees simple in form and color, though distinctive in shape, which helped create a setting of beauty and peace. He designed Mountain View Cemetery to serve as an example of a civilized life, where one both lives and dies in harmony with the environment.<br /> <br /> As families began buying up plots in the cemetery, it appeared the resting place would serve the affluent of the Bay Area, with many monuments being erected on the grounds. When Olmsted began work on Mountain View Cemetery, the land was 209-acres. Since then, it has expanded to over 226 acres, though with every new addition, there is sensitive treatment to Olmsted’s original design.",

    "bodyText": "The North Parlor, often known as the Front Office, is where Olmsted first established his office. Until construction was completed on the rest of the office, the North Parlor would serve as the firms’ sole place of work. As their home became an office, Mary Olmsted grew tired of the constant bustle at her front door, and demanded a second entrance be put in. The North Parlor would separate the office from the rest of the home, and with seventy employees at the height of the firm, this was a busy office during its heyday. Even when renters took over the residential side of Fairsted, the North Parlor remained in use for the office. As the rest of the office would be completed, the North Parlor would serve as an office for Senior partners, including Olmsted himself. Though he grew up enjoying the landscape paintings of the Hudson River School, Olmsted himself was not a gifted artist. It was in the North Parlor that he would speak his ideas into existence and let others put pen to paper. The truly technical work was done upstairs.",

    "bodyText": "The photographic records room is where the firm stored nearly 66 thousand photographs to accompany the 6 thousand landscapes the firm worked on. It’s interesting to think about how for a majority of the firm’s life, photo’s were being taken on an elaborate setup. It wasn’t simply just a point and shoot task but a real undertaking. Photos were often the first step in a landscape design project, because they were used as reference for engineers. Photography was used not only to show the evolution of a project, but also could be manipulated to show how certain placements of trees could affect views of the area. The drawers were used to hold not single photographs but albums, all relating to a certain landscape’s design process. The typewriter on the desk was used to label photographs as they were pasted onto album sheets. The numbers on each box represented cities, with 900 representing Boston, and 500 representing NYC. All the drawers have since been emptied, digitized, and put for storage in our vault, because, this is a wooden house, these are wooden drawers, not the best place to store our valuables.",

    "bodyText": "Remembering back to the engineer’s office, the engineers created the canvas, and those in the planting department did the painting. Planting plans were the last to be produced on any project, because so much work had to be done ahead of it. The landscape had to be graded, drainage concerns addressed, and irrigation needs handled all before any plants could be put in. A typical example of what the planting department created, was what we like to call plant by number. There was a key at the top of the plan, and throughout the plan numbers scattered, correlating to the key and what species could be planted. Bubbles were drawn to show how much area a certain plant should take up. The first number in the bubble represents a plant, with a planting list often put right on the plan to reference. The second numbers tells us how many of that plant to place, so, plant by number.",

    "bodyText": "The tracings produced in the engineers office would come to the printing department for copies. The Olmsted firm had two different methods for printing. The first was that an image on trace paper was placed on top of another paper filled with chemicals that would react in the light. The two papers were then rolled outside of the window on platforms, where they would print and dry in the sun, a form of sun printing. Being New England, you can’t always count on it to be sunny. And you may have experienced, even when it is the season for the sun to be glaring down, weather can get in the way, so another form of printing had to be brought in. What they brought in was a machine called the Wagenhorst, and it worked the same way sun printing does, only staff could operate this year-round. A carbon lightbulb would be lowered into the tube, and just like with the window, trace paper would be placed on top of a chemical-reacting paper and pushed up against the tube. This screen would come out and cover the entire tube, ensuring no light got in. The light caused a chemical reaction where it would pass through the paper, creating a blue coloring, with white lines showing where the light hadn’t touched. The Olmsted’s wouldn’t leave the chemicals on the paper, so it was brought to the next room and fully developed in a bath. The wet plans were then placed on drying frames, then rolled into the closet, where a heater would speed along the process. There were many different sizes of plans coming out, so several drying frames of different sizes had to be created. For Blue Hills Parkway, Olmsted needed three, twenty-five foot sections of plans to encompass all of it. ",

John Charles broke away from the traditional grid that guided many of Canada’s larger neighborhoods, utilizing a curvilinear street plan instead.<br /> <br /> John Charles worked to ensure roads fit with the area’s natural topography, and that significant features such as existing trees and views were preserved and protected. Despite a change in ownership in 1911, John Charles continued his work, focusing on deed restrictions to retain the area’s character, while Olmsted Brothers associate James Dawson was working on grading revisions and decorative light fixtures to line the streets. John Charles saw The Uplands as “unquestionably the best adapted to obtain the greatest amount of landscape beauty”.",

    "bodyText": "From the photographic records room to the engineers office, the drafting department, planting department and printing department, the six thousand designs the Olmsted firm would work on in nearly 100 years would produce over one million pieces of paper, which needed a safe place for storage. The final modification done during Olmsted Sr.’s time would be to ensure these materials, a vital part of the histories of many parks, schools, and towns, were stored in a safe place. Starting as a two story vault, a third was added when it was realized just how much materials needed proper storing. In the photographic records room, there was a fear about keeping such valuable materials stored in wooded boxes, in a wooded home. Part of Fairsted is not the wooded house, but a brick area. This brick area is the vault, which would prove a better defense against fire. Harry Perkins was tasked with overseeing the complex organization and distribution of the firm’s plans. The office cartoons those in the Olmsted firm were so fond of making includes a take on Perkins role in the vault. He was meticulous about his organization method, refusing anyone access to get materials from the vault, because one plan put back out of order could mean it’s lost for years. When the NPS arrived at Fairsted in 1979, what they saw was stacks of rolled up tubes of paper pilled on oneanother. That was Perkins organizational method. It took 18 years to pull, conserve, and catalog everything in the vault.",

At Thornewood, the crowning achievement was a sunken English Garden, also referred to as The Secret Garden.<br /> <br /> The walled garden is entered through wood gates over a hundred years old, with a walkway bordered by flowers and shrubs circling the entire garden. Olmsted planted wisteria, purple clematis, climbing hydrangea, and pillar roses in The Secret Garden.<br /> <br /> Steps in the front and rear of the garden lead visitors down to a sunken area, where the central focus is a tranquil fountain surrounded by a lush lawn. The Secret Garden is where many of Thornewood’s statues are found.<br /> <br /> In 1926, The Secret Garden was named one of the five most beautiful gardens in America, and again in 1930, this time by the Garden Club of America. Olmsted surrounded the house with spacious gardens and lawns and, despite being designed over one hundred years ago, much of his design remains intact today.",

Olmsted and his sons would remain involved at Trinity up until the early 1890s, advising the planning and development of the campus for over twenty years.",

    "bodyText": "Troy University got their Olmsted-designed landscape thanks to Edward M. Shackelford, a professor turned President of the growing University, who helped Troy in their greatest period of growth. While Shackelford got the Presidency in 1899, it wasn’t until 1922 that he reached out to Olmsted Brothers seeking guidance on the future of the school. Within days of Shackelford’s request, Olmsted Brothers responded expressing interest in working at Troy, estimating their cost between $1000 and $2000, however a lack of funding stopped Olmsted Brothers from beginning work in 1922.<br /> <br /> Thankfully, five years later, the Alabama State Legislature approved $5.4 million dollars for buildings throughout the State, and at the same time the Alabama Board of Education signed a deal with Olmsted Brothers to make plans for higher education institutions in the state. For several years, Olmsted Brothers studied and surveyed the landscape at Troy, eventually calling for a large, open pedestrian quad to anchor the campus.<br /> <br /> In a June 1930 letter, Olmsted Brothers wrote to Shackelford that Troy was “by far the largest of any of the schools” the firm was working on at the time. Olmsted Brothers worked with Troy for decades, with the Brookline firm sending a floral engineer to arrange plantings around the campus. When Shackelford saw the design, he called it “the finest piece of work of its kind that I ever saw.”",

Olmsted Jr. recommended unused lots along the hill behind Ballou Hall be preserved for open green space.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr.’s 1920s plan would shape the campus for the next fifty years. Dorms were grouped around campus greenery, making it feel less like a campus and more like a community. The plan also included a teaching hospital for the medical school., which would later be relocated to Boston. For many years, Olmsted Brothers served as managers of Tufts campus grounds, even hiring the University’s first full-time buildings and grounds employee.",

Prominent Boston landscape architect Charles Eliot, not yet with the Olmsted firm, was hired to design the park. Shortly after beginning work, he partnered with the Olmsted’s, forming Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot.<br /> <br /> Tyler Park, which would become an important selling point for house lots in the area, was designed to take advantage of the area’s natural features. Eliot’s design included paths, a central fountain, and a play area for children. After Eliot’s untimely death in 1897, John Charles Olmsted continued to supervise work on the park.<br /> <br /> At Tyler Park, John Charles was disappointed in the construction, particularly the stonework of the central fountain, which would be dismantled in 1906 to make way for a rockery. Despite Eliot’s vision never fully being realized, much of his original design is still evident; the topography, trees and rocks, as well as original paths were all incorporated into the restoration work in the late 1990s.",

    "bodyText": "The Capitol we see today underwent extensive expansion in the mid-19th century, and who else to plan and oversee that work but Frederick Law Olmsted.<br /> <br /> In 1874, with the additions of House and Senate wings, as well as a new dome, the grounds surrounding the Capitol also needed to be enlarged. Describing his plan for the Capitol, Olmsted said that “the ground is in design part of the U.S. Capitol, but in all respects subsidiary to the central structure.”<br /> <br /> To not detract attention away from the Capitol Building, Olmsted was careful not to group any trees or other landscape features together. He also strongly believed that the use of sculptures and other ornamentations should be kept to a minimum.<br /> <br /> While Olmsted was determined to have the grounds compliment the building, he also felt the need to address architectural problems that had persisted for years. Washington, D.C. was expanding west, and the terraces of the Capitol Building did not seem to support that notion. Olmsted proposed marble terraces on the sides of the building to “gain greatly in the supreme qualities of stability, endurance, and repose.”<br /> <br /> Work accelerated in 1877, both on the building and the grounds. Olmsted employed over 100 varieties of trees and bushes at the Capitol, with thousands of flowers used in seasonal displays. In 1878, after hundreds of flowers had been destroyed or stolen by vandals, watchmen were appointed to patrol the grounds and proved quite effective, allowing the lawns to be completed.<br /> <br /> In 1885 Olmsted retired as superintended of the terrace project, though he continued to direct work on the grounds until 1889. His goal in working on the Capitol was not to detract from the building but compliment it with the grounds. He did so by contrasting the buildings straight lines with the curved walkways of the grounds, the same grounds a bill must walk in the hopes to become a law.",

    "bodyText": "By 1921, Union County’s population had surpassed 200,000 and was in need of park space, and a commission to help acquire the land needed. After forming the Union County Park Commission, Percival Gallagher of Olmsted Brothers was quickly hired to perform a countywide reconnaissance, evaluating the area’s potential for an expansive network of parks and riverside corridors, linked through cross-country parkways.<br /> <br /> Just as Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. would have done, Gallagher proposed setting aside land for both passive and active recreation. The Olmsted firm’s plan was to create several large park units that would serve the entire country, as well as smaller parks to serve local communities. In their 1921 proposal, Olmsted Brothers wrote that “The attractiveness of much of the County, therefore, is to be found in its pleasantly undulating topography and the quiet pastoral character of the countryside, in which the chief details of lively interest are the many streams of water and ponds along their way. These streams and ponds, under the circumstances, become particularly important in any consideration of the natural physical features of the country.”<br /> <br /> Despite passing away in 1934, Gallagher shaped a remarkably varied park system consisting of both urban and suburban parks, a mountain reservation, and parkways. Upon Gallagher’s passing, the Union County Park System paid tribute to his “wide vision, far-flung experience and high knowledge of the beautiful and the practical.” Olmsted Brothers, and later Olmsted Associates, continued advising the Union County Park Commission well into the 1960s.",

Each Alabama institution would pay $1,500 for planning work, plus $1,500 to cover travel, assistants, drafting, and printing. Through their work together, Alabama’s Board of Education was required to consult the Olmsted Firm before allowing any alterations to be made to the finished plan.",

    "bodyText": "While in California managing the Mariposa Estate gold mine, Frederick Law Olmsted asked in 1865 by the trustees of the College of California to draw up a plan for a campus and residential area on grounds that were once used as a farm. After visiting the site in the foothills of San Francisco Bay, Olmsted proposed a plan where students live in cottages arranged in a picturesque style, with meandering roads and paths around them.<br /> <br /> Olmsted envisioned a divided roadway curving through the base of surrounding hills, lined with private residences with landscaped grounds. The 1886 “campus park” plan established an east-west axis and characterized by the sloping terrain of the area. By integrating the campus into the surrounding community, Olmsted believed students would benefit from a balance between “a suitable degree of seclusion and a suitable degree of association” with the rest of the world.<br /> <br /> One of Olmsted’s first campus plans, it was not implemented by Berkeley’s founders, though it would form the basis for Olmsted’s ideas on campus planning. Olmsted would depart from more traditional, symmetrical campus designs that he felt weren’t conducive to growth and expansion. As with his parks, Olmsted designed with the future in mind.",

Olmsted’s original plan for the Midway incorporated more bridges, and the restoration work being done will reinforce that concept.</p> <p paraeid=\"{be43edee-644e-4de5-b534-f9a399df6b83}{217}\" paraid=\"1725826478\">If we look at Olmsted Brothers work at the University of Chicago and Olmsted Sr.’s work on Chicago’s parks for the Columbian Exposition, the similarity is that, despite enduring for years, there are still improvements to be made. With the continued restoration of both these landscapes, old visions unable to completed during the Olmsted’s lifetimes are finally being realized.</p>",

    "bodyText": "The campus design at the University of Florida was born from an ongoing expression of social and architectural change within a context of architectural compatibility. The campus character can be broken into three historical eras. The first era, from 1905 to 1925, was around the implementation of the original campus plan. The second era, from 1925 to 1944 was based on coalescence and enhancement, which was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers was responsible for redesigning and unifying the campus through a planting plan of native vegetation. In 1925, University of Florida hired Olmsted Jr. and firm member William Lyman Phillips to lead the re-design of the campus, specifically to improve the landscape of the quadrangle.<br /> <br /> The quadrangle, which Olmsted Brothers referred to as the campus green, was the focal point of the early campus and was designed to serve as an entrance to the University. In 1931, the campus green was renamed the Plaza of the Americas, to honor the University hosting the first meeting of the Institute of Inter-American Affairs. Additionally, 21 live oak trees were planted on the Plaza of the Americas, with 21 flags to represent the attending nations.",

John Charles called for the acquisition of land from the town of Moscow, including its railroad depot, so that roadways could be reconfigured to lead to campus.<br /> <br /> In a 1908 letter to McLean, John Charles wrote that “The university as a whole, both grounds and buildings, without a suggestion of lavishness or over decoration, ought to exhibit clearly, in all its outward appearance, the fact that it is the place of work and of residence of cultivated and careful people,”. To complement and frame academic buildings, John Charles recommended a conservative use of trees.",

Olmsted Brothers sent firm member James Dawson down to Kentucky that year, though they would not formally begin working until two years later after the acquisition of a former children’s home and industrial school.<br /> <br /> In addition to James Dawson, Edward Whiting also guided work at the University of Louisville, adapting the grounds and recommending that drives and walks be rerouted to create a more cohesive campus. Whiting proposed a series of quadrangles to be anchored by the library, while local architects disagreed, suggesting an elaborate cross-shaped lawn. Whiting also suggested a single entry point for the University, which would diverge once inside the campus fence to discourage outside traffic from entering.",

Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were called to design the campus in 1867, though their plan was initially rejected by the college’s trustees. The only section of Olmsted and Vaux’s plan that was adopted was the orienting of academic buildings towards nearby Stillwater River, and including an open parade ground and arboretum.<br /> <br /> The Olmsted name would have another chance in Orono, when Olmsted Brothers were hired in 1932 to address campus growth. Carl Rust Parker, who often took lead on Maine designs, called for a rectangular mall lined with elms and flanked by symmetrical, academic buildings. Parker also wanted to include a naturalistic lake and paths leading around the campus.<br /> <br /> Much of the original Olmsted design remains at the 600-acre campus. Olmsted Sr.’s original parade ground and arboretum are still intact, and Olmsted Brothers mall, though now lined with oak, is still present, and a major feature of the campus.",

Completed in 1848, the campus was made of a parklike octagonal green space, surrounded by institutional structures. Like many successful schools, enrollment increased, and the campus became too small to house its student body.<br /> <br /> A century later, Olmsted Brothers were hired to develop a plan for the now 640-acre campus to accommodate future enrollment of over five thousand students. Firm member Carl Parker was tasked with overseeing the work at Ole Miss, where he established an east-west axis along a central ridge of the campus. The design was meant to honor the original plan with a series of open quadrangles, all connected through green paths.<br /> <br /> Parker chose to relocate roadways and parking areas to the periphery of the campus, allowing the pedestrian-oriented core to dominate. Olmsted Brothers planting plan emphasized placing varieties of dogwoods, oak, and fruit trees across the campus. For nearly forty years through Olmsted Brothers and into Olmsted Associates, the firm remained involved at the University of Mississippi.",

    "bodyText": "In 1912, Olmsted Brothers were contacted by the University of Pennsylvania, who requested that they collaborate with architect Paul Philippe Cret to create a plan for the campus as it grew in student population. With both teams agreeing to the partnership, one year later they had created their preliminary report. To avoid the danger and noise caused by traffic in bustling Philadelphia, they proposed an elevated subway line.<br /> <br /> On the campus grounds, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. suggested that they “open through the heart of this territory and in its least expensive part a Mall or College Avenue… one hundred feet wide facing which could be built a number of University buildings.” Unfortunately, the Olmsted and Cret plan was never realized, though eighteen years later Olmsted Jr. would be invited back, playing a minor role in the planning of the University’s Morris Arboretum.",

    "bodyText": "In 1911, after acquiring appropriations from Utah State Legislature and securing a topographical map, Olmsted Brothers were employed to provide a preliminary site plan for the Utah State Capitol. John Charles Olmsted took the lead, spending nine days in Salt Lake City sketching ideas, and examining soil and elevations.<br /> <br /> Olmsted found the views favorable and suggested implementing terraces to situate the building at the highest point possible. He recommended grading slopes lower to allow views up to the building from all sides, and carefully planted trees to avoid any obstruction of views.<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s plan, classical in nature, included an oval pathway that would intersect other curved paths. He called for Utah State Legislature to buy up and remove all houses on Capitol Hill, which was likely unpopular at the time since Utah’s most influential citizens were living on Capitol Hill.<br /> <br /> The location of the Utah State Capitol was eventually shifted two hundred feet to the south to provide space for future buildings. This change would complicate Olmsted’s grading plans, which he asked to revise, but was denied. Despite other public buildings being added, the preeminence of the Utah State Capitol and the view from all sides conveys much of Olmsted’s design intent.",

Hired in 1908, Olmsted Brothers transformed the town’s farmland into 600-acres of parks, parkways, gardens, and city landscape. That year, Olmsted Brothers published their ‘Report of the Committee on Beautifying Utica of the Utica Chamber of Commerce”.<br /> <br /> In order to make space for both transportation and street planning, Olmsted Brothers recommended placing tracks underground to better manage traffic. Also in their report, Olmsted Brothers proposed ““an attractive parkway with electric car service on a private right-of-way running direct to Baggs’ Square and short circuiting, so to speak, the whole of North Genesee Street.”",

Olmsted would design the grounds for the mausoleum and would include four landscape features: a broad terrace in front of the mausoleum, a hill surrounding the mausoleum, a stone arch to form an entrance, and a winding pathway connecting the entrance with the terrace.<br /> <br /> Olmsted and Hunt worked together on the design for the mausoleum terrace, and once completed, the Vanderbilt Mausoleum was hailed “the most magnificent tomb of any private individual” and “the most costly mausoleum in America” following its 1886 completion.<br /> <br /> The Vanderbilt Mausoleum was not Olmsted and Hunt's first collaboration, and it wouldn’t be the last. They had already worked on Central Park together and would go on to collaborate at the Chicago World’s Fair. Seeing how well they did on his family’s mausoleum, George Vanderbilt hired Olmsted and Hunt to design his estate in Asheville, North Carolina.",

On his return, he partnered with entrepreneur J.J. Vandergrift, as McMurty had plans of expanding his factory to nearby hilly farmland along the Kiskiminetas River. The dream was that factory workers would buy, not rent, their homes to ensure a committed labor force.<br /> <br /> In 1895, McMurty requested Frederick Law Olmsted to develop the plans for his factory village, but with Olmsted Sr. already retired, John Charles Olmsted took the lead at Vandergrift. John Charles wanted the factory life separate from town, so he located railroad and factory buildings on flatland by the river, while placing residential areas and main businesses on high ground, above the sound and smoke pollution.<br /> <br /> At Vandergrift, John Charles envisioned wide, paved streets that could drain easily, many single-family lots and small parklets, all curving around the hillside, following the river. John Charles’ plan was implemented so quickly that lot sizes were reduced to maximize house sites, and roads were narrowed.",

    "bodyText": "In August of 1868, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux made a visit to Vassar College, to begin consultation on the campus's design. A day after their visit, Olmsted wrote to his wife Mary, reporting that “they have a miserable plan to be amended, that’s all.”<br /> <br /> For the next 65 years, past the time of Olmsted Sr. and into Olmsted Brothers reign, Vassar periodically called on the Brookline based firm for their professional guidance in the expanding campus plan.<br /> <br /> Of the two Olmsted Brothers, John Charles took the lead at Vassar College, but it was Percival Gallagher, partner at Olmsted Brothers, who contributed most to the college. Taking over from Beatrix Farrand, Gallagher served as consulting landscape architect to Vassar from 1929 to 1933.<br /> <br /> In addition to adding to the growing arboretum Farrand had started, Gallagher also suggested that the intersections of diagonal walks along the campus quad, collections of Japanese Maples should be planted. Gallaghers suggestion was approved, and one can still walk along the Japanese Maples today.",

    "bodyText": "In 1920, the Verona Park Association purchased land and surrounding acreage to form a 54-acre park. Olmsted Brothers were contracted to design the park, as part of their ongoing work for the Essex County Park Commission. Olmsted Brothers plans from 1922 incorporated a variety of passive and active recreation spaces, such as open lawns, hillsides for sledding, a beach, a sunken garden, scenic overlook, footbridge, playfield, concert ground, picnic grove and a boat house.<br /> <br /> By 1927, Olmsted Brothers had developed a new planting strategy for areas along the boathouse, comfort stations, and the bandstand, all of which were built and remain significant features of Verona Park today. Two years later, the historic dam was reconstructed along with a 36-foot footbridge.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers submitted their final planting plan in 1932, which included lining commercial avenues with trees allowing for a separation of the park from more commercial zones. While actual development of the park did not start for several years due to court proceedings concerning condemnation of some land, this delay caused no inconvenience to the public, because the park was already being utilized for boating, bathing, skating, picnics, and band concerts. In 2008, rehabilitation efforts were carried out which made improvements to the park while maintaining the Olmsted firm’s overall design.",

    "bodyText": "The Back Bay Fens has transformed over and over again throughout the years. The original shallow bay became a foul salt marsh after the filling in the Back Bay in the mid-19th century. Then, Frederick Law Olmsted, working with the city engineer, converted the smelly grounds into a \"park\" with a stream running through it that Olmsted described as a \"sanitary improvement\". Later, the park changed again when the Charles River Dam was built in 1910, changing the water flow patterns throughout the Fens. Olmsted's original design became obsolete.<br /> <br /> In the 1940s the park changed yet again. Here, like across the nation, Victory Gardens sprang up- gardens in which to grow produce for the home front, allowing more food to be available for the soldiers fighting in World War II. The program was successful; Victory Gardens grew over half of the produce used during the war. But in the Back Bay Fens, the Victory Gardens were sustained and over 70 years later they are the nation's only continuously operating WWII Victory Gardens and they remain a beautiful landmark in the park. Many of the gardens are now filled with flowers instead of vegetables, but the spirit of the gardens has stayed the same.<br /> <br /> Olmsted believed that parks should aim to emulate a natural environment as closely as possible. Yet, he was a firm supporter of our nation and believed that practicality should trump aesthetics in public parks. ",

Except for the water tower, John Charles intended Volunteer Park to be free of all man-made features, allowing the area's beautiful and refreshing landscape to dominate.

Due to the rugged landscape of the chosen site, intensive grading and planting work was required, with Olmsted calling for grounds to be manipulated to create steep slopes. Before Olmsted could design, he required the grounds to be cleared, damaged trees removed, and soil to be stripped. Olmsted designed a 1500-foot driveway to lead up to the house from the main road.",

Olmsted’s design created a park-like setting for the Gothic Cathedral, providing open spaces, a native woodland and cultured gardens.<br /> <br /> Olmsted designed the arrival to the Cathedral so that “the great sweeping branches of the trees seem to brush off, as it were, the dust of the city, so that one at last reaches the Cathedral cleansed in mind and in spirit.”<br /> <br /> Olmsted’s plan included internal roadways, locations for institutional buildings, a series of open spaces and gardens, as well as a path cutting through the existing 5-acre woodland, which was later renamed to Olmsted Woods, honoring the man who had devoted so much time to the surrounding landscape.<br /> <br /> In 1919, Olmsted spoke about the “great charm of approaching the Cathedral through and up a wooded hillside, leaving the city far behind and below. Helping one to forget the hurly-burly and busy-ness of a work-a-day world must be taken advantage of to the fullest extent.”",

A few years after the end of the war, the Illinois State Legislature would pass three bills in February of 1869 that would create a system of parks and boulevards for Chicago.<br /> <br /> The approved legislation ultimately led to the formation of the South Park Commission, and the entrance of Olmsted and Vaux. Olmsted and Vaux created their plan for South Park in 1871, however the Great Chicago Fire delayed construction. When construction resumed, South Park was broken into an eastern and western division, 372-acre Washington Park in the west, and 593-acre Jackson Park in the east.<br /> <br /> While Jackson Park would serve as a lakefront trace, Washington Park, which got its name in 1881 to honor the first president of the United States, would serve as an inland rectangle of prairie lands.<br /> <br /> Washington Park would be realized according to Olmsted’s design, though he would not be supervising the design. By the late 1880s, about two-thirds of the park had been built under the supervision of landscape architect H.W.S. Cleveland. In the end, Washington Park had a hundred-acre open meadow for sports and gatherings, surrounded by ninety acres of open woods, complete with walking paths.",

That same year, Olmsted Brothers would create a master plan and architectural drawings for the 54-acre site.<br /> <br /> The plan had a complex of six buildings on the lawn, with the classical Legislative Building as the centerpiece. Olmsted Brothers suggested a naturalistic treatment of the site with plantings of low, well-pruned trees along the edge of the site, blocking the view of industrial buildings but leaving the mountain vista on the opposite side open.<br /> <br /> Throughout the project, Olmsted Brothers stressed the importance of establishing a connection between the Capitol Grounds and downtown Olympia. The firm recommended a diagonal avenue along the edge of the Capitol Campus going down to Sylvester Park. Twenty years after it began, Olmsted Brothers’ work on the Capitol Campus was complete.",

As he would have done in a subdivision, John Charles placed the buildings around curved streets and paths.

    "bodyText": "Olmsted Brothers would landscape several projects in the Ann Arbor, Michigan area before, in 1929, being called to design a cemetery just over forty-acres North of their Barton Hills subdivision. The topography of the land allowed for proper drainage, and most of the acreage was without any trees. While locals wanted the land to be divided into four, ten-acre sections, Olmsted Brothers had other ideas.<br /> <br /> The 1931 General Plan for Washtenong Memorial Park used a curvilinear road system following the natural topography of the site. An axis for the chapel, fountain, and service area cut across the interior curvilinear drives, providing a contrast of uses. The areas between plots were suitable for family lots or mausoleums, and plantings of evergreen trees together were used to direct views.<br /> <br /> From correspondence, we know that Olmsted Brothers planting list was followed according to the suggested location and species. As late as 1959, members of the Olmsted Firm were still in contact with those managing Washtenong Memorial Park.",

    "bodyText": "Olmsted Brothers were contacted in 1899 by John C. Thompson, president of the New York Air Brake Company, about anonymously gifting a park to his city of Watertown, New York. Thompson’s office was in New York City, so he was already familiar with the work of the Olmsted firm. John Charles Olmsted took the lead on the design for the park, originally called Watertown Park.<br /> <br /> On his first visit to the area on June 7<sup>th</sup>, 1889, the Watertown Daily Times reported that “John C. Olmsted, of Brookline Mass., the designer of the city’s projected park, is now in Chicago, looking after some landscape work there of which he has charge. On leaving there he will come directly to this city to make such changes in his designs as he deems advisable after inspecting the park as preliminary staked out. He is expected here the last of the week or the first of the next, and will probably remain several days. He will visit here frequently during the progress of the work.”<br /> <br /> John Charles started by acquiring more than 700 acres of woods and fields that would provide scenic vistas over the growing city, leading towards Lake Ontario. An addition to part of the park plan was contiguous land for a residential development. John Charles produced his first plan for Watertown Park in 1901 and would spend the next two decades supervising construction at the challenging, rocky site.<br /> <br /> The plan for Watertown Park included a formal tree-lined boulevard as the primary entrance, which would connect roads and paths curving through the park towards its summit. To mitigate the steepness, John Charles designed walls, overlooks, shelters, and steps that ascended the slopes, all accompanied by textured plantings. Upon Thompson’s death in 1924, his anonymity was taken away, and the park was renamed to Thompson to honor its founder.",

Lapham tore down Hall’s home to build a new one, and had the grounds redesigned by Olmsted Brothers in 1904.<br /> <br /> With the project being led by John Charles Olmsted, the most distinct design at Waveny was the parterre garden, which is often referred to as the most important formal garden in town, forming a historically significant area. Olmsted integrated the property’s fields and woodlands with formal landscape elements like polo fields and gardens.<br /> <br /> Olmsted created a terraced axial walk that extended east from the house to an ice pond. The parterre garden is framed by evergreen trees, with a walkway leading to a circular fountain and statue. In the many years since, New Canaan has felt the pressure to redesign Waveny.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers designed the garden for an estate, to be used by a single family and their guests. However, Waveny is no longer a private residence, but instead a public park enjoyed by many. New Canaan’s local Garden Club hopes to renovate and renew the parterre garden, making the design more inviting and open.",

On his first visit to the campus, Olmsted Jr described the landscape as “not merely beautiful, but with a marked individual character not represented so far as I know on the ground of any other college in the country.\" He believed the glacial topography of the area gave the campus \"its peculiar kind of intricate beauty.\"<br /> <br /> It wasn’t until the 1920s that Olmsted would be invited to develop the campus. With firm member Arthur Shurcliff, the firm completed a master plan that rejected the Beaux Arts quadrangle campus that was popular during the time. Olmsted Jr used his father’s design philosophy to preserve the site’s natural beauty. Olmsted Jr advised Wellesley to preserve its meadows, valleys, native plan communities and beautiful lake.<br /> <br /> Utilizing the natural configurations of the site, Olmsted Jr organized buildings into clusters, while framing the lake with quadrangles and courtyards. Meandering paths and boardwalks, lined with native and exotic vegetation, connected campus features while minimizing roads.",

    "bodyText": "Olmsted Brothers work on the Pratt Estate of Glen Cove, New York, also known as Welwyn, was done in two phases, with the first from 1906 to 1909. The earliest work done by Olmsted Brothers was the grading of the site, as well as planning approach drives and service courts, all highlighted by extensive planting lists.<br /> <br /> In 1908, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr did an analysis of the Pratt holdings, advising on boundaries between to decide the common land amongst the family. The second phase of Olmsted Brothers involvement was in 1934, when firm member Carl Rust Parker planned a subdivision on the Pratt’s property, as well as reshaping and replanting the Pratt Family Cemetery.<br /> <br /> For more information and resources, please visit:<br /> <a href=\"http://ww3.rediscov.com/Olmsted/default.asp?IDCFile=/olmsted/detailsS.IDC,SPECIFIC=5015,DATABASE=SERIES,\">Olmsted Research Guide Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/collections/72157698663909471/\">Flickr</a><br /> <a href=\"https://olmstedonline.org/Job/Details/09468\">Olmsted Online </a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.tclf.org/welwyn-preserve\">The Cultural Landscape Foundation</a><br /> <a href=\"https://www.nassaucountyny.gov/2927/Welwyn-Preserve\">Nassau County, New York</a><br />  ",

For ten years Olmsted Brothers worked at West Point, expanding the campus into newly acquired land.<br /> <br /> Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. took lead on this design, with assistance from Edward Clark Whiting. They felt that variety in trees and greenery should be introduced to the site. Olmsted Jr. felt this would “add interest and pleasure to places which are now rather monotonous or even disagreeable. My idea is that for this purpose much native shrubbery, to be collected in the reservation, should be used.” In addition to an extensive planting plan, Olmsted Brothers also drew plans for staff headquarters, Lieutenant’s quarters, a gymnasium, and several academic buildings.",

Included in the Wards were “the larger part of the great promontory, the shank of which is crossed by the line dividing Yonkers from New York, and which terminates three miles to the southward in the abrupt headland of Spuyten Duyvil.”<br /> <br /> Working with engineer James R. Croes, Olmsted helped design several areas within the Bronx section of Westchester County. Together, the pair faced challenges due to the area’s rugged surface, “broken by ledges, and…numerous steep declines on its hillside.” In many of the residential communities in Westchester County, winding and curving roads became key features.",

By the 1870s a tree-lined drive had already been built along the bluff, but it wasn’t enough for Portland’s residents.<br /> <br /> In 1905, Portland Mayor James Phinney Baxter hired Olmsted Brothers to design a landscape plan for the park, as well as to develop a master plan for all the city’s parks. On the Western Promenade, John Charles Olmsted led the design work, with firm apprentice Henry Vincent Hubbard assisting.<br /> <br /> In addition to improving the Western Promenade, Olmsted’s plan also connected the park to nearby green spaces, creating a park system modeled after Boston’s Emerald Necklace. On the Promenade’s twenty-five acres, Olmsted designed space for peaceful strolling and socializing by horse and carriage, though he didn’t include areas for structured recreation.<br /> <br /> Although Olmsted’s proposal for a formal plaza was not implemented, the Western Promenade’s strolling paths, lawns, and allées resemble the original design intention.",

Both Olmsted and Cook’s ancestors come from Britain, and both choose to honor that heritage, with Cook naming his estate after that homeland in Wheatley, England.<br /> <br /> Once again Olmsted would work on an estate with Peabody and Stearns, this time creating an Italian Renaissance mansion in the hills of the Berkshires, completed in 1894. The collaboration between Olmsted and Peabody and Stearns would be crucial in ensuring the home’s windows and balconies would provide sweeping views of open fields and Stockbridge Bowl.<br /> <br /> Olmsted used a circular drive to approach the home, ending in a formal court entrance surrounded by evergreen trees, and a marble fountain at the center. A patio terrace and formal garden is behind the house, which forms a U-shape. The terrace connects to open lawns, with walking paths lined with mountain laurel, azaleas, and rhododendrons.",

    "bodyText": "In 1902, Olmsted Brothers were asked to renovate areas of Williams College’s campus, including the President’s House and Cemetery. Though work on that initial design was completed in 1912, Williams chose to retain the advice of John Charles and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.<br /> <br /> Over the course of six decades, Olmsted Brothers would advise Williams through their gradual transformation with a campus design that was adaptable. Olmsted Brothers 1923 design for George A. Cluett’s estate was purchased by Williams College, adding to campus acreage.<br /> <br /> In the one hundred active years of the Olmsted firm, Williams College would be their largest commission in Western Massachusetts. From 1902 to 1962, Olmsted Brothers advised on Williams’s development, believing the campus should be planned around discrete quadrangles interwoven with shared green space.<br /> <br /> Present day grounds of Williams College reflect much of the original Olmsted Brothers design, with quadrangles and diagonal walks. Though their father taught them never to include a straight line in their designs, the exception was college campuses. While the rest of the adult population often need to be forced to take the longer path and meander for a little while, college students already know to do that.",

While the linear park would change Boston for the better, he had several other, smaller parks in the area that deserve their share of the attention.<br /> <br /> Wood Island Park in East Boston is one of these smaller, isolated parks. What started as a simple park featuring few walks and a playground transformed into his largest neighborhood park, with forty-six acres of public beaches, picnic areas, tennis courts, outdoor gymnasiums for both men and women, playgrounds, and several promenades.<br /> <br /> Despite Wood Island Park’s popularity, green spaces do fall victim to a community’s expansion. The northernmost jewel of the Emerald Necklace, and the glory of East Boston would be razed for the expansion of Logan Airport in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. There was a time when the park was ranked with San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park as one of the county’s great oceanside municipal parklands. Today, it sits under a runway for airplanes.",

It would take another fourteen years for Olmsted Brothers to be hired and begin designing Woodland Park, which would be the city’s largest. With John Charles Olmsted taking the lead, he prepared his first report for Woodland Park, suggesting one section be reserved for a zoo, and the other retained for passive and active recreation.<br /> <br /> In 1908, John Charles created a new plan for Woodland Park and the zoo, with the Great Lawn serving as its focal point. With zoo buildings arranged next to formal gardens, a playground, wading pool, and tennis courts were placed along the Great Lawn’s boundary. Believing native forests are vital to urban areas, John Charles preserved the area’s natural woods, and enhanced them through a network of trails.",

In terms of architecture, Woodlawn Cemetery brought in the talents of McKim, Mead, & White, John Russell Pope, Edwin Lutyens, John Merven Carrère and Thomas Hastings.<br /> <br /> As for landscape architects, Beatrix Jones Farrand worked on the Harkness Memorial Garden and the Milliken Memorial at Woodlawn Cemetery. Farrand was one of the founding members of the American Society of Landscape Architecture, with her most popular surviving project being Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C. Ellen Biddle Shipman also designed the landscapes for three mausoleums at the cemetery.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Brothers handled the lot designs for Frederick Constable and Ernest Stauffen at Woodlawn, and in the 150 years since its creation, the cemetery is known for the serious collection of trees that spreads out around the burial lots.<br /> <br /> During Olmsted Sr.’s early years, cemeteries were one of the few places those not in the upper class could go for open green space. Olmsted Brothers created memorial gardens designed to provide comfort for those visiting their loved ones. No longer the only green space in town, cemeteries still reflect parks in many ways.",

    "bodyText": "When Chicago was chosen as the city to host the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893, Frederick Law Olmsted was called on to adapt his initial designs for the South Park Commission site, now called Jackson Park, Washington Park, and the Midway Plaisance, to be more appropriate for a fairground.<br /> <br /> Olmsted would collaborate with architect Daniel Burnham to create Venetian-inspired please grounds complete with waterways and natural areas for quiet reflection, complementing the grand architecture of the fair. This collaboration between the two men would help launch the “City Beautiful” movement, promoting the inclusion of green space in urban centers to improve the community’s morale and quality of life.<br /> <br /> Twenty years before the exposition, Olmsted and Calvert Vaux had conceived of lushly planted lagoons for this area of Chicago, which would finally come to fruition. Olmsted would dredge the swamp in the area, leaving an island at the center of the lagoon, dubbed The Wooded Island, which was meant to be the central piece of landscape architecture at the fair.<br /> <br /> As Olmsted would explain it, his goal in the design at the Chicago World’s Fair was ““to establish a considerable extent of broad and apparently natural scenery, in contemplation of which a degree of quieting influence will be had, counteractive to the effect of artificial grandeur and the crowds, pomp, splendor and bustle of the rest of the Exposition.”",

    "bodyText": "<p>One of the five peninsulas that are designated a part of the Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park, the former island called World's End boasts more than 250 acres, and four drumlins. World's End is home to one of the highest points in the harbor and offers excellent views of Boston and the south shore.  </p> <p>Similar to other islands in the harbor, the Indigenous community used World's End seasonally for thousands of years before European colonization. According to European sources, the town of Hingham deeded the land from the Wompatuck, Squmuck, and Ahahden in 1662 in return for a \"valuable consideration.\" Colonists used the island for farming and grazing animals. Around that same time, colonists created a causeway, called \"the bar,\" which connected two of the outermost drumlins to the mainland.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>In 1855, John R. Brewer purchased a 10-acre parcel of land. Brewer began construction on the land immediately, erecting a caretaker's cottage the same year. The following year, construction on the main house began. In 1859, Brewer hired a \"landscape gardener\" who cut down many of the cedar trees and replaced them with ornamental trees and flowers.   </p> <p>Brewer purchased both <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/langlee-island.htm\">Langlee</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-sara.htm\">Sarah Islands</a>, and he continued to purchase land on World's End until he owned all but two parcels of land. He established a family farm with plenty of space for crops and pasturage. In 1886, Brewer hired <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/frederick-law-olmsted.htm\">Frederick Law Olmsted</a> to subdivide the plots into a redevelopment that would be called \"World's End.\" Olmsted mapped out roads, and created 163 lots. Although Brewer followed Olmstead's plans of tree-lined roads and groves, he never subdivided the lots. Brewer died in 1893, and left the estate to his children. By 1900, the estate included a creamery, a blacksmith shop, lodging for workers, greenhouses, and windmills. </p> <p>In 1936, Brewer's youngest daughter, Fanny Brewer, died. Farming operations ceased, though employees continued to care for the land. In the 1940s the military put a searchlight on one of the drumlins.<sup>2</sup> The Trustees of Reservation purchased the peninsula in 1967 and eventually the peninsula became a part of the Boston Harbor Islands National and State Park. Today, the island is still owned and operated by the Trustees of Reservation. The peninsula is open to the public, and has 4.5 miles of tree lined paths.<sup>3</sup></p> <h2>Learn More...</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/boha/learn/historyculture/facts-woen.htm\">Island Facts: World's End - Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)</a></p> <hr /> <h2>Footnotes </h2> <ol> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> <em>Volume 2: Existing Conditions</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017) 275-278; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park</em>,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> <em>Volume 1: Historical Overview</em></a> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 29. </li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 31-34,187-188; Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v2.pdf\"> Volume 2: Existing Conditions</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 275-278. </li> <li>Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, <em>Cultural Landscape Report: Boston Harbor Islands National & State Park,<a href=\"http://npshistory.com/publications/boha/clr-v1.pdf\"> Volume 1: Historical Overview</a></em> (Boston: National Park Service, 2017), 192; The Trustees of Reservations, \"World’s End,\" Accessed April 6, 2023, <a href=\"https://thetrustees.org/place/worlds-end-hingham/\">World's End, Hingham, MA - The Trustees of Reservations</a>. </li> </ol>",

    "bodyText": "Olmsted Brothers were hired in 1938 to assist in the design of Wright Brothers Hill. The hillside in the middle of the site, along with vegetation along the edges, separated the formal, symmetrical design at the top of the hill from the casual character of the lower area’s meadow. This subtle design technique keeps with the Olmstedian belief that potentially conflicting uses should be separated.<br /> <br /> According to Olmsted Brothers’ original plans, an eight-foot path was to encircle the entire site. A grass pathway once encircled the site, but no longer exists due to the loss of shrubs that defined the path’s edge. Wright Brothers Hill exhibits several characteristics of Olmsted’s design philosophies and practices.<br /> <br /> The diverse planting design combined with 100 different plant species at Wright Brothers Hill reflects the emphasis Olmsted placed on the liberal use of planting as a fundamental component of landscape design. A 1939 stock list specifies 8,181 plants for the site. Expansive lawns throughout the site, a large open meadow in the eastern portion of the site, and the dense tree and shrub plantings along the periphery and in specific other locations both define the spatial organization of the site and frame vistas into the larger landscape beyond.<br /> <br /> The site’s balance of formal and informal areas follows Olmsted’s idea that “formal design was generally limited to…special gathering areas.” Today, the site retains its original Olmsted Brothers plan.",

With its old beech trees and topography, Olmsted Brothers identified Wyman Park as one of the finest single passages of scenery to be so close to a large city. Because they were so taken aback by the landscape of Wyman Park, Olmsted Brothers advocated the site becoming a stream valley reserve that would fit into the city’s grid. Within Wyman Park is the Wyman Park Dell, a 16-acre section of the park known for its steep enclosing slopes and sweeping lawn, which was fully realized and conceived by Olmsted Brothers.",

    "bodyText": "In the summer of 1915, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. visited the thousand-acre plantation that would make up Yeamans Hall. When viewing the grounds, Olmsted Jr. described them as “diversified and picturesquely undulating”, possessing “intricacy and mystery”.<br /> <br /> Olmsted Jr. was asked to render his professional opinion about the plantation’s suitability “as an admirable winter resort development”. For nearly ten years, Olmsted Brothers worked with fellow professionals to bring to fruition their collective vision of all the property could be. Olmsted was particularly impressed with the area’s natural beauty, ability to extend golfing season, proximity to Charleston, and accessibility by rail.<br /> <br /> The collaborative professional team was composed of Olmsted Jr. Seth Raynor and James Gamble Rogers, course architects, to create an “admirable winter resort” first described by Olmsted Jr. in 1915.",

Many thought he was crazy to leave behind his landscape architecture work, and his father made sure Frederick knew his displeasure over the move. However, at the time no one could have known that this move would set the stage for the creation of parks from the natural domain.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{30}\" paraid=\"1014588677\">A year after his move to California, the state had secured a grant deeming Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove inalienable parkland. A commission was formed to oversee the creation of the public preserve, with Olmsted serving as Superintendent and Chairman.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{34}\" paraid=\"1912661631\">Another year would pass before Olmsted wrote his report on Yosemite Valley and Mariposa, stressing the uniqueness of the valley, not because of the towering cliffs, but because of the union of the entire landscape, and the experience of taking it all in, uninterrupted.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{38}\" paraid=\"1710684116\">Olmsted wrote his report for Yosemite and Mariposa with a distinct eye for the times; the Civil War was over and he was expanding upon Lincoln’s vision for a broader, more inclusive interpretation of democracy as he wrote the foundation for our national park system.</p> <p paraeid=\"{b6eb8cd1-ec5f-4a65-8051-1e538403a946}{42}\" paraid=\"242410202\">Like father, like son, Olmsted Jr. would join in on his father’s fight 50 years later when asked to refine his father’s work and address the need for a new bureau to manage scattered parks and monuments. This would start a 6-year correspondence, culminating in Jr.’s writing of the Organic Act, which would help solidify the creation of the NPS, keeping great natural wonders in the hands of the people.</p>",

    "bodyText": "In 1913, Olmsted Brothers were commissioned by Ypsilanti to provide advice on how to help the town grow, not only to attract business and industry, but also to provide a healthy living environment for its citizens. Focusing attention on the Huron River, Olmsted Brothers were blunt in their criticism of the area.<br /> <br /> In their report, Olmsted Brothers noted that “Huron River with its large natural reservoirs and its steep channel, was long ago claimed for economic uses, by water power development in a small unsystematic way. Many mills were built but most of them have since fallen into disuse and decay, and the river is now largely in a picturesque state of neglect. Its shores now overgrown in many places”.<br /> <br /> While hired to landscape Ypsilanti for its then six thousand residents, they were also able to design the area's parks as well. Olmsted Brothers called for green space along the river, a park entrance off of Michigan Avenue, and pathways along the perimeter of green space, all of which was implemented.",

Farms required acequias as the rain in South Texas was too infrequent and could not be depended on to water the crops.  A river with dependable flow, proper bank height, and slope were all requirements for establishing a mission. The San Antonio river met all those requirements. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5a0d1efb-0fa5-4e3e-8235-3b5fde9f94a3}{166}\" paraid=\"379189508\">Acequia systems began with a dam that would raise the water level. The dam diverted water from the San Antonio river and forced it into hand dug earthen ditches that carried the water to farms around the missions. Eventually emptying back into the San Antonio River.  The Espada Dam still diverts water from the river into the Espada acequia system, the oldest continually used acequia system in San Antonio.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{5a0d1efb-0fa5-4e3e-8235-3b5fde9f94a3}{186}\" paraid=\"1082033129\"><strong>Acequias: The Lifeblood of the Missions </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{2b357f2c-284d-4f64-a1b6-c2c54783fe1c}{88}\" paraid=\"869676761\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">A short walk from the parking lot takes you to the Espada Dam, the only Spanish built dam that remains.  The Espada dam was constructed by 1745. The dam is built from flagstone layers placed on a natural ledge across the San Antonio River. The shape of the dam is unusual in that it points downstream instead of upstream. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5a0d1efb-0fa5-4e3e-8235-3b5fde9f94a3}{210}\" paraid=\"817406788\">The Espada dam is a diversion dam.

At this spot along the river you can see Double-crested Cormorants resting on logs, Great Egrets wading along the rivers edge looking for its next snack, and Black-bellied Whistling Ducks in flocks floating in the river. Listen and you might hear how they got their name, from their boisterous whistle of a call. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4ff1ef97-a9cf-436e-a771-528a45a21026}{65}\" paraid=\"1269387204\">This spot is also a great place to catch turtles sun bathing. Look along the top of the dam or on a floating log and you might see a Red-eared Slider or Texas River Cooter. </p>",

    "audioDescription": "The northern most of the 4 missions in the park, Mission Concepcion can be found nestled between the San Antonio River corridor and a small suburban neighborhood. The grounds of the site of Mission Concepcion are 5 acres in size and are dominated by a church that is approximately 40 ft tall and is built of white/gray limestone. The front of the church faces west and is marked by a large wooden door that is approximately 10 feet tall and two large bell towers that sit on either side of the structure. Attached to the side of the church is the convento, that is made up of 3 rooms and served as the living quarters for the friars and priest who lived and worked at the mission. In front of the church and convento is a large grassy field dotted with trees that leads down to the filled in remains of a stone quarry. Remnants of the quarried limestone can still be seen protruding through the soil. Lastly off to the side of the grassy field, one can find a grotto made of limestone that is used by the churches modern parishioners as a place to pray and light candles.",

Beginning in 1779, several attempts were made to grow wheat but failed due to storms and seed germination. The first successful harvest of wheat was in 1794 at Mission San Jose. The same year the mill was completed.    </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{126}\" paraid=\"910138816\">The gristmill at Mission San Jose was the first mill in Texas and it was powered by water from the acequia. The mill was likely built into the quarried area after the lime kilns were discontinued.  The lime kilns can still be seen today at the back of the mill. There you will see three circular indentations into the wall.  These are remnants of the lime kilns.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{168}\" paraid=\"1567351437\">The mill you see today was restored in the 1930’s.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{178}\" paraid=\"635439960\"><strong>Acequias: The Lifeblood of the Missions </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{0cc0d2d0-3439-4ef2-9cb7-00c873f94e36}{34}\" paraid=\"2000980281\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Acequias not only irrigated crops but they also powered machinery.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{190}\" paraid=\"808912478\">The acequia water was diverted through a ditch and sluice gate to the gristmill forebay. The Miller would open the gate when he was milling the wheat. The water would flow through the sluice gate to the forebay, a containment area to hold the water. The forebay gate, located at the bottom of the forebay, would be closed. Water would fill the forebay. Once filled, the miller would open the forebay gate to allow water to flow through the forebay channel to move the horizontal wooden water wheel. Water flowed out of the forebay channel and powered the wooden water wheel pushing the wheel counter clockwise. Once the water had powered the wheel, the water would flood a field behind the mill. Water continued to flow from the acequia into the forebay during milling operations to maintain a steady flow of water to the water wheel. </p> <p paraeid=\"{40bd53e8-a248-4a85-9261-f7700addf7cc}{200}\" paraid=\"645572537\">Inside the mill house you can see the two mill stones. The wooden water wheel below moved the grind stones in the mill house. The miller would pour flour into the wooden hopper, then the wheat would spread between the two mill stones and be ground into flour. Flour would pour out the bottom as the finished product. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Located outside the mission walls is a reconstructed gristmill. In front of the mill is a cement lined acequia, or irrigation ditch. The acequia diverts to a ditch that leads to the gristmill. At the front of the mill building is the forebay, a cement water holding tank. The one-story mill building is made from sandstone. Inside the building is one room with three windows that houses the milling equipment, including the two mill stones and hopper. Below the mill building is a vaulted tuffaceous limestone room where the wooden water wheel and other milling mechanisms are located. Stone stairs lead down to the water wheel and mill race.",

This church, although smaller than the churches found on the mission sites to the north, still represents one of the most dramatic changes that indigenous people undertook as they moved from their traditional way of life to that of being a citizen of Spain.

It was on the feast day of San Antonio de Padua and so they named the river the San Antonio River.</p> <p paraeid=\"{59a56b3c-7bc8-421e-a7ac-9b49a7ba5edf}{72}\" paraid=\"282682060\">Mission San Juan was originally founded in East Texas, not far from Cushing, and named Mission San Jose de los Nazonis, an indigenous group. The French pushed the Spanish out o East Texas requiring the mission to move to its current location. They moved supplies and renamed the mission San Juan Capistrano. The name was changed because there was already a Mission San Jose along the San Antonio River.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{59a56b3c-7bc8-421e-a7ac-9b49a7ba5edf}{96}\" paraid=\"1946118533\">In 1756 the mission was home to 265 indigenous people and the first stone church with sacristy, granary and convento were completed.  The mission would build and complete two churches with a third church never being finished. The second and current church was completed in 1772.  The third church was built beginning around 1775 and would accommodate a growing population. The church was never complete because the mission population declined.    </p> <p paraeid=\"{59a56b3c-7bc8-421e-a7ac-9b49a7ba5edf}{184}\" paraid=\"1808646160\">The mission was partially secularized in 1794 and fully secularized in 1824 by Mexico.   </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{3c013b28-fd64-45f4-9748-c7ac568a7f78}{36}\" paraid=\"1479540010\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Bicycle Information </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{3c013b28-fd64-45f4-9748-c7ac568a7f78}{100}\" paraid=\"1239521138\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Please walk bikes on sidewalks inside the missions. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{3c013b28-fd64-45f4-9748-c7ac568a7f78}{102}\" paraid=\"1590934022\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The bike rack is located near the mission entrance.

    "audioDescription": "Situated 7 miles south of downtown San Antonio, one of the first things that a visitor might notice about the mission is the quiet tranquility. The grounds measure 2.5 acres in size being fully surrounded by low eroded remnants of the historic walls that once protected the mission's inhabitants. The mission church stands apart from the rest of the structures as its walls are plastered white due to modern upkeep of this active Catholic church. However, despite its brilliant appearance the mission church is smaller than its counterparts to the north measuring 100 feet long, 25 feet wide and 35 ft high at it's bell tower. In the southwest corner, just outside of the compound's walls, visitors can find the start of the Yanaguana trail, a .3 mile long trail, that weaves it's way through the lush overgrowth near a small creek that empties into the San Antonio river. The trail provides visitors the opportunity to experience some of the natural Texas ecosystems that were common before the Spanish arrival.",

The Yanaguana Trail is a 0.3 mile long paved trail that weaves its way through the lush overgrowth along an original channel of the San Antonio River. The trail provides visitors the opportunity to experience some of the natural Texas ecosystems that were common before the Spanish arrival. <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0d8ff1ac-eafc-4507-ace7-4c04c6a2ad4b}{7}\" paraid=\"213882730\"><strong>Wild San Antonio </strong></p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{5bf9cf9c-cfbd-4a1c-b8ae-96591bb048d9}{189}\" paraid=\"1516406589\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The Yanaguana Trail takes you through a riparian area out to an original channel of the San Antonio river. The Yanaguana offers a rare look at what the San Antonio river and riparian area would’ve looked like before the Spanish arrived.  Look all around you, and you will find pecan and mulberry trees, and grape vines. This would’ve been prime gathering grounds for the indigenous people of South Texas.   Follow the trail out to the river channel and see if you can spot a Great Blue Heron perched on the rivers edge or Red-eared Slider on a log. Listen carefully and you might hear the call of a Red-shouldered Hawk or of a Barred Owl. The Barred Owl sounds like it is saying “who cooks for you? who cooks for you all?\" <br /> Keep your eyes and ears open as you are bound to experience a wilder side to San Antonio.   </p>",
    "audioDescription": "This path bends through a riparian landscape of live oak trees, pecan trees, mulberry trees, and mustang grape vines. On the far side of this loop, the trail comes to an original section of the San Antonio River.",

San Antonio Cultural Arts consulted with local communities, the San Antonio River Authority, the East Pyron Symphony Lane Neighborhood Association, and bird specialists to develop the creative concept.</p> <p>Ceramic nests pertrude out from the colorful wall. Gonzalez Martinez also uses flat-stamp iconography influenced by re-conquest indigenous communities of modern-day Mexico to portray the flora and fauna of the this World Heritage Site.<br /> <br /> Check this mural out on your way from Mission San Jose to the Espada Dam!</p>",

Down the hill and across the road is a massive giant sequoia with a deep black burn scar at the base. Beyond it is a single-story building with reddish brown planked wood siding and several multi-paned windows. Thick wooden beams and joists are visible. The building has a green peaked roof, and there is a paved pedestrian plaza in front of the building. On the panel is a closer photo of the view in front of you, except the building has a red peaked roof. A sign on the roof reads, \"Giant Forest Market\". A dozen 1990s-era cars are parked in front. The caption reads, \"This 1996 photo illustrates an unusually quiet summer day at the old market. Note the bare ground, which has since been revegetated.\" The text reads, \"Across the road stands the Giant Forest Museum, where you can learn about sequoia trees. Not so long ago a very different scene greeted people here. The museum was a busy market. To the right of it stood a cafeteria and gift shop. A third building housed another gift shop. To complete the scene, imagine the three motels and dozens of cabins that were spread out behind you. But the scene has changed. Commercial services have given way to preservation of sequoias. We can always build gift shops and cafeterias, but the wonders of the Giant Forest, over 3,000 years in the making are irreplaceable.\" A photo of a fallen sequoia log in front of a building with a person walking through a cutaway section of the trunk. The caption reads, \"For decades these lodgings in the Giant Forest damaged sequoia roots. The buildings, in turn, were damaged by fallen sequoias and their limbs. For the good of the trees and the safety of visitors, the facilities were moved. You can still enjoy commercial services in the park, but outside of the sequoia habitat.\"",

    "audioDescription": "The View: In front of you is a magnificent view of the forest below. From here you can see the varied sequoia treetops. The oldest often have a dead tip rising above the foliage. The tallest, are mature sequoias with a round crown. The narrow-pointed tops belong to younger sequoias. The text reads, The canopy of leaves cloaking the Giant Forest covers the work of a dramatic change agent- fire. Fire has shaped every sequoia you see. Young trees grow tall fast to rise above the low flames that typically burn here. Then they put on thick bark, which protects them from most fire. Black scars on sequoia trunks reveal the trees' ability to survive. If today's view includes smoke from the park fire, this may be a good day for the sequoias grove. Flames clear forest litter and fertilize the soil, prompt cones to release seeds, and open the forest to the sun. This creates the ideal seedbed for sequoias. Other trees and wildlife benefit from the fires affects, as well. A photo of your left view from this location shows a robust green forest with tree tops of various shapes and sizes. Mountain tops line the view in the distance. The caption reads, Look to your left for this view of treetops of the Giant Forest. The tallest round crowns are mature sequoias. The oldest ones often have a dead tip rising above healthy foliage. Young sequoias show very narrow pointed tops. An inset photo shows a park firefighter walking through patches of fire and billowing smoke, on the forest floor in a grove of Sequoia trees. He wears a backpack and a yellow helmet and shirt, and holds a metal canister with a flame coming out of the nozzle. The grove includes a very large sequoia trunk, with two large burn scars, almost 10 feet high. There are also a few fallen tree trunks, about one foot in diameter, and a few charred stumps. The caption reads, A changing of your fire Rather than put out every fire, the parks plan carefully to use it as a tool. The goal: to take advantage of fire's benefits while minimizing risk to people, property, and the health of the Forest.",

Take a walk along the edge of that outline to see how immense these trees are. The text on the panel reads, A Giant's Footprint The stones in the pavement behind you simulate the \"footprint\" of Ed by Ned, the twin sequoia trees growing in front of you. The footprint gives an idea of the area on which mature sequoia trees stand. If it seems large, consider the enormous size of the tree balanced upon that spot. A black and white photo of two joined sequoia trees trunks. At twelve feet high on the trunks, on either side of the joint, are wooden signs. Below each sign stands a man, wearing a vest and hat. The caption reads, Ed by Ned, the nickname given by John and James Jordan in 1906, are two individual trees that grew so close together their bases joined. An illustration of the two joined sequoia trunks, with a white dashed outline showing the shape made by their combined bases. The caption reads, The combined bases of Ed by Ned spread 34 feet long and 25 feet wide (or 10.3 m by 7.6 m) a great size for a swimming pool.",

    "audioDescription": "The View: In front of this exhibit are three giant sequoia trees. Their massive trunks stand side by side, in a row. On the upper corners of this wayside exhibit frame are tactile sequoia cones made of brass. The cones are about the size of an egg, with a small twig attached to each. The cones have been flattened on the bottom to help secure them to the frames. Many wayside exhibits in the Giant Forest have similar brass cones. The text reads, A Graceful Grouping Known as The Three Graces, these three sequoia trees are all the same age. How did they come to stand in such an orderly row? At some time in the past, a large tree probably fell here. In falling, it may have torn an opening in the forest canopy, letting sunlight hit the ground. Eventually one of the frequent natural fires here burned it up. Sequoia seeds sprout in huge numbers after fire. They grow particularly well where it burns hot enough to leave nothing but ash and bare soil. They survive even better where sunlight also reaches them. A row of ash left by the burned trunk of a tree that opened the forest as it fell would be the perfect spot. A black and white photo shows three giant sequoias, touched by shafts of sunlight that also illuminate the dirt road beside them. The caption reads, Other sequoia threesomes have been called the \"Three Graces\" in the past. This lovely trio was named when the Moro Rock Road beside it was still a simple path. Two photos of other in line Sequoias. A photo of four sequoias in a line with two dirt roads, each of which runs in between the trees on the left side of the grouping. The caption reads, If you drive south from here, you will pass The Four Guardsmen, another example of same aged sequoias growing in a line. The second photo shows a line of giant sequoia trunks in groupings of three and four with a single trunk to the right. The caption reads, Sequoias in a group like this are fairly common. Look for them as you explore the park's sequoia groves.",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit, titled \"A Living Shrine\", shows black and white photos, and text about honoring those who have fought for this country. A photo of a ceremony at the General Grant Tree. A man wearing a park ranger hat and uniform is attaching a large decorated wreath with a bow to the tree's trunk. A flag of the State of California drapes down around a flagpole. Two other men stand stiffly at attention, wearing round helmets and dark colored uniforms. One of them is holding a rifle at his side. Their waist length jackets have light colored insignia and buttons. and their trousers have a stripe down the side. A wooden sign mounted on a base next to the tree reads, General Grant Tree. The Nation's Christmas Tree. The text reads, Strong. Uplifting. Inspirational. Enduring. Sequoias and other \"trees of life\" inspire profound emotion, reminding us of ideas above and beyond ourselves. What could be more fitting, therefore, than naming the General Grant Tree as a National Shrine? Still standing after countless storms and fires, it honors the immeasurable sacrifice made by those who gave their lives in service to the nation. A quote from the Congress of the United States of America in 1956. \"The General Grant Tree...a national shrine in memory of the men and women of the Armed Forces who have served and fought and died to keep this Nation free...\" A photo shows a man making a speech. He is elderly, with short white hair and dressed in a dark uniform, with a small winged insignia and bar of striped ribbons on the jacket pocket. At the cuff of the jacket sleeve is a light colored wide band with four smaller bands going up the arm, and an appliqued star near the elbow. He is standing behind a podium with a piece of paper on it, and is facing a shiny, old fashioned microphone, that is shaped like an upright pill, with a fan shaped arc above it. An American flag, hangs on a pole, next to the podium. The text reads, In 1956, Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz stood here to dedicate this tree as a national shrine on behalf of President Eisenhower. Perhaps, just eleven years after World War II, the peace and stability embodied by sequoias seemed especially important.",

    "audioDescription": "The View: Before you is a view of almost the entire General Grant tree, the second largest sequoia in the world. Its thick trunk and immense mass dwarf the magnificent giant sequoias surrounding it. This exhibit has a photo and text on the left side. On the right side is a recessed rectangle with tactile images of a giant sequoia, and a person next to it, in scale. The main text reads, A Monarch The General Grant Tree towers above the grove. Only excellent sequoia habitat would allow it to reach this tremendous size - 268 feet tall and 40 feet wide - at just 1700 years of age. Below the text is a photo of the dead, bare top of a sequoia trunk that sticks up taller than the tops of its surrounding branches, which have full green foliage. The text reads, The dead top on old large sequoias doesn't mean they are dying. Fire scars at the base of the tree prevent water and nutrients from reaching the tip of the trunk. On the right side of the exhibit, you can feel the outlined shapes, and compare the sizes of, a giant sequoia and a tiny human figure next to it, in the bottom right corner. The text reads, A Presidential Tree This tree was named in 1867 for Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant. Inspired by this tree and its neighbors, in 1890 Congress protected Grant Grove as a national park - the nation's third after Yellowstone and Sequoia. The tiny human figure, to the bottom right of the tree, gives a sense of scale. The Braille information provided on this exhibit has already been explained in this Audio Description.",

A charred tree stump is next to it. A photo of a fire burning near the base of a sequoia tree. The text reads, A Natural Process Frequent natural fires shape this ecosystem. Fires have touched every mature sequoia many times. Thick insulating bark protects mature sequoias from all but the hottest flames. The Tennessee Tree before you has burned more dramatically than many, yet it still survives. How? Sequoia wood is high in tannin, a chemical that helps exposed wood to resist rot and insects. Where bark remains, nutrients can still flow. Look up to see how much of this tough tree lives on. A photo shows the ground next to a sequoia tree trunk. It is thickly covered with pine needles and small branches. The text reads, Sequoias depend on fire. Fire clears leaf litter away and opens the cones, allowing seeds to reach the bare mineral soil they need to grow. A photo shows a bright green young seedling sprouting up from darkened soil with patches of white ash. The text reads, Wildfires create open spaces where sunlight can reach the forest floor. Young trees in these clearings get abundant sunlight, water, and nutrients. On the right side of this exhibit is a photo of a sequoia tree trunk, engulfed in flames. Smoke billows around the tree. The text reads, Fire eventually conquered the tree to the right, leaving only a stump. Before it died, however, the tree left its legacy: thousands of seedlings that sprouted after earlier fires. Some of the trees around you may be its offspring.",

The text reads, An amazing range in elevation, from 1,359 feet (or 411 meters) to 14,494 feet (or 4,417 m), makes these parks extraordinary. The diversity in elevation results in a huge variety of plants and animals. Their habitats range from low, hot foothills to evergreen conifer forests to cold alpine peaks. Biodiversity, the variety of life, is protected in these parks for you and future generations to enjoy and study. A photo of the view in front of you. Rounded foothills in the foreground covered with trees and shrubs. Higher up, conifer forests. Even higher, in the distance, snowy peaks. The photo identifies three habitat zones: Alpine Zone. Mount Eisen. 12,160 feet (or 3,706 m). Castle Rocks. 9,180 feet (or 2,798 m). Conifer Zone. Giant Forest. 6,500 feet (or 2,000 m). Moro Rock. 6,725 feet (or 2,050 m). Milk Ranch Peak. 6,250 feet (or 1,905 m). Foothills Zone. Amphitheater Point. 4,390 feet (or 1,337 m). You are here. The text identifies three animals are shown for each habitat zone: Alpine Animals: adapted to high, snowy peaks. Photo of a gray-crowned rosy finch. The bird is rosy pink with gray wingtips, tail, and head. A photo of a pika, a small tan furry animal shaped like a little rabbit, except with small oval ears. A photo of a mountain yellow-legged frog with bulging round eyes and a wide mouth. Its skin is bumpy and tan, except for its belly and inner legs, which are bright yellow. The text reads, Conifer Forest Animals: Adapted to cool, moist woods. A photo of a white-headed woodpecker with a red patch on the crown. Its wings are black with long white feathers at the edges. A photo of a pine marten. This tan furry animal has a pointy black nose with long whiskers and oval-shaped upright ears. A photo of the non-venomous mountain kingsnake. Its body is circled with repeating bands of red, black and white. The text reads, Foothill Animals: adapted to dry, hot summers. A photo of a California quail. The bird's head is black with white streaks, and has a black top knot that curves forward. Its body is plump and round. A photo of the venomous western rattlesnake. It has a broad, bluntly triangular head. Its upper body is light tan, with brown blotches. Its lower body is banded with stripes. A photo of a gray fox, like a dog with a fluffy tail.

Vehicles longer than 24 feet are not advised between Foothills Visitor Center and Potwisha Campground. Vehicles longer than 22 feet (6.7 km) are not advised between Potwisha Campground and Giant Forest Museum.<br /> <br /> Foothills Visitor Center is one mile beyond the entrance station and is open daily from 8:00 am - 4:30 pm. Stop here for trip planning information and maps.<br /> <br /> As you climb from the foothills to the forests, weather will get cooler. You'll reach the giant sequoia groves about 45 minutes beyond the entrance station.</p> <h3>Be Prepared</h3> <p>There are no gas stations within park boundaries, although there are limited, seasonal stations on nearby national forest lands.

    "audioDescription": "The landscape surrounding Ash Mountain Entrance Station is rolling hills, covered with scattered brush and small trees, including blue oaks and buckeyes. Ahead, you can see a rocky mountain top. Here, at the entrance station, the road widens from a two-lane road, into a four lane road, with two heading uphill. On the downhill, or exit side of the road, is a small parking lot. Separating the exit side of the road from the uphill, or entrance, side is a median with a one-story entrance structure, a pole flying the United States flag, and a red stop sign. The entrance station is made of pale grey stone cobbles, with brown wood framed windows, a reddish-brown wood plank eave, and thick brown wooden roof rafters. The word \"Sequoia\" is carved into the stone in capital letters near the top of the building. An extension of this building looks like an enclosed porch. The bottom two or three feet are made of the same stone as the on the main building, but the upper half is made of reddish brown plank wood. Thick wooden rafters support the roof and stick out, shading part of the building. Windows adjacent to the entrance and exit lanes may be open so that park staff can assist drivers. Signs provide information about fees, vacancies, and safety. Separating the two entrance lanes is a second structure that is much smaller, about the size of a toll booth. It also has a stone base, with a wood plank structure above, and windows open to the car lanes. As you drive up to enter the park, outside the main building, a rectangular wood plank sign reads, \"Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks Entrance fees. Just past the entrance station is a sign with current campground status information on occupancy.",

    "audioDescription": "The text reads, This trail climbs through forest to Hockett Plateau. The large meadows and rolling hills of this gentle piece of high country contrast with peaks and crags of Mineral King destinations. Like most park trails, Atwell Hockett Trail leads into designated wilderness. One of the highest forms of protection for public lands, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to experience. Possible destinations include: A photo of a grassy meadow. Near the edge, a rustic wood building stands by tall trees that ring the meadow. A line of upright wood posts mark a fence through the field. The caption reads, This is Hockett Meadow, 10.4 miles (or 16.7 kilometers) one way. Elevation: 8,499 feet (or 2,591meters). The trail breaks out of the trees and into this large meadow, where deer graze summer's rich grasses and wildflowers. A photo shows a fast-moving stream through a rocky clearing, surrounded by young sequoia trees. The caption reads, Golden Trout Wilderness in Sequoia National Forest. 18 miles (or 29 kilometers) one way. Elevation: 9,780 feet (or 2,981 meters) at park/forest boundary. South of the national park boundary lies Sequoia National Forest. Different regulations apply; check with a USFS ranger station for more information. A map of the Mineral King area shows our location at the Atwell Hockett Trailhead. The bottom photo is of a large flat meadow circled by conifers. A rustic log cabin with a peaked shingle roof stands in the meadow. Its chimney has a tall capped flue. It is the historic Hockett Meadow Ranger Station. A smaller wood shed is nearby. A quote from The Wilderness Act of 1964. Outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive or unconfined type of recreation.",

This is the spot where the cars used to be able to drive onto the log for photos. <br /><br />The border between the lot and the historic \"photo op\" is marked with upright log posts about two and a half feet high. To the left of these posts, when facing the tree trunk, is a wooden sign engraved with white lettering. It reads,<br /><br />Auto Log <br />Base Diameter - 21 feet. <br />Fell in 1917. Since then many types of vehicles have been photographed on this unusual log driveway. <br /><br />There is a short-cut to get below the tree, to a spot where many people like to take pictures. If you walk another 20 feet past the wooden sign, there is a narrow dirt path through a cut in the trunk. This opening in the log is about 2 feet wide and 12 feet high. From below the log, photos can be taken, looking up at the log with people standing on top.",

Here and there a thin top layer of rock appears to be missing, creating a thin edge along the surface of the dome, like the dried outer layer of a giant onion. Beyond the edge of the rock is a view of forested hills. Layer after layer of hills descend into the distance, becoming fainter and fainter, until they are hard to see against the hazy sky.

    "audioDescription": "Text is shown in English and Spanish, but for this audio description we will only read English. This wayside exhibit, titled \"Berries, Bees, and Snow\", shows how wildlife depends on manzanita plant flowers and berries. The View: Behind this wayside exhibit, within easy reach from the sidewalk, is a Manzanita bush, 2 to 3 feet high. Depending on the season of your visit you can touch its leaves and feel for berries. But use care, as there are often bees around this bush. The area around you has covered picnic benches and paved paths. The text on the panel reads, The greenleaf manzanita before you is a berry making machine, well adapted to the local pattern of snowy winters and dry summers. In fall, many animals rely on its berries. But timing and amount of this prize food may be at risk, because climate change affects not only snow but bees. If snowfall changes or bees arrive at the wrong time, fewer berries may appear and maybe not when wildlife needs them most. Help scientist track changes to this essential plant and the ecosystem that relies on it. Take photos using the nearby picture post. A photo of a black bear, standing amid bushes with bright green oval leaves. The bear is covered with black fur, with a tan muzzle, black nose, and large round ears. The caption reads, In late summer and fall, bears gorge on berries to fatten for winter. Many other mammals, birds, and insects also depend on manzanita, Spanish for little apples. A photo shows a black textured clump with tan colored nuts mixed in it, on the ground. The caption reads, Black bear scat (or poop) loaded with manzanita berry seeds. Four photos of a manzanita branch with oval pointed leaves show how it looks during each season. Simple graphic icons illustrate weather conditions. From left to right, Winter Snow (with two snowflake icons): leaves with tiny green clusters are partly covered by snow. The caption reads, Snow cover protects dormant berry buds from winds and hard freezes. Warmer winter mean less snow, which threatens survival of buds. Springtime Buds (with two raindrop icons): A cluster of pink bulb shaped flowers. The caption reads, As roots absorb melting snow, pink buds appear. With warmth and moisture, buds become small white or pink flowers. Summer Pollination (with a sun icon): A bee is inside the flower cluster. The caption reads, Buzz pollination makes berries possible. Bees beat their wings to shake pollen from flowers, which fertilizes seeds. Listen for manzanitas buzzing with bees. Autumn Harvest (with a single raindrop icon): A cluster of bright red berries. The caption reads, The reddish-brown berries may stay on bushes into the late fall, feeding animals for months.",

    "audioDescription": "Surrounding the Big Stump Entrance Station is a forest of conifer trees, including sequoias. Large granite rocks line the highway. Here, at the entrance station, the road widens from a two-lane road into a three-lane road, with two heading up into the park. On the park exit side of the road, is a small pull out with a wooden building with a peaked green roof and two sets of brown metal double doors. In the median separating the exit side of the road from the entrance, is a one-story structure, as well as a red stop sign and stop light. This rustic structure has a stone base, about 3 feet high. The upper part is made of planked pine, with wood framed windows, a plank eave, and very thick wooden beams, supported by thick curved wooden braces. These stick out on the entrance side, shading that part of the building. It has a cross gabled roof with green shingles. The words \"Kings Canyon\", in capital letters, are carved into a thin granite slab near the top of the building. Windows adjacent to the entrance and exit lanes are open so that park staff can assist drivers. A pole behind the building is flying the United States flag. Signs provide information about fees, vacancies, and safety. Separating the two entrance lanes is a second structure that is much smaller, about the size of a toll booth. It is a smaller version of the building just described. Just past the entrance station is a sign with current information on campground status and occupancy.",

Sledding accidents send over 20,000 people to emergency rooms each year in this country. <strong>The most common reason people get hurt is they sled when conditions are bad (icy snow, rock or tree hazards exposed, poor visibility), so if the snow isn't great or you can't see, don't sled!</strong><br /> <br /> Don’t let an accident ruin your winter fun.</p> <ul> <li>When sledding, slide feet first.</li> <li>Consider wearing a helmet.</li> <li>Make sure your path is clear. Don’t slide near rocks, trees, branches, or other people.</li> <li>After sliding, look uphill. Move out of the way of people coming downhill after you.</li> <li>Don’t slide into roads or parking lots.</li> <li>Avoid hard-packed snow or ice, where speed and direction get out of control.</li> <li>Sliding devices that can be steered may be safer than others.</li> </ul> <p>In an emergency, contact a ranger or call 911.

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit, titled \"The Ultimate Sacrifice\", shows black and white photos and text about the Mark Twain Stump. The View: Continue along this short dirt path through a conifer forest, several hundred feet to a giant sequoia tree stump. The stump stands about 5 feet tall. The top has been cut away and you can climb up a few wooden stairs to the top. The top surface is uneven and there are no safety rails. Once on top, one can see how the trunk's deep layers of tree growth radiate out in concentric layers, like a cut onion. You can also walk around the base of the stump, to discover how truly huge this tree was. On the wayside is a photo of this forest, in 1891. A few large sequoias are surrounded by sparse younger trees. A giant sequoia tilts dramatically. The cut on the right side of its base is wedge shaped. The caption explains that a photographer shot this sequoia mid-fall, and that the forest around you has regenerated since then. The text reads, The Mark Twain Stump in front of you has a unique story to tell. In 1891, while lumbermen were cutting other sequoia trees for grapevine stakes, lumber, and shake shingles, the Mark Twain Tree was selected for another fate, world fame. The American Museum of Natural History in New York City wanted a cross section of a giant sequoia for display. The Mark Twain Tree was chosen to provide the slab. Through this huge tree's sacrifice, many people far from California could marvel at the immensity of sequoias. Some vowed to preserve the remaining giants as living, growing monuments. At the top left is a historic photo of a woman, in a long dark dress, posing in a line with four children and a man with a beard, in front of a giant sequoia that is twice as wide as their group. This is the Ben Hicks family at the still standing Mark Twain Tree in the 1880s. The tree was nearly 300 feet (or 91.4 meters) tall and was 91 feet (or 27.7 meters) around at the base. A photo of the trunk of the tree, with a deep gouge on the right side, and a large pile of wood chips. Two lumberjacks chop and saw inside the cut. It took 13 days to bring the tree down. A photo of the stump, with a cut slab next to it. Lumberjacks cut the slab into movable pieces for rail shipment to New York. Another slab went by ship to the British Museum in London. A photo of three girls looking at a slab mounted on a display in a New York museum.",

These silent watchmen have observed change across this landscape throughout their expansive lifetimes; a closer look at these trees provides curious visitors with clues about our climates' past, present and future.<br /> <br /> If you'd like to learn more about sequoias, join a park ranger for a guided hike through the Giant Forest and gain an understanding about forest health, fire ecology, and the life cycles of the largest trees on earth. Try your hand at measuring the diameter and height of these giants as part of an ongoing community science project. Middle and high school field trips, college classes, and volunteer groups of all ages are welcome to join for a fun-filled, informative day of exploration! Call Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks' Education Office at 559-565-4211 or email seki_ritc@nps.gov for more information.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The Big Trees Trail circles a meadow within a forest that's canopied with pine, incense-cedar, fir, and, of course, sequoia trees. The branches of young sequoias give them the cone shape of most other conifer trees, like a Christmas tree. Mature sequoias, however, have trunks that become much bigger than the branches. Branches only start about halfway up the trunk. Mature sequoias, called monarchs, are nature's skyscrapers. Trying to glimpse their tippy tops could give you a sore neck. Their trunks are reddish brown, with thick layers of deeply furrowed bark that is soft and fibrous on the surface, like shredded wheat cereal. Some trunks have dark, indented triangular scars, caused by fire. The forest floor is covered with a thick, soft carpet of pine needles. Around large sequoias, the ground is also covered with thin strips of bark that have shredded away from the tree trunks. The forest creates a rich habitat for a large variety of wildlife, including black bears, mule deer, chickarees, and gray squirrels. Depending upon the season, you may also hear the sounds of forest birds: ravens, nuthatches, and Steller's jays. As the seasons change, so does the look of the forest. Spring brings warming temperatures and small colorful wildflowers in the meadow. Winter brings a blanket of snow.",

    "bodyText": "<p>A giant sequoia dedicated to the memory of Booker T. Washington-a leader in the African-American community during the late 18th and early 19th centuries-stands before you.<br /> <br /> Colonel Charles Young-a commissioned officer in the US Army who served as the first superintendent of Sequoia National Park, dedicated this tree in honor of a man he deeply admired. Deployed to protect the park in the summer of 1903, Charles Young and his men travelled by horseback from the Presidio in San Francisco to Sequoia National Park, reaching their destination 16 days later. Assigned to extend a wagon road leading into the park, Young and his men made steady progress, meeting the goal of extending the road into the Giant Forest.<br /> <br /> The African-American army company working on the road were known as â€˜Buffalo Soldiers'. The citizens of nearby Visalia were so impressed with their work, they insisted that one of the giant trees be named in Captain Young's honor. Young declined, asserting that 2,000-year-old living trees should not be diminished by attaching any human's name. He acquiesced when it was agreed upon that the person honored would be Booker T. Washington.<br /> <br /> The significance of this Giant Sequoia tree was forgotten over time. After nearly 100 years, this tree has been rediscovered, and in 2003-on the hundredth year anniversary of the tree's dedication-a rededication ceremony was performed to honor Charles Young and Booker T. Washington. A sequoia has been named for Charles Young and is nearby.</p>",

Washington tree heads slightly downhill from the road. The tree is about 100 yards away. There is a large fallen branch between the road and the tree.

    "audioDescription": "We are in a V-shaped river cut valley, near the entrance to Boyden Cavern. This section of the river and the highway are surrounded by tall marble cliffs. Yucca plants stick up from these cliffs. They have a spiky ball of leaves at their base, with a single tall spire of flowers, rising like a plume above it. Along the base of the cliff are bay laurels, with long thin dark green leaves. If you run your hands over the leaves, you can smell the fresh scent. There is a brown wooden building with peaked roofs and long wood planks on the outer walls. It has a double door on the end closest to the parking area with a wooden sign with white lettering over it that reads, \"Gift Shop\". The wall that faces the river has a door at the far left side, and two windows on the right, with a ledge the runs below them. A small wooden pamphlet holder is attached to the ledge between the windows. Over the windows, a wooden sign with white lettering reads, \"Boyden Cavern\". This is the concession building that sells tickets to the cavern. Beside it is a trail up to the cavern entrance, which is alongside the river. The trail up to the cave is not accessible.",

Water in the soil weathered the granite into round shapes, eventually exposed by erosion. Another photo shows a Western fence lizard scurrying up a stone.

You can touch the roots of the sequoia tree. The roots are intertwined like a honeycomb, branching out, as if each root piece was still digging into the ground. Dirt and rocks are still intertwined held tightly in the root system. Dirt and rocks are still held tightly in the root system. If you feel the between sections of roots, you may be able to find pieces of dirt and rock. Feel the very center of the roots, about 4 feet above the ground.

The ground around the trees is clear so you can walk over and explore their trunks and feel their bark. A black and white photo of a bearded man mounted on a dark horse, in front of a massive sequoia tree trunk. He is dressed in a cavalry uniform, wearing a felt hat with a medium sized brim and cylindrical crown that comes to a rounded peak. His jacket has large buttons and braids across the chest and on the cuffs. Around his jacket is a leather belt with bullets encased along the back. His pantaloons are tucked into buttoned knee boots. He has a riding crop tucked under his leg. His saddle rests on a striped blanket. The saddle's foot strap has a leather flap that wraps around the ankle of his boot. The caption reads, A cavalry trooper poses in front of the Sherman tree, circa 1910.<br /><br />The text reads, Shaping a Park Call the cavalry! The Parker group owes its name to the cavalry officer who commanded troops here in 1893. Why was the military here? Congress established Sequoia National Park in 1890, but the National Park Service did not exist until 1916. So who could protect Sequoia and our other national parks in the meantime? The U.S. Cavalry. Every summer from 1891 to 1913, mounted troops guarded these parks. They rode almost 300 miles from their post at the San Francisco Presidio. The cavalry's duel task of guarding the parks and assisting visitors came with little instruction or funding. Yet the troopers managed to end serious damage to sensitive alpine meadows by limiting poaching and driving out illegally grazed sheep. They also built roads and trails to provide access for an excited public. A quote by Captain J. H. Dorst, first military superintendent of Sequoia National Park. \"The more one sees of [the Giant Forest], the grander it seems. To spoil it would be desecration.\" A black and white photo portrait of a man in a dark jacket with braids, buttons, and epaulets. He is slightly balding, with a mustache and long sideburns. The caption reads, Captain James Parker The text reads, Far from Family The Parker Group of Sequoia honors Captain James Parker and his family. In 1893, as the second military superintendent of Sequoia National Park, Parker commanded troop B of the fourth cavalry. For several summers, the troop stayed not far from here at a site called Soldiers Camp.",

The distant rocky peaks are jagged, but the closer ones are rounded, sloping down to u shaped valleys filled with dense conifer forests. The peaks, shown from left to right and top to bottom are: Mt. Clarence King, Mt. Gardiner, Buck Peak, Glacier Monument, Grand Sentinel, and North Dome.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />This smooth walled canyon differs so much from the jagged peaks that surround it. You can thank glaciers for this scenic contrast. These rivers of ice deepened, widened, and straightened this canyon's curves.<br /><br />Natural processes created the awesome scenery protected here. Geologic uplift, glacial movements, flood, fire, erosion, all had a hand in what you see. In these parks, these processes continue to generate change and beauty.<br /><br />A photo shows a valley with a still lake. Curving down to the lake's edge is a glacier, with streaks of dirt, rocks, and chunks of ice embedded in it. The sheet of ice reaches up into the snowy base of the surrounding mountain ridges.<br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />The glaciers in these parks, the southern most in North America, are melting faster than ever seen before. Palisade Glacier, shown here, may be gone soon.<br /><br />An illustration of the canyons before you, filled with snow and ice. A section cut through the illustration shows the depth of the ice.<br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />During the ice ages past, centuries of snow built up, compressed into ice, and slid slowly downward. They filled this canyon, scouring and scraping the canyon's walls with boulders picked up along the way.<br /><br />An illustration of the same canyons, after the ice melted. Scrape marks gouge the walls of the canyons where the top of the ice had been. <br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />As ice ages end, glaciers retreat, dropping the rock they carried, often in rows or piles. Watch for these moraines on the floor of the canyon. Look also for the U-shaped profile that marks a glacially sculpted canyon.<br /><br />On the top right corner is the National Park Service logo, in the shape of an orange arrowhead, pointed downward. Inside the arrowhead are the words in white lettering, \"National Park Service\" with a green sequoia tree shape to its left. Near the bottom of the arrowhead is a white buffalo silhouette set against a green meadow, with a white lake and snowcapped mountain behind it.<br />Below the arrowhead, Text reads, <br /><br />Help the park fulfill its mission<br />Protect scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife.

A photo of your view - a falcon's eye view from this peak, on Moro Rock. Through the clouds below is a tree and grass covered valley, with a light brown roadway, weaving across the hillside in switchback curves. The text reads, Prior to 1925, you couldn't have seen the dramatic zigzag of Generals Highway below- it wasn't there. Visitors came up a one-way road two canyons farther northwest. Cars would make the steep drive uphill in the morning and downhill in the afternoon. By 1925, visitors on this rock could see, and hear, traffic on the Generals Highway. Can you hear it? Whether you think of it as a sound or as noise is up to you. This is historic road has become part of the landscape and soundscape of this park. A photo of a peregrine falcon flying towards us with outstretched wings. Most of its body is grey with black stripes that widen at the tips of the wings and tail. Its head appears hooded with black feathers. The beak, throat and neck are white. The tail is spread open like an upside-down fan. The caption reads, Listen... natural sounds can reveal inner workings of ecosystems. Parks work to protect these soundscapes. Animals use sound to find food, defend territory, call mates, protect young, and avoid predators. Disruptive sound can change animal behavior. Peregrine falcons, which nest on Moro Rock, may leave the nest of disturbed by noise.",

    "audioDescription": "You are in a conifer forest with small trees. Some are charred, with no leaves. A brass plaque with engraved lettering on a stacked stone pedestal reads, Converse Basin Grove One of the largest stands of giant sequoias. It contained some of the finest big trees. The grove was logged as private land between 1897 and 1907. First by the Sanger Lumber Company, and later by Hume-Bennett Lumber Company, which in 1909 developed Hume Lake for a mill. Converse Basin, two miles northeast of this monument, has its own mill and narrow-gauge rail connection to the logging town of Millwood, from which lumber was sent to Sanger in the valley by flume, although they never realized any profit. The companies cut several thousand big trees and left only the largest, The Boole Tree, unfelled. The area today is part of Sequoia National Forest, which regulates all uses including logging, but none of the ancient sequoias will ever be commercially cut again. Jim Savage, Chapter 1852 and E. Clampus Vitus. October 23, 1977",

    "audioDescription": "A wooden sign on wood posts with white embossed lettering reads, \"Colonel Young Tree.\" The footpath has a slight uphill grade. The Colonel Young Tree is about 200 yards away at the top of the dirt path. You can probably smell the scented pines around you. A canopy of Ponderosa Pines and white firs provide a blanket of shade. Along the sides of the path, depending on the season, there are clusters of purple-blue flowers. As you make your way to the end of the path, you take a sharp turn to the right, and then you see it: a majestic monarch sequoia. If you walk around it, you can feel smoother, darkened indents in the tree about 5 to 8 feet across. They are called fire scars. If you touch that darkened part, your hands may become dark with charcoal.",

    "audioDescription": "The View: You are surrounded by large sequoia trees. Their green canopy provides welcome shade. The text explains that the road to Moro Rock is part of the legacy of America's first black national park superintendent. Captain Charles Young, a West Point graduate, commanded the cavalry units of Buffalo Soldiers who were assigned here in 1903. Before there were park rangers, the military guarded national parks. Young's troops were the first African-Americans to do so. In just one summer, he and his men completed many projects. They took some of the first vital steps towards long- term protection of this park. Captain Young later earned the rank of Colonel, and became a national figure. A sequoia named for him stands a short distance along the trail. A black and white photo of a man mounted on a horse standing on a wooden bridge. His saddle rests on a thick blanket. The saddle's foot strap has a leather flap that wraps around the ankle of his boot. He is dressed in a dark long-sleeved shirt and light-colored pants, and wears a brimmed felt hat. He wears long leather gloves that come up to his forearm. His pants are tucked into buttoned knee boots. In this rare 1903 photo, a Buffalo soldier poses on the Marble Fork Bridge in Sequoia National Park. A black and white photo portrait of Charles Young. He is clean shaven. He wears a white shirt under a buttoned jacket. On his collar are the letters \"U.S.\" and a U.S. Calvary pin of two crossed swords with a number \"9\" in the center. A quote by Charles Young next to his portrait reads, \"The people of the adjoining country and tourists are awakening to the benefits and beauties of the park and desire to protect the game and Forest....\" Text to the right reads, Who were the Buffalo soldiers? Buffalo soldiers were African Americans who served in the United States cavalry after the Civil War, primarily in the American West. It is believed that American Indians- who revered the buffalo- gave the name and tribute to the soldiers' courage, skill, and appearance. These soldiers carried the name with pride.",

Sledding accidents send over 20,000 people to emergency rooms each year in this country. <strong>The most common reason people get hurt is they sled when conditions are bad (icy snow, rock or tree hazards exposed, poor visibility), so if the snow isn't great or you can't see, don't sled!</strong><br /> <br /> Don’t let an accident ruin your winter fun.</p> <ul> <li>When sledding, slide feet first.</li> <li>Consider wearing a helmet.</li> <li>Make sure your path is clear. Don’t slide near rocks, trees, branches, or other people.</li> <li>After sliding, look uphill. Move out of the way of people coming downhill after you.</li> <li>Don’t slide into roads or parking lots.</li> <li>Avoid hard-packed snow or ice, where speed and direction get out of control.</li> <li>Sliding devices that can be steered may be safer than others.</li> </ul> <p>In an emergency, contact a ranger or call 911.

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit, titled \"Community\", shows four different types of conifer trees. The View: The forest is canopied with pine, incense-cedar, fir, and, of course, sequoia trees. The text reads, Community Look at the canopy above you. This forest is a diverse neighborhood that supports more than sequoias. How many different kinds of trees can you count? Look for differences in cones, leaves, and silhouettes. Protecting sequoias means safeguarding this entire forest. Across the exhibit are four indented rectangles, each showing a different tree. Each rectangle has a raised cone outline on the left. Next to it is a raised outline of the shape of the leaves (also called needles). Both of these are in true scale. There is a silhouette of the mature tree on the right of each rectangle, but it is not tactile or to scale. Going from left to right the trees are: 1. Incense-cedar, or Calocedrus decurrens. The raised cone does not have a typical cone shape; its two outer scales open into a v shape, leaving a thin central structure inside the v. The shape next to it illustrates the thick, short, flattened leaves on a cluster of tiny branches, forming a broom-like spray. The tree has a long thin trunk with a conical top. The text reads, Often mistaken for a sequoia, its leaves are flatter and its bark is harder and rougher. 2. Giant sequoia, or Sequoiadendron giganteum. You can feel a raised cone outline on the left. The cone is brown, with dark ridges crisscrossing it. The leaf to the right has what looks like long thin twigs, covered in small overlapping green scales, which are the needles. These needles are tiny and hard to see. The text reads, Its short sharp needles overlap each other, completely covering the twigs. The tree has a tall thick trunk, with short stubby branches starting two-thirds of the way up. 3. White fir, or Abies concolor. The cone stands upright on the branch, above the short needles that grow along the sides of the branches. Horizontal ridges tightly crisscross the cone. Inside the raised leaf outline, the photo shows needles in a row on either side of the twig. The tall narrow tree has branches pointing downward. The text reads, Needles grow in neat rows along the twigs. Cones grow upright and fall apart while still on the branch. 4. Sugar pine, or Pinus lambertiana. Inside the raised cone outline, the photo shows the cone opening. Dozens of fan-shaped segments, like scales on a fish, are open, having released the seeds within. The raised leaf outline on the upper right shows a cluster of five long thin needles, coming out of a central point. The text reads, Long slender branches extend far from the trunk. Needles grow in bunches of five. The Braille information provided on this exhibit has already been explained in this Audio Description.",

    "audioDescription": "The View: To the left of the wayside exhibit is a large rock with mortar holes embedded into it, where Native American people once pounded acorns into meal. Each hole is between 4 and 12 inches wide, in a conical shape. On the left side of the rock, is a Bay Laurel tree, with long, dark green, pointy leaves. The leaves are aromatic when crushed. Overhead are Canyon Live Oak trees, with oval leaves that are jagged and pointy on the outer edge. A large Sumac bush on the right has olive green leaves that are oval with a pointed tip. From this site, you can often hear the river flowing through the canyon below this exhibit. The text reads, This site once served as a busy kitchen for a village. It provided Native American people everything they needed for cooking: rocks and sticks to shape into bowls and utensils, river water, and nutritious acorns from oak trees. Women chipped the hollow bedrock mortars into these rocks to pound acorns into flour. Baked into cakes or boiled to make mush or soup, acorn meal sustained the village. The main image is a black and white photo of an older American Indian woman seated crossed legged in a printed dress, with an apron around her waist. Around her are three deep rounded baskets made of woven grasses or reeds. Two are striped and one has a zigzagged pattern. Two long narrow sticks rest atop the largest basket. To her right is a large cloth laid out on the ground. Two shallower plain baskets lie on the cloth. A building made of upright slatted wood boards is seen behind her. The caption reads, Western Mono tribe member Hi a inh, also called Jane Whaley, sits with traditional baskets and stirring tool (1929 to 1930). Another black and white photo shows a middle-aged American Indian woman at work. Her dark hair pulled back in a bun and she's wearing a dress with a ruffled collar, seated on a blanket on a large flat rock. With arms bent, she holds a conical shaped stone the size of a bread loaf above a round hole in the stone next to her. The caption reads, Women used a shaped stone to pound acorns into meal or flour. A time-consuming process, preparing acorns gave friends time to talk, laugh, and socialize. Yokuts tribe member Mary Pohot, 1925. Below there is an image of an acorn- a brown thumb sized oval nut with a light brown textured \"cap\".",

    "audioDescription": "This outdoor exhibit panel is titled, \"Competition\" and features two photos with captions and additional text about giant sequoia ecology. This exhibit features a photograph of the brown trunk, a very large trunk of a mature giant sequoia tree. Other mature firs trees are seen in the background, and a cluster of small fir seedlings are in the photo’s foreground. The photo’s caption reads, “White fir seedlings grow thickly around the base of this mature sequoia.” The exhibit text reads, “Where sequoias grow, white firs can usually be found nearby. These two tree species compete for space and sunlight on the forest floor. Both trees begin as seeds that are dropped on the forest floor from cones high above. Once the seeds sprout, their roots must reach bare soil to get nourishment to survive. White firs have larger seeds that provide energy to grow longer roots. Tiny sequoia seeds sprout shorter roots that often die before reaching nutrients and water. Without the frequent fires that are natural to sequoia groves, white firs would take over. When fire moves through the forest, sequoias gain the advantage. Fire clears away dead leaves and exposes bare mineral soil. Heat triggers sequoia cones to release their seeds, resulting in masses of seedlings when conditions are right for them to survive. Thick bark protects older sequoias from fire. To the right of the giant sequoia photograph is a smaller photo of a small, brown-tinged sequoia seedling and a sequoia cone, found atop incense cedar twigs and plant material on the forest floor. The photo’s caption reads, “A Warming Forest“, “In this sequoia grove, winter’s storms build a deep snowpack that melts continuously through spring. If the forest becomes warmer, more precipitation will fall as rain, not snow. The snowy season would shorten, resulting in drier summers. Sequoias may struggle to reproduce in these conditions. If temperatures climb, the youngest trees may disappear, threatening the future of the grove.”",

The trail travels through several aspen forests and meadows, ending at Granite Lake, a stop that offers beautiful vistas of Mount Hutchings, Goat Mountain, and Comb Spur. The first campsite along the trail is at 4 miles at Lower Tent Meadow. This is a hot, steep climb, so you may want to plan your hiking for early in the day or late in the evening.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The text reads, Spectacular views of the Kings Canyon reward those who climb this trail. Lower Tent Meadows offers a welcome rest halfway to the top. After ascending steeply over 5,000 feet (or 1525 m), the trail levels out in Granite Basin. Like most park trails, Copper Creek Trail leads into designated wilderness. One of the highest forms of protection for public lands, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to experience. A photo of a grassy flat area, surrounded by rocky hillsides dotted with conifers. A steep white mountain range is seen in the distance. The caption reads, Granite Basin and Granite Lake. 1.8 miles (or 12.9 km) to The Lip. Elevation: 10,348 feet (or 3,152 m). \"The Lip\" marks the entrance to Granite Basin. Granite Lake lies about 2 miles (or 3.2 km) farther. Monarch Ranger Station, which is intermittently staffed, is a short way down the trail near Granite Pass. A photo of a meadow of green grass and shrubs, lined with tall trees. Steep mountain walls rise beyond the trees. The caption reads, Simpson Meadow. 22.8 miles (or 36.7 km) one way. Elevation: 5,990 feet (or 1,826 m). After Granite Pass, the trail passes through forested canyons, and then descends quickly to the Middle Fork of the Kings River and Simpson Meadow. Side trails along the way lead to State and Horseshoe Lakes. A map shows the location of the Copper Creek Trailhead, The bottom photo shows a rocky slope dotted with trees. The top of a mountain range, in the distance, is covered with snow. The caption reads, A view from Copper Creek Trail. A quote by Willa Cather, \"We come and go, but the land is always here.\"",

The text on the panel reads, Correct Climate Sequoias need a climate like the Giant Forest has now, lots of precipitation but not very cold temperatures. Yet this area was not always ideal sequoia habitat. This meadow reveals that, until about 4,000 years ago, very few sequoias grew here. It was either too dry or too cold. This meadow records the history of local climate. Over thousands of years its soil formed in layers as plants decomposed. Scientists can identify these plants and know what type of climate they require. That tells us what the climate was like when they were growing here. A background photo, taken from the meadow, shows a dense line of giant sequoias against a dark sky. An illustration, layered on top of the photo, shows a cross section of the meadow's soil, with bright green grass on top of a brown layer, a dark green layer below that, then a grey layer at the bottom. The text reads from top to bottom, Meadow Layers Reveal Sequoia's Past Bright green layer: Ideal for Sequoias. Today to 4,000 years ago. There is enough rain and snow to support sequoias and their forest neighbors. Brown layer: Too Dry. 4,000 to 12,000 years ago. Sagebrush and dry climate pines grew then. Dark Green layer: Too Cold. Before 12,000 years ago. An ice age dominated the landscape. A glacier 500 feet thick (or 152 m) filled the canyon at Lodgepole just north of here. Cold tolerant plants that lived here then now grow 3,000 to 4,000 feet higher in elevation. Grey layer: Solid Bedrock.",

    "audioDescription": "The View: A giant cross section of a sequoia trunk stands before you, tilted up, like a wall, behind the wayside panel. The section is about 15 feet in diameter. A thick crack runs through its center. Thick bark is seen on the top but has been worn away lower down. You can feel how uneven the outer edge of the trunk is. Thin cracks run roughly parallel to the outer edge. On the wood around the outer edges of these cracks, you may feel very subtle ridges, running perpendicular to the cracks. Each ridge represents one year of growth after the fire, as the tree wraps around the edge of the scar to cover the opening, and protect the tree. The text reads, Cross-Section Story This slab from the stump of a giant sequoia tells a story of fire and survival. The annual growth rings show that the tree lived about 2,210 years. Marks within some rings show that, during that time, at least 80 different fires burned hot enough to leave a scar. Mature sequoias survive all but the very hottest fires. Thick, fibrous bark insulates the tree from killing heat. The bark holds very little sap or pitch, so it is not very flammable. As you can see in the slab, even if fire does penetrate the bark on occasion, it doesn't often kill the tree. Mature sequoias live quite well despite large fire scars. A photo of the trunk section. The caption reads, This slab was sliced from the base of a giant sequoia that grew not far from here. In 1950 the park cut the tree down because it threatened to fall on rental cabins. Recognizing the hazard to both visitors and trees, the park eventually moved overnight facilities out of the sequoia grove. Visitors no longer risk having sequoias fall on them while they sleep. Two-thousand-year -old sequoias no longer risk being felled because they lean over little cabins. An inset circular photo shows a close up of the trunk section, entitled, Scars and Healing It shows two dark curved cracks. The cracks are highlighted in red and the wood outside the cracks is highlighted in yellow. The caption for the red highlights reads, These scars reveal how many fires were hot enough to damage the word beneath the bark. A typical sequoia here has survived several such fires during each century of its life. The caption for the yellow highlights reads, Notice wider growth rings next to the cracks. After fire, sequoias often grow faster for a few years. It may be due to decreased competition for nutrients and water for several years after surrounding plants are burned away. A black and white photo of this sequoia tree starting to lean to one side as loggers cut the base. The caption reads, The tree from which this slab was cut was photographed as it fell in 1950.",

    "bodyText": "<h3>Crystal Cave will not be open for the 2024 season due to damage to the road and trail leading to the cave caused by flooding and landslides during extreme 2023 winter storms and the 2021 KNP Complex Fire. </h3> <p>Crystal Cave is an excellent example of a marble cavern. There is a moderately steep (but paved) half-mile trail from the parking area to the cave entrance. The trail through the cave is also one half mile. Because of fragile formations, the only way to visit the cave is on a guided tour. Tours are suitable for all ages. If you decide to see the cave, plan on spending about half a day traveling to the cave, walking to the entrance, and taking the 45-minute tour.</p> <h4>Tickets and Operating Hours</h4> <p>Visit <a href=\"https://www.sequoiaparksconservancy.org/crystalcave.html\">Sequoia Parks Conservancy's Crystal Cave</a> webpage for tour dates, important information about tours, and a link to purchase tickets. Tours are 50 minutes and tickets are available from our parner, the Sequoia Parks Conservancy. Tickets must be purchased in advance, online. Tickets do sell out, so it is recommended that you book three weeks in advance of your visit. <br /> <br /> Tickets are not available at the cave.</p> <h4>Services</h4> <p>No services are available at Crystal Cave. At the Crystal Cave Parking lot restrooms and food storage lockers are available. Everyone is required to remove all foods and scented items from cars and place them in the food storage boxes.</p> <h4>Accessibility</h4> <p>The trail to Crystal Cave, though paved, is very steep and narrow, and not recommended for visitors using mobility assistive devices. For an American Sign Language (ASL) translation of the Crystal Cave tour, please ask at the information booth at the Crystal Cave trailhead for a tablet with ASL interpretation. For an in-person ASL interpreter, please email the SPC Field Institute at SFI@sequoiaparks.org. Assistive Listening Devices with SM receivers are available at the Crystal Cave Entrance Booth located at the Crystal Cave Trailhead. Neck loops are available for those with T-coil hearing aids.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This bulletin board has information notices, program schedules, and photos of Crystal Cave. It also has safety information. A black and white historic photo of a cave filled with rough and polished marble, including icicle like stalactites and mounds of stalagmites. A large tour group of all ages is intently focused on what the ranger is pointing to. Many women are wearing skirts that fall below their knees. A few men wear short brimmed hats. The caption reads, A 1950s tour group views Marble Hall, the largest room in Crystal Cave. The text below reads, Welcome the Crystal Cave Wild Cave Tour Learn proper caving techniques as you explore off trail and crawl and climb through passageways on this four to six-hour tour. Limited to 6 people, ages 16 and up. Before your Tour Remove all food and scented items from your vehicle and place them in food storage lockers in the parking area. Store all food, coolers, related items, and anything with an odor (even if it's not food) including unopened cans and bottles. Deposit garbage immediately in bear proof containers or store it like food. Take infant seats out of cars; the smells they absorb may attract bears. If You See a Bear Don't let a bear approach you or your food. Wave your arms. Make loud noises, and throw small rocks in its direction (avoid hitting the face or head). Keep a safe distance but be persistent. If a bear does get food, never try to take it back. On the right side of the board is a photo of a rectangular solar panel, with a shiny black surface with a grid of thin metal lines. It sits on a rod, tilting upward. The text reads, Going Solar With the help of a grant, the Crystal Cave lightening system received an important upgrade. Solar panels replaced the old propane generator, eliminating noise and operating costs. New efficient lights reduce energy use. More importantly, the new system will protect the cave and its watershed. A photo of a man installing lighting cables in the cave. The caption reads, LED bulbs are bright and efficient. They also do less harm to sensitive cave dwelling animals that are sensitive to light and heat. A photo shows a close-up of a flat tan surface, separated from a foamy looking green surface, by a curved line of tiny white crystals. The caption reads, Less algae and moss grow under LED lights than under the old lighting system. This lets you enjoy the natural colors of the delicate cave formations and helps to protect the cave ecosystem.",

    "audioDescription": "The text explains that Crystal Cave is a dark, beautiful, fragile underground world. It is paved and lit. The trail winds through large and small cave passages. There is a photo of the historic Spider Web Gate, a metal gate made to look like a web across the cave's opening. Others include a brimstone dam in a cave room and water polished marble bedrock. A map of this area shows our location in the parking area. Safety information, Getting to Crystal Cave It is a half mile walk from here to the cave where the tour starts. The downhill trip to the cave entrance takes approximately 20 minutes. The trail is paved but has stairs, uneven ground, steep drop offs, and can be slippery. It can be icy in early summer or late fall, or slippery at any time. After the tour, the uphill return trip is steep and strenuous, with a 320-foot (or 100 m) elevation gain; take your time and enjoy the scenery. Consider the strenuous nature of the trail before participating in a cave tour, especially if you have heart, respiratory, or mobility concerns. The total walking distance, including the tour, is 1.5 miles (or 2.4 km) There are no restrooms on the trail to the cave or at the cave. From the time you leave this parking area, no restrooms will be available for at least 1 and a half hours. Use restrooms here before heading down the trail. Drinking water is not available at the cave. Bottled water can be purchased at the information booth. On future visits, consider bringing drinking water in a reusable bottle. Protect Crystal Cave Do not touch cave formations. These \"growing rocks\" are easily damaged by touching. Oils and dirt from human hands discolor them and prevent them from growing. Leave bulky items in your car or at the cave entrance. Backpacks, tripods, hiking sticks, and other items that can damage cave formations cannot be carried into the cave. Child carriers of any kind are not allowed; babies are safest when carried in front. Pets are not allowed on the trail or in the cave. Pets may not be left unattended in the parking area or in your vehicle. Food and drink cannot be consumed in the cave (except water). Leave all natural and historic objects undisturbed. Please do not take rocks, cones, cultural artifacts, or other items. Protect Yourself All natural areas pose risks. You are responsible for your own safety. Rattlesnakes and bees may be seen along the trail to the cave. If you see them, keep your distance and inform cave staff. Poison oak, which can cause a rash, grows here. Avoid touching plants along the trail and near the cave. Stay on trails. Watch out for uneven or slippery footing. The trail is paved, but can be uneven, wet, or even icy. It is not brightly lit. Watch for stairs, narrow passageways, and low ceilings. The cave trail is steep and strenuous for some visitors. If you have physical limitations that will make it difficult for you to complete the cave tour and return trip, reconsider your plans to visit.",

A photo shows a creek flowing through a forested area, with a rustic bridge crossing in the distance. The caption reads, Sheep Creek Cascade. 1.0 miles (or 1.6 km) one way. Elevation: 5160 feet (or 1573 m). The Sheep Creek crossing provides a place to rest after a gentle climb. Ferns and a series of cascading waterfalls decorate this shady canyon. A photo of a green meadow surrounded by sequoia trees. The caption reads, Summit Meadow (Sequoia National Forest). 5.0 miles (or 8.0 km) one way. Elevation: 7900 feet (or 2408 m). The meadow lies at the junction of Don Cecil Trail and the unpaved Big Meadows Road, near the boundary between park and forest. A faint half mile trail leads from the meadow to the top of Lookout Peak; be prepared to scramble over rocks if you choose to go to the summit. A map shows the Trailhead at your current location. The bottom photo shows a stretch of rounded rocky mountain peaks with conifer trees on the lower slopes.

Your help in reducing these pollutants outside the park protects the scenery here. Behind that text is a photo showing a view similar to what can be seen from the exhibit area. Hills, or ranges, are covered with shrubby vegetation and descend into the distance. A horizontal dashed line marks a spot on the horizon below the hills, with text that says: Dashed line indicates approximate location of Coast Range. About 100 miles away, it is visible only on clear days. All of the text is repeated in Spanish. Below the main photo is a sidebar. One section shows two photos of the same location, one with very hazy air and one with clear air. text reads: Limited Scenery: Summer smog rises into the park, obscuring vistas.

A photo on the panel shows a line of giant sequoias at the meadow's edge. The text reads, Most sequoias die by falling, as the one in for of you did in 1992. Even in the best sequoia habitat these giants are not immortal. Soft soil, heavy snows, or root damage may unbalance a tree and cause it to lean. If it leans too much, its shallow roots cannot hold its huge weight, and the tree falls. In this tree's case, people may have hastened the process. A road cut near its base in the early 20th century severed some of its roots. It was tall enough that, had it fallen the other way, it would have hit the restaurant that once stood across the meadow. Additional text reads, I Heard a Sequoia Fall A quote by Bill Tweed, Park Ranger at Sequoia National Park, in July 1974: \"It was a calm, sunny day in the Giant Forest. Out of the clear blue came loud cracks as the roots snapped, and then a crash like thunder. We found the tree shattered, with an amazing amount of water flowing from the broken wood. Touching the inside of the sequoia was startling, it was ice cold.\" A photo of a destroyed building, the walls and roof demolished and topped with tree debris. The caption reads, It's not wise to build beneath sequoias. They don't fall often but when they do, watch out. This photo shows the devastating effects of a falling sequoia. In 1941, it crushed the park superintendents' house not far from here.",

Possible destinations include: The top photo shows a tranquil lake surrounded by gray granite and Florence Peak. The caption reads, Franklin Lakes. 5.7 miles (or 9.2 km) one way Elevation: 10,331 feet (or 3,149 m) at first lake. Colorful metamorphic rocks skirt the trail but, at the lakes, the gray granitic presence of Florence Peak dominates. Franklin Pass lies almost three miles beyond the lakes. The next photo shows a green valley with patches of snow. The caption reads, Farewell Gap. 6.4 miles (or 9.8 km) one way. Elevation: 10,587 feet (3,227 m).<br /><br />Farewell Gap, the low point in the prominent \"V\" to the south, marks the boundary between Sequoia National Park and Sequoia National Forest. A map of the Mineral King area shows our location at the beginning of the Franklin Farewell trail. The bottom photo is of a rocky \"v\" shaped valley dotted with trees and small patches of snow. A rocky mountain range lies beyond. The caption reads, View toward Franklin Pass A quote by Hanshan, Poet: \"Who can leap the world's ties And sit with me among the white clouds?\"",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit, titled \"Feeding the Foothills,\" shows color photos and text about blue oaks. About three feet to the left of the exhibit is a picture post, a metal post about four feet tall. The View: In front of the sign are two mature blue oak trees, and to your right is a California buckeye tree. Landscaped native flowers and plants surround the path. On the wayside is a large background image of a green, grassy hillside dotted with trees. A caption identifies the trees as \"Blue oak trees.\" The text is written in both English and Spanish. The English text reads, Tough blue oaks, like the tree before you, are key to most life in the foothills. Well-adapted to survive summer's heat, they produce abundant acorns. Many birds, mammals, and insects rely on acorns, especially in fall. In turn, others rely on the acorn-eating species. Climate is key to acorn production. If climate change brings hotter weather or less rain, the timing, quantity, or quality of acorns will shift. Help scientists track changes in these trees and in their ecosystem by taking photos using the nearby picture post. On the bottom left are two photos. The first is of an acorn woodpecker with an acorn in its beak on a tree trunk filled with acorns in holes. The next is of a black bear climbing a tree. The caption reads, Some animals depend entirely on fall's nutrient-rich blue oak acorns. To survive winter, black bears gorge on acorns and woodpeckers cache them in trees. On the top right is a large inset with four photos. The header reads, Rain falls mostly December through March, with very little summer or fall moisture. A photo of bright green, round leaves has three large illustrated raindrops overlayed on the top edge. The caption reads, New Leaves. Bright green leaves usually burst from leaf buds in February through March. Blue oaks rely on winter rain to produce this growth. A photo of small, round, yellow-green blossoms among leaves has two large illustrated raindrops overlayed on the top edge. The caption reads, Tiny Blossoms. Oak flowers aren't very flower-like. They're catkins, hanging clusters of blooms with no petals. Look for these small green flowers in spring. A photo of small green acorns on a leafy branch has an illustrated sun overlayed on the top edge. The caption reads, Fruit of the Oak. From catkins come acorns, the blue oak's prized product. With too little rain, acorns may drop before maturing. A photo of small, brown acorns on a sparse branch has one illustrated raindrop overlayed on the top edge. The caption reads, Fall Harvest. Some animals travel miles for the ripe, brown acorns. Look for this vital food on oak branches and the ground below and in animal scat (poop). Below the captions, footer text reads, Find its Phase. Look at the blue oak in front of you. What seasonal phase do you see? On the bottom right of the wayside is a QR code. Text reads, How else does climate change affect life in these parks? Scan the code or visit go.nps.gov/cycle2 About three feet to your left is the picture post. On top of the pole is an eight-sided platform. Each side has an illustrated outline of a camera pointed outward and arrows to indicate clockwise movement, as well as a number and direction label. Side 1 is N, side 2 is NE, side 3 is E, side 4 is SE, side 5 is S, side 6 is SW, side 7 is W, side 8 is NW. On top is an outline of the front of a camera with the labels 9 and Up. On the post is a sign with instructions, a QR code and the url go.nps.gov/post5, and a diagram of the top of the post. The text reads, Picture Post. Instructions: 1. Place camera on post at N (north) position. 2. Take a photo at all nine positions, moving clockwise. Photo 9 captures the sky. 3. Use the code or link to upload your photos.

By mid-September, they joined to form a single fire called the KNP Complex. From here you can see a steep, burned slope behind the Foothills administrative buildings where the fire burned in mixed hardwood and shrub vegetation.  You’ll notice a range of conditions, from blackened, standing-dead trees or bare ground, to areas sprouting grasses or containing live green trees.  At other locations in the app, learn more about how fire history, terrain, vegetation, and weather affect how a fire burns.  </p>",

To the right of the tree is a peaked wooden shade structure and a long brown wood building with a peaked green roof. On the panel, a black and white photo shows the same long brown wood building, with a parking lot in front of it. In the foreground are several old-fashioned gas pumps. Two long lines of 1950s cars, waiting for gas, stretch back through the parking lot, past the end of the building, and out of sight. The caption reads, Until 1970 the gas station shown here in the 1950s stood just across the road. It was one of the facilities removed to protect the sequoias of Giant Forest. The text reads, Try to imagine yourself standing here in the 1950s. You would have been facing a service station and a parking lot. Behind you stood almost 100 cabins and motel units. Development in the Giant Forest began long ago. As early as the 1890s people began building here. Campgrounds, hotels, shops, a post office, park headquarters, parking lots, a gas station, and a sewage treatment plant all stood on the roots of the sequoias. Over time, people recognized the damage being done to the grove's ecology and beauty. In the 1970s the park began to move services to less sensitive areas. In 1999 the last buildings came down. Today, the only facilities left here are those dedicated to one thing, helping you learn about the giant sequoias.",

There are six photos of different types of trees below it. The text reads, To people around the world, large old trees symbolize wisdom, fruitfulness, and strength. Because they live so long we imagine that they are eternal. However, giant sequoias and other \"trees of life\" are not immortal. They rely on natural processes to create habitat where they can reproduce and thrive. As long as we protect the sequoia's ecosystem, this tribe of ancients will live on. Is there an honored tree where you live? A photo shows two monks, wearing orange robes, seated before a large old tree. The caption reads, India: Monks meditate under one of the three most holy Bodhi trees in Buddhism. A photo shows a huge oak tree supported by scaffolding. The caption reads, England: The Major Oak, one of 50 Great British Trees, may have sheltered Robin Hood. A photo shows two large tree trunks, with a railed wooden walkway between them. The caption reads, Japan: The Great Sugi, a Cryptomeria tree, is honored as a Special Natural Monument. A photo shows a tall tree, with a thick trunk and fat, stubby branches at the top. The caption reads, Africa: A cultural and religious symbol, the baobab represents long life and endurance. A photo shows the view upward at a broad smooth tree trunk, with smaller branches of green leaves. The caption reads, New Zealand: All forest animals are said to be children of Tane mahuta (Lord of the Forest), a kauri tree. The last photo shows a tree with a massive trunk. Two people on the left are dwarfed by its size. The caption reads, Mexico: The revered El Tule, the thickest tree in the world, is a Montezuma cypress.",

You are standing near a giant sequoia that has an enormous black triangular scar at the base of the trunk that is about 15 feet high and 10 feet wide. The text on the panel reads, Frequent Fire Numerous fires created the large scar on the sequoia in front of you. Frequent fire is common in good sequoia habitat, and mature trees have ways to survive. Most large sequoias survive fire and live well despite large scars. Thick bark with many air pockets insulates the wood from heat. With little sap or pitch in it, the bark is not very flammable. High branches hold foliage well above most fires. With competing plants burned away, surviving trees get more water, nutrients, and sun. A photo of a fire worker inspecting the charred scar on a sequoia tree. He wears a yellow shirt, a white safety helmet, a backpack, and has a two-way radio on his belt. He touches the tree trunk with his left hand. His right hand is gloved, holding what looks like a shovel. The caption reads, A fire worker examines the base of a larger fire scar. A typical sequoia here might have survived several fires each century. New wood grows from either side of a fire scar, covering a little more each year. This healing growth leaves telltale marks on the tree's annual growth rings. These marks reveal how many fires a tree has survived.",

A background photo on the panel, taken from the meadow, shows a dense line of giant sequoia trees against a dark sky. The text reads, From Hurt to Healing Across this meadow, a restaurant, campground, and dozens of cabins once crowded the sequoias. Behind you stood the early park headquarters. Cars once drove where you now stand. Round Meadows's sequoias have been threatened by development more than once, yet people ultimately chose preservation. Preserving the Sequoia Habitat Late 1800s. There were plans to log the giant sequoias. Local citizens saved them by demanding the creation of Sequoia National Park in 1890. Early 1900s. Round Meadow, ringed by cabins, was still privately owned. In 1916 donations to the National Geographic Society bought Round Meadows for public use. Late 1900s. As the park became more popular, roads, campground, utilities, and public cabins spread around the meadow. In the 1970's the public began to support efforts to repair years of ecological damage. The park began eliminating facilities, removing the last building in 1999. Today. It's up to us to carry on. If we want to save sequoias, we must preserve their habitat, the natural places and processes that allow these amazing trees to thrive. A photo of the view before you, except that it shows a brown wood planked building on the far side of the meadow. A truck is parked on the road in front of it. A red circle has been drawn around the building. The caption reads, For decades, sequoias suffered so that this restaurant, which stood directly across from you, and more than 100 other buildings and their associated utilities could operate here.",

    "audioDescription": "The View: In front of you is a dark brown log cabin about 24' wide by 18' deep. The outer walls are made of logs that have been cut down the length on four sides, to create long square beams, about two feet thick. These are stacked on top of each other to form the walls, and connected to each other with notches at the corners of the building. The top of the front wall is covered with wide wooden planks, and the peaked roof is covered with wooden shingles. The cabin has a double door at the entrance, divided by a post in the middle. Inside, the cabin has a dirt floor. There is a window on each side wall, and a stone fireplace on the back wall. The fireplace stones are rough cut, with a thin layer of mortar in between them. The stone base juts out in front. The fireplace is about ten feet across, with a five-foot opening in the center for burning wood in the inner hearth. A metal beam supports the rocks above the opening. A large squared off log forms the mantelpiece above the fireplace. The cabin framing for the roof is visible. It is mostly built out of round peeled logs, with a few squared off. Daylight shines through cracks in between the logs and planks, including a few spots in the roof. A wayside exhibit mounted on the fence outside is titled \"Changing Values\" and shows black and white photos and text about the adjacent Gamlin Cabin. A photo of people posing in front of this cabin, except that the cabin has only one door. The men wear hats, pants and shirts with vests. The women wear long skirts and puffy blouses. Additional detail, from left to right: A man with a bushy beard and a pocket watch. A donkey with two barefoot children astride its back. The boy is about 5 years old, in overalls, and the girl is about 10, in a dress. Both wear large straw hats. A woman holding the donkey's reins wears a ruffled apron, and a hat with decorations. In the doorway are two women in calf-length skirts, one with a scarf around her neck, like a tie. A man wearing a hat and watch chain, pets a dog. Another man wearing knee high boots leans against the building with his foot on a wagon. A caption notes, The logs of the Gamlin Cabin are sugar pine, and the roof shakes are sequoia wood. The text reads, Built before these sequoias were protected as a park, this cabin has seen many changes. How people used it varied with why they came to the grove. A timeline of pictures and history along the bottom reads, from left to right,Uses of the Gamlin Cabin. An oval portrait photo of a man with a light-colored mustache and beard, wearing a rounded short brimmed hat and a suit with a vest and tie. The caption reads, 1872. Israel Gamlin and his brother Thomas built the cabin, then lived in it for two summers while grazing sheep. Before living here, they lived in the Fallen Monarch, a downed sequoia further along this trail. A photo of a man in a uniform and hat, mounted on a horse in front of a massive sequoia tree trunk. The caption reads, 1890. After the park was created, the U.S. Cavalry came to protect the trees. They stored hay and grain for their horses in the cabin. A photo of a man with his hands on his hips. He has dark hair and a thick moustache, and wears a hat, white shirt, a dark vest with a badge and watch chain, and dark trousers. The caption reads, 1902 through 1909. The first civilian park ranger lived in the cabin for seven years. Lewis L. Davies not only patrolled the grove, he raised sequoia seedlings, learning about their relationship with fire.",

    "audioDescription": "This trailhead orientation panel shows a map and photos of the South Fork area. The text reads, two trails from this secluded area lead to low-elevation sequoia groves. One of these, Garfield Grove, formed the heart of the original 1890 Sequoia National Park. Only later was the park enlarged to include other groves and, later still, the high peaks. Like most park trails, these lead into designated wilderness. One of the highest forms of protection for public lands, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to experience. A map shows the location of the South Fork Trail. A photo shows a creek cascading through a bank of large rocks, surrounded by trees. The caption reads, Ladybug Trail 4.2 miles (or 6.8 km) one way. This relatively easy trail begins at the end of the parking area and ends at Whiskey Log Camp in the South Fork sequoia grove. As you hike, look along the ridge to the north for views of Homer's Nose, a prominent granite dome. The first permitted camping spot on this trail is Ladybug Camp (1.7 miles, or 2.7 km). A photo shows a row of large reddish-brown sequoia trunks in a lush grove. The caption reads, Garfield Grove Trail, 2.9 miles (or 4.7 km) one way to first sequoias. This trail begins along the road, just before the parking area. It climbs across north facing slopes into Garfield Grove, one of the largest sequoia groves in this park. The first permitted camping is at Snowslide Creek (3.6 miles or 5.8 km). Beyond Garfield Grove, the trail levels out as it approaches Hockett Meadow, 11.1 miles (or 17.9 km) from here. A quote by Joseph Wood Krutch, \"The idea of wilderness is one of the permanent homes of the human spirit.\" A bottom photo shows tree covered mountains with a granite peak with traces of snow in the distance. The caption reads, \"A view from Ladybug Trail.\"",

In this system, trees are measured by trunk volume only, not branches, leaves, or roots. <br /> <br /> Tree dimensions change year to year because trees grow, branches fall, and fires can burn and remove a portion of a tree. Until 2003, the Washington Tree in Giant Forest (Sequoia National Park) was the second-largest sequoia. After being reduced by fire, it no longer ranks among the top 30.<br /> <br /> If branches are also measured, the President Tree is the second largest tree, bumping General Grant to third.</p> <h3>Tree Facts</h3> <p>Height: 268.1 feet (88.7 meters)<br /> Ground circumference: 107.5 feet (32.8 meters)<br /> Trunk volume: 46,608 cubic feet (1320 cubic meters)</p>",
    "audioDescription": "In front of you is an enormous sequoia tree. The tree has deep crevices and a flared base. Its massive trunk is covered with a shaggy reddish-brown bark that is thick and fibrous. Its thick stubby branches with oval clusters of green leaves, start high above the ground, about halfway up the trunk. The branches are so short that the tree is shaped more like a pointed cylinder than a regular tree. The shape could also be compared to a fat carrot with a few broccoli florets sticking out near the top. Looking up from this angle, so close to the massive tree, almost all one can see is trunk, with a few branches very high in the air. The ground in front of the tree is fenced off. Just beyond the fence is a brown wooden sign. The white carved lettering on it reads, General Grant. The Nation's Christmas tree.",

    "audioDescription": "Forest Description: You are at the beginning of a trail through a conifer forest that leads to the General Grant Tree. The forest is canopied with pine, incense-cedar, fir, and, of course, sequoia trees. The branches of young sequoias give them the cone shape of most other conifer trees, like a Christmas tree. In mature sequoias, however, the trunk becomes much bigger than the branches. In fact, the top of the tree might only be about twice the width of the base, so it is shaped more like a pointed bottle brush than a regular tree. Branches only start about halfway up the trunk. The mature trees, called monarchs, are nature's skyscrapers. They can grow as tall as a 26-story building. Trying to glimpse their tippy tops could give you a sore neck. Their trunks are reddish brown, with thick layers of deeply furrowed bark that is soft and fibrous on the surface, like shredded wheat cereal. Some trunks have dark, indented triangular scars, caused by fire. These are widest at the bottom, and point upward. The forest floor is covered with a thick, soft carpet of pine needles. Around large sequoias, the ground is also covered with thin strips of bark that have shredded away from the tree trunks. The forest creates a rich habitat for a large variety of wildlife, including black bears, coyotes, mule deer, beavers, chickarees, and gray squirrels. Depending upon the season, you may also hear the sounds of forest birds: ravens, (insert birdsong?), nuthatches, (insert birdsong?), and Steller's jays. As the seasons change, so does the look of the forest. Spring brings warming temperatures and small colorful wildflowers on the forest floor. Winter brings a blanket of snow. Text along this trail is shown in English and Spanish but for this audio description we will only read English, and any additional information provided by Braille. This trailhead orientation panel features a tactile map of the trail, and an illustration of a giant sequoia, with a thick trunk, with reddish brown bark, and short stubby branches with clusters of small green leaves, that start high above the ground. The text reads, This grove showcases some of the best sequoia habitat anywhere, producing some of the world's largest trees. Allow 30 minutes to complete this Â½ mile (or 0.8 km) paved loop. Relatively easy, it has no steep slopes or stairs on the main trail. Halfway around the loop stands the General Grant Tree, one of the largest trees on Earth. Please, for the sake of the sequoias' shallow roots, stay on the trail. A tactile map of the Grant Grove area, generally described from the bottom to the top. A depressed surface with small round dots represents the paved road. Two paved oval areas have a raised letter \"P\" to indicate parking. A raised circle with a star above one of the parking lots shows where you are right now. Stretching out from either side is a deep groove that represents Grant Tree Trail loop. Little bars across the trail represent where tactile exhibits with Braille are located. There is also a stretch of trail, with raised square bumps, that cuts across the loop trail. It leads through a fallen hollow sequoia tree called the Fallen Monarch. It is a dirt trail with steps, which is not accessible. Please exercise caution! Near the top of the loop trail, on the right side, is a depressed circle with a raise dot in the center. This represents the General Grant Tree. A legend on top identifies six tactile shapes used on the map, already described. In the lower left corner, a depressed horizontal bar that represents 300 feet (or 91 m) in length. A few inches above it is a depressed arrow pointing upward to represent north. The text reads, Trail safety All natural areas pose risks. You are responsible for your own safety. Watch for uneven or slippery surfaces. Be aware of what is around you and overhead. Branches, heavy cones, and entire trees may fall. Listen for cracking, snapping sounds and get out of the way. A free Braille copy of the entire exhibit text is available at Kings Canyon Visitor Center. On the lower right corner of the panel, an indented black arrow points right toward the Loop Trail. Additional Braille information reads, Welcome. This half mile, paved loop is about ten feet wide. Above is a tactile map. Above that is a legend that defines the symbols. However, please note that the legend is actually below the tactile map, not above it.",

Behind the Sherman Tree are the General Grant, President, Lincoln, and Stagg trees. Another measure of tree volume is the total biomass of the tree-trunk, branches, roots, and foliage. If we measure the biomass, the Sherman Tree still ranks at #1, but the General Grant Tree loses second place to the President Tree.<br /> <br /> Rapid growth over a long life accounts for the size of these trees, but they are not as old as once thought. The most recent age estimate of the Sherman Tree is about 2200 years old.<br /> <br /> Sequoia roots are shallow but spread wide. They entangle with the roots of other sequoias, forming a kind of mesh that helps all the trees maintain balance and stability.<br /> <br /> As you walk among sequoias, watch for Douglas squirrels, also called chickarees. They climb into sequoias and chew through the stems of cones. If you come across a tree that seems to drop a cone every few seconds, you know that a Douglas squirrel is cutting cones for dinner. They then eat the green, fleshy covering of the cones; look for chewed-up cones on the ground. They also store cones and dried mushrooms high in pines or sequoias.<br /> <br /> The Congress Trail starts near the Sherman Tree, and provides a tour of some of the most spectacular sequoias of Giant Forest. This easy three-mile loop also connects to other trails that can take you throughout Giant Forest (be sure to take a map).<br /> <br /> The Sherman Tree was once named the Karl Marx Tree by the Kaweah Colony, a utopian group that lived in Three Rivers before Congress created this park. The Kaweah Colony supported itself in part through logging. When the national park was established, their efforts were deemed illegal. One of their original structures, Squatter's Cabin, still stands near Crescent Meadow and is on the National Register of Historic Places.<br /> <br /> In 1903, the Buffalo Soldiers protected these parks. Their leader, then-Captain Charles Young, was one of the first superintendents of these parks and the first African-American superintendent of any national park. He developed plans to protect the legacy of the giant sequoia groves, oversaw the building of the first roads into the parks, and protected both parks from illegal logging, grazing, and poaching.</p> <h3>Services and Parking</h3> <p>The main parking area and trailhead for the General Sherman Tree is located just off Wolverton Road. The parking area is one of the main shuttle stops in the parks. Shuttles stop here every 15 to 20 minutes.<br /> <br /> Parking for people with disabilities is located on the Generals Highway 2 miles from the Giant Forest Museum and 3 miles from the Lodgepole Visitor Center.<br /> The parking area provides restrooms, trash cans, water, and food-storage lockers.<br /> <br /> Make sure that you store all food is stored in these lockers-bears can be active in this parking lot.<br /> <br /> The General Sherman Tree is about a half mile from the parking lot. Be prepared for an uphill climb when return from your hike. In summer, you can avoid the uphill hike by walking from the Sherman Tree down to the accessible parking lot and shuttle stop along the Generals Highway. From there, take the Orange Route back to the main General Sherman Tree parking area.</p> <h3>Accessibility</h3> <p>Accessible parking is located on the Generals Highway 2 miles from the Giant Forest Museum and 3 miles from the Lodgepole Visitor Center. The parking area provides restrooms, trash cans, and water. An easy path leads to the General Sherman Tree from the trailhead. This wheelchair-accessible paved path is accessible by wheelchairs, strollers, and walkers. The trail is about 500 feet in length and is gently sloped.<br /> <br /> In summer, the free park shuttle leads to the General Sherman Tree accessible parking area.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "The enormous General Sherman tree stands before you, about 40 feet away. Its bark is a bumpy reddish brown, with some lighter streaks. Grooves in the bark run vertically up the trunk. The trunk remains thick as it rises up toward the crown, tapering only gradually. More than halfway up, branches and green foliage finally appear. The massive branches are short and stubby. To see the top of the tree, one must look almost straight up. A split rail fence surrounds the tree, keeping people away for the tree's protection. Visit nearby wayside exhibits to learn more about the scale of the tree. A wide wooden sign mounted on the ground in the walkway to the tree. The wood is worn and rounded. Engraved white lettering reads, \"General Sherman\"",

    "audioDescription": "Forest Description: You are at the beginning of a trail through a conifer forest that leads to the General Sherman Tree. The forest is canopied with pine, incense-cedar, fir, and, of course, sequoia trees. The branches of young sequoias give them the cone shape of most other conifer trees, like a Christmas tree. In mature sequoias, however, the trunk becomes much bigger than the branches. In fact, the top of the tree might only be about twice the width of the base, so it is shaped more like a pointed bottle brush than a regular tree. Branches only start about halfway up the trunk. The mature trees, called monarchs, are nature's skyscrapers. They can grow as tall as a 26-story building. Trying to glimpse their tippy tops could give you a sore neck. Their trunks are reddish brown, with thick layers of deeply furrowed bark that is soft and fibrous on the surface, like shredded wheat cereal. Some trunks have dark, indented triangular scars, caused by fire. These are widest at the bottom, and point upward. The forest floor is covered with a thick, soft carpet of pine needles. Around large sequoias, the ground is also covered with thin strips of bark that have shredded away from the tree trunks. The forest creates a rich habitat for a large variety of wildlife, including black bears, coyotes, mule deer, beavers, chickarees, and gray squirrels. Depending upon the season, you may also hear the sounds of forest birds: ravens, (insert birdsong?), nuthatches, (insert birdsong?), and Steller's jays. As the seasons change, so does the look of the forest. Spring brings warming temperatures and small colorful wildflowers on the forest floor. Winter brings a blanket of snow. This trailhead orientation panel provides information notices, photos, popular hikes around the Sherman Tree area. The View: You are standing in a sequoia forest near the top of the trail. Trees are relatively small and far apart, with plenty of open clearings. As you start to walk the trail, listen for the call of chickadees which sound like \"cheeseburger\"; and the call of the chickaree rodent, which sounds like a high pitched, \"pew, pew\". Along the trail, you can touch tree trunks and smell changing scents in the air, leaves, and bark. By the end, you will be in a dense, tall forest of sequoias, where you can strut along a giant trunk or run your fingers over a tall twisted ball of roots. The text reads, The Sherman Tree trailhead There are three photos with information about three popular hikes. A photo of an immense monarch sequoia tree, The General Sherman Tree, with a giant sequoia forest around it. People appear tiny standing before it. The General Sherman Tree is a half-mile (or 0.8 km) down the path. A photo of three giant sequoia trunks grouped together, The Senate Group. It is part of The Congress Trail, a two-mile (or 3.2 km) loop that starts at the Sherman Tree and continues through the Giant Forest Sequoia Grove. A photo taken from the base of a giant sequoia, looking straight up. The deeply grooved reddish brown trunk gives way to a densely leaved top, with blue sky above. The text explains that the Trail of the Sequoias is a moderate six-mile (or 9.7 km) loop that splits from the Congress Trail at the Senate Group and rejoins it at the Chief Sequoyah Tree. It says to bring a trail map. Junctions along this trail can be confusing. A black and white photo portrait of man. His dark wavy hair is combed to the side and hangs down just below his ears. His eyes are light and deep-set, and he has a rounded nose. He has long mustache and full, bushy beard. He is wearing a wool overcoat with a buttoned shirt and scarf. The text reads, John Muir in Giant Forest In 1875 pioneer naturalist John Muir visited here and gave this grove its enduring name: \"...this part of the Sequoia belt seemed to me the finest, and I then named it \"The Giant Forest.\" ... a magnificent growth of giants grouped in pure temple groves, ranged in colonnades along the sides of meadows, or scattered among the other trees. ... when I entered the sublime wilderness the day was nearly done, the trees with rosy, glowing countenance seem to be hushed and thoughtful, as if waiting in conscious religious dependence on the sun, and one naturally walked softly awe-stricken among them. I wandered on, meeting nobler trees where all were noble.\"",

The text reads, Getting to know sequoias takes two things: learning about them and experiencing them firsthand. Explore the museum's indoor exhibits, but then leave the walls behind. Take a walk through the sequoia's world. If you plan to explore, be sure to purchase a map in the museum or any other visitor center. A map shows our location in the Giant Forest Museum area. A key names the main trails and shows round trip distances. Big Trees Trail. 1.25 miles (or 2 km). 1.5 hrs. To Beetle Rock. 0.5 miles (or 800 m). 15 min Hazelwood Trail. 1.5 miles (or 2.4 km). 1.0 hrs. Accessibility. Beetle Rock Trail This paved trail has a moderate grade. Only vehicles with accessibility permits may use the small parking area near the beginning of the trail. Big Trees Trail The Big Trees Trail is paved. From the museum down to the Generals Highway, it has a moderate grade. Around Round Meadow the trail is flat. Only vehicles with accessibility permits may use the small parking area at Round Meadow. Hazelwood Trail The Hazelwood Trail is unpaved with uneven surfaces. It is relatively flat, but has a short incline at the beginning of the trail. Other trails There is great variability among the trails in Giant Forest. Some other trails might be accessible depending on your ability. Some Things to Do Here A photo of an exhibit panel depicting a forest scene, including the shallow roots of a fallen sequoia tree. The caption reads, Enjoy exhibits at the Giant Forest Museum and get answers to your questions about sequoia trees. A photo of a large flat rock. Beyond it is an expansive view. The caption reads, At Beetle Rock look west toward the Coast Range and learn about local air quality. A photo of a green meadow, lined with giant sequoias. The caption reads, Examine why sequoias grow along the Big Trees Trail. See giant trees towering over a forest meadow.",

After a snowy winter, Grizzly Creek swells and the waterfall widens to a frothy wall of thundering white water. When there is less snow, Grizzly Falls retreats to the right side of the exposed granite, forming a channel of freefalling water that fans out as it spreads over rocks toward the base of the falls. <br />",

The text accompanying the map reads, “Trail Information,” “This gently sloping loop trail leads through a portion of the Giant Forest sequoia grove. The path circles the upper end of Hazelwood Meadow and a footbridge crosses a small creek. Look for water-loving plants and wildflowers that thrive in wet conditions along the creek and in the meadow. After a short walk from this point, you’ll reach the loop portion of the Hazelwood Nature Trail. The loop is 0.6 miles (1 km) long and is relatively flat. The path is firmly packed and has benches and pullouts. The trail is suitable for people in wheelchairs or families with small children or strollers. From this point, you can also walk to the General Sherman Tree, Giant Forest Museum, or connect with other Giant Forest trails. If you choose a longer hike, a trail map is recommended. Maps are sold at Giant Forest Museum and other visitor centers.” The following trail accessibility statistics are also included on the sign: “Length of loop: 0.5 miles (0.8 km) from this point. Elevation gain: 50 feet (15 m). Trail surface: Firm-packed. Trail grade: Average 6.5%, Maximum 10%. Maximum cross slope: Less than 2%. Clear tread width: 6 feet” Below the map, additional text reads as follows: “Protect Sequoia National Park” “Stay on trails. Shortcutting damages the natural landscape. Carry out all trash. Do not feed or approach wildlife. All pets are prohibited on park trails. Most trails in Giant Forest are closed to stock. Leave all natural objects and artifacts in the park undisturbed. Please do not take any cones or other items. Do not disturb wildlife, plants, or historic objects.” “Protect Yourself All natural areas pose risks. You are responsible for your own safety. Carry a map and know how to use it. Watch for uneven or slippery footing. Be cautious around steep drop-offs and wet or icy areas. Don't walk on cones or other forest litter that may roll or slide underfoot. Be aware of what’s around you and overhead. Trees and limbs can fall without warning. Be careful when crossing roads. Use trails unless you need to cross the highway, then use crosswalks.”",

One of the highest forms of protection for public lands, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to experience. Possible destinations include: The top photo shows a green meadow nestled between steep granite peaks and canyons. The caption reads, Bearpaw Meadow 11.3 miles (or 18.2 km) one way Elevation: 7,800 feet (or 2,377 m) This trail remains relatively level in most places as it skirts steep canyons and sheer cliffs on the 11 miles to Bearpaw Meadow. From the Bearpaw area, look deep into a wilderness of granite peaks and canyons. The next photo is of the historic Whitney Hut at the end of the trail on Mount Whitney. The caption reads, Mount Whitney 60 miles (or 97 km) one way Elevation: 14,494 feet (or 4,417 m) The High Sierra Trail tops the Great Western Divide at Kaweah Gap. It descends into the Kern Canyon, then climbs again to reach Mount Whitney, the tallest peak in the lower 48 states. The historic Whitney Hut marks the end of the trail. A map of the Giant Forest shows our location at the beginning of the High Sierra trail. The bottom photo is of a rocky valley and cliffs are sprinkled with patches of snow. The caption reads, View east from Kaweah Gap. A quote by Colonel John R. White, Park Superintendent and originator of the High Sierra Trail: \"I know of no better [scenery] than that which...will be opened by this trail.\"",

Nature, people, and spirit share this space. Native Americans call this place <i>Pah-din</i>, which means <em>place to go through</em>. It is also known as Hospital Rock.</h4> <p>This spot along the Kaweah River supports a diverse mix of animals, plants, and trees. The richness of this landscape made it an ideal location for <b><i>Pah-din</i></b>, a village that was home to hundreds of California Native Americans. Today, it is still an important place for the descendants of the village, and a site where people of many backgrounds come to rest, play, and explore the natural world.The Hospital Rock area features hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Snow, ice, and water carved the surrounding hillsides and valley floor. In this place, several large granite boulders provided temporary shelter or space for tribal gatherings. The area namesake rock, <i>Pah-din</i> or Hospital Rock, is a massive 60 feet long and 20 feet wide. Like the landscape, the river is a life force. It is home to fish and insects, and sustains nearby plant life.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-The Civilian Conservation Corps</h4> <p>In the 1930s, the Hospital Rock landscape changed dramatically. Assigned to Hospital Rock, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) completed several landscaping and improvement projects. They also cut a new stone staircase leading to the pictograph, built the Big Pool Trail and tunnel, and built a historic vehicle water station. Many local Native Americans joined the Corps and contributed to its projects nationwide.</p> <h3>Connections between Land and People Exhibit</h3> <h4>Native American groups lived, interacted, and traded goods in this village for generations. They continue to gather here as land stewards to practice their culture, educate, restore native plants, and for spiritual and special events.</h4> <p>Native Americans have a deep connection with the land. When Hospital Rock was an active village, the people cared for the plants and woodland ecosystem in ways that promoted health and abundance. From this practice, they were able to harvest materials necessary to live and thrive. Even today, these tribal cultural practices remain a way of life.Life here included fishing and gathering foods, cultivating the land, trading, playing games, visiting, andconnecting to one’s spiritual beliefs. The land provided everything needed to survive. People of the village harvested plants to build shelters, weave baskets, and create snares.Fire has always been part of this landscape. People living here depended on it for warmth and cooking. They also used it to clear vegetation to improve visibility and productivity in forests and grasslands.In this area, Native Americans hunted game, such as deer, squirrels, birds, and fished for food. Theyalso gathered plants, acorns, seeds, berries, and roots.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-Homeland</h4> <p>“This is an ancient site, a sensitive site.... People took care of each other here. There’s a welcome feeling here...the medicine is strong.”A connection with the land is critical to North Fork Mono Tribal Chairman Ron Goode. “Everything out here is our relations.” Traditional Ecological Knowledge has been passed down for generations by his people, and children today have strong relationships with the land. This traditional knowledge guides their restoration of damaged meadows and waterways in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. This work benefits not only tribal lands, but also national forests and parks.</p> <h3>A Village Exhibit</h3> <h4>In this area, the Mono (Monache), the Yokuts, and the Tubatulabal connected with their neighboring tribes to form a vibrant community. These connections continue today.</h4> <p>Many groups lived, visited, gathered, and practiced traditions here. Historical accounts document more than 500 people occupying this village. Travelers stopped at the village to visit, rest, or trade. Runners and messengers used the extensive trails to deliver news about events such as fires. Tribal leaders are responsible for the safety and welfare of their people, including welcoming outsiders, negotiating with neighboring groups, and maintaining peace.By the 1860s, Native Americans left the Hospital Rock area. New settlers forced many out of the area, while others died from newly introduced diseases.Today, Mono (Monache), Yokuts, and the Tubatulabal live all over the world. Some live on rancherias,  reservations, or other Indian lands. Their descendants maintain a strong connection to <i>Pah-din</i> (Hospital Rock) and often participate in park management decisions.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-A True Leader</h4> <p>The descendants of Chief Chappo remember him as a strong leader who was compassionate, honest, and decisive—a peacemaker and a healer. Responsible for the welfare of his people, Chappo lived peacefully at Hospital Rock for generations. In the 1860’s, when new settlers arrived, they brought disease and conflict to the area. Chappo made the difficult decision to leave his homeland to save his people. Today, his descendants share stories about his gifts, and work to follow in his footsteps.</p> <h3>Activity, Past and Present Exhibit</h3> <h4>Signs that <em>Pah-din</em> (Hospital Rock) was once a vibrant village are all around us. Pictographs, bedrock mortars, historic fire pits, and obsidian artifacts all tell a story of a way of life.</h4> <p>Imagine a time when a community of hundreds of people lived here. Picture a village with dwellings (called nobi by the Mono people), children playing, women preparing food, and men getting ready for a hunt. This location inspired a way of life and created traditions and practices that continue today.Village women processed acorns into a flour that was a staple food. They made depressions in flat bedrock to create grinding holes, or mortars, and used cylindrical stones as pestles.Redbud shrubs provide strong, flexible shoots that were split or kept whole to weave into baskets. Elderberry shrubs were used for food, cultural uses, medicine, or ceremonial use.Items such as beads and obsidian (volcanic glass) may be found here. If you find an artifact, help us by leaving it where it is. Take a photo, note the location, and report your finding to park staff.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-The Weavers</h4> <p dir=\"rtl\" style=\"margin-right: 80px; text-align: left;\"><i></i><i>“The materials that make up a Native basket serve to ground it to an area. The weaver’s culture governed the techniques used to make it and the designs that adorn it. And the voices of tribal elders whisper through it.”               </i>- BRYN BARABAS POTTER</p> <p>Weaving serves a practical purpose but is also an art. Nature not only provides materials but also inspires patterns. An active basket-making community continues to teach skills to the next generation of weavers.</p> <h3>Community Traditions Exhibit</h3> <h4>What memorable traditions occur here, past and present? The Hospital Rock area has a rich history of people, events, and activities that shape it and create a sense of  community.</h4> <p>The granite rocks near the pictographs of Hospital Rock served many purposes such as a shelter, a place of healing, and a location for ceremonies. Native Americans call this place <i>Pah-din</i>, which means <i>place to go through.</i>Every Native American society has healers, who practice traditional medicine to aid ailing community members. On occasions, healers cared for injured travelers here. The English name “Hospital Rock” was first used in 1873 after a pioneer recovered here from a trapping injury.Spirituality was prominent in the form of reverence for the natural world. The land and its animals were respected. Creation stories were passed down within families.­Like the beat of drums, sounds from clapper sticks are an important part of cultural, spiritual, and ceremonial traditions. Clapper sticks are made from elderberry stalks.Today, families picnic together, share memories, swim in the Kaweah River, and hike in this spot.</p> <h3>Shared Voices Exhibit</h3> <h4>What is your native language? From past to present, many languages have been spoken here, connecting people to this space and to one another.</h4> <p>In the past, California Native American groups lived, met, and gathered here. They spoke a number of languages and dialects to trade goods, share news, and cooperate with others. Today, these languages are still heard throughout the Sierra range and foothills. People can tell a lot about their neighbors based on the way they say “hello.” A person’s language communicates to others who they are, where they come from, and how they live.Historically, California Native Americans each had their own language. However, each group spoke many languages to connect with their neighbors and fellow travelers.Today, travelers from all over the world rest, picnic, and enjoy nature here, whether they call this place Hospital Rock or<i> Pah-din</i>. While you’re here, listen for people speaking a variety of languages.Nature also has a language. The rustling of oaks, chirping of birds, calls of squirrels, and the roaring river flowing over granite boulders form the essential sounds of this landscape.</p> <h4>Keeping Traditions Alive-Our Language Lives</h4> <p>Language is Marie Wilcox’s life. According to Marie, “words matter and learning the language is important to our culture.” Marie is one of the last living speakers of the Wukchumni language. With the help of her family, Marie created a Wukchumni dictionary. Containing thousands of words and examples of their uses, the dictionary documents the living language of her people. As part of a movement to preserve our nation’s Native American languages, Marie’s work documents the art and heritage of the Wukchumni voice.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "After you exit the Hospital Rock Picnic Area parking lot, these exhibits are positioned at an angle along a sidewalk.

    "audioDescription": "About 20 yards from the road is a large gray granite boulder, about 25 feet high by as much as 100 feet wide. An upright, naturally flat surface on the rock, like a wall, starts about 6 feet above the ground and rises up to 15 feet. It is about 20 feet wide. On the top are vibrant red paintings of figures and shapes, with paint streaks running down the rock that obscure other painted figures and shapes below them. <br /><br />Known as pictographs, these images include what appear to be:<br /><br />Human stick figures, including one with about twenty small lines radiating out from its head.<br />Several parallel lines, some wavy and some curving.<br />A couple of starburst images with 10 lines radiating out from a central point.<br />Bird shapes with curved wings and tails.<br />A snake.<br />A tree-shaped outline, with five branches on either side of the trunk. <br />And several other geometric shapes, often with parallel lines radiating out at an angle from a straight line, like multiple arrows.<br /><br />People can approach, but not touch, the pictographs. The uneven path that climbs slightly from the road up to the pictographs is made of paving stones, dirt, and a few stairs. Immediately in front of the pictographs is a set of about 10 rough-carved stone stairs, allowing people to get a closer look at the images. Caution is advised, as the stairs are narrow and uneven.<br /><br />A carved wood sign with embossed white letters reads,<br /><br />Hospital rock<br /><br />Safety information text is shown in English and Spanish, but for this audio description we will only read the English.<br /><br />It reads,<br /><br />Please Be Aware<br /><br />Welcome to Hospital Rock, a sacred site for local California Indian tribes whose ancestors lived and died here. Please be considerate of the sensitive area by staying on the trail, not touching the pictographs, and behaving respectfully.<br /><br />Archaeological and historic sites like these are unique and irreplaceable.

It also kills soil fungus that may harm seedlings.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Hot Spots<br /><br />The four large sequoias that you see here are probably the same age. Such clusters may be found where fire once burned very hot. Most fires in this area are low ground fires, not hot enough to kill many big trees. <br /><br />Where fire does flare up enough to kill a patch of trees, seedlings get a good start. No trees block their sunlight or compete for water and nutrients. A thousand years later, a group of giants may stand in what was once a hot spot.<br /><br />A photo of two hands. One is open with a bunch of tiny seeds, about the size of oat flakes, in the palm. The other hand holds two sequoia cones, each the size of a small egg. <br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />Sequoia cones open when fire's heat rises. Soon tiny seeds drop to the ground.

After 1.9 miles, turn left at the trail junction to go to Cedar Grove Overlook, or stay to the right to join the Lewis Creek Trail and continue climbing. Like most park trails, Hotel Creek Trail leads into designated wilderness. One of the highest forms of protection for public lands, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to experience. A photo of steep tree covered mountain sides with a canyon below. The caption reads, Cedar Grove Overlook. 2.3 miles (or 3.7 km) one way. Elevation: 6086 feet (or 1855 m). Once the overlook trail splits from the steep Hotel Creek Trail, it levels out. The overlook offers wide views of the glacially carved Kings Canyon. A photo shows a sunlit meadow among conifer trees. The caption reads, Frypan Meadow. 7.6 miles (or 12.3 km) one way. Elevation: 7,840 feet (or 2390 m). A network of trails meets at this meadow. To the west lies Sequoia National Forest and, to the north, Kennedy Pass leads to the Middle Fork of the Kings River. A map shows the location of the Hotel Creek Trailhead. The bottom photo shows a stretch of rounded rocky mountain peaks with conifer trees on the lower slopes. The caption reads, A view of Monarch Divide from Lookout Peak.

Can you see the mountains of the Coast Ranges today?<br /><br />Wind and weather patterns cause pollutants to pool in the southern San Joaquin Valley. The problem occurs all year, but is especially bad in summer. A dark haze often blocks the view for days or even weeks.<br /><br />In national parks people expect grand vistas, but in too many parks air pollution increasingly mars the view. You can help prevent smog darkened scenery. Conserve electricity, recycle, reduce your use of cars and gas-powered engines, and support clean air policies.<br /><br />A photo of the view before you, the sky has a yellowish tint that hangs above the mountain range.<br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />Even on the\"clear day\" when this photo was taken, a haze obscures distant features. The best visibility typically occurs in winter. The worst, in summer.<br /><br />Arrows point to the position of the Coast Range that is not visible in this photo, due to smog.<br /><br />Two photos of the same view.

The air flow pattern enters the San Francisco Bay area and then splits and curves north and south. The northern flow continues over the Sacramento Valley with two small branches flowing right and left. A longer flow pattern curves southward into the San Joaquin Valley, with branches to the Sierra Nevada mountains and the Coast Range. The flow dead ends at the southern end of the valley, and loops back to the north, like a hook. The illustration shows our location, in the Sierra Nevada mountains, near this dead-end loop.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Pollution's Path<br /><br />As air flows through the San Joaquin Valley, it picks up urban and agricultural pollutants, including ozone. The southern end has the second worst ozone pollution in the country.<br /><br />Polluted air is trapped in the valley. It collects in the southern end near Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.

When it fell, however, its broken roots exposed bare soil in a sunny spot with plenty of moisture. Those were the perfect conditions for the sequoia directly across the trail to get started.<br /><br />Natural disturbances, such as falling trees and fire, contribute to good sequoia habitat.<br /><br />A photo of a giant sequoia that has fallen. The root ball is exposed and broken branches are still attached to the trunk. Tall sequoias surround it.<br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />The fallen sequoia in this photo tore a hole in the canopy, letting in needed sunlight.

    "audioDescription": "The View: You are descending into a thick forest of sequoias. Through the upper canopy of leaves, you can see glimpses of more distant trees and some bare branches, called \"snags\", that stick up from the tops of some sequoias. These gnarled tree tops create a twisted sculpture amongst the thick green curtain above. The text reads, You are standing on the edge of the Giant Forest sequoia grove. Sequoia trees grow in front of you but not behind you. Based on the huge size of so many sequoias here, the Giant Forest appears to provide the best habitat anywhere for sequoias to grow. John Muir, famous Scottish- American naturalist, described entering this grove in 1873: \"A magnificent growth of giants... one naturally walked softly and awe - stricken among them. I wandered on, meeting nobler trees where all are noble... this part of the Sequoia belt seemed to me the finest, and then I then named it,\" the Giant Forest.\"\" A photo of the top of a giant sequoia tree. The highest part of the trunk and two or three branches are bare, stubby, and worn down. The caption reads, Look closely and you might see this bare snag top. It is the tip of the 275 - foot - tall General Sherman Tree (84 m), just visible through the smaller trees. A map of the Giant Forest Trail system. The text reads, Within the Giant Forest stands scores of huge sequoia trees. This map- which illustrates the Giant Forest's trail system-highlights several of the large sequoias, including the General Sherman Tree, the biggest tree on Earth. The Giant Forest covers three square miles. It is the second largest sequoia grove in both area and number of sequoia trees. You can visit the Giant Forest via 40 miles of trail. Many of these paths are relatively flat and easy to walk. The map includes location the following trees, top to bottom: Adams tree. Lincoln tree. Chief Sequoyah. The President. Pershing Tree. Column Tree. General Sherman Tree, the largest tree by volume 52,000 cubic feet. The map also says that, The General Grant Tree, one of the largest sequoias, is in Grant Grove, a one-hour drive from here.",

    "audioDescription": "The View: This overlook has views down to the junction of the Middle and the South Fork of the Kings River far below us, with mountain peaks in the distance, sometimes covered with snow. Looking down from the overlook, the Middle Fork of the Kings River is on the left, and the South Fork is on the right. Because we are looking up the canyon toward the headwaters, both rivers flow toward us. Scrubby plants and deciduous bushes grow nearby, and below. The mountaintops are covered with conifers.<br /><br />The exhibit shows an illustration of the same view, with snowcapped peaks in the distance. The Middle Fork of the Kings River carves through a V-shaped canyon. Most of the south fork canyon is obscured by hills. <br /><br />The distant peaks and other features on the illustration are labeled. In the foreground, to the left of the Middle Fork of the river are:<br /><br />Deer Ridge.<br /><br />Deer Canyon.<br /><br />Brush Canyon.<br /><br />Tombstone Ridge.<br /><br />Little Tehipite Valley.<br /><br />In between the middle and south fork are:<br /><br />Junction Ridge.<br /><br />And Eagle Peaks.<br /><br />The distant ridges and peaks, going from left to right, are:<br /><br />Rodger's Ridge.<br /><br />Spanish Mountain. <br />10,051 feet.<br /><br />Crown Rock.<br />9,342 feet.<br /><br />Obelisk.<br />9,700 feet.<br /><br />Silver Spur.<br /><br />Mt. Harrington.<br />11,008 feet.<br /><br />Grand Dike (7 sisters).<br /><br />And University Peak. <br />13,632 feet.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />It took many years for geologic processes to shape the canyon before you. A photo of very steep jagged cliffs with a rounded ridge below, covered with low shrubs.<br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />Water and Sediment<br /><br />The middle and south forks of the Kings River steadily scour and reshape this canyon, one of the deepest in North America. However, this was a shallow sea in the early Jurassic period where plants and animals were buried in the sand.<br /><br />A photo shows a steep cliff side with zigzagging layers of white, brown and gray rock.<br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />Heat and Lifting<br /><br />A volcanic wave at the edge of the continental plate lifted this prehistoric sea floor. Squeezed, melted, and twisted, the layers of marine sediment became marble and other metamorphic rock. Magma pushed upward, solidifying into granite domes.<br /><br />A photo shows a cave with a wall made of many layers of stalactites suspended from the roof of the cave, like icicles.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Erosion<br /><br />Glaciers scraped away sedimentary and metamorphic rock, and polished the granite domes over 15,000 years ago. As the glaciers retreated, water and wind erode the canyon walls forming caves.<br /><br />Additional text reads,<br /><br />In partnership with Fresno County Resource Advisory Committee, the National Park Service, and Miramonte Conservation Camp Crew 2.<br /><br />Logos for Giant Sequoia National Monument and Sequoia National Forest are at the bottom right.",

Just a thin layer of soil covers the granite. That can make it tough on some trees. Sequoias, however, do well in this environment. Their shallow roots can support a giant tree in less than three feet (or 1 m) of earth by spreading out far from the tree. Interlocking roots throughout the forest help to support the sequoias.",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit, titled \"Meeting the Wilderness Mission: Protecting Wilderness\", with a photo and text, shows the importance of protecting Kings Canyon. A photo shows the view in front of you, looking out over miles of canyons, covered with conifer trees. A snowcapped mountain range is seen in the distance. The five mountain peaks that are identified along the horizon are: Spanish Mountain in the center of the ridge, and, to the right edge, Tombstone Ridge, Mount Reinstein, Mount Goddard, and Kettle Dome. The text reads, One of the largest areas of wilderness in the lower 48 states lies before you. This expanse of the Sierra Nevada spans both national forest and national park lands. Wilderness provides us increasingly rare, far reaching benefits: adventure, inspiration, scenery, wildlife habitat, clean water, scientific discovery...What might it hold in store for you or your children? A quote by Wallace Stegner in 1960 reads, We simply need that wild country available to us, even if we never do more than drive to its edge and look in. For it can be means of reassuring ourselves of our sanity as creatures, a part of the geography of hope. Additional text reads, Help the park fulfill its mission Protect scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife. Enjoy them in ways that leave the parks unimpaired for future generations. In the upper right corner, near the mission text are logos for the Forest Service and the National Park Service. The U.S. Forest Service Department of Agriculture logo is in the shape of a badge. The badge has a concave top with squared off top corners and oval base that comes to a point at the bottom center. It is outlined in yellow with a green center. Inside the badge are words in yellow lettering. \"Forest Service\" is on the top and \"Department of Agriculture\" is on the bottom. In the center, are the letters \"U\" and \"S\", with a yellow conifer tree in between them. The National Park Service logo is in the shape of an orange arrowhead, pointed downward. Inside the arrowhead are the words in white lettering, \"National Park Service\" with a green sequoia tree shape to its left. Near the bottom of the arrowhead is a white buffalo silhouette set against a green meadow, with a white lake and snow capped mountain behind it.",

It's situated on top of one of the many moraines along the canyon floor. These piles of glacial rubble are higher than the canyon floor, and views from the cabin are spectacular. Look closely to see horizontal scars along the canyon's granite walls; these were scratched by large rocks frozen fast in glacial ice as it slid slowly downslope thousands of years ago. <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are in an area of rocky boulders with low shrubs. Small pine and cedar trees are scattered sparsely across the landscape. A small, one room, wooden cabin is at the end of a short dirt trail. A steep granite mountain range is seen from the cabin. A horseshoe shaped river is nearby. A rectangular wooden sign carved with white embossed lettering reads, Knapp's Cabin A metal plaque attached to the sign reads, George O. Knapp, a wealthy California businessman, conducted several elaborate summer camping trips to this region of the Sierra. This cabin was built during the \"Roaring Twenties\" as a storage shed for those expeditions. It is the oldest building in Cedar Grove. Knapp's Cabin is about 10 feet by 20 feet. The outer walls and peaked roof are covered with overlapping layers of wooden shingles. On the north end of the building, the roof extends three feet to form an overhang: a porch with a dirt floor. The cabin has a wood door on each end. The doors are made of three vertical planks of wood, secured by three thinner planks mounted in a \"Z\" shape on the interior of the door. The doors are fastened in an open position and you may enter the cabin. Inside, the cabin frame is visible. It is built out of peeled log poles, with a few squared off in a roughhewn rectangular shape. The cabin has no windows and a dirt floor. There are several granite boulders near the cabin. One is just to the right of the south entrance, another midway along the east wall and several just beyond the porch area at the back of the cabin.",

This relatively easy trail begins at the end of the parking area and ends at Whiskey Log Camp in the South Fork sequoia grove. As you hike, look along the ridge to the north for views of Homer's Nose, a prominent granite dome. The first permitted camping spot on this trail is Ladybug Camp (1.7 miles, or 2.7 km). A photo shows a row of large reddish-brown sequoia trunks in a lush grove. The caption reads, Garfield Grove Trail. 2.9 miles (or 4.7 km) one way to first sequoias. This trail begins along the road, just before the parking area. It climbs across north facing slopes into Garfield Grove, one of the largest sequoia groves in this park. The first permitted camping is at Snowslide Creek (3.6 miles or 5.8 km). Beyond Garfield Grove, the trail levels out as it approaches Hockett Meadow, 11.1 miles (or 17.9 km) from here.

For a longer dayhike or overnight trip, continue to Emerald, shown in the photo above, (5.3 miles or 8.5 km one way) or Pear Lake (6.2 miles or 10.0 km one way). When the Watchtower route closes (late fall through early summer), take the Hump route. Never use the Watchtower route when it is icy. A photo shows a dramatic view of rocky granite peaks with a jagged mountain range dappled with snow. The caption reads, Alta Peak. 7.0 miles (or 10.8 km) one way. Elevation: 11,204 feet (or 3,415 m). It is one of the easier High Sierra peaks to climb, but Alta's elevation can still slow you down.

    "audioDescription": "The View: About 10 feet to the left of this wayside is the root end of a fallen sequoia tree. It is hollow. You can walk down uneven, dirt steps into the hollow center, and then continue down the hollowed-out trunk. The opening is about 5 feet high, so watch your head! The roots of the tree stretch up around the opening about 15 feet. As you reach the trunk portion, the hollow tunnel is about 6 feet across, and you can feel the trunk above your head and on either side. There are trip hazards along the way. Columns have been installed along the way to reinforce the trunk for safety. You can go about 50 feet through the trunk before it connects to the other side of the loop trail. On the wayside exhibit, a photo shows seventeen men posing by the fallen tree before you. There are wooden bedframes in the hollowed-out area. Deer heads with antlers are mounted to the trunk above the opening. In the background is a crudely made wooden table that seems to be set with plates and food. Two taller tables are covered with bottles and boxes. The men wear trousers and shirts, and most also wear a hat and either a vest or a jacket. Other details, from left to right include: a man with dark hair and a moustache holds the barrel of a rifle propped up on the ground at his left. A man holding a violin on his shoulder stroking it with its bow. A man next to him is holding a guitar. A group of men are in two rows. Seven, in front, are seated on various objects, a rough wooden bench, an upright wooden crate, a barrel, a tree stump and a fallen tree trunk. One man holds a cane. The back row shows six men standing. A man in uniform is mounted on horseback to the right. The caption reads, Like the Gamlin Cabin on this trail, the Fallen Monarch sheltered some of the park's early visitors. Construction crews such as this one camped here, sleeping in beds inside the hollow log. The cavalry kept their horses in it (note the mounted cavalryman in this photograph). The text reads, Even after they fall, sequoias endure. These trees resist decay, sometimes lasting for hundreds or even thousands of years on the forest floor. Compare the Fallen Monarch in front of you with this photograph from 1900. It looks nearly the same today as it did over a century ago.",

They indicate elevational bands called life zones. Temperature and precipitation, which are affected mostly by elevation, create these zones. Plants and animals adapted to certain conditions inhabit each one. Sequoias live in the montane zone.<br /><br />Is our climate shifts due to increased heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, life will adjust. Biologist can already measure the uphill movement of Sierran animals compared to 100 years ago. In years to come, your children will see a different mosaic of life in these mountains.<br /><br />A photo of the view from where you are standing.

It has short body, with reddish gray fur. The face and ears are rounded, its beady eye is dark brown. Its muzzle is a lighter gray, with a pointed nose and white whiskers. Sitting on granite rock, it chews on a short branch with green leaves. The caption reads,<br /><br />Pikas live high in the alpine zone. This cousin of the rabbit survives only where is cool. Increasing heat drives animals to seek higher ground. Life already on the highest peak has just one option- to move north, if it can.

    "audioDescription": "The View: You are standing before the \"Centennial Stump\". It has a diameter of 24 feet. A sign explains that the tree was cut in 1875. The top of the stump is slightly concave, surrounded by worn ragged edges sticking up about 5 feet from the base. A photo shows a historic black and white image of the felling of a sequoia tree. The tree is captured during its dramatic fall, at about a 45-degree angle. There are people standing safely near the base. The text reads, Living Proof Early explorers told of giant trees, but the public remained skeptical. At least three nearby sequoias died to prove that they lived. Cut into pieces, they were shipped across the country to exhibit as freaks. All that remains of the tree that once stood here is the Centennial Stump. Cut in 1875 for America's Centennial Exhibition, sixteen feet of the trunk were hollowed out and then reassembled in Philadelphia. People laughed it off as the \"California Hoax.\" There is a quote from an eyewitness to the felling of a sequoia in 1893. \"The immense tree quivered like one in agony, and with a crushing, raging, deafening sound it fell, ... breaking into a million pieces.\" Inset is an historic black and white photo of a fallen tree trunk. The cut base that faces us is about 15 feet high. Standing at the bottom are a woman, in a long white dress with puffy shoulders, and a man, in shirt and pants holding a hat. To their right is a ladder that reaches almost to the top of the cut. Near the top rung is a man, holding up a two-man saw that is taller than the giant section of the trunk. The caption reads, Mark Twain Tree Over 300 feet tall, the Mark Twain Tree was cut in 1891. Slabs of its trunk still hang in museums in New York and London. You can see its stump along the Big Stump Trail near the park entrance.",

    "audioDescription": "A smooth paved path leads you to the edge of a paved, lighted, outdoor amphitheater, surrounded by tall pines, including the Jeffrey pine which has a butterscotch smell, and incense cedar trees. There are several large, weathered branches on the ground in the wooded area around the amphitheater.<br />To your right, and slightly downslope, is a platform with a stone base. It has six stairs, on both the right and left sides. The stairs lead to a curved stage. Behind the stage is tall wooden structure, painted tan, with a white screen in the center. The sides of the structure angle slightly inward, each with a tall narrow window. <br /><br />To the left of the projection wall is a campfire ring made of stones that stick up about one foot above the ground. <br /><br />Starting 15 feet from the edge of the stage area, there are twenty, 20-foot-long wood benches for seating. They are lined up in two sets of ten, with a five-foot-wide aisle running down the center. The benches angle slightly inward toward the stage, creating a V shape.<br /><br />About ten feet behind the bench seating is a small, tan, wood planked projection building. It has a locked wood framed window on the side that faces the screen.<br /><br />If you are facing the stage and go to the trees to the right of the middle of the seating area, there is one Jeffrey pine near the path. If you scratch its trunk, you will find that it smells like butterscotch.<br /><br />On the right side of the wall, about halfway up, is the National Park Service logo, in the shape of a brown arrowhead, pointed downward. Inside the arrowhead are the words in white lettering, \"National Park Service\" with a green sequoia tree shape to its left. Near the bottom of the arrowhead is a white buffalo silhouette set against a green meadow, with a white lake and snowcapped mountain behind it.",

As you approach the building, you will pass a dining area on the right, with outdoor tables covered by market umbrellas. <br /><br />The Lodgepole Market Center is a two-story building planked in dark wood. It has several dormer windows poking out through the roof. A peaked roof extends out over the main entrance, supported by large beams and posts rising from a low stone wall. This creates a seating area and shade outside the glass double doors at the market entrance. A second entrance of double doors is next to the outdoor dining area<br /><br />Opposite from the Lodgepole Market Center entrance is the end of the Lodgepole Visitor Center, where the restrooms are located.",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit, titled \"Silence & Clean Air\", shows an illustration, photos and text about the energy systems used in the park. The View: In front of you is a tree filled valley that stretches into the distance. Mountain peaks that surround it have exposed rock above a thick tree line. An illustration of a distant view of this location, including the road, a ranch style house and mechanical equipment. On the roof of the house is the symbol of a yellow lightbulb inside a black jagged multipoint star shape. A spiral black line connects that to a smaller wood shed with two tilted shiny panels on the roof. An inset illustration shows a close up of what is inside that shed: three rows of generator batteries in a metal rack. Wires connect the batteries. The text reads, Silence and Clean Air Silence and clean air two of the priceless qualities we seek in national parks. Yet until recently, an obsolete diesel generator ran noisily 18 hours a day at this remote spot. In 1933, park employees installed a solar energy system here. Now for days on end electrical power is produced only by silent, clean sunshine. Sunlight strikes solar panels, energizing electrons. The resulting electrical current charges a bank of batteries. The batteries store enough power for three sunless days. For backup, a propane generator stands ready, but it is seldom used. Fossil fuels produce most of the electricity in Central California. Burning these fuels contributes to acid deposition, high ozone levels, and particles in the air. in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, ozone is damaging black oaks, yellow pines, and sequoia seedlings. Acid deposition is changing the chemistry of alpine lakes. A haze of airborne particles obscures once beautiful vistas. By switching to cleaner, more efficient energy sources we not only protect our parks, but give our hometowns more of the qualities we seek here. Ask for information on air quality at any park visitor center. A photo of a bunch of thin, yellow spikes. The caption reads, Yellow pine needles exhibit ozone damage. A photo of two people sitting on a rock at the edge of a stream, holding up a cylinder of water. The caption reads, Scientists monitor the effects of air pollution on park waters. Attached to the stone base, on the front of this wayside panel, is a metal framed plaque with raised letters. It reads, The Mineral King Road Cultural Landscape District Has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, under the provisions of the National Preservation Act of 1966. The District represents a cultural landscape that reflects the growth of recreational activity in California from 1915 to 1942.

The trail starts along the steep bank to the right. Additional parking available across the Generals Highway in the Potwisha Overflow Parking Lot.</p> <h3>Community Science</h3> <p>Water is essential for life to thrive in the hot, dry foothills, but can sometimes be challenging to find. In the springtime, streams and creeks swell to high levels as snowmelt makes its way down towards the Central Valley. Once the snow has melted, however, water levels drop significantly. By late summer, many water sources dry up completely. Inconsistent snowpack from year to year makes it difficult to predict what resources will be available for the parks' flora and fauna. By tracking water levels over time, park scientists can better understand this unique landscape.<br /> <br /> Are you interested in exploring watersheds in the Foothills? Join a park ranger at any point in the year to collect data as a community scientist. In order to be sensitive to the plants and animals that call these streams home, group sizes are limited to a maximum of 6 participants. Individuals with an interest in a longer-term volunteer commitment are encouraged to reach out.<br /> <br /> Call Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks' Education Office at 559-565-4211 or email seki_ritc@nps.gov for more information.</p>",

One of the highest forms of legal protection, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to enjoy. A photo of a creek, cascading over large rocks, surrounded by trees. The caption reads, Marble Falls during spring high water. 3.7 miles (or 6.0 km) one way to end of trail Elevation gain: 1470 feet (or 448 m) The text reads, Other nearby trails: A photo of a creek with water flowing through large rocks, surrounded by green shrubs and trees. The caption reads, Paradise Creek Trail This gentle trail begins in Buckeye Flat Campground near site #28. If you are not camping there, park at Hospital Rock Picnic Area and walk the 0.7 miles to the campground. A map shows our location at the beginning of the Marble Falls trail. There is a safety warning on the map indicating that rattlesnakes and ticks are common in the foothills. The bottom photo shows a view of rolling hills with a valley cutting through the middle. Hills on the left are darker green with more trees. Hills on the right are rockier and lighter green, with more shrubs.

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit, titled \"A Fiery Hand Shapes the Land\", shows the importance of fire in the parks.<br /><br />The View: In front of you is a view through charred tree trunks over a canyon. The rounded mountain sides are covered with conifer forest. <br /><br />Three images, from left to right, show:<br /><br />A photo of an intense blaze engulfing a forest.<br /><br />An illustration of this valley consumed by fire with large plumes of smoke filling the sky.<br /><br />A black and white photo of the burned valley, charred and desolate, with spiky broken tree trunks covering the mountainside. The sky is hazy.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />In fall 1955 McGee Fire burned over 17,500 acres between Miramonte and the Kings River. Sparked by an escaped burn, McGee was a dramatic example of extreme fire behavior in the Sierra Nevada ecosystem.<br /><br />Natural fires were common and not very intense so they burned ground vegetation and debris, but left the trees. McGee left ashes and charred sticks where the trees once stood.<br /><br />Sierran plant species play an important role in fire ecology. Bushes have oily leaves and shaggy bark to fuel fires so they burn in any fire, large or small. Trees here are adapted to fire in a different way. Giant sequoia bark can be two feet thick and pine bark several inches thick, so fire rarely harms the living wood.<br /><br />A quote by E.V. Kormarek,<br /><br />\"The earth, born in fire, baptized by lightning, since before life's beginning has been and is, a fire planet.\"<br /><br />Additional text reads,<br /><br />What Happened:<br /><br />After this area was logged in the late 1800s, few trees remained in this altered ecosystem where poor quality wood and branches were left to rot. Years of suppressing all fire here had disrupted the fire cycle. Dense brush grew under the trees forming fuel ladders.<br /><br />Fifty years later the dry September wind carried embers from a prescribed burn into a tinderbox of old brush and scraggly trees. Fuel ladders allowed the McGee Fire to climb from the ground through the brush and branches into the treetops.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />What's Next:<br /><br />The land seems barren after a fire like McGee, but looks are deceiving. Within two years the hills are covered with grass, brush and new seedlings. Increased food and light helps trees like sequoia and pine grow quickly. To speed up the process, foresters plant more seedlings.<br /><br />Today the Forest Service burns small areas under carefully controlled conditions to reduce risk of a large fire like McGee harming people and property in the forest. This also protects timber resources and wildlife in the area, while continuing the natural fire cycles.<br /><br />A badge-shaped U.S. Forest Service Department of Agriculture logo. <br /><br />",

Do you see a snow-covered clearing? A wet and soggy brown field? Or a meadow knee-deep in flowers and tall grasses? In winter, deep snow blankets this landscape. As spring nears, snowmelt nourishes newly-emerging plants. By summer, grasses and flowers overtake the meadow, towering over the boggy ground. As the plants die back in fall, they decompose and provide nutrients for the next generation of vegetation. Meadows provide critical habitat for amphibians and birds. They offer a cool, shady resting place for mammals, including deer and black bears. Their flowers sustain native bee species and other insects.”",

The caption reads, Redwood Meadow 16.8 miles (or 27.0 km) one way. Elevation: 6,040 feet (or 1,841 m) Chaparral hillsides and oaks give way to lush meadows, streams, and sequoia groves as you approach the upper reaches of the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River. A photo of a canyon surrounded by granite peaks. The caption reads, Bearpaw Meadow 17.0 miles (or 27.4 km) one way. Elevation: 7,820 feet (or 2,384 m) From the Bearpaw area, look deep into a wilderness of granite peaks and canyons. The High Sierra Trail passes through here.

Closer to Mist Falls it crosses ground that is sometimes steep and rocky. Parts of the river have cascades and rapids. Other parts have deep, clear pools that look inviting, but swimming is not advised due to the fast current and cold water. Mist Falls is indeed misty, and the rock it travels over is smooth and wide.

An inset photo shows people at an overlook, standing behind metal handrails. The text reads,Changing ViewsMorro Rock TrailA climb up Moro rock always offers a dramatic experience, with views that constantly change. Natural processes transform the landscape you see. People shape the view as they make changes in the park and surrounding areas.An atmosphere altered by pollution affects both how far you can see, and in the long term, life itself in these parks. What will you- or your children- see from here in the future?A photo at the top of the granite rock; handrails create a safe walkway across the gray glossy rock. Visitors take in the eagle eye view of the mountain range beyond. The caption reads,The Top of the Trail TodayThe text reads,Climbing a Granite DomeThis trail climbs over 350 steps to the top, and an elevation of 6,725 feet (2050 m). Just a few steps up, the vista of the High Sierra peaks (above) first reveal itself. A black and white photo of Moro Rock near the top, with wooden stairs and long handrails running up the dome. Another black and white photo shows concrete steps with metal handrails circling a large rock on the way to the top. The caption reads, Yesterday's trail The first stairs were built in 1917 of wood. Concrete steps replace them in 1931, making them safer and blending them in with the granite rock.Please note, about 60 stair steps up the trail is a broad landing with strongly scented plants on either side called mountain misery.Exhibit Two: This orientation panel shows photos and a timeline of events. A black and white photo from September 7, 1936, of a hiker, gazing east from the top of Moro Rock. He leans on two walking poles and is wearing a stiff, wide brimmed hat, long pants and a jacket with shirt and tie. Near him is a stone stairway cut into the granite rock, a flagpole with two flags, and a metal handrail.The text reads,A High PointThe text explains that early travelers used ropes to scale this dome. Today's staircases make the trip easier, but it is still an effort to gain the top. From the 6,725 feet summit, on a clear day, you can see more than 150 miles. A timeline provides key dates, text and some related photos (starting as black and white and ending in color):1858. A bearded man, Hale Tharp, who was led by two young Native Americans to explore Moro Rock. 1860s. A dark horse with a spotted rump. This rock may have been named for a horse that grazed nearby. It may also come from \"moro\", the Spanish word for spotted animals or dark rocks.1890. Just two weeks after the creation of Sequoia National Park, Moro Rock gains protection when Congress enlarges park boundaries. 1903. A uniformed man, Buffalo Soldier Capt. Charles Young, and his regiment complete Moro Rock Road. 1913. Old model T style cars parked on dirt, under trees. Automobiles become more common at Moro Rock. 1915. The Mather Mountain Party begins its historic trip across the Sierra with a climb up Moro Rock. During the trip, the idea of a national park service is born.1917. A woman poses at the bottom of a new wooden staircase that leads up the dome's northern ridge. 1921. About twenty male Park rangers pose on top of Moro Rock, along with some other hikers, including several women and children. A large U.S. flag rises from the peak.1926. Congress enlarges Sequoia National Park to include the Great Western Divide, whose peaks are visible to the east. 1931. Workers remove the deteriorating wooden staircase and build a stone stairway that fits neatly into existing crevices in the rock.1933. New steps at the bottom of the stairway now complete the trail from the parking area to the dome's top. 1940s. About 50 male WW II soldiers pose for a photo while resting on top of Moro rock 1959. Encircled by a chain railing, a few men and women look out over Giant Forest.1960s. A new metal handrail along the entire stairway provides more protection from falls. 1975. Zigzagging white lightning cuts through a blue sky. The first recorded lightning fatality occurs at Moro Rock. 1978. Due to the way it blends almost invisibly into the granite contours, Moro Rock Stairway is added to the National Register of Historic Places. 1995 to 2005. Three people fall from the rock to their deaths in separate incidents. Always stay on the trail and within the railings.2005. A graph shows a cross section of earth and sky, with the Moro rock in the center at the bottom. A graph key represents the darkness in a spectrum of colors: purple represents the darkest; green is medium bright; and red is the brightest. Above Moro rock, the sky is dark blue and purple. On either side of the rock, the sky is dark high above the ground, but moves down through the rainbow, as it nears the ground, reaching red at a few points.

Natural processes transform the landscape you see. People shape the view as they make changes in the park and surrounding areas.<br /><br />An atmosphere altered by pollution affects both how far you can see, and in the long term, life itself in these parks. What will you- or your children- see from here in the future?<br />A photo at the top of the granite rock; handrails create a safe walkway across the gray glossy rock. Visitors take in the eagle eye view of the mountain range beyond.

Just a few steps up, the vista of the High Sierra peaks (above) first reveal itself.<br /> <br />A black and white photo of Moro Rock near the top, with wooden stairs and long handrails running up the dome. Another black and white photo shows concrete steps with metal handrails circling a large rock on the way to the top. The caption reads, <br /><br />Yesterday's trail <br />The first stairs were built in 1917 of wood. Concrete steps replace them in 1931, making them safer and blending them in with the granite rock.<br /><br />Please note, about 60 stair steps up the trail is a broad landing with strongly scented plants on either side called mountain misery.",

Its surface has curved ridges next to slight dimples as if patches of the top layer of the rock have flaked off. The rock looks like long thin plates that have stacked together to form its flat oval shape.

Many plants have a small metal signs identifying their common and scientific names. A 50-foot dirt pathway loops through the garden, reaching from the street to the Visitor Center entrance. Along the path is a wooden bench to relax on.<br /><br />A photo of gentle rolling hills, densely covered with dark green trees and shrubs. <br /> <br />The text reads,<br /><br /> All life in the Sierran foothills around you depends on communities of native plants. Adapted to the local climate, these tough plants form the basis of this entire ecosystem. <br /><br />They survive due to fascinating adaptations that help them to live through the hot, dry summers here. As a result, they can provide year-round food and shelter to the animals of the foothills. <br /><br />Additional text reads,<br /><br />Growing native plants <br /><br />Wherever you live, a community of native plants evolved to fit your climate. These plants require little irrigation, pest control, or overall care. What plants are truly native to your soil? <br /><br />A photo shows thin green branches with clusters of hand-shaped leaves. The caption reads,<br /><br />California buckeyes drop their large leaves each summer to save water. <br /><br /> A photo shows a mound of long, spiky, needle thin green grass. The caption reads,<br /> <br />Deergrass gathers water effectively with its far-reaching root system. <br /><br />A photo shows a bush with small clustered leaves, and tall upright spikes of flower clusters made up of tiny light blue flowers that circle up the flower stems. The caption reads,<br /><br />Silver bush lupine's pale leaves deflect some of the sun's strong rays. <br /><br />A photo of a branch with flat paddle shaped leaves, with bunches of small pink bell-shaped flowers dangling below. The caption reads,<br /><br />Manzanita leaves stand up, rather than lay flat, to limit exposure to sun. <br /><br />A photo shows a branch covered with clusters of tiny short, needle like leaves. The caption reads,<br /><br />Tiny chamise leaves lose less water through evaporation to the dry air. <br /><br />A photo shows several plants, each with a rounded cluster of green spiky leaves at its base and a single 8 to 10-foot-tall flower spike. Many small white flowers cluster around the top of this spike, combining into the shape of a giant, thin football. The caption reads,<br /><br />Chaparral yucca's tough, waxy leaves and thick roots store scarce water.",

Look outward from Panoramic Point across hundreds of miles of Kings Canyon National Park and neighboring national forest lands. Below lies Hume Lake, a small historic lake in Sequoia National Forest that was created in 1908 using a rare multiple-arch dam. The lake water fed a flume that floated timber down to the valley. Beyond, lies the deep glacial gorge of the Kings Canyon itself and a wealth of the High Sierra's peaks.<br /> <br /> The area before you has a rich history. In the 1890s, artist Bolton Brown climbed many peaks to learn about and paint the area more accurately. Beginning In the late 1920s, poet Kenneth Rexroth often hiked here and wrote about this area. James Hutchings also spent time here, developing his Illustrated California magazine in the 1850s to bring attention and protection to the High Sierra. The likes of John Muir, Stephen Mather, George Moskey, and Horace Albright spent time here discussing how to develop a national park system.<br /> <br /> This is also home to countless species of plants and animals, from the alpine zone, where cold-tolerant species like pika and foxtail pines live, to the foothill zone, where heat-tolerant life thrives year round. You can also see the effects of fires that have passed through, leaving the forest healthier and stronger.<br /> <br /> You can also continue past the overlook on a more difficult 2.6-mile unpaved hike to the Park Ridge Fire Lookout. If the lookout volunteers are in, they may give you access and a tour of the view.</p> <h4>Accessibility</h4> <p>The half-mile trail to the viewing area is accessible, leading visitors to a stunning view overlooking the Sierra Nevada. The trail leads up a moderately-sloped path with cross slopes that may be difficult for some individuals to navigate.<br /> <br /> The area also has an accessible parking stall, restrooms, and picnic tables.</p> <h4>Winter Access</h4> <p>To access this area in winter, you will need to hike, snowshoe, or ski into the area.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit, titled \"A Remarkable Range\", shows photos and text about the landscape in front of you. A background photo shows the sweeping view of the mountain ranges and canyons below. A large lake is seen in the valley. The following peaks are identified from left to right: Spanish Mountain at 10,051 feet. Obelisk at 9,700 feet. Mt. Goddard at 13,568 feet. Kettle Dome at 9,446 feet and, below it, Tombstone Ridge. North Palisade at 14,242 feet and, below it, Monarch Divide. Near the bottom of the photo, labels identify Hume Lake at 5,200 feet and two canyons just above the lake: the South Fork of the Kings River, in the canyon closest to the lake, and the Middle Fork of the Kings River, in the next canyon back. A topographic map shows a large dot where the Obelisk is located, at the top of a mountain. Two lines connect to this dot. The caption reads, The Obelisk. Park boundaries stretch to include this granite dome along the far western edge of Kings Canyon National Park. A black and white photo shows a line of mules, harnessed with large sacks on their backs, walking up a steep snow covered slope. Two men on horses lead them. The caption reads, Mapping Mt. Goddard. In the early 1900s, cartographers and their mules scaled these rugged snow covered peaks to map the area. A photo shows a group of people sitting on rocks at the shore of a large lake. Conifers line the edges of the lake. In the distance is a gently sloping rocky mountain with a few scattered trees. The caption reads, Hume Lake This reservoir in Sequoia National Forest hosts a public campground, a private camp, and a community of cabins. (266 words) A photo of rocky, jagged mountain peaks, that look orange in the later afternoon light.

    "audioDescription": "This exhibit is titled, \"Panoramic Point Trail\". This panel shows a map and photos of the Trail. It also has safety information. The text explains that most a broad view out over of Kings Canyon National Park can be seen from Panoramic Point. There are two short trails to the overlook. One is accessible. Much of the landscape is wilderness, one of the highest forms of legal protection. The map shows the Grant Grove Area, with a Panoramic Point Trail map inset. One photo shows a tree-filled valley with mountains in the distance, described as the view from Panoramic Point, elevation 7,500 feet, about half a mile away on either trail. It explains that views reach to the crest of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Another photo shows a small wood building on a wood pole structure with windows on all sides and a U.S. flag, described as Park Ridge Fire Lookout, 2.8 miles from here. When no staff is present, the lookout is closed to the public. A photo at the bottom shows another view from Panoramic Point, of a tree-lined ridge with snow-capped peaks in the distance. A quote by Edward Abbey: \"We need wilderness whether or not we ever set foot in it...\" Safety text says: Store food properly to keep bears wild. Do not store food or scented items in your vehicle. Store them in metal food-storage boxes or bring them with you. Travel Lightly: Trails here are for day-use only. Overnight trips are not permitted. Pets and wheeled vehicles are prohibited. Firearms are subject to state and local regulations. Discharge of a firearm is prohibited within Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks. Wood fires are prohibited on this trail. As you travel, choose to act in ways that preserve the wilderness experience. Blend in. Keep noise to a minimum. Leave Indian artifacts, historical objects, and natural items such as pine cones where you find them. Don't construct fire rings trenches, or other \"improvements.\" Don't introduce invasive species. Before hiking, clean seeds and mud from boots, laces, and equipment. Wilderness Safety: People traveling in wilderness areas should be very self-reliant. Immediate rescue is rarely possible. The responsibility to understand natural hazards and to travel safely lies with you. Plan your trip carefully. Carry a map. Be prepared. Creek crossings may be hazardous at any time. Bring drinking water or treat it. Never drink untreated water from lakes or streams. Know what to do in an emergency. Cell phones rarely work in most of the park. Carry and know how to use basic first aid gear. Be alert to falling objects. Take notice of snapping branches overhead, pay extra attention to windy or snowy conditions. If you encounter illegal activity, leave the area immediately and notify a ranger.",

You can hike to the end of the trail, or walk as far as you'd like and then turn around. In summer, watch carefully for poison oak and avoid touching its \"leaves of three.\" Many hikers prefer to spend time here in fall, winter, and spring, when temperatures are cool. In spring, wildflowers are varied and lovely. In spring or after storms, take care with creek crossings and turn back if it doesn't seem safe.<br /> <br /> The trailhead is in Buckeye Flat Campground. In winter, the road to the campground is closed to vehicles and you can begin your hike at Hospital Rock Picnic Area. Walk along the road to the campground and look for the trailhead as you enter.</p> <h3>Education Programs</h3> <p>The Sierra Newt, a native Californian amphibian, calls the foothills home. Newts descend from the hillsides throughout the winter and early spring to reach their breeding pools, which form as snowmelt cascades down the mountains.<br /> <br /> Interested in learning more? Join a park ranger on a curriculum-based field trip to study the phenology, or timing, of newt migration. Tracking the timing of breeding cycles gives scientists critical insight into how the lives of plants and animals are impacted by the changing climate.<br /> <br /> Call 559-565-4211 or email seki_ritc@nps.gov to learn more about the community-science field trip opportunities offered at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.<br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "This trailhead orientation panel shows a map and photos of the Paradise Creek trailhead. The text reads, Gentle Paradise Canyon contrasts sharply with tis surrounding terrain. The trail crosses Middle Fork Bridge then parallels and crosses Paradise Creek. Crossing the creek, however, may be difficult. The trail grows quite faint in some areas, and can be hard to find. Turn back unless you are prepared for route-finding and creek crossings. Like almost all park trails, Paradise Creek Trail leads into designated wilderness. One of the highest forms of legal protection, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to enjoy. A map of the foothills area shows our location at the beginning of the Paradise trail. A safety warning indicates that rattlesnakes and ticks are common in the foothills. The top photo shows a tree filled valley. A gentle creek with large rocks surges through it. The caption reads, Paradise Creek 3.0 miles (or 4.8 km) one way to end of trail Two photos of poison oak: \"Spring\" shows a branch with leaf clusters of three. The pointed leaves have yellow centers deepening to orange with red tips. \"Summer\" shows a close up of a cluster of three green, pointed, leaves. The caption reads, Poison oak is abundant along this trail. This plant causes itchy rashes a few days after it touches your skin. Look for shrubs or vines with leaves of three. If you come in contact, wash the area with cool, soapy water. The bottom photo shows a tree lined ridge, with a granite dome visible in the distance to the right. The caption reads, View from Paradise Creek, with Moro Rock on the ridge to the right. A quote by Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas: \"Walking the wilderness is indeed like living.\"",

    "audioDescription": "The text reads,<br />The trail first climbs through the sequoias of Atwell Grove, which saw some logging in the 1890s. After the first mile, it becomes less steep, then crests at Paradise Ridge just past the grove. The trail that descends from there to Redwood Meadow is very steep and challenging.<br />Like most park trails, Paradise Ridge Trail leads into designated wilderness. One of the highest forms of protection for public lands, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to experience. Possible destinations include:<br />The top photo shows a sunlit sequoia trunk surrounded by deep green woods. The caption reads,<br />Atwell Sequoia Grove.<br />1.0 mile (or 1.6 km) one way.<br /><br />Atwell Grove extends from 6,500 feet to 8,460 feet in elevation, making it one of the highest -elevation sequoia groves on earth. It also grows on an unusually steep slope for sequoias. <br />In the photo, taken from a ridge, large treetops give way to the Great Western divide and canyons of the Kaweah River. The caption reads,<br />Paradise Ridge.<br />3.7 miles (or 6.0 km) one way.<br />Elevation: 8,460 feet (or 2,579 m.)<br />Openings in the trees allow views toward the gigantic Great Western Divide to the east and the canyons of Kaweah River to the north.<br />A map of the Mineral King area shows the location of Paradise Ridge Trailhead. <br />The bottom photo is a view of treetops that open up to sequoia covered mountains. The caption reads,<br /><br />A view into Mineral King Valley on the climb to Paradise Ridge.<br /><br />A quote from Mary Austin (Inyo writer). <br /><br />\" Man is not himself only...He is all that he sees.\"",

Sequoia trees line the path that stretches ahead along the right side of the meadow.<br /><br />On the upper corners of this wayside exhibit frame are tactile sequoia cones made of brass. The cones have been flattened on the bottom to help secure them to the frames. Most wayside exhibits on this trail have similar cones.<br /><br />A background photo, taken from the meadow, shows a dense line of sequoias against a dark sky.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Prime Sequoia Habitat<br /><br />Welcome to one of the best places on earth for giant sequoias. In Giant Forest sequoias grow bigger than anywhere else, and Round Meadow is one of the best sequoia habitats within Giant Forest.<br /><br />As you circle Round Meadow on the Big Trees Trail, notice where these magnificent trees thrive and where they do not. Where are they largest? Where are they absent? As you walk the trail you can learn what factors determine where sequoias grow.<br /><br />The map shows a long, rough oval shape with the words \"Round Meadow\" in the center. Surrounding the shape is a series of dots that cross each other at the bottom edge of Round Meadow, indicating a loop trail. The words \"You are Here\" are above and to the right of where the dots cross. The text reads,<br /><br />Big Trees Trail<br />Distance 0.6 miles (or 1.0 km)<br /><br />Accessibility<br /><br />The trail is very flat with no steps. It is paved except for small stretches of wooden boardwalk.<br /><br />Additional text reads,<br /><br />In memory of John Palmer.<br /><br />The Big Trees Trail is dedicated to John Palmer, Chief Park Interpreter from 1969 to 1987. His vision, a Giant Forest preserved for the sequoias and the people who want to experience them, has finally come. <br /><br />Additional wayside exhibits along this trail will be described as if you are continuing on this trail to the right and circling the meadow counterclockwise.",

    "audioDescription": "A photo of a contemporary ranger in uniform and hat, looking toward a giant sequoia. As she stands in a sunlit patch, her figure is dwarfed by the trees surrounding her. The text reads, Protection: Past and Future Are sequoias safe? No longer can a national park guarantee absolute protection of the natural systems these trees rely on. Air pollution affects young sequoias trying to grow skyward. Climate change may heat or dry this area too much for these sensitive trees. By facing these challenges, we can work to protect this symbol of endurance and its forest community. On the right side of the exhibit, there is a recessed rectangular area with tactile graphics of a National Park Service logo and leather hat band. On top is the logo, in the shape of a brown arrowhead, point downward. Inside that arrowhead, a green sequoia tree shape is cut out and recessed. The rest of the illustration is not tactile. It includes the words, \"National Park Service.\" Near the bottom of the arrowhead is a white buffalo silhouette, set against a green meadow, with a white lake and a snow-capped mountain behind it. Below this is a band, running on an angle across the lower right corner. It has a raised parallel ridge along each edge, and four raised sequoia cone shapes within those ridges. Thin needle-like ridges, representing sequoia leaves, can be felt between the cones. The text reads, Symbol of the Service Three of the first four national parks protected giant sequoias. As a result, the NPS arrowhead logo features a sequoia silhouette. Embossed sequoia cones decorate the belts and hatbands of park rangers nationwide.",

It takes you along the ridge above Redwood Canyon for spectacular views as well as along the canyon floor among the trees. The trail is lightly used, so you may be able to experience solitude on this hike.<br /> <br /> Relatively few people visit the Redwood Mountain sequoia grove. The trails take you along the ridge above Redwood Canyon for spectacular views as well as along the canyon floor among the trees. The trailhead is two miles from Highway 180 down a sometimes rough, unpaved road; take it slowly. Once you arrive, you can take a short walk or an overnight trip (for overnights a wilderness permit is required).</p> <h4>Redwood Mountain Grove, Post-Fire: What to Expect</h4> <p>This grove burned in the 2021 KNP Complex Fire. Forty percent of the grove burned at moderate to high fire severity, and many giant sequoias were killed. <br /> <br /> Redwood Mountain Grove is a very large grove noted for its old growth sequoias and diversity of other plants. In the spring, wildflowers are a highlight both along the ridge trail and along Redwood Creek. In the fall, the dogwood shrubs turn a deep red color, and the fall light provides good photo opportunities. Visitors to this grove will see evidence of wildfire in fire-killed trees, more open forests, and we hope, giant sequoia seedling regeneration as well as re-sprouting wildflowers and shrubs.<br /> <br /> Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/seki/learn/nature/knp-complex-fire.htm\">KNP Complex Fire web page</a>, to learn more about this fire.</p> <h4>Services Nearby</h4> <p>Parking, vault toilets, and bear boxes are available.<br /> <br /> <br />  </p>",
    "audioDescription": "This trailhead orientation panel shows a map and photos of the Redwood Canyon Trail area. The text reads, These trails wind through Redwood Mountains Grove and the largest area of unlogged sequoia forest on Earth. It was here that scientists in the mid 1960s discovered the strong, fascinating connection between healthy sequoia groves and natural fire cycles. Watch for signs of fire and regrowth as you walk. Like most park trails, Redwood Canyon trails lead into designated wilderness. One of the highest forms of protection for public lands, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to experience. Several loops offer opportunities for short or long hikes. Possible destinations include: A photo shows a group of giant reddish-brown sequoia trunks. The caption reads, Sugar Bowl Loop. 6.5 miles (or 10.5 km) round trip. Elevation gain: 1,480 feet (or 450 m). The name comes from the Sugar Bowl Group, a dense stand of mature sequoias along the trail. This walk is slightly steeper than the Hart Tree Loop, with a short series of switchbacks near the creek. A photo of massive giant sequoia with a deeply furrowed trunk and a deep fire scar. The caption reads, Hart Tree and Fallen Goliath Loop 7.3 miles (or 11.8 km) round trip. Elevation gain: 1,100 feet (or 335 m). Named for a man who located it in the 1880s, the Hart Tree is one of the 25 largest sequoias. Watch along this trail for evidence of limited logging that took place in the 1870s. Combine this trail with the Sugar Bowl Loop for a longer hike of 9.8 miles (or 15.8 km). A map shows the location of the Redwood Mountain Trailhead. A bottom photo shows the view from a ridge, lined with sequoia trees. In the distance are tree covered mountains. The caption reads, Redwood Mountain A quote by Honoré de Balzac, \"Who...can walk in a forest without the forest speaking to him?\"",

The trunks of large giant sequoias trees are almost always marked by fire scars at ground level, and their lower branches have been burned away. Their living limbs and needles grow hundreds of feet above the forest floor, where they are safe from most flames. Fire is necessary in order for sequoia cones to open and release their seeds. It is also necessary to clear away underbrush and give trees the space and sunlight they need to grow. Scientists and park managers have developed ways to use fire to maintain healthy ecosystems within the parks, including natural (lightning) fires and prescribed burns.<br /> <br /> Redwood Canyon also houses thousands of dogwood trees. In spring and early summer, white blossoms cover their branches. In autumn, their foliage turns red, brown, and yellow. Light filtering through the leaves or blossoms creates an ever-changing atmosphere, so the experience of the canyon shifts with the seasons.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit, titled \"Meeting the National Park Mission: Protecting Natural Objects,\" shows photos and text about protecting sequoia health. The text reads, In front of you stands one of the world's largest groves of the world's largest trees. Redwood Mountain Grove covers five square miles with more than 2,100 giant sequoias larger than 10 feet in diameter. The National Park Service mission requires us to protect these \"natural objects.\" How? We protect the natural processes that create the conditions that those objects require. In the case of sequoias, a process that holds the key to survival is fire. Without it, these giant trees cannot regenerate. A photo of a tree covered mountain range. Sequoia trees in the foreground have differing shapes. A few with pointed cone shaped tops are identified as young \"spiretop\" sequoias. A sequoia tree with rounded full branches at the top is identified as a mature sequoia. A giant sequoia, with massive branches and abundant foliage, has a dead branch at its top. It is identified as a \"snagtop\". The caption reads, Shape reveals the life stage of a sequoia. Young sequoias grow into graceful spires as they race toward the sunlight. Mature sequoias show smooth clumps of foliage. The tops of the trunks eventually die, giving the oldest trees the nickname \"snagtops.\" A photo shows a green forest with a low fire burning around the bases of giant sequoia trees. A firefighter walks near the base of a sequoia. The firefighter wears a yellow shirt, a yellow plastic helmet, and a backpack. The caption reads, The earliest efforts to use fire to benefit sequoias started here. In the 1960s, scientists first learned how much sequoias need fire: Sequoia seeds rain down after fires. These seeds survive best in burned forest clearings. Small, frequent fires create optimum conditions for large sequoias, too. They clear the forest of competing trees and remove fuel that would feed unnaturally hot wildfires. Two black and white photos of other sequoias, photographed from the same position at different times. A photo from 1890 shows several sequoias. Park workers stand next to the enormous trunks. A photo from 1970 shows the same sequoia trees with thick clusters of young fir trees growing around the trunks. The text reads, Compare these photos. In 1890, when fires burned naturally, the forest floor was clear. In 1970, after years of fire suppression, undergrowth chokes the same forest. Additional text reads, Help the park fulfill its mission. Protect scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife. Enjoy them in ways that leave the parks unimpaired for future generations.",

The rock is silhouetted in black as the handrails reflect the last sunlight. The mountains beyond take on a textured gray against the last glow of sunset behind them, the upper sky is dark. The stars appear as hundreds of white curved lines streaking across the dark sky. <br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Daytime views from here reach miles into the wilderness. At night, you can see even farther. In the dark, our universe reveals itself in uncountable stars.<br /><br />Why protect dark skies? For nocturnal animals, who need darkness to live. For diurnal wildlife, who seek safety in the night. For knowledge gained from telescopes that require darkness to probe the cosmos. And for you to enjoy the fascination, beauty, and inspiration of the heavens.<br /><br />Dark skies grow rarer as artificial light spills across the landscape from afar, as shown by the late night long exposure above. Today's improved lighting, however, can help. Fixtures that focus light downward, rather than up and out, save energy and restore darkness, even miles away.<br /><br />An image shows a rainbow spectrum of colors depicting a view toward the west. Five cities are identified across the bottom. Each city creates a warm color, that morphs into a cooler color in the higher atmosphere. The cities from left to right: <br /><br />Los Angeles, 169 miles, 272 km. Red<br /><br />Bakersfield, 83 miles, 133 km. Orange <br /><br />Porterville, 36 miles, 58 km.

Be sure to stay hydrated as the canyon is hot and dry in summer.<br /> <br /> Kings Canyon is also a very active bear area. Be sure to stow anything with a scent in the food storage lockers.

    "audioDescription": "Exhibit One: This trailhead orientation panel shows a map and photos of the Woods Creek and Bubbs Creek Trails area. The text reads, Welcome to where roads end and trails begin. Walk a few hours, or hike farther into a glorious wilderness ruled by elevation and climate. Like most park trails, these lead into designated wilderness. One of the highest forms of protection for public lands, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to experience. Possible destinations include: Via Woods Creek Trail. A photo of a cascading waterfall, surging through rocks. The caption reads, Mist falls. 3.9 miles (or 6.3 km) one way. Elevation: 5,840 feet (or 1780 m). As the name suggests, mist from this powerful cascade surrounds the area of the falls. The trail and nearby rocks can be slippery here, especially in early summer when the river is at its peak flow. Be extremely careful. Via Bubbs Creek Trail, A photo of a pass through a rocky ridge, with a rounded crag to the left, and a pointed steep crag to its right. Low shrubs and a few conifer trees dot the landscape. The caption reads, Sphinx Creek. 4.1 miles (or 6.6 km) one way. Elevation: 6,240 feet (or 1902 m). Towering over the canyon floor, the Sphinx evokes images of Egypt's giant statues. John Muir named the formation in the later 1800s. A map shows the location of the Woods Creek and Bubbs Creek Trailhead. The bottom photo shows a hillside of large foxtail pines, with a snow-covered mountain range in the distance. The caption reads, Above Vidette Meadow, A quote by Shel Silverstein, \"There is a place where the sidewalk ends...\" Exhibit Two: This trailhead orientation panel shows a map and photos of the Rae Lakes Loop area. The text reads, One of the most popular loops in the Sierra Nevada begins here. The Rae Lakes loop travels 41.2 miles (or 66.3 km) through rugged canyons and alpine wilderness. Part of the loop parallels the Sierra Crest, sharing the tread of the Pacific Crest and John Muir trails. Because of the large number of hikers on the Rae Lakes Loop, special restrictions apply. Extra care with storing food from bears is required. Keep the camping restrictions in mind as you plan your trip. Above all, choose to act in ways that preserve the wild character of this remarkable place. Six photographs with captions, from left to right, and top to bottom: A photo of a tree filled valley, with rocks and patches of snow, and mountains in the distance. Middle Paradise Valley is 6.8 miles (or 10.9 km) clockwise. A photo of two deep blue lakes, ringed by trees with a granite dome in the distance. Middle Rae Lake is 22.7 miles (or 36.5 km) clockwise. A photo of a sunlit meadow, dotted with large conifer trees. Vidette Meadow is 28.2 miles (or 45.5 km) clockwise. A photo of trees with bright yellow leaves, a conifer forest, and steep mountains with patches of snow beyond. Woods Creek Crossing is 15.7 miles (or 25.3 km) clockwise. A photo from a rocky ridge, looking down at three turquoise blue lakes. Glen Pass is 24.6 miles (or 39.6 km) clockwise. A photo of a lush green meadow, lined with conifers, with steep granite cliffs in the distance. Junction Meadow is 31.1 miles (or 50.1 km) clockwise. The text reads, Clockwise or counterclockwise? Choose the direction of your hike before getting a wilderness permit. Most people travel the Rae Lakes Loop in the clockwise direction. More time is spent climbing, but the ascents are more gradual, especially along the approach to Glen Pass. Hiking in a counterclockwise direction results in steeper climbs. Most of the elevation gain comes early in the trip. A map shows the location of the Rae Lakes Loop with trails marked. The bottom photo is a calm lake, with granite Fin Dome towering above the left horizon.",

    "audioDescription": "The text reads, Mountain passes and vistas of remote High Sierra lie ahead. Monarch Lakes, lying on the boundary between granitic and metamorphic rock, create an inviting but chilly destination for hikers and backpackers. Like most park trails, the Sawtooth Trail leads into designated wilderness. One of the highest forms of protection for public lands, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to experience. Possible destinations include: The top photo shows a brown rocky alpine, with pockets of snow. The caption reads, Monarch Lakes. 4.2 miles (or 6.8 km) one way. Elevation: 10,400 feet (or 3,170 m) to first lake. From valley floor to forest to rocky alpine, the trail brings you to Monarch Lakes at the foot of 12,343 foot Sawtooth Peak. Like several other small lakes in this area, Lower Monarch Lake has a small dam. The next photo of two ridges descending into a mountain pass covered with a grove of massive red firs in the shape of an inverted triangle. The caption reads, Timber Gap. 2.0 miles (or 3.2 km) one way. Elevation: 9,450 feet (or 2,880 m.) The views of Mineral King Valley are superb as you climb. At the gap itself, you stand in a grove of massive red firs. A map of the Mineral King area shows our location at Sawtooth trailhead. At the bottom is a photo of snow covered peaks and valleys. The caption reads, View toward Mineral King Valley from the Sawtooth Trail. A quote from The Wilderness Act of 1964: \"...where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man...\"",

    "audioDescription": "This interactive exhibit, titled \"Sentinel Tree,\" is embedded in the rough surface of the pedestrian plaza in front of the Giant Forest Museum. It is like a smooth giant ruler that runs the length of the plaza, showing the height of the sequoia tree called The Sentinel, if it were lying on the ground. The height ruler is mostly made up of a long line of smooth, light grey cement paving stones that are each one foot square. So it is a ruler measuring feet, not inches!<br /><br />The exhibit begins with a darker square representing the base of the tree. This square is located in the middle of the plaza, close to the museum entrance. This paving stone is etched with an illustration of the entire tree, and titled, \"Ground Level on Sentinel Tree\". There are arrows pointing at either side of the base of the tree. The text reads, <br /><br />You are Here.<br />28 feet (or 8.5 meters) thick.<br /><br />A shorter width ruler, perpendicular to the height ruler, crosses the plaza to show the tree's width of 28 feet (or 8.5 m). A dark stone paver at each side of this width ruler explains that the Sentinel tree measures 86 feet (or 26.2 m) around the circumference of the base.<br /><br />After walking 20 feet (or 6 meters) further along the ruler on the plaza, another dark paver appears. It is again etched to show the full tree, but the arrows are now slightly higher up on the tree trunk. The text reads, <br /><br />20 feet (or 6 m) up Sentinel Tree.<br />Imagine yourself here.<br />18 ft. (or 5.5 m) thick.<br /><br />Every 20 feet, another dark paver appears, showing the tree, arrows, and text asking you to imagine yourself at that height along the trunk and saying how wide the tree is at that point.<br /><br />The final dark paver reads,<br /><br />257 ft. (or 78.5 m) up Sentinel Tree.<br />Imagine yourself at the top.",

His eye is painted white with a black pupil. The headdress has a white band that curves around the forehead down to the ear area, decorated with six yellow triangles with white centers, outlined in black, in an alternating pattern.

Can you spot them? <br /><br />On the left side of this rectangle, you can feel a raised oval, which is the outline of a sequoia cone, with about 20 tiny seeds below it. <br /><br />The text reads, <br /><br />Each cone holds about 200 seeds the size of oat flakes. They must land on bare soil to grow. <br /><br />To the right of the cone is a seedling a few weeks old. If you feel the round top, it shows that the seed coat is still attached to the plant. The text reads,<br /><br />The first leaves out of the seed are long and soft. Short, prickly needles grow the next year.<br /><br />To the right of the seedling is a taller sapling, with short needles.<br /><br />Moving right to the second indented rectangle, you will find the shape of more mature sequoias, shown at about one 200th of actual size. <br /><br />On the left side is a spire-shaped young tree, filled with branches from top to bottom. The text reads, <br /><br />Given plenty of water, these \"teenagers\" grow quickly upward. Pointy and cone-shaped, they have a grayish bark.<br /><br />On the right side of this rectangle is an outline of a mature sequoia tree with a thick, bare, lower trunk, and short stubby branches near the top. The text reads, <br /><br />As sequoias age, lower branches drop off and bark thickens. Their crowns of foliage grow rounded and irregular.<br /><br />The Braille information provided on this exhibit has already been explained in this Audio Description.",

    "audioDescription": "The text reads, All seasons alter this view, but none as dramatically as winter. Snow smooths jagged rocks, pointy trees, and rough ground. Yet it means more than a change in scenery. Snow here equals water for the valley below. Farmers supported creation of Sequoia National Park in 1890. They knew that mountain snow sends water to thirsty people and crops downstream. They also knew that, without forests to hold the soil and slow the snowmelt, runoff would speed downward too early, too fast. Climate changes that may reduce snow pack concern farmers - and city planners- today. A photo of a tree and brush filled valley with a fast-moving blue green river. White caps encircle large rocks as it rushes along the rocky shore. The caption reads, A photo of this location on Moro Rock during winter, a glistening snow-covered peak has icicles hanging from a top perch. The white starburst sun shines over the snow dusted valley below, a sparkling river flowing through it. Mountain peaks layer the distant landscape. Almost all the land you can see from here lies in the Kaweah watershed. Watershed means an area where all water on or under it drains to the same place. The Kaweah River's water - billions of gallons - flows to the southern San Joaquin Valley.",

Large layers of gray speckled granite, like large scales, are seen on the rock's face. A large v shaped surface has a tinge of light orange that darkens near the bottom. Stairs, with a handrail lead up the side of the dome. The caption reads,<br /><br /><br />Look at the rock above you for evidence of exfoliation. Numerous rock layers that have yet to break free loom overhead. Some have separated from the main rock but still lie on the surface. Exfoliation produces the round shape of Moro Rock.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Granite describes something hard and unchanging. Yet bit by bit, the mass of granite that forms Moro rock splits like the layers of an onion and huge slabs detach. When a layer peels off, it frees the granite below of its huge weight. The next layer may in turn expand and separate from the parent rock. This exfoliation shrinks Moro Rock gradually, making it smaller than it was in times past-and larger now than it may be the next time you visit.<br /><br />A photo of an enormous granite rock slab covering a steep rocky hillside, surrounded by pines and firs. The caption reads,<br /><br />Scan the view behind you for this rockslide. In the 1990s, a slab broke loose and crashed onto the Generals Highway. It blocked the road until the park staff blasted it into smaller pieces and removed it. Throughout the parks, rocks of various sizes are always on the move, changing our views in ways we may or may not notice.<br />",

The trunk has been cut across its base, showing the tree's cross section. <br /><br />On the panel, a background photo, taken from the meadow, shows a dense line of giant sequoias against a dark sky. An illustration, layered on top of the photo, shows two giant sequoias. The tree on the left has a wide \"Flared Base\", like an overturned fluted glass or trumpet bell. The tree on the right has a \"Typical base\", with just a slight widening at its base.<br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />Sequoias growing in moist areas often develop flared bases. This adaptation apparently provides greater support in the soft soil. It's similar to standing with your feet wider apart for stability.<br /><br />Notice the bases of other sequoias. They may provide clues about local soil moisture.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Surviving Change<br /><br />This spot is unusually wet for sequoias. It was probably drier here when the trees in front of you began growing. During prolonged droughts, wet meadows like this one often shrink. Sequoias can get started in the drier soil around the edge.<br /><br />However, if the climate turns wet again and the meadow expands, roots get flooded. These giants may not make it. Their roots may drown. The moist soil may be too soft to support large trees, causing them to lean and finally fall. Time will tell.",

Each plant that grows here has a strategy to survive the winter. Conifers—pines and other needle-bearing trees—have a conical shape and densely packed, slippery needles that shed snow . Flexible branches bend easily to dump snow before too much accumulates. Thick bark insulates the trunk from cold. Broadleaf trees and bushes grow shorter and rounder. When they lose their delicate leaves each fall, only their bare branches are exposed to cold. Smaller plants spend the entire winter under the snowpack, sheltered from wind and temperature extremes.”",

Attached to the root end of the trunk is a small cabin with wood siding and a stone fireplace. Most of the wood plank siding is grey in color, and weathered, warped, and carved with graffiti. A few planks that have been restored near the door are straighter and orange brown in color. Further up the trunk, a wooden shutter is attached to the log with two large metal hinges. The shutter is open, with its lower edge propped up on two posts, revealing a square opening cut into the trunk behind it, forming a window. The entrance to the cabin is missing a door. People can enter the front portion of the cabin. The back part is blocked by a wooden railing. Beyond it are Tharp's original old wooden bed, table, and bench.

In 1937, The CCC Boys tunneled through its trunk. Today cars can drive through this tunnel. <br /><br />A black and white photo of 25 jovial young men posing for a group photo. Some have their hands on their hips or behind their backs. A couple are holding shovels. Many are dressed in brown button up long-sleeved shirts with two breast pockets. Their belted dark trousers are cuffed at the bottom. Most are wearing round canvas hats. Behind the men are a dozen white canvas tents, in two neat rows. A larger white tent is seen behind the lines of tents, with smoke billowing next to it. To the left, is a shrub covered hill with a road running beside it. An old-fashioned Model T style automobile is parked near the road. The caption reads,<br /><br />CCC Boys pose at their camp at Potwisha. <br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Tunnel Log reminds us of the work of young men who struggled to survive The Great Depression in the 1930s. The drive through hole in the log was carved by the \"boys\" of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). <br /><br />The Great Depression left millions unemployed. Congress created the CCC to put young men to work and get paychecks to their families. The CCC worked mostly on public lands, including Sequoia National Park. <br /><br />Despite youth and inexperience, the CCC boys proved remarkable in developing many features of this park and at thousands of other places across the nation. They built roads, trails, buildings, campgrounds, water systems, and more much of which is still used today. <br /><br />A black and white photo of a large fallen sequoia covered with snow laying across a road. An old-fashioned automobile with a hard top with rounded corners and close, rounded fenders. is parked facing the log. The caption reads,<br /><br />When this sequoia fell across the road on December 4, 1937, CCC worker Roy DeVoe of Weldon, California, suggested cutting the tunnel. The tree extended 275 feet long, with a base of 21 feet. <br /><br />A black and white photo of a large fallen sequoia with two old fashioned, Model T style cars parked on the top of the trunk. Several visitors are standing or sitting next to their cars. The caption reads,<br /><br />Auto Log circa 1920s <br /><br />The text explains that in the past it was common to alter natural features to create attractions that drew people to the parks. Today, national parks are valued more for preserving landscapes unchanged.<br /><br /> A photo of curved dirt road with boulders piled up along either side. A very large rock spans between those boulders, creating a bridge across the road. A man stands under the rock for scale. A photo of Tunnel Rock from the 1930s.",

    "audioDescription": "The View: In front of you is an enormous sequoia tree. The tree has deep crevices and curves outward at the base. The trunk is covered with shaggy reddish-brown bark that is thick and fibrous. Its thick stubby branches with clusters of oval green leaves, start high above the ground.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />The General Grant Tree's massive trunk makes it the third largest tree in the world, by volume. And at 40 feet (or 12 m) in diameter at ground level, it is the world's widest known sequoia. But it is not nearly the oldest. In fact, it is 1,500 years younger than the oldest known sequoia.<br /><br />Location, not age, is the key to a sequoia's size. In places with the best combination of moisture, sunlight, and nutrients, they outgrow older sequoias rooted in less prime locations. Apparently conditions here are ideal, considering how quickly the General Grant Tree has grown so large.<br /><br />Additional text, with small illustrations, reads,<br /><br />Fun Facts:<br /><br />An illustration of a sequoia tree, the planet earth, and a red car lined up next to each other. A fuel hose connects the trunk of the tree to the gas tank of the car.<br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />If the trunk of the General Grant Tree was a gas tank on a car that got 25 miles per gallon, you could drive around the earth 350 times without refueling.<br /><br />An illustration of people, holding hands, stretched out around a sequoia tree trunk. <br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />The General Grant Tree is so wide it would take about twenty people holding hands to make a complete circle around the base.<br /><br />An illustration of a sequoia tree trunk, filled with large orange balls and tiny white balls. <br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />If the General Grant Tree's trunk could be filled with sports equipment, it could hold 159,000 basketballs, or more than 37 million ping pong balls.<br /><br />An illustration of a sequoia tree with a yellow star at the top.<br /><br />The caption reads,<br /><br />President Calvin Coolidge proclaimed the General Grant Tree to be the Nation's Christmas Tree in 1926. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower designated it as a National Shrine, a living memorial to those who have given their lives for their country.<br /><br />A large Illustration of the General Grant Tree:<br /><br />The text inside the trunk reads,<br /><br />Volume makes it the 3rd largest tree in the world. <br /><br />The text at the base reads, <br /><br />It is the widest known sequoia, at 40 feet across.<br /><br />The statistics listed for the General Grant tree include:<br /><br />Volume.<br />46,608 cubic feet (or 1,320 cubic meters).<br /><br />Height.<br />268 feet (or 82 meters).<br /><br />Estimated Age.<br />1,700 years old.<br /><br />Estimated Weight.<br />1,254 tons (or 1,325 metric tons).<br /><br />Circumference (at its base).<br />107 feet (or 33 meters).<br /><br />Maximum Diameter.<br />40 feet (or 12 meters).<br /><br />Diameter of Largest Branch.<br />4.5 feet (or 1.4 meters).<br /><br />Height of First Branch.<br />129 feet (or 39 meters).<br /><br />To see the world's largest tree (by volume), drive 27 miles (or 43 km) south on the Generals Highway to the General Sherman Tree in the Giant Forest.<br /><br />Additional text reads,<br /><br />How do we know its age?<br /><br />Determining a living sequoia's age is hard. We can't count all of the growth rings inside a huge sequoia without injuring the tree. Instead, scientists have used tree ring measurements from old stumps to develop mathematical formulas for sequoia growth. On living trees, they only need to count the rings on the outer edge to apply the formula. This gives an estimated age, not a precise one, that is \"give or take\" within a couple hundred years.",

    "audioDescription": "Notice the tactile brass sequoia cone, the size of a small egg, on the upper left corner on the frame of this exhibit. The text reads, This tree is not the tallest or the widest, but the overall volume of its trunk makes it the biggest tree on Earth. Text and charts explain the Sequoia World Records by volume, weight, width, height and age. The General Sherman holds the records for volume: 52,500 cubic feet (or 1,487 cubic meters) and weight: 1,385 tons (or 1,256 metric tons). General Grant holds the record for width: 40 feet (or 12 m). Unnamed sequoias hold records for height: Three hundred and eleven feet (or 95 m) and age: 3,200 years. A diagram of the tall General Sherman tree along with three circular sections through the trunk show the volume at various heights. The sections are labeled A, B, and C. The same letters appear on the tree illustration. \"A\", at the base, is 36.5 feet (or 11 m) in diameter. \"B\", 180 feet up, by the first branches, is 13.7 feet (or 4.2 m) across. \"C\", for the largest branch, is 6.8 feet (or 2 m) wide. An illustration of three tiny people at the base of the tree, with an arrow pointing upward. The text reads, It's a Matter of Perspective Looking up at the General Sherman Tree for a six-foot-tall human is about the equivalent of a mouse looking up at the 6-foot-tall human. More labels on the illustration of the General Sherman Tree explain that: The height is 275 feet tall. The volume is 52,500 cubic feet (or 1,487 cubic meters). Just how much is that? If the Sherman tree's trunk could be filled with water, it would provide enough water for 9,844 baths. That's one bath every day for 27 years. The weight is 1,385 tons (or 1,256 metric tons) The circumference, the measurement around the base of the trunk, is 103 feet (or 31 m). The age is 2,200 years old. Additional text reads, Biggest Does Not Mean Oldest The General Sherman Tree is about 1,000 years younger than the oldest - known Sequoia. How can this be? Location, location, location! We're growing conditions are best, sequoias grow faster. They outgrow older trees rooted in less prime locations. A life sized photograph shows that the cross section of a stunted 100-year-old sequoia tree is actually smaller than a U.S. half dollar. On the bottom, illustrations with arrows show the life cycle of a sequoia, from a tiny seedling less than two years old, to a taller Spire Top tree, 25 to 100 years old, to the massive 2,200-year-old General Sherman Tree.",

    "audioDescription": "This wayside exhibit, titled \"Shaping a Park: The Naturalists\", shows photos and text about early park rangers. <br /><br />A black and white photo of a group of tourists, of all ages, on a steep stone stairway. The women are wearing knee length dresses, jackets, and rounded hats. The men wear trousers and buttoned shirts. Some have ties and brimmed hats. A ranger stands above the group, wearing a hat with a stiff brim, a white shirt and tie under a five-pocket buttoned jacket, and jodhpurs. He is pointing forward and upward. Many tourists are looking in that same direction. The caption reads,<br /><br />Park ranger Frank Been leads a group at Moro Rock in 1930. Been was hired a year earlier as the park's first fulltime paid ranger naturalist.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Moro Rock is one of the places in Sequoia National Park where, in 1922, naturalists began \"translating\" the landscape for early park visitors. Naturalists offered walks, talks, and campfire programs, which combined information with inspiration, and visitors loved it. <br /><br />For many people, parks are beautiful but mysterious. What shaped the land? Why does something grow here and not there? The tradition of naturalists helping visitors to combine fascination with knowledge continues today, kindling a commitment to parks in untold numbers of people. <br /><br />A quote by Colonel J. R. White, Park Superintendent, 1926: <br /><br />\"The expansion of museum, nature walks and campfire lectures is the surest protection against degeneracy into jazzy amusements\"<br /><br />A black and white photo of an older man. He is wearing a stiff, wide brimmed felt hat. The hat has a medium sized, cylindrical crown with a dimpled rounded peak. A wide band with an emblem encircles its crown and a leather strap is tucked under his chin. He wears a white shirt and tie under a jacket with curved lapels, covered buttons, and two large buttoned pockets across the chest. He gazes downward, peering at the ferns surrounding him. The caption reads,<br /><br />Walter Fry<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />Sequoia's First Naturalist <br /><br />As a young man, Walter Fry came to the Sierra Nevada to log. After counting more than 3,000 rings on a cut sequoia, he turned instead to protecting the trees. Fry eventually became the first civilian superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.<br /><br />Later, in 1920, Stephen Mather, (first director of the National Park Service) concluded that every park needed naturalists. Two years later the Sequoia Nature Guide Service was born when Superintendent John White called on his predecessor, Walter Fry, to volunteer. Working part time, Fry thus became Sequoia National Park's first naturalist.",

    "audioDescription": "The View: In the distance is the lower trunk of the massive General Sherman Tree, with a triangular black scar that points upward from the base almost 30 feet high. Glimpses of the upper tree are seen through the branches of smaller giant sequoias that grow nearby. The text reads, “The Largest Tree on Earth.” In front of you stands the General Sherman Tree. It's claim to fame is the biggest tree in the world comes from the volume of its trunk. A few other trees trunks are bigger around. Some trees are taller. But no other tree has more wood in its trunk and the Sherman tree. The Sherman Tree's top is dead, so the tree's trunk no longer gets taller. However, its volume keeps increasing. Each year the trunk grows wider, adding enough wood to equal another good-sized tree. Check out the life-sized \"footprint\" of the Sherman Tree's trunk on the ground behind you. It gives an idea of the trees girth -109 feet (33 m) around at the ground- and its irregular shape. Natural growth patterns and fire scars caused the uneven shape. Compare the fire scar on the tree (the same black scar visible behind the cavalry in the historic photo below) with the indentation the scar makes in the trunk's outline. A photo of the view. An inset black and white photo of a row of nine men on horseback, in cavalry uniform, posing in front of the tree. The horses face us. The massive trunk is the width of seven horses. High on the tree trunk, inside the scar, is a white sign that reads \"General Sherman\". The caption reads, “U.S. Cavalry guarded Sequoia National Park from 1891 until 1916, when the National Park Service came into existence. In 1879, pioneer cattlemen and former soldier James Wolverton named the tree \"General Sherman,\" after the leader he served under during the Civil War.",

The text reads, “There it is!” Across the open space before you stands the biggest tree on the planet, the General Sherman Tree. Some trees grow taller, and some are bigger around, but no tree has greater mass. The amount of space taken up by its trunk is greater than that of any other tree. From here you have an unusual view, because you can see the entire tree from bottom to top. Notice two characteristics of a monarch sequoia: The top is dead, so it's upward growth has stopped at 275 feet (84 m). It has a huge, cylindrical trunk, which makes it the world's largest tree by volume. As long as the sequoia tree lives its trunk thickens, gaining mass. Each year the General Sherman Tree's trunk gains enough new wood to equal a very large tree of most other species. A photo of the massive monarch in the winter, amongst smaller snow-covered trees, the reddish-brown trunk and branches above stand out. An icon of a camera. The caption reads, From this viewpoint you can photograph the Sherman tree from bottom to top. For similar views of other sequoia trees, visit one of Giant Forest's meadows. A photograph of a woman examining a piece of a large branch, about four feet in diameter, that is laying near the base of the General Sherman tree. Broken fencing and small branches are scattered in the snow on either side of the branch. If you walk around the General Sherman tree, you can touch this fallen branch. The text reads, The General Loses a Limb Look closely, the General Sherman Tree has changed since this photo (left) was taken. Can you spot the large limb in the photo that is now missing from the tree itself? This second largest branch on The Sherman Tree fell in January 2006. No one witnessed the crash. Thankfully, it crushed only some fencing and pavement (right).",

    "audioDescription": "The View: Two wide sequoia trees flank the path before you. Their trunks are only 10 feet apart. You can touch and compare the texture of the two. The tree on the left has a healed fire scar and the bark is soft. The right tree's trunk has a huge triangular dark fire scar about 20 feet tall and about 10 feet wide at the base. The scar is recessed about 4 feet deep into the trunk. A softer, shaggy bark has wrapped around the lower edges of the scar.<br /><br />The text reads,<br /><br />This pair of trees provides evidence that fire plays a natural role in the life of giant sequoias. In fact, most owe their lives to fire. The evidence lies not only in their obvious fire scars, but also because they may be twins. Centuries ago, they probably started life at the same time after a fire prepared the ground for them.<br /><br />Fire creates ideal conditions for sequoia seeds to germinate and for seedlings to grow. Heat rising from a fire dries overhanging cones, causing them to open. Cones then rain seeds onto fire-cleared, ash-fertilized ground - a perfect seedbed. Millions of sequoia seedlings sprout after a fire.<br /><br />Fire also kills many trees of other species that don't survive fire as well as sequoias. That helps sequoias by reducing competition for sunlight, water, and nutrients. Fire's heat may also kill soil fungus that could harm sequoia root. Groups of same aged sequoias like these tough twins are fairly common. Look for them as you explore the park's sequoia groves.<br /><br />A photo on the left shows the tree in view on the left, already described. The caption reads,<br /><br />Healed Fire Scar<br />Look for this scar near the base of one twin. The bark almost covers the scar now, insulating the wood from further fire damage.<br /><br />A photo on the right side of the panel shows the tree in view on the right. The caption reads,<br /><br />Open Fire Scar<br /><br />This scar is still charred and wood is exposed. If fire returns here soon, this scar may not have time to heal over, as did the scar on the opposite tree.<br /><br /><br />A photo shows a charred tree trunk with ash, fire and smoke around the base. Inset images show the growth of a sequoia. The text reads,<br /><br />Growth after fire.<br /><br />Most fires in the sequoia forest burn low to the ground. They are relatively cool, as fires go. Rarely hot enough to kill mature sequoias, they can still kill trees of thinner barked species.<br /><br />Sequoia seeds sprout best in a sunny, clear bed of ashes.<br /><br />Sequoia seedlings sprout by the thousands, but few survive.<br /><br />Saplings may be thinned by other fires.<br /><br />Centuries later, long- term survivors tower over the forest, providing seeds for the cycle to begin again.",

From here thanks to hardy trailbuilders in the park's early years, you can hike to the Sierra Nevada's highest peaks. <br /><br />In the 1920s Congress extended Sequoia National Park eastward from the sequoia groves to the crest of the Sierra Nevada. <br /><br />Superintendent John White knew that people needed access to the new park area. Rather than build roads, he envisioned a \"High Sierra Trail\" from the Giant Forest to Mount Whitney. <br /><br />For his trailbuilding project, White set forth two criteria: minimal damage to the land and as few ups and downs as possible. Despite the steep. rocky terrain, trail crews met his challenge. Using White's route, hikers today can travel from sequoia grove to Sierra crest with remarkable ease for such a rugged landscape. <br /><br />A quote by Park Superintendent John White,<br /><br />\"... the Kern Canyon and High Sierra area should be developed only as a trail park...the honk of the motor horn should never echo in [them}.\" <br /><br />A black and white photo of a woman standing with a horse, with a snow dappled mountainside behind her.

Next to her, is a pile of large rocks and a wooden sign on a post that reads, \"Sierra National Forest, Muir Pass Elevation 12,059 feet\" The caption reads,<br /><br /> Susan Thew in the high country<br /><br />The text below reads,<br /><br />Getting Involved<br /><br />When a debate began over whether the High Sierra should be added to Sequoia National Park, a local woman took action, Susan Thew hired a photographer and set off into the mountains.

Notice a mosaic of live trees and shrubs, patches of fire-killed vegetation, and other areas where only bare, blackened ground remains. As time passes new plants will sprout in most of these bare areas. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{dcf0a411-465b-42c8-b913-94f90bb6c519}{184}\" paraid=\"957073885\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">These different burn  patterns resulted from a variety of fire behavior (or how the fire burned). In places, light upcanyon winds may have pushed the fire cross-slope or it may have backed down the hillside at lower intensity. Further upcanyon, areas with no vegetation and exposed rock are places where flammable shrubs burned at higher intensity. Look on the slope below the pullout for a buckeye tree re-sprouting from its base and other plant re-growth.  </p> <h4>Poison Oak</h4> <p>Beware the three-leaved plant that grows here! Touching it can cause an intensely itchy rash. Even in winter when twigs are bare, oils from this plant can transfer from the plant to hands, clothing, and anything that touches it.</p> <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "You are in the foothills area. Around you are gently sloping hills covered with grasses, low shrubs, and small trees. On the uphill side of the road, about 20 feet away is a very large rock that spans across two boulders, creating a tunnel. The rock is about the size of a small house, and shaped roughly like a jelly bean, lying on its side. It is mostly pale grey in color, with some reddish color and some dark grey patches underneath. Remnants of a highway with a painted yellow line in the center are beneath the rock, showing that cars actually drove through this tunnel at one time. Today there is a path where you can walk through it.<br />The path to tunnel rock is strewn with a few small boulders, to keep out cars. Once you are past the boulders, you can easily walk through the tunnel. It is about 20 feet wide, and the top of the tunnel angles from about 10 to about 15 feet in height. <br /><br />You can feel the boulders around the entrance and on both sides of the tunnel. The base of the boulders has been reinforced with stones and cement, for safety. Once inside, on the side closest to the road, you might be able to touch the ceiling, if you are tall, and jump.<br /><br />In front of the boulders is a metal sign with an illustration of a sequoia cone. It reads,<br />Tunnel Rock",

One of the photos features a dogwood flower and its caption reads, “Pacific dogwoods usually flower twice each year, in both spring and fall.” The second photograph features a small, compound red and black-tipped berry on a background of green foliage. Its caption reads, “The dogwood’s showy reddish-orange seed clusters provide a feast for songbirds.” The main text of the exhibit panel reads, “The Pacific dogwood’s leaves are extravagantly large for trees that grow where summers are dry. These wide leaves use much more water than a conifer’s small, waxy needles. But near this mountain meadow, the water they need is available. The melting winter snowpack provides water in spring and early summer. Long taproots help dogwoods access water deep in the soil when the snow is gone. Pacific dogwoods rely on cool temperatures to keep their leaves from losing too much water. Their leaves hang downward to shade the trunk and branches. If an opening in the canopy allows too much sunlight to hit the trunk, the sunlight stimulates the growth of new leaves to provide more shade.”",

The tops of the trees are not visible. One of the trunks is overlaid with three square illustrations. Each shows a sequoia tree with arrows pointing at either side the trunk, and text explaining the height and trunk width at each position, and asking you to imagine yourself there. The panels are harder to read as they get farther up the tree trunk. The lowest one clearly reads, <br /><br />40 feet (or 12 m) up Sentinel Tree.<br />15 ft. (or 4.6 m) thick<br /><br />On the next higher square, one can read the words,<br /><br />60 feet (or 18 m) up Sentinel Tree.<br /><br />On the next only the number 80 is visible.<br /> <br />The wayside exhibit text reads,<br /><br />Want to Climb a Sequoia?<br /><br />You can't climb a real sequoia tree, but you can, perhaps, get a sense of it. Look up at the Sentinel Tree, the large sequoia to your left. Then explore the \"ruler\" that stretches before you on the pavement. The ruler is as long as the Sentinel Tree is tall. A shorter ruler crosses the plaza to show the tree's width at its base. As you \"climb\" the ruler, markers tell the height and diameter of the tree at that point.<br /><br />Sequoia trunks remain thick far up the tree. This differs from most other conifers, whose trunks taper to a point. The sequoia's columnar shape provides the huge bulk for which sequoia trees are famous.",

    "audioDescription": "The View: To the right of this wayside exhibit, you can touch the trunk of the fallen giant sequoia. It is near the bottom of the accessible trail, about 20 feet after the pavement changes from concrete to a wooden walkway. A tunnel about six feet tall by six feet wide is carved through the log. Inside, on the right, you can feel a deep hole in the center of the trunk. Deep curved cracks with smaller cracks appear along the tunnel \"walls,\" along with illegally carved names and initials. There are areas on the tunnel wall that are blackened. <br /><br />At the base of the fallen tree trunk, a root ball stretches up about 20 feet. <br />The text reads,<br /><br />What brought this huge tree to earth? Ironically, a tree's own size can contribute to its downfall. If the tree starts to become unbalanced, it's weight quickly becomes more than its shallow roots can support. <br />Sequoias may lose their balance for one or more reasons: road building, underground pipes, or soil fungi can damage roots that hold trees upright. If soil moisture increases, the ground may soften too much to hold the tree. Heavy snows or high winds can cause a tree to lean. Large fire scars at the base of the trunk may leave trees last to stand on.<br /><br />Sometimes sequoias fall for no apparent reason. First, some unknown factor can cause the tree to lean. Then, gravity and the great mass of the trunk eventually bring the tree down. When and why this sequoia fell are not known.<br /><br />A black and white photo of the fallen sequoia before you, the giant trunk lying on the ground. The caption reads,<br /><br />This fallen sequoia might lie here for decades, maybe centuries. Chemicals in the woods, called tannins, resist insects and rot. The same traits that enable the tree to survive for so long now enabled the log to linger after death.<br /><br />Photos of three famous fallen sequoias. The Auto log with a white mini van parked on the cutout area. The caption reads,<br /><br />Auto log fell in 1917. Closed to vehicles in 2002 due to rot. Sequoias do decompose eventually.<br /><br />The Tunnel log with a car driving through the tunnel. The caption reads,<br /><br />Tunnel log. Fell in 1937.<br /><br />Tharp's Log, a wooden plank cabin with a stone fireplace that's built onto the hollow end of a fallen sequoia. The caption reads,<br /><br />Tharp's log. Date of fall unknown. It had already fallen by 1858.<br /> <br />A photo of a woman looking up at a tree's roots that are five times her height. The caption reads,<br />Buttress tree. Fell in 1959<br />The text reads,<br /><br />Most sequoias fall uphill. Why?<br /><br />When branches and cones fall from trees, they tend to slide downhill until they hit a tree trunk. Also, fire tends to linger on the uphill side of trees due to air currents. Over the course of repeated fires, large scars may develop there. Later, when something causes the trees to fall, it often topples in the direction of the scar.<br /><br />As you explore, look for fire scars. Are they on the uphill side of the trees? Check out fallen sequoias. Which direction did they fall?",

Today, particulate pollution--tiny bits of dust and chemicals-more commonly blurs this scene. What's changed? People now limit the spread of most fires. However, many more vehicles, industries, and agricultural processes are producing particulates.<br /><br />But not all pollution can be seen. Formed from vehicle exhaust and common volatile fumes, ozone by itself leaves views clear. Yet it damages plants and animals, especially along air drainages. The good news: despite population growth, ozone has not increased much. Our efforts can make a difference.<br /><br />A map of the wind pattern over the California coast and the San Joaquin Valley. The wind stream enters from the Pacific Ocean at the San Francisco Bay area, then divides into northern and southern streams, with a long curl that moves circles into Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.

    "audioDescription": "This outdoor exhibit panel is titled, \"When Sequoias Fall\" and features two photos and an illustration, and includes a caption and text about giant sequoias and thimbleberries. The main photo features an uprooted and overturned sequoia, which rests on its side. The butt end of the log is full of crevices that harbor mosses. In the background are immature fir trees. The text reads, “Giant sequoias have an exceptionally long life but will eventually fall. Wet soil of mountain meadows provides little support for tree roots. The logs of sequoias and other trees are a common sight around the edges of meadows. Sequoias are especially vulnerable because of their shallow root system. When a tree falls, it creates a new opening that spans the tree canopy to the forest floor. Sunlight fills this space, enriching surrounding trees with extra sunlight. A clear and sunny location offers space for understory plants to grow. Eventually, new trees will reach upward here, filling in the opening.” To the right of the main photo is a photo of a green thimbleberry plant with white blossoms. Next to it is a close-up illustration of thimbleberry leaves and a red fruit that resembles a raspberry. The photo caption reads, “Thimbleberries” , “When space opens up in a sequoia grove, thimbleberries are ready to grow. Their durable seeds last for years underground. When a tree falls, the new patch of sunlight stimulates sprouting. Under the upturned tree roots, exposed bare soil creates an ideal seedbed.”",

    "audioDescription": "This outdoor exhibit panel is titled, \"Winter Wildlife\" and features a photo and two illustrations with captions, and text about wildlife. A photograph features a brown-phased pine marten standing atop a heavily trafficked path on the snow. The photograph’s caption reads, “Pine martens travel easily through snow and stay active through winter. They walk lightly on the surface without sinking, or use tunnels to move below the snowpack.” The main text reads, “In summer, if you walk carefully and quietly, you’ll find a huge variety of animals here. They range from large mammals like black bears and deer to the tiniest insects. When weather is warm, food is abundant and animals fatten up to prepare for cold weather. As you walk, listen for bird calls, buzzing insects, and other signs of this active community. Frigid temperatures and a deep snowpack quiet this forest in winter, but wildlife is still plentiful. Each species has a strategy to survive the cold months when food is scarce. Some are active beneath the snow’s surface, where temperatures are more stable. Others rest quietly through winter, using food reserves they gathered in warmer months. A few move to warmer locations and return when conditions are less demanding.” To the right of the main photo are two color illustrations. The first is a drawing of a yellow-colored pale swallowtail butterfly with its wings expanded and a green pale swallowtail chrysalis attached to a piece of wood. The illustration caption reads, “Pale swallowtail butterflies spend winter inside their chrysalis and then emerge as adults in spring. Like many insects, the adults die off in fall after reproducing. Their young live through winter as pupae, making the transformation from caterpillars to butterflies.” The second illustration is of a brown water boatmen in an underwater scene. The caption below it reads, “Other insects live through winter as adults. Some hibernate, and some simply slow down. Water boatmen live under the ice in streams and ponds. They slowly “row” through the frigid water, searching for air bubbles, and then rest on the bottom until they need more air.”",

The Lakes Trail leads to Heather Lake, Emerald Lake, and Pear Lake. The challenging Alta Trail, which climbs more than 4,000 feet in elevation over 12.8 miles (20 kilometers) to the summit of Alta Peak, has some spectacular views. Or go as far as Panther Gap 4 miles, (6.4 kilometers) for a good look at the Great Western Divide. The Watchtower portion of the Lakes Trail leads you along the ridge overlooking Lodgepole, the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River, and Tokopah Falls. This stretch of trail is extremely treacherous if any snow or ice is present; if icy or snowy conditions are present, always choose the Hump Trail instead.<br /> <br /> For a much easier hike, try the Wolverton Meadow Loop which circles a wetland. On this trail, you must usually make two easy stream crossings; however, early in the season the water can be high. Wolverton Meadow is an excellent place to view black bears in the late spring and early summer. They are often seen feeding in the meadows. The meadow's wildflowers change throughout the season, so taking this hike in June is a different experience than in August or May. Keep an eye out for pine martens, relatives of the weasel that live high in the branches of pine trees and are relatively common here. They are shy of people and hide well, so you have to stop for a while and search for them.</p> <h4>Sled Safely</h4> <p>Every winter, people get hurt badly while sledding in the park. <strong>The most common reason people get hurt is they sled when conditions are bad (icy snow, rock or tree hazards exposed, poor visibility), so if the snow isn't great or you can't see, don't sled! </strong>Don’t let an accident ruin your winter fun.</p> <ul> <li>When sledding, slide feet first.</li> <li>Consider wearing a helmet.</li> <li>Make sure your path is clear. Don’t slide near rocks, trees, branches, or other people.</li> <li>After sliding, look uphill. Move out of the way of people coming downhill after you.</li> <li>Don’t slide into roads or parking lots.</li> <li>Avoid hard-packed snow or ice, where speed and direction get out of control.</li> <li>Sliding devices that can be steered may be safer than others.</li> </ul> <p>In an emergency, contact a ranger or call 911.</p>",

Walk a few hours, or hike farther into a glorious wilderness ruled by elevation and climate. Like most park trails, these lead into designated wilderness. One of the highest forms of protection for public lands, wilderness preserves untamed landscapes for you to experience. Possible destinations include: Via Woods Creek Trail. A photo of a cascading waterfall, surging through rocks. The caption reads, Mist falls. 3.9 miles (or 6.3 km) one way. Elevation: 5,840 feet (or 1780 m). As the name suggests, mist from this powerful cascade surrounds the area of the falls. The trail and nearby rocks can be slippery here, especially in early summer when the river is at its peak flow. Be extremely careful. Via Bubbs Creek Trail, A photo of a pass through a rocky ridge, with a rounded crag to the left, and a pointed steep crag to its right. Low shrubs and a few conifer trees dot the landscape. The caption reads, Sphinx Creek. 4.1 miles (or 6.6 km) one way. Elevation: 6,240 feet (or 1902 m). Towering over the canyon floor, the Sphinx evokes images of Egypt's giant statues. John Muir named the formation in the later 1800s. A map shows the location of the Woods Creek and Bubbs Creek Trailhead. The bottom photo shows a hillside of large foxtail pines, with a snow-covered mountain range in the distance. The caption reads, Above Vidette Meadow, A quote by Shel Silverstein, \"There is a place where the sidewalk ends...\"",

    "audioDescription": "You are standing near an accessible trail that leads across a bridge surrounded by conifer trees and rocky canyon walls on either side. From the bridge, the South Fork of the Kings River may be seen and heard. It may even be possible to feel the spray from the river when the water is high in spring. By fall or during a drought, it may be a meandering, thin flow, as shallow as two feet deep, scattered with branches and tree trunks, looking more like a stream than a river. In spring thaw after a winter with very heavy snowfall, it may be wide and deep, filling much of the meadow, and even covering the trail! Just beyond the bridge are steep rocky cliffs, with loose piles of boulders near the base. The trail here becomes much more rugged and rocky. Growing in patches amid those boulders are conifer trees, willows, and other deciduous trees and shrubs. The mountain slopes at the far end of the meadow are also steep and rocky, with conifer trees growing on top and where the slopes are less steep.",

    "audioDescription": "This trailhead orientation panel shows photos and accessibility information for Zumwalt Meadow Trail. A photo of a partially shaded wooden deck with two benches, about 20 feet apart, facing each other. Just beyond this seating area is a green meadow, lined with conifer trees and towering granite cliffs in the background. The text reads, Accessibility Information This trail follows the Kings River to Zumwalt Meadow, a lush meadow surrounded by steep granite cliffs. The loop trail is 1.5 miles, but only the first portion is designated as accessible to people in wheelchairs. A photo of a wooden planked bridge, with railings, suspended over a river. There is a conifer forest on the banks of both sides of the river. On either end of the bridge are support towers, about 15 feet high, that straddle the width of the bridge. They are made of open metal framing, so people can walk right under them. A thick cable on each side connects these towers across the river, curving down toward the center of the bridge. Additional cables stretch downward, connecting the curved overhead cable to the bridge. A hiker crosses the bridge from one side of the forested area to the other. The text reads, Along the river side of the meadow, the trail is nearly level, with very little elevation gain and cross slope. The trail begins on a hard-packed surface, then crosses a bridge with a wooden plank surface. Beyond the bridge, a side trail provides easy access to a sandy beach along the river. The main trail continues on a wooden boardwalk to the meadow, and then on a hard-packed surface to Road's End.",

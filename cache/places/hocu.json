    "bodyText": "American Indian cultures in this area are deeply rooted in the woodlands of the Eastern Temperate Forest. Native people managed and cultivated the environment surrounding Ohio Hopewell earthworks using a deep body of traditional ecological knowledge. For thousands of years, people harvested hickory nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, and acorns as staple foods. Fruits and berries including grapes, honey locust, hackberry, elderberry, and mulberry were plentiful in the bottomland forests. White-tailed deer was the most important animal food, followed by other small mammals, mussels, fish, turtles, and birds. Turkey, ducks, and geese were the most common birds eaten. Flint-tipped darts launched with a spearthrower (\"atlatl\") were the main hunting gear; the bow and arrow was not adopted until after the Hopewell episode. The earthwork builders were farmers as well: they grew crops including acorn and crookneck squashes, sunflowers, sumpweed, goosefoot, maygrass, little barley, erect knotweed, and tobacco. The earthwork builders lived their daily lives in small sedentary settlements dispersed around the ceremonial earthwork centers. Houses were covered with watertight bark harvested from the forest. People managed the forests using fire and tree girdling to increase nut and fruit production, and to improve habitat for game animals.",

They used a tool called a magnetometer that can \"see beneath the soil\" and produce a map showing where ancient people disturbed the soil by digging, or where fires for cooking or heating once burned. Near this location, the magnetometer detected a series of disturbances spaced at 20-foot intervals, following the inside edge of the circular earthwork. Archaeologists excavated one of these disturbances and found a large pit where a gigantic timber post once stood, probably two feet in diameter and 20 feet tall. Imagine more than 150 of these spaced out all around the circle! Evidence is mounting that these earthen landscapes were also full of monumental wooden architecture.",

Principally, they are composed of a 20-acre circle joined to an irregular, 20-acre square with sides over 900 feet in length. The circle's diameter is 1,054 feet, a dimension shared by several other circular enclosures in Ohio. There were two smaller circles on the higher ground along the square’s eastern edge, and a pair of 2,400-foot-long parallel walls headed southwest, perfectly framing a vista of the winter solstice sunset. Importantly, the earthwork walls were not mere berms of earth, but carefully designed arrangements of specific sediments chosen for particular qualities. Red and yellow sediments were the primary building materials selected for Hopeton's walls. With only limited exception, red sediments were placed on the exterior of the embankment walls while yellow sediments were placed on the interior. You'll see an example of this at Stop 9 along the southern wall of the square. ",

    "bodyText": "<p>Are you ready to step back in time over 2,000 years ago to experience a prehistoric culture that created enormous earthen monuments and crafted intricate artwork out of exotic natural materials that paid homage to their own? Well, you won’t need to arrange a trip to the ancient pyramids of Egypt or the preserved ruins of the Roman Empire in Italy. Look no farther than the heartland of the United States; Ohio. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hocu/index.htm\">Hopewell Culture National Historical Park</a> protects the remains of a dynamic social and ceremonial phenomenon that once flourished in the woodlands of eastern North America.<br /> <br /> Long before the first Europeans ever set foot on the continent, American Indians were constructing earthen mounds and embankments that enclosed hundreds of acres of land throughout the south-central Ohio area. Burial mounds to mark the locations of their dead and earthworks formed into huge geometric patterns, like circles, squares, and octagons, were the signatures of this ancient culture. The people now known as the Hopewell built these ceremonial places and gathered at them for feasts, funerals, and rites of passage.<br /> <br /> When you come to the park’s visitor center at Mound City Group, you walk in the footprints of American Indians who constructed these sites from about 200 B.C. to A.D. 500. As you walk among the burial mounds, you can read about their significance and what was discovered by archeologists who tell us the story through their research. Taking a tour inside the visitor center, you’ll witness pieces of ancient, priceless artwork crafted by American Indian hands. Effigy birds crafted from copper brought from the Lake Superior region, earspools made of silver from southern Ontario, and a spear point blade fabricated from obsidian brought from Wyoming, more than 2,000 miles away!<br /> <br /> As your tour at the Mound City Group comes to an end, journeying to the park’s other sites will leave you equally astounded and in awe of the accomplishments of the Hopewell culture. The grand scale of the geometric earthworks is enough to tire out visitors, figuratively and literally. Trails at each of the park’s sites will take you on journeys that will have you counting your steps in miles, not feet. A small jaunt at any of the sites is enough to make us appreciate the engineering, manpower, and skill involved in creating these ancient monuments.<br /> <br /> Located in Chillicothe, Ohio, the park’s visitor center at Mound City Group offers an award-winning 19-minute orientation film and a world-class museum filled with exquisite artifacts that are over 2,000 years old. The park is less than 60 miles south of Ohio’s capital, Columbus, and is only 77 miles southeast of Dayton and 105 miles northeast of Cincinnati.

Native people built more than two dozen huge geometric earthworks within about 25 miles of modern-day Chillicothe, Ohio, nearly 2000 years ago. Extraordinary earthworks were also built in the Great and Little Miami valleys west of here (including Fort Ancient), and in the Muskingum watershed to the northeast (including the Newark Earthworks). But this area in the central Scioto River valley stands above all others in the number, size, and variety of ancient earthworks built here. <br /> <br /> \"Hopewell\" is not the name of any American Indian tribe. We don't know what the people who built the earthworks called themselves. In part, this is because American Indians suffered disease and warfare brought by Euroamerican colonists, and much knowledge and wisdom was lost along with many lives. By 1843, the United States government had forcibly removed all the Tribal Nations from their Ohio homelands to reservations west of the Mississippi River. <br /> <br /> The first scientific archeological investigations of the Ohio earthworks took place in this vacuum, without the participation of Indigenous peoples. One of these early excavations took place on a farm owned by a man named M. Cloud Hopewell. The geometric earthworks and the artifacts discovered on Mr. Hopewell's farm were so distinctive and characteristic, that archeologists assigned the name \"Hopewell Culture\" to the earthwork builders. ",

Mound City Group’s walls enclose at least two dozen mounds in an area larger than ten football fields. Never the less, compared to the many giant complexes located around the Chillicothe area, Mound City Group is a relatively small Hopewell earthwork. This wondrous site remains revered and spiritual to many.<br /> <br /> This site features the park's only visitor center. It is located at at 16062 State Route 104, Chillicothe, OH 45601. Visitor center hours are 9:00 am to 4:00 pm, every day of the week (except Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day & New Year’s Day). Park grounds are open every day of the year from dawn until dusk.<br /> <br /> Please be mindful that Mound City Group is still considered a sacred place by many people, so we ask all visitors to treat the earthworks with respect. There are no trails within the enclosure. Visitors are welcome to stroll reverently amongst the mounds. Please, <u><strong>do not walk on</strong></u> the mounds or earthen walls. Park trails include a nature trail and a beautiful paved river walk along the Scioto River. The nature trail winds through a young forest and passes masonry stones from a lock of the Ohio-Erie Canal that ran along the west border of the park in the 1800’s. Facilities in the visitor center include restrooms, a small <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/hocu/learn/bookstore.htm\">gift shop</a>, an auditorium and a musuem (temporarily unavailable).

Grasslands such as these used to cover much of the Midwest, including some areas of Ohio. Warm-season refers to the fact that these grasses and flowers go to seed later in the summer than conventional hay fields, with peak bloom times in June and July. Why is the park maintaining these grasslands? Grasses were chosen to protect underground archeological resources by preventing erosion. Native warm-season grasslands in this region have greatly decreased over the years due to development and land use change. Grassland nesting birds and pollinators have consequently declined with this habitat loss. The park is working to provide habitat refuges for these and other wildlife species that utilize the food sources and space of these grasslands. ",

Indeed, an 1848 description provided that these walls \"resemble the heavy grading of a railway, and are broad enough, on the top, to admit the passage of a coach.\" The circle was slight in comparison, measuring only five feet tall, though it is still one of the region's largest monumental undertakings! Non-Native settlers showed little respect for the earthworks and most were used as agricultural fields beginning in the 19th century. Remnants of both the circular and square embankments are still visible, though many years of plowing have reduced them to only a few feet in height.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "The hills you see in the distance are the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The hills are made of sedimentary sandstones and shales laid down more than 325 million years ago during the Devonian and Mississippian geologic periods when this part of the Earth was covered by shallow seas (DMu: Berea Sandstone; Do: Ohio-Olentangy Shale). Later, the hills were pushed up when the tectonic plates underlying the African and North American continents collided (the Alleghanian orogeny, 325-260 million years ago). Those mountain-building events took place long before humans walked the earth. <br /> <br /> 18,000 years ago, the spot where you are standing here at Stop 3 would have been covered by glacial ice. The ice even covered some of the hills on the western horizon. A warming trend caused the glacier to retreat northward leaving behind loamy soils on the distant hilltops (Wg2: Caesar Till/Lattaville Moraine). The meltwaters also carried sands and gravels here to form the landform you are standing on (Wok: Kingston Outwash terrace). After a brief re-advance about 17,200 years ago, the glaciers resumed their retreat and the meltwaters cut down into the Kingston Outwash and formed the wide, flat terrace below you (Woc: Circleville Outwash terrace). The Scioto River has been meandering across the modern floodplain since the end of the last Ice Age, about 11,600 years ago (Qal: Alluvium). We know American Indians were here at least 10,000 years ago because archeologists found flint knives and dart points of that age in the fields below you.<br /> <br /> 2,000 years ago, American Indians chose these glacial outwash terraces to build their largest geometric earthworks. Just below you are the conjoined circle, square, and parallel walls of the Hopeton Earthworks. Just across the river to the west, on the same terrace, is the Mound City Group earthworks with at least 25 mounds surrounded by an earthen wall and eight dug holes. Other large earthworks are found on outwash terraces both upstream and downstream from here. The ancient architects chose these broad, flat, well-drained and flood-free landforms as building sites for their greatest monuments.<br /> <br /> Today, these glacial outwash terraces are valuable sources of sand and gravel for the construction industry. Ohio ranks among the top ten producers in the country. You can see an active mine in the distance just beyond the Hopeton Earthworks. When that mine opened in the 1970s it threatened to destroy the earthworks. Local people started a movement to protect the earthworks, and Congress designated Hopeton Earthworks as a national park in 1980.",

    "bodyText": "You are about to discover a little-known wonder of the ancient world. Hopeton Earthworks is one of five Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks managed by the National Park Service near Chillicothe, Ohio. These earthworks were recently recently nominated to the World Heritage List along with two other Ohio earthworks managed by the Ohio History Connection: Fort Ancient and Newark Earthworks. These American Indian monuments will be recognized as masterpieces of human creative genius, alongside Stonehenge, the Pyramids of Egypt, and the Great Wall of China. If you're not familiar with these amazing earthworks, you're not alone!<br /> <br /> Read on as Chief Glenna J. Wallace of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma tells the story of her first encounter with the Ohio earthworks, and invites us to join her in a journey of discovery:<br /> <br /> \"I am a world traveler, having journeyed to many impressive sites in more than seventy countries. Ohio is one of the ancestral homes of the Shawnee people, who came from the east and lived in the Ohio Valley for three hundred years – long before American settlement. The first time I saw the Hopewell earthworks in Newark, I experienced a shock of disbelief. I had never heard of any of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks! Yet, there before me lay an extensive, intricate array of earthen walls and landscapes - earthworks built by Native Americans nearly two thousand years ago, carrying one basketful at a time. These places embody precision and beauty, containing mathematical complexities in their design and astronomical alignments to the sky.<br /> <br /> My Shawnee ancestors protected and preserved them so we can appreciate them today. The day I first visited Newark, I made a commitment to learn all I could about all of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, to teach others about them, and to preserve them. Join me!\"<br />  ",

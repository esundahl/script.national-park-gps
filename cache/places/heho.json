The building is painted eggshell white with reddish-brown trim around the windows and doors. A single brick chimney juts up from the center of the steeply pitched roof. An open porch stretches across the front of the main structure, with four thin, square columns holding up the porch’s moss-covered roof. Between the columns, the porch is adorned with three delicate wooden arches painted to match the eggshell hue of the house. Ornately carved brackets, also painted to match, trim the top of the brown-painted columns. In the yard on the left is an antique metal water pump with a long, curved handle. Two tall trees stand at the front corners of the building’s grassy lot.

    "bodyText": "<blockquote> <p>\"This cottage where I was born is physical proof of the unbounded opportunity of American life.\"</p> <p>Herbert Hoover</p> </blockquote> <p>In the years following his presidency, Herbert and Lou Hoover restored the president's humble birthplace, which he called, \"physical proof of the unbounded opportunity of American life.\" The small space and few material possessions reflect an ethic of thrift. The cottage was a typical starter home for a young late 19th century family. Antique furnishings represent common household items of a simply furnished two room rural home.</p> <h2>Family Of Five</h2> <p>In 1871, Jesse Hoover and his father Eli built this two-room cottage across the street from Jesse's blacksmith shop. Jesse and his wife Hulda moved in with their young son Theodore. Herbert Hoover was born here on August 10, 1874. When \"Bertie\" was two his sister Mary was born.</p> <h2>A Starter Home</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover lived here only until he was three and half years old. This was the Hoovers' first home, and although it was small it served the young family well. As Jesse prospered, the family moved to a larger, two-story house about one block south of here.</p> <h2>Two Rooms Inside</h2> <p>One room served as a bedroom for the two adults and three children, the other as a combination living room, dining room, and kitchen. In the winter, a wood-burning cook stove did double-duty inside the main room as the home's heater but during the warm months the Hoovers moved it to the back porch, which became a summer kitchen.</p> <h2>Construction</h2> <p>The home's large foundation stones came by wagon from the open prairie to the west. Timber for the board and batten cottage followed the Mississippi River from northern forests to sawmills in Muscatine, and then overland 40 miles by ox teams to West Branch. Strips of cotton fabric stuffed between the seams insulated the house. The small twelve-paned windows reduced the heat escaping the cottage.</p> <h2>After The Hoovers</h2> <p>The Hoover family lived in the cottage only until Herbert was three years old. Several families owned and occupied the cottage after the Hoovers moved out in 1878. The Scellers family, who lived there from 1890 until 1934, moved a two-story frame house onto the cottage lot. They moved and attached the cottage to the back of the two-story house, where they used it as a kitchen and dining room.</p> <h2>Tourist Attraction</h2> <p>As Hoover's fame spread people became interested in visiting his birthplace. Mrs. Scellers came to enjoy meeting visitors and showing them through her house. Her guest register showed that Herbert Hoover was especially popular with visitors from abroad. These people spoke of their great respect for the man who had done so much to alleviate suffering in their homelands during and after World War I.</p> <h2>Return Of The Hoovers</h2> <p>Even before Herbert Hoover's election to the Presidency in 1928, his wife Lou Henry Hoover tried to purchase the Birthplace Cottage to return ownership to the family. The Hoovers reacquired the cottage in 1935, the year after Mrs. Scellers died.</p> <h2>Restoration</h2> <p>Although previous owners had altered the two-room cottage, they never moved off of the property. Restoration began in the summer of 1938 with the removal of the two-story addition from 1890. Then the Birthplace Cottage was re-positioned 90 degrees to the south, so that its front door would once again face Downey Street.</p> <h2>\"Memories of a Little House\"</h2> <p>Lou Henry Hoover relied on the recollection of various family members, including Herbert's older brother, Theodore. She turned those stories into a manuscript called \"Memories of a Little House,\" which guided the restoration and furnishing of the historic house.</p> <h2>Furnishings</h2> <p>Since most of the original furnishings were unavailable, the family decorated the cottage with period pieces they felt best represented the home in which the Hoover family lived.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Birthplace Cottage 290 words Birthplace Cottage, 1 ¾ minute. First of two descriptions at this location. Herbert Hoover’s birthplace is a one-story wooden house with a grey shingled roof that angles up sharply from the façade. A single brick chimney emerges from the peak. The exterior is painted white, and a central doorway is flanked by two 12 paned rectangular windows. The house faces east and is about 20 feet wide across the front. A white picket fence surrounds the house and yard on the north and east sides. A sign 11 inches wide and 3.5 inches tall hangs on the white picket fence left of the entrance gate. When the cottage is open to the public, the sign reads \"open.” Another sign five inches wide by 12 inches tall, titled “Birthplace Cottage,” hangs on the right gatepost. The sign is described following this message. From other messages you can hear descriptions of the birthplace’s interior, back porch, and yard. A wooden walkway leads from the main boardwalk to the front door through a gate in the east side of the fence. The walkway is approximately 20 feet long. Watch your step, as the walkway drops off a couple inches on either side to the grass lawn. A flower bed to the left of the walkway adds color to the lawn in the spring and summer. As you reach the cottage, there are two steps up to a tiny porch just 4 feet wide and 3 feet deep. The porch is covered by a red wooden awning, and leafy vines climb white wooden latticework on either side. Once on the porch, you’ll have to step up another inch or two at the threshold to enter the house. End of message. Birthplace Cottage – Sign 147 words Sign: \"Birthplace Cottage.\" 50 seconds. Second of two descriptions at this location. The sign identifies the birthplace of Herbert Hoover. A sign 12 inches wide by five inches tall hangs on the right gatepost. Beneath the title “Birthplace Cottage,” an image shows Herbert Hoover as a baby, wearing an infant's gown with long sleeves and decorative trim on the cuffs and hem. A caption reads: \"Herbert Hoover circa 1875.\" A quote from Herbert Hoover appears below the image of the baby: \"This cottage where I was born is physical proof of the unbounded opportunity of American life. In no other land could a boy from a country village, without inheritance or influential friends, look forward with unbounded hope.\" A note at the bottom of the sign states: \"President and Mrs. Hoover purchased and restored the cottage in the 1930s.\" End of message.",

This became the summer kitchen. The porch and summer kitchen may have served several other purposes over time, a woodshed, store room, and spare bedroom. It was here, in the dark of night on August 10, 1874, that blacksmith shop assistant, Elwood King was awakened to go and fetch the doctor. Around midnight, Herbert Clark Hoover was born.</p> <h3>Vegetable Garden & Flower Beds</h3> <p>Hulda grew her vegetable garden behind the cottage, while flower gardens of marigolds, peonies, and snapdragons filled the front and side yards. And just like today, seeds, cuttings and bulbs, were traded with family and friends. The dark red double-petaled tulips that once grew here came from the bulbs Hulda's mother had brought with her from Canada.</p> <h3>Water</h3> <p>Near the southwest corner of the back porch was a wooden pump, and dangling from it a gourd dipper. Beneath the pump spout was a wooden tub. For soft water, they dipped from a rain barrel, positioned to catch the run-off from the roof. For watering the garden and washing, they filled a wooden tub with water pumped from a cistern in their backyard. Nearby was the drain into which Hulda Hoover poured her dishwater. For drinking water, the Hoovers went one block north to the town pump in the middle of the intersection of Downey and Main Streets.</p> <h3>Privy</h3> <p>The Hoovers placed their privy, probably a two-holer, in the corner of the lot away from the cistern but convenient to both the house and the blacksmith shop.</p> <h3>Cellar</h3> <p>A cellar under the cottage stored vegetables and other foods below the winter's frost. According to Lou Hoover's research, \"In such a tiny house the cellar door was a necessity outside, demanding the throwing of shawl over head and shoulders, as one ran to it from the back door of the kitchen on a freezing day.\"</p> <h3>Chicken House</h3> <p>The Hoovers kept a chicken house for fresh eggs near the rear of the lot.</p>",

The back porch of the Birthplace Cottage is twelve feet wide and six feet deep. It's empty except for a rack of firewood to your left as you exit the back door. Hinges also stick up from a hatch door in the porch floor, so watch your step. To your right as you exit is the summer kitchen-a small room stocked with pots, pans, and other cooking implements. In the summer, a Plexiglas partition blocks the lower half of the doorway to the summer kitchen; in the winter, a Plexiglas partition covers the entire doorway.<br /><br />The porch sits about a foot-and-a-half off the ground, but a wooden ramp begins directly opposite the back door and leads down to the right, eventually connecting with the main boardwalk near the blacksmith shop. <br /><br />The backyard also has several items of interest. If you face straight ahead as you exit the cottage, a wooden privy will be about 50 feet away and a little to the right, at roughly one o'clock on the clock face. It's painted white, and a crescent moon is carved into its narrow door. At nine o'clock, directly to your left, about 20 feet away are two wooden posts with two clotheslines strung between them. At ten o'clock on the clock face, ten feet to your left, a black water pump stands on a low wooden platform. Just beyond it is a vegetable garden on a rectangular plot of land about 10 feet by 20 feet. At approximately eleven o'clock, several hundred feet in the distance, an American flag flies at the gravesite of President and Mrs. Hoover.<br /><br />End of message.",

    "audioDescription": "Birthplace Cottage Main Room 239 words Birthplace Cottage Main Room. 1 ½ minute. First of two descriptions at this location. When you enter the birthplace, you will be in its main room. Inside the Birthplace Cottage, you’ll find wooden walls painted white, and an 8-foot wooden-beamed ceiling, also painted white. A rag rug covers the floor, thinly striped in faded tones of many colors. Low barriers separate you from the furnishings but allow passage through the house. An exhibit panel mounted on the barrier, described in the following message, tells about the furnishings. The main room is furnished with a settee, dry sink, cupboard, pie safe, a few simple wooden chairs including a highchair, and a drop-leaf table. A kerosene lamp, sundry kitchen items, clock, and books are among the meager possessions on display. Some children’s blocks and a small wood pull-horse on wheels are the only toys. The bedroom is on the left as you enter through the front door. A barrier blocks the lower half of the doorway to the bedroom. The bedroom and its furnishings are described in a separate message. There are five windows located around the room, and a door directly opposite the front door that leads to the back porch. Inside the front and back doors are signs that read “Exit - Please Close the Door.” Mind the short step down from the threshold when exiting through the back door. End of message. Tight and Cozy 215 words Panel: “Tight and Cozy.” 1 ½ minutes. Second of two descriptions at this location. The panel describes the historic furnishings of Herbert Hoover’s birthplace. In the main living space, a panel that is 24 inches wide and 6 inches tall angles atop the plexiglass barrier. The panel's title, “Tight and Cozy,” appears at the top left, above text that reads: “With two adults and three children, the Hoovers did not have much room for furnishings. And they had even less room in the winter when they brought the woodstove inside from the summer kitchen on the back porch. The porch also may have served as a woodshed, storeroom, and spare bedroom.” To the right of the text, a color photograph from 1987 offers a wintertime view of the main living space with a woodstove. A cast iron kettle and pot sit on the stove in front of the stovepipe, and a tea service rests atop a dropleaf table. Against a wall, a pot with a lid and a coffee grinder sit on a wooden dresser. A clock with a pendulum occupies a space on a shelf painted a lavender color, matching the door. A caption explains: “The furnishings reflect Lou Hoover's interpretation of her husband's birthplace.” End of message.",

The re-built blacksmith shop sits west of the original shop's location just a stone's throw from the Birthplace Cottage.</p> <h2>Horseshoes & Wagon Wheels</h2> <p>Large double doors made it easy to maneuver horses around for shoeing or to bring in large wagon wheels or plows for repair. Inside the main building you'll find a working forge, along with an anvil, and a rack filled with period tools of the trade.</p> <h2>\"The Brand of Iowa\"</h2> <p>Banging iron, sparking fires, and a stream of customers, often brought Jesse's boys, \"Tad\" and \"Bertie\" across old Penn Street to investigate their father's business.

Playing barefoot around the blacksmith shop, I stepped on a chip of hot iron and carry the brand of Iowa on my foot to this day.\"</p> <h2>Successful Career Cut Short</h2> <p>Success allowed Jesse to buy a larger farm implement store on Main Street in 1878. Here he sold pumps, wagons, barbed wire, and sewing machines. He operated that shop until his death in December 1880. Though he died at age 34, in his short life he had provided an excellent example of what hard work and integrity could achieve. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "Blacksmith Shop. 226 words. Blacksmith Shop. 1 ¼ minutes. First of two descriptions at this location. The blacksmith shop is a one-story wooden structure painted dark reddish-brown with white trim. The building faces south, its large double-doors opening onto the main boardwalk, which widens to about 10 feet at this location. The building comprises two sections. The main structure, on the left, is about 20 feet wide. Its front has no windows—just two extra-wide double doors below a flat roofline. The words “Jesse Hoover, Blacksmith” are printed on a white sign with black lettering, which hangs above an oversized horseshoe on the upper center of the façade. You can enter the main part of the building through either of its wide doorways, though a wooden fence blocks entry into the workspace. To the right, adjacent to the main building, is a smaller structure with a slanted roof that gently angles up to the left. The right-hand structure has a single double doorway, but entry is blocked by a wooden fence about 3 feet high. An exhibit panel titled \"Forging Character\" is mounted on the exterior wall between the two wide doorways, though it may only be visible when the blacksmith shop is closed. It is described in the following message. The interior of the blacksmith shop is described in a separate message. End of message. Forging Character. 235 words - Panel: \"Forging Character.\" 1 ½ minute. Second of two descriptions at this location. The panel describes the historic significance of the blacksmith shop. The upright panel titled \"Forging Character\" is 24 inches tall and 18 inches wide. It is mounted on the exterior wall between two wide doorways. Beneath the title, introductory text reads: \"As a boy Herbert Hoover liked to watch his father, Jesse, shoe horses and repair plows, but he was not always careful. 'Playing barefoot around the blacksmith shop,' he recalled, 'I stepped on a chip of hot iron and carry the brand of Iowa on my foot to this day.' Come back during open hours to see the shop's interior and occasional blacksmithing demonstration.\" A note beneath the introductory text states: \"In 1957 the Hoover Birthplace Society built this re-creation of Jesse's shop. The original had been in the lot to your right.\" The introductory text appears over the main photograph of a blacksmith shop. Using long-handled tongs, an artisan holds a piece of metal over flames in a stone fireplace. The man's image is slightly blurred, suggesting movement. A caption reads: \"Blacksmithing demonstration.\" An inset photograph features Jesse Hoover, a dark-haired man with a long thick beard. The caption reads: \"Jesse Hoover, a well-liked and fair businessman, sold his blacksmith shop and opened a farm machinery business on Main Street in 1878.\" End of message.",

Each pair of tongs has a specific purpose and is used depending on the shape of the metal or the angle the blacksmith is working on.</p> <p>The bellows is another important tool. This smithy has a two-stage bellows just behind the forge. A simple pull on the handle hanging above it raises the top section of the bellows. The collapsing weight of the bellows forces air through a pipe directly into the forge and in to the fire. This adds more oxygen, allowing the fire to reach hotter temperatures.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Blacksmith Shop Interior 246 words Blacksmith Shop Interior. 1 ½ minutes. First of two descriptions at this location. Inside the blacksmith shop, about six feet beyond the wide double doors, a wooden post-and-rail fence runs across the width of the main space. An exhibit panel mounted on the rail fence illustrates how a blacksmith works with metal. The panel is described in the following message. Beyond the fence, the room is cluttered with metal pieces and partly finished products, as well as blacksmith tools—including hammers, tongs, and anvils. Horseshoes hang from ceiling beams and metal rods line racks along the walls. Wagon wheels rest against the wall and fence. The rustic, dark wood walls feature exposed beams, and three rectangular windows on the back and left side provide the only light. The floor is packed dirt and cement. The ceiling slopes up gently from the sides to a central peak. Halfway back on the right-hand side of the room is the blacksmith’s forge. It’s a square brick platform about three feet high and five feet on each side. A brick chimney, blackened with soot, rises from the platform to the ceiling. On the right-hand wall, a narrow doorway leads into another, smaller space. This second room contains wood-working tools and metal pieces of various shapes and sizes. The doorway is located just beyond the fence, so visitors are not able to enter the other room and can only peek in. End of message. Hammering Out a Dinner Gong. 232 words.

The angled panel is 24 inches wide and 14 inches deep. Beneath the title, introductory text reads: “In the 1870s Jesse Hoover and other blacksmiths shoed horses and made and repaired farming equipment. They also created decorative and functional household items.” The panel goes on to explain the 4 steps a smithy follows to make a dinner gong or triangle. Pieces of metal attached to the panel illustrate each text. You are welcome to touch them. Step one displays a thin metal rod. Text reads: “Cuts the ends of a piece of round steel with shears.” Step two displays a rod with one pointed end. Text reads: “Draws out points at each end.” Step three displays a rod with bent, curled ends. Text reads: “Bends ends and creates scrolls.” Step four displays a rod bent into a triangle with a curl on each end, plus a ringer, a straight metal rod with a circle on one end.

Beneath the title “CE Smith House “, a black and white photograph shows an elderly couple standing outside their home. The man wears a three-piece suit. The woman has a high-collared, long-sleeved dress that reaches down to the ground. A caption reads: \"The Smiths on their 50th anniversary, 1917.\" Beneath the photograph, text reads: \"Charles E. Smith, a Civil War veteran and carpenter, moved in the 1880s to West Branch with his wife, Deborah. In 1903 he finished this dream house on the top of Cook's Hill, down the road to your left, where each spring he tapped his maple trees to make syrup.\" A note at the bottom of the sign states: \"A Methodist Church formerly stood on this site. The NPS moved the house here in 1969 to add a historic building to the commemorative landscape.\" End of message.",

A plaque near the corner, about 4 feet above the ground, reads: “This property has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior.” The second-story façade and both floors of the Main Street frontage present a more humble appearance. They are constructed from plain blonde brick with a simple repeating pattern of decorative brickwork below the roofline. The sidewalk here is just one small step up from the street, and a curb-cut is available at the corner. Please watch your step, as the sidewalk contains some cracks and uneven joints.

    "audioDescription": "Downey Street 513 words Panel: \"From Downey Street to Pennsylvania Avenue.\" 3 minutes. First of two descriptions at this location. This panel depicts the south Downey Street neighborhood as it was during Herbert Hoover's boyhood. The panel titled \"From Downey Street to Pennsylvania Avenue\" is located near the intersection of Downey and Penn Streets along the boardwalk. Looking toward Hoover's birthplace cottage, the angled panel is 42 inches wide and 24 inches deep. Below the title displayed in the illustration’s blue sky, introductory text reads: \"Herbert Clark Hoover was born on August 10, 1874, in a two-room cottage. He spent his early boyhood years on the edge of the village surrounded by farmlands. His parents, relatives, and many neighbors were Quakers whose daily lives were centered on their faith's beliefs. Herbert's mother Hulda tended to him and his siblings, Theodore and Mary. She also served as a recorded minister in the Quaker meeting. Jesse, a devoted father, worked hard as a blacksmith and businessman. Together they played major roles in forming the character of the boy who would become the 31st president of the United States.\" To the right of the introductory text, a quote from Herbert Hoover reads: \"My grandparents and parents came here in a covered wagon… The most formative years of my boyhood were spent here. My roots are in this soil.\" Below Hoover's quote, more text reads: \"The park is a commemorative landscape conceived by the Hoover family, the Hoover Birthplace Society, and the National Park Service.\" The illustration stretches across the width of the panel, providing a look at Hoover's boyhood neighborhood. A caption poses the question, \"How has the street changed?\" On the illustration, the view starts at a bridge on the left. Moving to the right, a white picket fence surrounds Hoover's modest birthplace cottage. A woman stands in the doorway. A caption notes that the cottage was \"built in 1871 by his father Jesse and grandfather Eli.\" A line connects the view of the old cottage with a modern photograph in the sky overhead. A caption reads: \"Tour the interior of Hoover's birthplace across the street.\" Doors stand open at Jesse Hoover's Blacksmith Shop and we can see someone working inside. A caption notes: \"Original 1871 shop faced Downey Street.\" Next to the Blacksmith Shop, a steeple stands tall at a Methodist Church. A caption reads: \"Built 1870, razed 1913, historic house moved here.\" The Garvin House occupies the property next door. A few children play outside. Farther on, the Crook's Hotel, a two-story building, is the last building shown on the illustration. Captions tell us that the Garvin House was built in 1872, and the hotel was built in 1870. The illustration shows a man riding a horse along Downey Street, and two men ride on a horse-drawn cart full of sacks. Walking toward the cart, another man carries a sack over his shoulder. On the street today, the blacksmith shop is now farther from Downey Street than the birthplace cottage and faces Penn Street, and the church no longer stands. End of message Historic Homes on Downey Street 201 words Historic Homes on Downey Street. One and a half minutes. Second of two descriptions at this location. Downey Street is a beige gravel road about 12 feet wide, running north-south through the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. The road is only for pedestrians. There’s a wooden boardwalk on either side of Downey Street, separated from the roadway by a strip of grass. A few trees and benches punctuate the grass borders. The boardwalks can be slick in wet weather, so watch your step. There are five historic homes on Downey Street between the South Downey Bridge in the south and Wetherell Street to the north. On the east side of the street, from south to north, they are the Varney House, the Leech House, and the Laban Miles House. On the west side of the street, from south to north, you’ll find the C.E. Smith House and Garvin Cottage. These homes are not open to the public. Each is described separately in its own stop. A few of the homes have stepping stones and hitching posts in front. One of the hitching posts is decorated with a small metal horse’s head. End of message.",

Since then, the National Park Service has preserved and interpreted the historic structures and landscape of this 187-acre park. In the late 1930's, President Hoover and his wife, Lou Henry Hoover, chose this place to celebrate the values they believed helped shape his life.</p> <h2>Commemorative Landscape</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover National Historic Site includes many features of Hoover's boyhood environment that have endured over time and give the park its unique identity as a Presidential birthplace, boyhood home, and memorial. Although much has changed here since Herbert Hoover's birth in 1874, the National Park Service, citizens of West Branch, and the Hoover family have worked to preserve key elements of the past that illuminate the life and times of America's 31st president.</p> <h2>Inspiring A Life Of Service</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover's accomplished and public-spirited life drew inspiration from his birthplace. During your visit immerse yourself in the landscape Hoover and the activities he experienced as a child. His father's craft as a blacksmith, Hoover's religious upbringing, his love of fishing, the education he received-influences Herbert Hoover carried into his adult life and that contributed to his character. You'll also read and hear eloquent accounts of the adversity that touched a Quaker family and shaped the path of a young boy from West Branch who went on to serve his country as President. We hope you will find Herbert Hoover National Historic Site to be an inspiring, accessible educational, and recreational experience for years to come.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Downey Street Information Kiosk 572 words Panel: \"A President’s Rural Roots.\" 3 ½ minutes. The panel introduces the park, offers an orientation map, and displays photographs of its main features. On the edge of the sidewalk along Downey Street, at the entrance to the park near the Visitor Center, an upright panel titled \"A President's Rural Roots\" stands 48 inches tall and 36 inches wide. Another panel appears on the opposite side and is described in a separate message. The title appears at the top of the panel. The main photograph at the top shows a cottage with white wood-frame walls and a brown-shingled gable roof with a brick chimney, surrounded by a white picket fence. Introductory text identifies the cottage as the birthplace of Herbert Hoover, 31st President of the United States: \"Born in a modest two-room cottage, Herbert Hoover spent most of his first 11 years in West Branch. He went on to become the president of the United States - the first one born west of the Mississippi River. Here Hoover's parents and neighbors instilled in him the Quaker principles of honesty and hard work that formed his strong beliefs in self-reliance and American individualism. This commemorative landscape preserves historic features underlying Hoover's achievements as a mining engineer, humanitarian, and statesman.\" A quote from Eugene Lyons' 1964 book \"Herbert Hoover, A Biography\" appears below the introduction: \"Few American Presidents had such humble beginnings and were so authentically 'self-made' as Herbert Hoover.\" Below the photograph of the cottage, a map shows landmarks in the park. An arrow points to this panel's location near the Visitor Center parking lot with the words: \"You Are Here.\" The map shows walkways leading to the nearby Visitor Center, Blacksmith Shop, and Schoolhouse. Farther along are the Friends Meetinghouse, Statue of Isis, Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum, the gravesite of President and Mrs. Hoover, House of the Maples, Tallgrass Prairie Observation Deck, Hoover Presidential Foundation, two picnic shelters, and restrooms. Text to the left of the map offers information about touring the park: \"Get oriented at the Visitor Center. See exhibits and a film about Hoover and find information about self-guided tours. Be sure to visit the Birthplace Cottage, Presidential Library and Museum, and the graves of President Hoover and his wife Lou Henry Hoover. Also in this memorial park are a blacksmith shop, Quaker meetinghouse, and schoolhouse.\" Beneath the interpretive text are safety tips: Boardwalks may be slippery when wet or icy. Use designated crosswalks. Do not climb trees and fences. Avoid creek banks, which are steep and unstable. A section called \"Protect the Park\" reads: Pets must be leashed at all times. Metal detectors are prohibited. Do not remove natural or historic objects. Do not climb on statues or gravestones. Park in designated spots only; no overnight parking or camping. No smoking in or near buildings. Three inset photographs appear along the bottom of the panel. In the left photo, two plain, rectangular, marble gravestones mark the gravesite of President and Mrs. Hoover. In the middle photo, US and Iowa flags fly from poles in front of the Presidential Library and Museum, a sprawling one-story building of rough-faced yellowish stone and a white portico. In the right photo, the Visitor Center features a one-story structure with a split roof that angles over the entryway. The National Park Service emblem is displayed on the Visitor Center's red brick south wall. End of message.",

This building was home to the Citizen’s Savings Bank before the bank moved into grander quarters at the corner of Main Street and Downey Street in 1909. The structure here on the south side of West Main Street between the Union Block and the Grinnell Building is about 20 feet wide and two stories tall. No longer a bank, it currently houses Main Street Antiques and Art. The first floor of the mainly brick building features a large storefront window on the right and a pair of doors on the left. The doors are set back a couple of feet, and there is a slight ramp up from the sidewalk. The first-floor windows and doors are framed in wood, which is painted custard-yellow with red, green, beige, and brown accents. On the second floor, four round-topped windows are set into a two-toned brick façade. Below the horizontal roofline, a decorative wooden cornice is embellished in the same multi-hued palate as the first floor. There’s a metal plaque on the far right edge of the first-floor façade, about four feet off the ground. It is inscribed with the following words: This property has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior. The sidewalk is one step up from the street here and a ramp is available to the right of the building at the corner of Poplar Street. End of message.",

The plainly furnished Friends Meetinghouse, built by the Society of Friends, or Quakers, in 1857, is the physical expression of those values. Now two blocks from its original location, the Herbert Hoover Birthplace Foundation relocated and restored this meetinghouse in 1964.</p> <h2>Silent Waiting</h2> <p>Quakers held two meetings for worship each week. Men sat to the right of the partition, women to the left. The Quakers did not have a paid minister. They did not use music, symbols, or sacraments in their worship. Instead, they practiced \"silent waiting,\" or worshipping in silence as they sat on the rows of long wooden benches.</p> <h2>Moved by the Inward Light</h2> <p>If moved by the \"inward light\", a man or woman could stand and share their insights or prayers. Those known for their inspired messages, like Herbert's mother Hulda, became \"recorded ministers\" and sat on the facing benches with the elders.</p> <h2>Equality Before God</h2> <p>The Quakers strongly believed all people were equal before God. During monthly business meetings the partitions were closed, allowing women a chance at leadership independent of men. Hulda, active in the West Branch meeting, helped conduct revivals, founded and led a young people's prayer meeting, and took an active role in temperance campaigns that aimed to discourage alcohol consumption.</p> <h2>\"Long Hours of Meeting\"</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover described the meetings in his memoirs, \"Those acquainted with the Quaker faith, and who know the primitive furnishings of the Quaker meeting-house, the solemnity of the long hours of meeting awaiting the spirit to move someone, will know the intense repression upon a ten-year-old boy who might not even count his toes. All this may not have been in recreation, but it was strong training in patience.\"</p> <h2>Career of Conscience</h2> <p>Like his mother, Herbert Hoover, learned to put his beliefs into practice, as he demonstrated during decades of leadership. The Quakers' stress on the equal worth of all persons is evident in Hoover's global humanitarian work, his dedication to public service, and his faith in the opportunities afforded by American life.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Friends Meetinghouse 192 words Friends Meetinghouse. 1 ¼ minute. First of two descriptions at this location. The Friends Meetinghouse sits on the east side of Downey Street. The one-story structure is made of wood and painted eggshell white. A pitched roof of grey shingles slopes up from atop the west-facing façade. Two stout brick chimneys emerge from the peak—one on each side of the building. Four tall rectangular windows and two narrow double doors face out onto Downey Street. The meetinghouse is 40 feet wide, with an open-air porch on the left side. A level wooden walkway about 40 feet long extends from the boardwalk on Downey Street to the front of the building. At the intersection of Downey Street and this boardwalk an exhibit panel titled “Raised with Quaker Values” stands next to the board walk in the grass. The panel is described in the next message. Once you reach the building, you can turn left or right and enter through either doorway. Watch your step as you enter; there’s a small step at the threshold. The interior furnishings of the meetinghouse is described at another stop. End of message. Raised with Quaker Values 345 words Panel: “Raised with Quaker Values.” 2 minutes. Second of two descriptions at this location. This panel features an illustration of a Quaker meetinghouse, rendered with a cutaway view of the interior. At the intersection of Downey Street with the boardwalk leading to Friends Meetinghouse, the panel titled “Raised with Quaker Values” stands in the grass. The angled panel is 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep. Text below the title reads: “In this meetinghouse, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, practiced principles of simplicity, honesty, equality, peace, and service to others. These values shaped young Hoover's character and were evident in his humanitarian endeavors and interest in public service. The Quakers worshiped in silence until the 'spirit' moved someone to speak. To encourage individual worship and female participation, men sat on one side of the partition and women and children on the other. Herbert's mother, Hulda, was an inspired speaker who sat with the elders in the front on raised benches. The congregation sat opposite. She conducted revivals, young people's prayer meetings, and temperance campaigns.” A quote from Herbert Hoover reads: “...the primitive furnishing of the Quaker meetinghouse, the solemnity of the long hours of meeting awaiting the spirit to move someone ... was strong training in patience.” In the illustration, a peaked gray roof stands atop the white, one-story meetinghouse. Through the cutaway section of the roof, we can see the layout of the unadorned rooms inside. The men's side is on the right, the women's side is on the left. In each partitioned room, members of the congregation sit in plain wooden pews, facing the elders and ministers. A door on the left leads from the women's side to a porch and a cry room, furnished with a few rocking chairs and cribs. In the illustration, several mothers hold their infants. A caption states: “The simple architecture and plain furnishings reflect Quaker values.” Another caption notes: “The meetinghouse, built in 1857 two blocks to your left, was moved here in 1964 and restored.” End of message.",

On the east side of the roofed porch, right of the exit from the main part of the meetinghouse, you’ll reach a doorway that opens onto another small room. Plexiglas on the bottom half of the doorway prevents visitors from entering, but you can look in. Inside the room are several wooden cribs and cradles and two simple wooden chairs. This is known as the “cry room.” End of message. Cry Room 181 words Sign: \"Cry Room.\" 1 minute. Second of two descriptions at this location. The sign illustrates the interior of the cry room. Outside the Friends Meetinghouse, an angled sign stands in a corner of the porch, next to the door opening into the Quakers' Cry Room. The gated doorway allows visitors to peer into the plainly furnished room. The tall narrow sign is 6 inches wide and 12 inches deep. The sign's title \"Cry Room\" appears at the top of the sign. Beneath the title, an illustration with a cutaway view through the roof shows the space inside the room. Three cribs are arranged along the walls. One woman walks with an infant. Another sits in a straight-backed chair, holding a baby, a young girl at her knee. A rocking chair occupies a place next to a table. Beneath the illustration, text reads: \"When infants and young children disturbed the silence of the meeting, their mothers took them to this small nursery, called the cry room. The doorway in the back leads to a latrine.\" End of message.",

Herbert Hoover’s parents Jesse and Hulda Hoover are buried in this cemetery overlooking the town of West Branch. The two gravestones stand next to each other several rows in from the road that circles this section of the cemetery. As you face the grave markers, Jesse Hoover’s is on the left. It’s about three feet high and a couple of inches thick, with a rounded top. The passage of time has caused the white stone to blacken a bit around the edges. The inscription reads: “Jesse C. Hoover – Died December 13, 1880, Aged 34 Years, 3 Months, & 11 Days. Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. – Matthew 11, 28” Above the inscription, a circular relief is carved into the stone. The image depicts a hand holding an open book. Hulda Hoover’s tombstone is a foot-and-a-half tall, and several inches thick. The top is gently rounded, but flatter than her husband’s.

Elton Trueblood, Graveside Eulogy of President Hoover</p> </blockquote> <p>When he died on October 20, 1964 at the age of 90, the 31st President was laid to rest five days later in this quiet, grassy hillside. More than 100,000 people lined the funeral procession route from Cedar Rapids to West Branch on that warm fall day. </p> <p>Herbert Hoover wrote of West Branch, \"My grandparents and my parents came here in a covered wagon. In this community they toiled and worshipped God. The most formative years of my boyhood were spent here. My roots are in this soil.\"</p> <h2>Simple Design</h2> <p>Iowa architect William Wagner designed the memorial while working closely with the Hoover family to commemorate his life. The two plainly inscribed ledger stones of Vermont white marble are in keeping with the Quaker ideal of simplicity. Across the curved walkway, the American flag waves in tribute. Did you know that it was Herbert Hoover who signed the congressional resolution making The Star Spangled Banner the national anthem during his Presidency? </p> <h2>View of Simple Beginnings</h2> <p>Beyond the flagpole, on the horizon at the end of the two rows of trees, is a direct view of the white, wood-frame cottage where Herbert Hoover was born. The first President born west of the Mississippi River, Hoover believed that anyone could start from simple beginnings and achieve great things. </p> <h2>Burial of Lou Hoover</h2> <p>The second marble gravestone is for Lou Henry Hoover, the tireless and talented First Lady from Waterloo, Iowa. Following her death in 1944, she was buried in Palo Alto, California, but was moved to rest beside her husband in 1964. Partners in life for almost forty-five years, they had both come back to touch the Iowa soil.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Gravesite of President and Mrs. Hoover 392 words Gravesite of President and Mrs. Hoover. 2 ½ minutes. The graves of President Herbert Hoover and his wife Lou Henry Hoover are located on a hilltop that overlooks the National Historic Site from the southwest. Several hundred feet to the northwest, between two rows of trees, is the small white cabin where Herbert Hoover was born. An exhibit panel titled \"Hoover Gravesite\" stands along the sidewalk by the parking lot for the gravesite. The panel is described in the next message. The main path to the gravesite leads west from the parking area for about 300 feet. The cement path is a bit steep for wheelchair access. A more gradual wheelchair ramp bordered by prairie plants leads south from the parking area, reaching the gravesite after about 450 feet. There are two marble benches to the left of the walkway as you approach the gravesite. Once you reach the gravesite, the path switches from cement to smooth stone and curves gently to the right for about 50 feet before ending abruptly. The graves of President and Mrs. Hoover are to the left, or southwest, of the six-foot wide walkway. Two white marble slabs are laid horizontally on black granite bases, perpendicular to the path. The stones each measure four feet wide by ten feet deep by two feet high. The stone on the left is inscribed on the front and top “Herbert Hoover, 1874-1964.” The stone on the right is inscribed “Lou Henry Hoover, 1874-1944.” Two additional marble blocks sit at the beginning and end of the stone path, framing the site. Each is about three feet high, three feet wide, and two feet deep. Behind the graves is an arc of flat-topped evergreen shrubs 18 inches high, and beyond that, three rows of rounded bushes planted on a curved slope. Finally, forming the outside edge of the engulfing arc is a row of dense evergreens about 15 feet high. Opposite the graves, on the right, or northwest, side of the path, is an American flag atop a flagpole 40 feet high. An eagle with outstretched wings adorns the top of the flagpole. Further to the north and northwest, the view is of the grassy fields, clumps of trees, and crisscrossing paths that make up the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. End of message. Hoover Gravesite 372 words Panel: \"Hoover Gravesite.\" 2 minutes. The panel introduces visitors to President Hoover’s gravesite. The angled panel titled \"Hoover Gravesite\" stands a respectful distance from the graves of President and Mrs. Hoover, where the visitor faces up a gentle slope. The panel is 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep. The title appears at the top of the panel above introductory text. The text reads: \"President Herbert Hoover died in New York City on October 20, 1964, at the age of 90. Five days later his body was interred on this hillside overlooking his birthplace and presidential library — a symbolic vista of his journey from birth to death. The remains of Lou Henry Hoover, who died January 7, 1944, were moved from California and placed beside her husband. Their son Allan selected the gravesite. Iowa architect William Wagner designed the memorial in collaboration with the Hoover family and William Anderson of the Hoover Birthplace Society. The two plainly inscribed gravestones reflect Quaker simplicity.\" The main image is a color photograph of Herbert Hoover's funeral. Eight men wearing military uniforms from different branches of the armed services hold an American flag above the casket, which lies on a green carpet. Nearby, more men hold flags. Behind the honor guard, a canopy shades a gathering of mourners. More attendees stand behind a row of potted flowers. A caption reads: \"A military honor guard carried Hoover's casket to the gravesite. More than 100,000 people lined the funeral procession from Cedar Rapids to West Branch.\" An inset black and white photograph offers an aerial view of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C., full of people. A caption below the image states: \"Before Hoover's burial in West Branch, a service was held in New York City and his body lay in state at the Capitol Rotunda (above) in Washington.\" In the bottom left corner, a quote from President Lyndon Baines Johnson upon signing the law establishing Herbert Hoover National Historic Site, August 12, 1965, reads: \"... one of the rich and rewarding inspirations of my life was to know him ... I shall always cherish his wisdom and his insights, but most especially I shall cherish the inspiration of his character.\" End of message.",

Grey shingles also cover the wide front porch, which is supported by four thin carved wooden columns. A white post-and-rail fence about four feet high surrounds the home. A sign five inches wide by 12 inches tall hangs on the gatepost. Beneath the title \"Varney House “, the image of the sprawling house shows a leafy tree standing at the entryway, a covered porch. A caption reads: \"Varney House circa 1930.\" Text beneath the image reads: \"Hannah Varney built this house in 1899 after divorcing her husband. She lived here with her six children less than a year, moved to Iowa City, and left the house to her daughters, Cora and Clara, who lived here until 1915.\" A note at the bottom of the sign states: \"In 1967, the National Park Service moved the house here from a block away to your right.\" End of message.",

    "audioDescription": "Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum 251 words Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum. Two minutes. The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum is a sprawling one-story building of fieldstone construction with white trim. The roof’s multiple gables and inclines are topped with slate-grey shingles. The library’s main entrance faces south. A short portico about 12 feet wide leads to four white-framed doors, each inset with eight small square windowpanes. Multi-paned windows to the left and right of the entrance continue the pattern across a large part of the southern façade. Two square columns on either side of the portico support its front corners. A concrete blockade about three feet high and one foot on each side stands in between the columns, so be sure to avoid it as you enter. A driveway runs past the front of the library, leading to a parking area to the library’s southwest. Parallel to the driveway, just to its south, is a two-way paved road that leads into the site from Parkside Drive. Two flagpoles stand on a strip of grass separating the driveway and road. One displays an American flag; on the other hangs the flag of the state of Iowa. A second, unused entrance to the library faces east. Here, four square columns line the front of a shallow portico. The Presidential Seal of the United States adorns the pediment above it. It’s a small step up to the portico; then two more steps up to the door. End of message.",

    "bodyText": "<p>A bridge on Downey Street, just south of President Hoover's birthplace, crosses a tributary of the West Branch of Wapsinonoc Creek. When Herbert Hoover was a boy, it was just an unnamed small stream of water trickling through marshy wetlands. Young Herbert and the neighborhood kids took their willow fishing poles about a quarter mile downstream to catch sunfish and catfish in the main creek.</p> <h2>Bridge on Downey Street</h2> <p>In March 1875, the citizens of West Branch petitioned Cedar County to build \"a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/south-downey-street-bridge.htm\">bridge on Downey Street</a>, near Jesse Hoover's blacksmith shop\" so wagons could get across. Twice constructed out of wood, it was finally rebuilt in 1917 as a steel beam and concrete span.</p> <h2>Flooding</h2> <p>Over time, farmers plowed the rain-absorbing prairie into cultivated fields, and as urban pavement increased rainfall runoff, the creek suffered from too little water in dry seasons and too much water in wet seasons. In 1993, floodwaters nearly reached the foundation of the nearby Friends Meetinghouse where the Hoovers once worshipped.</p> <h2>Erosion</h2> <p>Studies by the National Park Service revealed that floods have cut a channel in the streambed. That means when floodwaters come, soil is carved from the stream banks. This erosion is threatening the park's historic structures, artifacts, and documents. The National Park Service is looking for ways to control the force of the stream and reduce this erosion. These efforts will help prevent the loss of vegetation that supports native wildlife and anchors this protective green space.</p> <h2>Hoover's Legacy of Water Conservation</h2> <p>As Commerce Secretary for President Warren Harding and later as President, Herbert Hoover supported several environmental conservation measures, especially in regard to water resources development and fisheries management. Perhaps these viewpoints got their start in a young boy's memories of sun-dappled streams and the joy of exploring with his childhood friends the waters of Wapsinonoc Creek.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Hoover Creek at the South Downey Street Bridge 211 words Hoover Creek at the South Downey Street Bridge. 1 ½ minutes. The Hoover Creek meanders east-west through the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. The creek is just a few feet wide, with shrubs and a few trees along its banks. At Downey Street, the creek flows beneath the South Downey Street Bridge. Downey Street is a gravel road about 12 feet wide with a wooden boardwalk on either side. Elsewhere, there’s a strip of grass separating the boardwalks from the roadway, but at the bridge, the boardwalks come right up alongside the road. Boardwalks can be slick in wet weather, so watch your step. The bridge is about 25 feet long, bordered on each side by a four-foot-high wooden post-and-rail fence. It’s about ten feet down from the bridge to the creek below. From the east side of the bridge, the view is toward Parkside Drive, which runs north-south alongside the park. The Friends Meetinghouse is about 60 feet away, at 2:00 on the clock face. The visitor center is about 200 feet away, at 10:00. If you’re facing west from the bridge, the Presidential Library and Museum is at 11:00 and about 200 feet away. The Birth Cottage is at 2:00, about 60 feet from the bridge. End of message.",

As a child, Herbert Hoover developed an early interest in geology while collecting interesting rocks along the railroad grade. </p> <h2>Railroad & Prosperity</h2> <p>Within ten years after the railroad arrived in 1870, West Branch grew from a tiny crossroads community to a bustling village, despite the generally hard economic times that followed the panic of 1873. By 1910 fourteen passenger trains passed through town daily, as did numerous freight trains.</p> <h2>Early Interest in Geology</h2> <p>The railroad tracks east of Downey Street brought something else for a curious and enterprising Bertie Hoover: a fascination with geology. He scoured the gravel of the track bed for agates and fossil corals. In his memoirs Hoover wrote, \"Their fine points came out wonderfully when wet, and you had to lick them with your tongue before each exhibit.\"</p> <h2>Train Depot</h2> <p>The West Branch depot, built in 1871 and which once stood nearby, was the scene of orphaned eleven year old \"Bert\" Hoover's departure for a new and uncertain life in Oregon in 1885, and where Hoover made his triumphant return as the newly nominated Republican candidate for president in 1928.</p> <h2>Rail to Trail</h2> <p>The rail line was abandoned shortly after the Rock Island Railroad declared bankruptcy in 1980. Thanks to the efforts of local citizens, in 1990 the three miles of railroad right-of-way between West Branch and Oasis was reopened as a segment of the Herbert Hoover Nature Trail.

At age thirty-three, Jesse Hoover had become a successful businessman. Ready to take on new challenges, he sold his blacksmith shop and bought a farm implement store on Main Street. Like any hard-working husband, Jesse used his improved fortunes to provide for the comforts of his family.</p> <h2>\"Rooms Big Enough to Swing A Cat In\"</h2> <p>In March of 1879, Jesse purchased the House of the Maples at auction for $140. It had, he said, \"rooms big enough to swing a cat in.\" On May 27th of that year, the family moved their belongings into their new home. Their spacious new house had an actual parlor and a modern little oil stove. A four-board whitewashed fence with a swinging picket gate framed the front yard. In the summer, the Hoover children would catch lightning bugs. In the winter, they'd sled down nearby Cook's hill as Hulda watched with her heart in her mouth. It was this house, and not the cottage that would hold the most memories for the Hoover children... both good and bad.</p> <h2>Making Ends Meet After Tragedy</h2> <p>On December 13, 1880, Jesse Hoover died in his upstairs bedroom from rheumatism of the heart. Herbert \"Bertie\" Hoover was only six years old. His mother, Hulda kept the family together by carefully managing the money from Jesse's business holdings and by taking in sewing and an occasional boarder.</p> <h2>Orphaned Children</h2> <p>But death would come to visit the House of the Maples once more. On February 24, 1884, at the age of 35, Hulda Hoover died from typhoid fever. Tad had just turned 13, Bertie was 9, and May was 7. The three children, now orphans, were separated and sent to live with relatives. It would be twelve years before they would live together again, this time in California-2,000 miles from their childhood Iowa home.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "House of the Maples Site 171 words House of the Maples Site. 1 minute. First of two descriptions at this location. The House of the Maples—the Hoover family’s second home in West Branch—once stood on this spot, on the east side of Downey Street. Today it’s an empty lot approximately 100 feet square. The area is flat and grass-covered, with a few trees spread out around the property. One of the trees is a very old maple, possibly old enough to have shaded the Hoover’s second home. Downey Street is open only to pedestrians, but the lot is bounded on the east by Parkside Drive and on the north by the Library entrance road. Both thoroughfares are open to vehicular traffic, so please stay alert. A gravel driveway about 30 feet long extends east from Downey Street onto the south edge of the property. Further to the south is the pale-green P.T. Smith House. An exhibit panel, described in the following message, tells about the house. End of message. Rooms Big Enough To Swing a Cat In 432 words Panel: \"Rooms Big Enough to Swing a Cat In.\" 2 ¼ minutes. Second of two descriptions at this location. This panel describes the Hoover’s second home. The angled panel titled \"Rooms big enough to swing a cat in\" stands on the empty lot at the site of the Hoovers' second home, known as the House of the Maples. The panel is 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep. The title, quoted from Herbert's father Jesse, is followed by an introduction: \"Jesse Hoover was doing so well with his new farming implement business that he moved his family in May 1879 into a four-room house here. As adults Herbert, Theodore, and Mary had mixed memories of their second home. They fondly recalled catching lightning bugs and sledding with Etta, Eddie, and Wallace Smith, who lived next door. Unfortunately, however, Jesse died in 1880 at age 34 of a heart ailment. Hulda kept the family together managing Jesse's business assets and taking in sewing and an occasional boarder. But tragedy struck again in 1884, when she died at 35 of typhoid fever. The orphans went to live with relatives. They were reunited later in Oregon.\" A note states: \"The Hoovers' house was razed in 1923. The adjacent home of Peter T. Smith's family is the only house Herbert Hoover remembered on a visit years later.\" A quote from the West Branch Local Record, May 29, 1879, reads: \"Mr. J. C. Hoover moved into his new house Tuesday morning, and is now 'as snug as a bug in a rug.'\" In the full panel photograph, two chimneys rise from the peaked roof atop a plain two-story home. Two windows bracket the front door, which stands open. A woman wearing a long-sleeved, ankle-length dress stands in the yard near a few trees. A caption reads: \"Hulda Hoover stands in front of the house about 1883. Herbert's brother, Theodore, called it the 'House of the Maples' in later years.\" An inset to the left of the image of the house shows a newspaper advertisement. It reads: \"Ho, for Kansas! But if you do not go there go to J. C. Hoover and buy your Farming Implements including three leading sulky plows, new departure tongueless cultivator, Orchard City wagon, buck eye reaper, rubber bucket pumps, sewing machines, and lightning rods. In face everything in my line. Come and see me, for I will not be beat in quality or prices. J. C. Hoover.\" Below the advertisement, a caption reads: \"Advertisement for Jesse Hoover's business, 1879.\" End of message.",

Three years later, he met and married a young woman, who had inherited 100 acres of farmland to the southwest of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/birthplace-cottage.htm\">Hoover birthplace</a>. So Miles sold his drugstore and decided to give farming a try. And as soon as the two-story frame house and barn were built, the new family moved in. Isaac's daughters, Providence and Abbie were around the same age as the Hoover children, and it's likely they played together in this rural playground filled with natural wonders.</p> <h2>Iowa Farms of the Late 1800s</h2> <p>Iowa farmsteads were laid out according to the character of the land. Rolling hills could serve as pasture or as a partial support for buildings like a barn. Where the ground was flat, crops were planted; outbuildings like chicken coops were constructed close to the home, but definitely downwind, to make for a short walk in the winter. And a road was leveled to give the farmer access to railroads and markets where he could sell his harvest.</p> <h2>1880 Census of the Miles Farm</h2> <p>An 1880 census showed that Miles had managed to get 73 acres under cultivation with corn, oats, rye, potatoes, and apples. He also raised 5 milk cows, 5 beef cattle, 55 pigs, and 20 chickens.</p> <h2>More Than Farmers</h2> <p>Farming did provide for Isaac and his family, but in 1882, Isaac became involved with his father Benjamin in the establishment of the Indian Industrial School, a Quaker-inspired school to educate Native American children in the industrial arts. It was during this time, when some of the Osage, Cheyenne, and Arapaho children lived and worked on the Miles Farm, that 8-year old Bert Hoover \"fished and hunted the countryside with them, learned the lore of the woods, and how to make bows and arrows.\" </p>",

Leech, a Civil War veteran and graduate of Iowa State University, had lived in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/laban-miles-house.htm\">Laban Miles House</a>; renting it at first in 1884, and then purchasing it two years later when the bank foreclosed on the home. By 1920, the well-liked country doctor and Iowa legislator decided to have a new home built for himself. The result was this white, one and a half story wood frame house with large overhanging eaves, an airy L-shaped veranda supported by four Doric columns, and a small inset balcony above the front porch that overlooks Downey Street.</p> <h2>Celebrations & Ice Cream Socials</h2> <p>However, at the turn of the century when Dr. Leech was still living in the Miles house, the empty lot where this home now sits became one of the most popular social centers in West Branch. Here during the hot Midwest summers, Dr. Leech held ice cream socials church groups and 4th of July celebrations for the whole town. His lawn parties grew in popularity when box supper socials to benefit the volunteer fire company became an annual event. The West Branch Times wrote, “All gentlemen are invited to come and buy a box and take supper with your own or someone’s best girl!”</p> <h2>\"A Long Life Of Usefulness\"</h2> <p>Although this home was built many years after <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/heho/historyculture/herbert-hoover.htm\">Herbert Hoover’s</a> childhood, there is still a connection between the physician who practiced medicine in West Branch for 55 years and the young boy who left and became the nation’s 31st President. When Dr. Leech passed away at the age of 91 in 1937, services were held at the West Branch <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/c-e-smith-house.htm\">Methodist Church</a>. Herbert Hoover, ever guided by the understanding that it takes a community to raise a child, sent a personal message of sympathy that was read at the funeral. In it, the former President remembered and praised Dr. Leech’s “long life of usefulness to the community and loyalty to his neighbors and friends.”</p>",

Cedar County Deed Records show that in 1875, Laban Miles purchased the home at 113 S. Downey Street for $2,250.00. In 1870, Miles had married <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/hulda-minthorn-hoover.htm\">Hulda Hoover’s</a> younger sister, Agnes Minthorn, just five days after Hulda and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/jesse-clark-hoover.htm\">Jesse Hoover</a> were wed. Now they were settling down with a family of their own.</p> <h2>Hoover & Miles Family Ties</h2> <p>There was much visiting back and forth between the Miles and Hoover homes, and the two families became close friends. The short walk on Downey Street often brought the Hoover children, Tad, Bertie, and Mary, together with their cousins for playtime or a shared pot of soup that had spent the day simmering on a wood stove. But their time together was short-lived.</p> <h2>Service as an Indian Agent</h2> <p>In the spring of 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Miles to serve as an agent responsible for the care and education of the Osage and Kaw tribes in the Oklahoma territory. When Laban, Agnes and their children left that summer, they rented their home first to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/methodist-church-site.htm\">Methodist Church</a> for a parsonage, and then to Dr. L.J. Leech, a well-known and respected physician in West Branch.</p> <h2>Adventures in Indian Country</h2> <p>But the ties between the Miles and Hoover families remained strong. Following Jesse Hoover’s death, Laban Miles asked Hulda if his nephew could come to live with them on the Osage reservation. In 1882, eight-year-old Herbert spent eight months there with his aunt, uncle and cousins. For the future President, they were memories that lasted a lifetime.</p>",

The Leech-Gruwell Garage is a two-story tan brick structure about 30 feet wide. On the first floor, the door and two tall windows are set back a few feet from the street between a pair of storefront windows. Another door is located on the far right. Several decorative features adorn the first floor. The windows and doors are framed in cream-colored wood, and a row of green rectangles runs in a two-foot strip below them. Above the windows and doors is a strip of opaque decorative glass divided into six rows of small squares textured with raised ridges and rows of inverted teardrop-shaped bumps. The simpler second floor features three windows set into a basic brick pattern, each topped by a slightly curved lintel. The top of the second floor is trimmed with beige wood siding about 5 feet wide just below the roofline. The sidewalk inclines up very slightly at the front door, but watch your step here, as the concrete is cracked in spots. It’s also one small step up to the sidewalk from Downey Street.

Limestone also divides the first and second stories with a thinner band, and then appears again at the roofline. Geometric designs are incised into the stone at the upper corners of the building. An American flag flies from the pediment atop the south-facing façade. Within the pediment is inscribed the date “1916.” A similar pediment on the east-facing side of the building carried the inscription: “State Bank.” Above the central doorway on the south side, metal letters spell out the words “Old Bank.” Just to the left of the door is a metal plaque, which reads: “This property has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior.” The sidewalk is about two feet higher than the street level here and about seven to eight feet wide from the building’s front to the edge, so use caution.

    "audioDescription": "The Opera Block 259 words The Opera Block. 1 ¾ minutes. The Opera Block is located at 107-109 North Downey Street, on the east side of the road. It abuts the Leech-Gruwell Garage Building to the right. The ornate two-story structure measures approximately 50 feet across its façade, making it the largest commercial building in downtown West Branch. Three separate commercial spaces occupy the first floor, each with its own doorway and storefront window. It’s one step up from the sidewalk to each door. Each door is set at a slight angle to the façade.  Several colorful patterns and designs enliven the second floor of the façade in yellow and dark red against a background of greyish-green stone. For example, a series of flattened yellow diamonds forms a narrow strip just above the first story. Further up, pairs of yellow and red pilasters fill the spaces between the rectangular multi-paned windows of the second floor. A number of horizontal stripes—both yellow and red—also stretch across the second floor, balancing the vertical lines of the pilasters. At the top of the building, a triangular panel juts up from the center of the horizontal roofline. Yellow lettering spells out “Opera Block, 1895.” On either side of this central sign are two smaller rectangular panels. The panel on the left bears the name of the builder, “C.A. Macomber.” The panel on the right reads: “Masonic Hall.” It’s one step up from the street to the sidewalk here, but there’s a ramp to the left of the building. End of message.",

    "audioDescription": "Historic Homes on Poplar Street 260 words Historic Homes on Poplar Street. 1 ½ minute. First of two descriptions at this location. Poplar Street is a beige gravel road about 8 feet wide, running north-south through the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. A wooden boardwalk runs along the east side of the street, separated from the roadway by a strip of grass about four feet wide. Another boardwalk crosses Poplar Street at Penn Street. The boardwalks can be slick in wet weather, so watch your step. Four historic homes line Poplar Street between Penn Street in the south and Wetherell Street in the north. The Mackey House can be found on the east side of the street near Wetherell Street. On the west side of the street, from south to north, you’ll find the Hayhurst House, the Wright House, and the Staples House. These homes are not open to the public. Each is described separately in its own stop. The exhibit panel titled \"A Growing Town\" stands on the north end of Poplar Street, between the boardwalk and roadway. The next message describes the panel. Please note: Poplar Street is only open to pedestrian traffic within the park, but Wetherell Street is open to vehicles, so stay alert. Also note, if you are approaching Wetherell Street from the south, a log blocks the way at the end of Poplar Street and several large bushes line Wetherell on either side of Poplar. If you are exiting the park, please use the boardwalk, which ramps down gently to Wetherell Street. End of message. A Growing Town 487 words Panel: \"A Growing Town.\" 2 ½ minutes. Second of two descriptions at this location. The panel identifies the historic homes along this block of Poplar Street. The angled panel titled \"A Growing Town\" stands in the grass between Poplar Street and the boardwalk near four historic homes — Mackey House, Hayhurst House, Staples House, and Wright House. The panel is 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep. The title \"A Growing Town\" appears at the top of the panel over introductory text. The text reads: \"The four houses on this Poplar Street block were here in the 1870s and 1880s when Herbert Hoover was a boy. Families built the houses on lots they bought from John Wetherell, a Quaker real-estate developer who had subdivided five acres. The Hoovers also bought their property from Wetherell. As you might guess, the road behind you is named Wetherell Street.\" In the main photograph, a narrow road and a boardwalk lead past four houses. A white picket fence surrounds the two-story Mackey House, on the left. A peaked shingled roof tops the pale yellow exterior. A caption reads: \"Carpenter David Mackey designed and built this house in 1869. One of the town's few Democrats, he was elected mayor in 1879.\" Across the street from Mackey House, an enclosed front porch stretches the width of the Staples House. Yellow trim accents the structure's white exterior. An arrow leads from the house to an inset photograph showing an older view. Trees stand in the yard next to a fence, a few taller than the two-story house. A caption notes: \"Dr. James and Eliza Staples bought this house in 1876. The historic photo shows the house in 1878, six years after it was built.\" Wright House stands next to Staples House. A covered porch shades the entryway to the home. It has a gray shingled roof and white siding. A caption reads: \"Mary Wright bought two lots in 1873 and owned the property for 48 years. Her husband, William, sold his blacksmith shop in 1875 and opened a harness and boot shop.\" The fourth house, Hayhurst House, stands on the other side of Wright House, farther down Poplar Street near a line of trees. It has a white exterior and a dark gray roof. An arrow points from the modern view to an inset photograph that shows more than a dozen Civil War veterans in front of the house. Decorative pillars support the covered entryway. A caption reads: \"E. S. Hayhurst bought three lots in 1870 and built this house. When the Hayhursts could not make payments, Wetherell repossessed the lots and rented the house. A 1912 photo shows Civil War veterans in front of the house.\" In the bottom right corner of the panel, a caption states: \"These four homes are preserved as part of the park's commemorative landscape. They are not open to the public.\" End of message.",

Since then, the National Park Service has preserved and interpreted the historic structures and landscape of this 187-acre park. In the late 1930's, President Hoover and his wife, Lou Henry Hoover, chose this place to celebrate the values they believed helped shape his life.</p> <h2>Commemorative Landscape</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover National Historic Site includes many features of Hoover's boyhood environment that have endured over time and give the park its unique identity as a Presidential birthplace, boyhood home, and memorial. Although much has changed here since Herbert Hoover's birth in 1874, the National Park Service, citizens of West Branch, and the Hoover family have worked to preserve key elements of the past that illuminate the life and times of America's 31st president.</p> <h2>Inspiring A Life Of Service</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover's accomplished and public-spirited life drew inspiration from his birthplace. During your visit immerse yourself in the landscape Hoover and the activities he experienced as a child. His father's craft as a blacksmith, Hoover's religious upbringing, his love of fishing, the education he received-influences Herbert Hoover carried into his adult life and that contributed to his character. You'll also read and hear eloquent accounts of the adversity that touched a Quaker family and shaped the path of a young boy from West Branch who went on to serve his country as President. We hope you will find Herbert Hoover National Historic Site to be an inspiring, accessible educational, and recreational experience for years to come.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Presidential Library & Museum Information Kiosk 541 words Panel: \"A President’s Rural Roots.\" 3 minutes. First of two descriptions at this location. The panel introduces the park, offers an orientation map, and displays photographs of its main features. On the edge of the sidewalk around the corner from the entrance to the Presidential Library and Museum, an upright panel titled \"A President's Rural Roots,\" stands 48 inches tall and 36 inches wide. This panel appears to the left of a 24 by 36-inch bulletin case with two brochure holders and a 12 by 12 inch panel with safety tips. The title appears at the top of the panel. The main photograph at the top shows a cottage with white wood-frame walls and a brown-shingled gable roof with a brick chimney, surrounded by a white picket fence. Introductory text identifies the cottage as the birthplace of Herbert Hoover, 31st President of the United States: \"Born in a modest two-room cottage, Herbert Hoover spent most of his first 11 years in West Branch. He went on to become the president of the United States - the first one born west of the Mississippi River. Here Hoover's parents and neighbors instilled in him the Quaker principles of honesty and hard work that formed his strong beliefs in self-reliance and American individualism. This commemorative landscape preserves historic features underlying Hoover's achievements as a mining engineer, humanitarian, and statesman.\" A quote from Eugene Lyons' 1964 book \"Herbert Hoover, A Biography\" appears below the introduction: \"Few American Presidents had such humble beginnings and were so authentically 'self-made' as Herbert Hoover.\" Below the photograph of the cottage, a map shows landmarks in the park. An arrow points to this panel's location near the Visitor Center parking lot with the words: \"You Are Here.\" The map shows walkways leading to the nearby Visitor Center, Blacksmith Shop, and Schoolhouse. Farther along are the Friends Meetinghouse, Statue of Isis, Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum, the gravesite of President and Mrs. Hoover, House of the Maples, Tallgrass Prairie Observation Deck, Hoover Presidential Foundation, two picnic shelters, and restrooms. Text to the left of the map offers information about touring the park: \"Get oriented at the Visitor Center. See exhibits and a film about Hoover and find information about self-guided tours. Be sure to visit the Birthplace Cottage, Presidential Library and Museum, and the graves of President Hoover and his wife Lou Henry Hoover. Also in this memorial park are a blacksmith shop, Quaker meetinghouse, and schoolhouse.\" Three inset photographs appear along the bottom of the panel. In the left photo, two plain, rectangular, marble gravestones mark the gravesite of President and Mrs. Hoover. In the middle photo, US and Iowa flags fly from poles in front of the Presidential Library and Museum, a sprawling one-story building of rough-faced yellowish stone and a white portico. In the right photo, the Visitor Center features a one-story structure with a split roof that angles over the entryway. The National Park Service emblem is displayed on the Visitor Center's red brick south wall. To the right of the panel, a bulletin case contains current announcements and information about programs and events. Safety tips are listed on a panel below the case. End of message. Safety Tips 120 words Panel: Safety Tips. 45 seconds. Second of two descriptions at this location. Next to the panel titled \"A President's Rural Roots,\" and below the bulletin case is a panel 12 inches square. The first section of text lists safety tips: Boardwalks may be slippery when wet or icy. Use designated crosswalks. Do not climb trees and fences. Avoid creek banks, which are steep and unstable. A section called \"Protect the Park\" reads: Pets must be leashed at all times. Metal detectors are prohibited. Do not remove natural or historic objects. Do not climb on statues or gravestones.

Hard work was a core value of the Quaker townsfolk, but so too was education-for both boys and girls. Herbert Hoover's own mother, Hulda had been a teacher in neighboring Muscatine County before she married. Because the Society of Friends raised much of the money for the construction of this one-room schoolhouse, it was also used as the town's first Quaker meetinghouse.</p> <h2>The Growing School</h2> <p>In 1869, after the town built a larger schoolhouse, this building was used as a classroom for the primary department, or youngest grades. Herbert Hoover entered public school in 1880 at age 5 and spent three years in the primary department. It is unknown if Hoover's class met in this building.</p> <h2>Pursuit of Higher Education</h2> <p>The value the Hoovers' placed on education paid off in 1891. 17-year old Bert Hoover enrolled at Stanford University, determined to become a mining engineer.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Schoolhouse 240 words Schoolhouse. 2 ½ minutes. First of two descriptions at this location. The schoolhouse is located about 50 feet to the northwest of the blacksmith shop off Penn Street. The small wooden building is painted a creamy off-white. The façade is 18 feet wide, with two rectangular windows on either side of a central doorway. The grey shingled roof rises to a peak above the doorway, and a brick chimney pokes up from the back of the modest structure. Two wooden walkways provide access from the main boardwalk that runs along the north side of Penn Street. The first intersects with the Penn Street boardwalk from directly in front of the schoolhouse. At this intersection an exhibit panel titled “Learning their A, B, Cs” stands next to the board walk in the grass. The panel is described in the next message. If you take this walkway you will need to climb four steps up to the building’s entrance. A second walkway about 20 feet to the right of that one provides access via ramp. The ramp heads north for about 30 feet and then turns west for another 20 feet along the front of the building. A metal railing lines the second half of the ramp. Watch your step on all walkways, especially during inclement weather, as the wood can be slippery when wet. The interior of the schoolhouse is described in a separate stop. End of message. Learning Their A, B, Cs. 380 words. Panel: “Learning their A, B, Cs.” 2 minutes. Second of two descriptions at this location. The panel identifies the historic schoolhouse. The angled panel titled “Learning their A, B, Cs” stands next to the sidewalk that crosses the lawn to the Hoover Schoolhouse. Steps and a ramp lead up to the entrance of the white frame structure, topped with a peaked roof. The panel is 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep. The title appears at the top of the panel above introductory text. The text reads: “Quakers, including the Hoovers, believed strongly in educating both boys and girls equally, and by 1853 West Branch's population was large enough to build this one-room schoolhouse. Because the Quakers had raised much of the funds, they also used it as their first meetinghouse. Herbert Hoover started school in 1879 at age five, but it is not known if he attended classes in this building even though his father and brother had. Orphaned at age nine, Herbert moved two years later to an uncle's home in Oregon, where he studied at a Quaker academy before joining Stanford University's first class in 1891.” A quote from Herbert Hoover states: “Iowa … was filled with days of school — and who does not remember with a glow some gentle woman, who with infinite patience and kindness drilled into us those foundations of all we know today.” The main image, a black and white photograph of a schoolroom, shows boys and girls sitting at wooden desks arranged in rows, some seated two to a bench. As the children face us, the teacher, a woman wearing a high-collared blouse, stands behind them at the chalkboard. A caption reads: “A West Branch schoolroom in the late 1800s.” The inset photograph shows four young men wearing hats and suits as they pose with surveying equipment, including a tripod and scope, and several measuring poles. A caption reads: “Hoover served on a geological surveying squad at Stanford in 1893. After graduating he became a successful mining engineer.” Text in the bottom right corner of the panel reads: “This schoolhouse originally stood two blocks away at Downey and Main streets. The National Park Service moved the schoolhouse here in 1968 for restoration.” End of message.",

When you enter the schoolhouse, a wall directly in front of you forces you to turn right. As you walk around the wall, you emerge into the rear right corner of a one-room schoolhouse. A wooden railing and Plexiglas barrier about three feet high prevents you from moving beyond the back corner of the room. The space is about 18 feet by 18 feet, with a worn wooden floor. Dark wood wainscoting covers the lower two feet of the walls; the rest of the walls and ceiling are painted white. The room is furnished with wood student desks in wrought iron frames arranged in rows. Reading texts and penmanship books, along with slate boards, have been placed neatly on the desks. Two small shelves hanging on the left-hand wall hold additional history and science texts. A larger wooden teacher’s desk sits at the front of the classroom with a globe and more books lined up along its back edge. Portraits of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln hang on either side of the front wall above the blackboard. At the back of the room, a black metal stovepipe rises toward the ceiling from a dull black potbelly stove and out the front of the room. Six rectangular curtained windows around the space shed a diffuse light on the rustic classroom scene. End of message.",

The heritage area region comprises thirty-seven counties with its headquarters in Waterloo, Iowa. The Board of Trustees and SSNHA staff serve jointly as the coordinating entity.<br /> <br /> Silos & Smokestacks National Heritage Area illustrates the cultural history of American agriculture and the shift to large-scale industrialized development of American farms to feed the nation and the world. The fertile region includes a rolling landscape in the central and western portions of Iowa to the hills, bluffs, and steep valleys in the vicinity of the Mississippi River. Centuries of occupation further shaped this landscape. American Indians established villages and agricultural fields along the river corridors for hundreds of years while using fire to manage the prairie uplands for hunting. In the 1700s, European migrants settled rapidly through the region in the mid-nineteenth century. Through technological innovation, expanding capabilities, and hard work, people of diverse backgrounds established themselves upon a vast expanse of farms, turning Northeast Iowa’s fertile lands into one of the most agriculturally productive regions of the nation. Innovative from the beginning, Iowa farmers expanded agricultural production through the application of material, labor, and energy. The growth of agriculture and its impacts is shared throughout the heritage area and continues today as farms grow and diversify.

    "bodyText": "<p>Meeting minutes from the town council reveal how West Branch approved its first bridge on South Downey Street over the stream we now call Hoover Creek.</p> <p>Construction projects in our time require months— or years— of planning, detailed specifications, reviews, and letting of contracts. Building the bridge over Hoover Creek seems to have been almost simple. The council approved the proposed bridge at a meeting on June 4, 1877. They instructed the street commissioner, Thomas Reeves (also the town marshal) to handle the project with a budget of $75.</p> <p>At the very next meeting, July 17, the Reeves reported on the completed project and what it had cost— $62.94. Fifteen dollars of this amount were credit given to men who worked on the project instead of paying their local taxes in cash. The only itemized expense associated with the bridge was $12.73 paid to Charles Leech for lumber and posts.</p> <p>The finished bridge was 22 feet long, resting on cedar piles driven deep into the creek mud. A basic pony truss along the sides of the bridge deck helped support the structure. <br /> <br /> In 1917 he town rebuilt the bridge, twice constructed out of wood, with a steel beam and concrete span. The National Park Service built a replacement bridge in 2021, part of the reconstruction of Hoover Creek to reduce flooding. The newest bridge attempts to recreate the original appearance and concrete railing of the 1917 bridge. Cedar pilings recovered from the creek during construction may have been the footings for the 1877 bridge.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Hoover Creek at the South Downey Street Bridge 211 words Hoover Creek at the South Downey Street Bridge. 1 ½ minutes. The Hoover Creek meanders east-west through the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. The creek is just a few feet wide, with shrubs and a few trees along its banks. At Downey Street, the creek flows beneath the South Downey Street Bridge. Downey Street is a gravel road about 12 feet wide with a wooden boardwalk on either side. Elsewhere, there’s a strip of grass separating the boardwalks from the roadway, but at the bridge, the boardwalks come right up alongside the road. Boardwalks can be slick in wet weather, so watch your step. The bridge is about 25 feet long, bordered on each side by a four-foot-high wooden post-and-rail fence. It’s about ten feet down from the bridge to the creek below. From the east side of the bridge, the view is toward Parkside Drive, which runs north-south alongside the park. The Friends Meetinghouse is about 60 feet away, at 2:00 on the clock face. The visitor center is about 200 feet away, at 10:00. If you’re facing west from the bridge, the Presidential Library and Museum is at 11:00 and about 200 feet away. The Birth Cottage is at 2:00, about 60 feet from the bridge. End of message.",

It was a gift from the people of Belgium in gratitude for Hoover's famine relief efforts on their behalf during the First World War.</p> <h2>Expressions of Gratitude</h2> <p>After the war, Herbert Hoover was sent many gifts expressing the gratitude of the Belgian people for his humanitarian efforts. Some sent him beautifully embroidered flour sacks, like those on display at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum. Many Belgian children, refugees, and soldiers contributed to a fund to create this work of art.</p> <h2>Placement at the Historic Site</h2> <p>When the Belgians shipped the finished statue to California's Stanford University in 1922. It remained on campus until the President and Mrs. Hoover brought it to West Branch in 1939. They wanted it to be placed in a position where it was contemplating the house, which is why Isis sits in her throne-like chair facing the Birthplace Cottage.</p> <h2>Dedication to Children's Causes</h2> <p>The Statue of Isis represents just one of Hoover's many efforts regarding children's welfare. As President he increased the budget for children's programs. After his presidency, Hoover was chairman of the Boys' Clubs of America for 25 years. He raised money and helped open 500 new chapters. Hoover's global relief work also inspired the creation of UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, a leading advocate for children's welfare and rights around the world.</p> <h2>The Mysterious Goddess</h2> <p>Isis wears a veil, a symbol of the mysteries of life. Her right hand carries the torch of life-its three flames represent the past, present, and future. Her left hand holds the key of life. An ancient Egyptian goddess and an American President are an unlikely pairing. But it provides a powerful visual link between Hoover's childhood and his life's dedication to the welfare of others.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Statue of Isis 348 words Statue of Isis. Two minutes. First of two messages at this location. A bronze statue of a seated Egyptian goddess is located on the south side of the cement sidewalk that runs between the Friends Meetinghouse and the Presidential Library. A level concrete sidewalk about 40 feet long extends from the boardwalk along the west side of Downey Street. Near the intersection of Downey Street and sidewalk an exhibit panel titled \"Helping War Victims\" stands in the grass. The panel is described in the next message. A metal chain draped across four 3-foot metal posts creates a barrier between the sidewalk and the sculpture. The figure is larger than life-size. She faces north, across the creek toward the Herbert Hoover Birthplace Cottage 100 feet away. She sits on a narrow throne; the throne itself rests on a rectangular concrete base, 3 ½ feet high, 5 ½ feet wide, and more than 7 feet deep. Isis sits up perfectly straight—her bare feet together, her left hand clutching an Egyptian ankh symbol, her head held high as she looks straight ahead. She wears a flowing garment that covers her arms, legs, and torso and drapes over the back of her throne. A veil obscures her face, revealing only the outline of her eyes and nose. In her right hand, she holds a three-flamed lamp. A metal plaque on the front of the base measures 2 feet high by 2 ½ feet wide. In raised letters, it reads: “Isis… The Goddess of Life. I am that which was and is and will ever be…and no mortal has yet lifted the veil which covers me. Sculptured by the Belgian artist Puttemans for the Birthplace of Herbert Hoover. Presented by a committee of Belgian school children, Belgian refugees and soldiers of the Belgian Army.” End of text. Half-a-dozen evergreen trees form a small arc behind her. Twenty feet to her west, on the opposite side of the sidewalk is a small sitting area. It includes two wooden benches with a water fountain in between. End of message. Helping War Victims 414 words Panel: \"Helping War Victims.\" 2 ¼ minutes. Second of two messages at this location. This panel explains the presence of the statue of Isis at the historic site. The angled panel titled \"Helping War Victims\" stands across from Friends Meetinghouse, next to the walkway leading to the Statue of Isis. The panel is 36 inches wide and 24 inches deep. Below the title, text reads: \"The Statue of Isis, Egyptian goddess of life, symbolizes Herbert Hoover's humanitarian efforts. Belgians gave Hoover the bronze statue to thank him for his help in staving off famine in their country in World War I. Hoover, a wealthy mining engineer, had given up his career to organize, without pay, a war relief organization. He persuaded German invaders and British blockaders to allow shipments of food that fed millions of people in Belgium and northern France. After the war Hoover directed relief efforts across Europe. He devoted the rest of his life to public service.\" The main image is a black and white photograph of workers unloading a statue from the bed of a truck, which is parked on a ramp in a grassy field. Atop a rectangular pedestal, the seven and a half foot tall statue depicts the veiled Egyptian goddess Isis sitting on a throne. At the bottom of the main image on the right, a caption reads: \"The statue, created by Belgian sculptor Auguste Puttemans, was installed in 1939 as part of President and Mrs. Hoover's memorial landscape plans. They positioned Isis to face the Birthplace Cottage.\" A quote from a book \"Herbert Hoover's Home Town: The Story of West Branch, 1948,\" appears on the bottom left. In the quote, Maud Stratton offers more details about the statue: \"In her right hand she holds the lamp of life, three flames denoting the past, present and future. Her left hand carries, half hidden, the key of life.\" In a black and white photograph in the upper right corner of the panel, Hoover points to several sacks lying next to piles of crates. A sign behind the piles says, \"European Relief Council.\" A caption reads: \"Hoover inspects supplies for European war victims in 1921. A color inset photo shows a cream-colored flour sack, embroidered with flowers and with a lace border design. The words \"Belgian Relief Fund\" are imprinted at the top of the square. A caption reads: \"Relief recipients embroidered flour sacks and sent them as gifts to Hoover.\" End of message.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The 81 acres of tallgrass prairie reconstructed here offer a glimpse of an Iowa landscape that had almost vanished by the time Herbert Hoover's grandparents moved here in 1854. Prior to the settlement of West Branch, prairie covered 85 percent of Iowa. Trees were scarce until planted; the Hoovers imported lumber from farther north for construction of the president's birthplace. Tall native grasses, sprinkled with brilliantly colored wildflowers once covered these rolling hills for as far as the eye could see.</p> <h2>Valuable Farmland</h2> <p>Iowa's prairies became some of the most valuable farmland in the world. The plowed fields of the Miles Farm characterized the immediate landscape during Hoover's youth. Prairie remnants persisted along the creeks and railroad tracks where Hoover spent many boyhood hours exploring.</p> <h2>Young Bert Hoover: Sod Buster</h2> <p>Hoover enjoyed a keen interest in the natural world and often referred to boyhood experiences: \"I was taken for a summer to live with Uncle Pennington Minthorn in Sioux County, Iowa, where he was breaking in a prairie farm. We lived in a sod house and I was privileged to ride the lead horse of a team which was opening the virgin soil.\"</p> <h2>Lost Resource</h2> <p>The tradeoff is that today less than one percent of prairie land still exists in Hoover's home state. This is one reason the National Park Service restored this historic cultivated field to much of its original splendor. Because their root systems run as deep as the plants are tall, native prairie grasses are well-adapted for controlling runoff and stabilizing areas susceptible to erosion.</p> <h2>Hoover's Legacy of Public Lands Conservation</h2> <p>Herbert Hoover, an avid fisherman and proponent of outdoor recreation, saw the value in conserving natural resources. During his presidency, the size of our national forests expanded by more than two million acres, and the land designated for new national parks and monuments increased by 40 percent. In honor of his conservation achievements and his fondness for the outdoors, this prairie offers a quiet and dignified setting to commemorate the life of the 31st president.</p> <h2>Trails</h2> <p>This prairie offers over two miles of trails for hiking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and nature study. Trail maps are available from the visitor center or at the Tallgrass Prairie Observation Deck.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "Tallgrass Prairie Observation Deck 235 words Tallgrass Prairie Observation Deck - Area Description. 1 ¾ minutes. The Tallgrass Prairie Observation Deck can be reached from the gravesite parking area via a 265-foot roughly paved path. A short, 25-foot-long boardwalk continues from the end of the paved path, leading to the Observation Deck. The Observation Deck is a roughly circular wooden platform about 15 feet across. Three backless benches around the perimeter of the deck provide seating, and two interpretive signs near the south edge offer information about the prairie itself. The signs are described in separate messages. The Observation Deck is situated within the prairie, so the view all around is of the tallgrass and other prairie vegetation. During the summer, the dense grass is green and wildflowers are often in bloom; in the winter the landscape is a subdued shade of yellowish brown. Depending on the season and weather conditions, the vegetation could be anywhere from 1 foot to 10 feet high. Some trees and farm buildings may be visible above the top of the grass to the southeast. A two-mile network of prairie trails begins at the south end of the Observation Deck. These trails are dirt and mown-grass, and the surfaces can be uneven as they meander through the gently rolling hills of the prairie. So use your judgment if you choose to explore the prairie further. End of message.",

    "bodyText": "<p>This prairie offers over two miles of trails for hiking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and nature study. Trail maps are available from the visitor center or the park website.</p> <h3>Grasses</h3> <p>The most abundant prairie grass is big bluestem with some Indian grass, switchgrass, little bluestem, side-oats grama, and Canada wild rye. Botanists call these prairie grasses \"warm-season\" grasses, because they grow abundantly in hot weather. These grasses form their seed heads in late summer and fall.<br /> <br /> Small patches of Virginia wild rye and slough or cord grass may be found in wet parts of the prairie. The prairie includes about five acres of wet meadow. The remaining area is drier upland habitat.</p> <h3>Wildflowers</h3> <p>A colorful array of flowers mixes with the green, purple, and golden hues of native grasses from April until late October. Golden alexanders, Canada anemones, spiderworts, yellow and purple coneflowers, and butterfly milkweeds in spring and early summer. New England asters and numerous species of goldenrods attract monarch butterflies when they peak in late summer and early fall.</p> <h3>Nonnative Species</h3> <p>Numerous other species have appeared by natural reintroduction from outside the park. Nonnative species, including some attractive wildflowers, have escaped into the park as well.<br /> <br /> Nonnative plants and woody vegetation continue to degrade sections of the tallgrass prairie. Land uses surrounding the prairie and the proximity of ornamental plantings contribute to invasions of exotic species. Reed canary grass and shrubs have become abundant along the creek banks and rills of the prairie.<br /> <br /> In areas that are diverse and well-populated with native grasses and forbs, natural competition appears to be sustaining native plants. Treatment with prescribed fire, physical removal, and herbicides, followed by native seed collection and redistribution can help to control invasive and exotic species.</p> <h3>Birds</h3> <p>Herbert Hoover National Historic Site is on the Mississippi flyway, a major bird migration route. Many species rest and take refuge in the park's reconstructed tallgrass prairie and along its quiet stream. Their colors and songs add visible and audible vitality to the park's dignified commemorative setting.<br /> <br /> Park staff and volunteers monitor long-term changes in breeding bird populations to evaluate the quality of habitat the park provides. The presence or absence of grassland birds like sedge wrens, dickcissels, grasshopper sparrows, Henslow's sparrows, bobolinks, and eastern meadowlarks indicate the prairie's overall health. Populations of these species decline as prairies disappear from the landscape. Several species are of continental importance because of their dwindling numbers.</p>",

    "audioDescription": "Visitor Center Information Kiosk 487 words Panel: \"A President’s Rural Roots.\" 3 minutes. First of two descriptions at this location. The panel introduces the park, offers an orientation map, and displays photographs of its main features. The title appears at the top of the panel. The main photograph at the top shows a cottage with white wood-frame walls and a brown-shingled gable roof with a brick chimney, surrounded by a white picket fence. Introductory text identifies the cottage as the birthplace of Herbert Hoover, 31st President of the United States: \"Born in a modest two-room cottage, Herbert Hoover spent most of his first 11 years in West Branch. He went on to become the president of the United States - the first one born west of the Mississippi River. Here Hoover's parents and neighbors instilled in him the Quaker principles of honesty and hard work that formed his strong beliefs in self-reliance and American individualism. This commemorative landscape preserves historic features underlying Hoover's achievements as a mining engineer, humanitarian, and statesman.\" A quote from Eugene Lyons' 1964 book \"Herbert Hoover, A Biography\" appears below the introduction: \"Few American Presidents had such humble beginnings and were so authentically 'self-made' as Herbert Hoover.\" Below the photograph of the cottage, a map shows landmarks in the park. An arrow points to this panel's location near the Visitor Center parking lot with the words: \"You Are Here.\" The map shows walkways leading to the nearby Visitor Center, Blacksmith Shop, and Schoolhouse. Farther along are the Friends Meetinghouse, Statue of Isis, Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum, the gravesite of President and Mrs. Hoover, House of the Maples, Tallgrass Prairie Observation Deck, Hoover Presidential Foundation, two picnic shelters, and restrooms. Text to the left of the map offers information about touring the park: \"Get oriented at the Visitor Center. See exhibits and a film about Hoover and find information about self-guided tours. Be sure to visit the Birthplace Cottage, Presidential Library and Museum, and the graves of President Hoover and his wife Lou Henry Hoover. In this memorial park are also a blacksmith shop, Quaker meetinghouse, and schoolhouse.\" Three inset photographs appear along the bottom of the panel. In the left photo, two plain, rectangular, marble gravestones mark the gravesite of President and Mrs. Hoover. In the middle photo, US and Iowa flags fly from poles in front of the Presidential Library and Museum, a sprawling one-story building of rough-faced yellowish stone and a white portico. In the right photo, the Visitor Center features a one-story structure with a split roof that angles over the entryway. The National Park Service emblem is displayed on the Visitor Center's red brick south wall.

    "audioDescription": "Village Green Information Kiosk 564 words Panel: “A President’s Rural Roots.” 3 ½ minutes. The panel introduces the park, offers an orientation map, and displays photographs of its main features. The upright panel titled \"A President's Rural Roots\" stands at the edge of the village green near the overflow parking lot at the entrance to the park by the Visitor Center. The panel is 48 inches tall and 36 inches wide. The title appears at the top of the panel. The main photograph at the top shows a cottage with white wood-frame walls and a brown-shingled gable roof with a brick chimney, surrounded by a white picket fence. Introductory text identifies the cottage as the birthplace of Herbert Hoover, 31st President of the United States: \"Born in a modest two-room cottage, Herbert Hoover spent most of his first 11 years in West Branch. He went on to become the president of the United States - the first one born west of the Mississippi River. Here Hoover's parents and neighbors instilled in him the Quaker principles of honesty and hard work that formed his strong beliefs in self-reliance and American individualism. This commemorative landscape preserves historic features underlying Hoover's achievements as a mining engineer, humanitarian, and statesman.\" A quote from Eugene Lyons' 1964 book \"Herbert Hoover, A Biography\" appears below the introduction: \"Few American Presidents had such humble beginnings and were so authentically 'self-made' as Herbert Hoover.\" Below the photograph of the cottage, a map shows landmarks in the park. An arrow points to this panel's location near the Visitor Center parking lot with the words: \"You Are Here.\" The map shows walkways leading to the nearby Visitor Center, Blacksmith Shop, and Schoolhouse.

The Boy Scout Picnic Shelter is an outdoor pavilion approximately 20 feet wide and 35 feet long, oriented roughly north and south. The structure is open on all sides with brown wooden pillars holding up a gently sloping green shingled roof. The pillars are spaced 7 feet apart, and a horizontal crossbeam runs around the east, west, and north sides about four feet off the ground, restricting entrance to the south. A low cement ledge also runs along the east, west, and north sides ranging from a few inches to a foot in height. A rough stone fireplace stands at the center of the south façade, with its chimney rising up past the peak of the roof. You must enter to the left or right of the fireplace. A metal plaque on the front of the chimney reads: “This shelter is dedicated by the Boy Scouts in Iowa in tribute to the life of Herbert C. Hoover as a reminder that the road of opportunity he traveled is open to all American youth. August 10, 1954.” Inside, you’ll find two long picnic tables running the length of the space, about 8 feet apart. The floor is cement and several light bulbs hang down from the center of the wood-beamed ceiling. The backside of the fireplace features a grill, and a bulletin board to the left of the entrance offers information about park programs and events. Additional picnic tables are located on the grass outside, a few feet to the southeast of the shelter.

On his 80th birthday, Hoover gave a nationally televised speech at West Branch's elementary school. Afterwards he came here for the dedication of a bronze plaque honoring his life — 'a reminder that the road of opportunity he traveled is open for all American youth.' Both President and Mrs. Hoover supported national youth organizations like the Boys Clubs, Girl Scouts, and Boy Scouts.\" In the top right corner of the panel, a quote from Herbert Hoover in his 80th birthday address on August 10, 1954, states: \"As the shadows lengthen over my years, my confidence, my hopes and dreams for my countrymen are undimmed.\" In the photograph, Herbert Hoover stands inside the picnic shelter, smiling at friends sitting nearby. On a table, candles surround a tiered cake as the white-haired Hoover holds a knife. A caption reads: \"Hoover cuts his birthday cake after enjoying a lunch of fried chicken, corn, and potato salad.\" End of message.",

    "audioDescription": "Downey Street 513 words Panel: \"From Downey Street to Pennsylvania Avenue.\" 3 minutes. First of two descriptions at this location. This panel depicts the south Downey Street neighborhood as it was during Herbert Hoover's boyhood. The panel titled \"From Downey Street to Pennsylvania Avenue\" is located near the intersection of Downey and Penn Streets along the boardwalk. Looking toward Hoover's birthplace cottage, the angled panel is 42 inches wide and 24 inches deep. Below the title displayed in the illustration’s blue sky, introductory text reads: \"Herbert Clark Hoover was born on August 10, 1874, in a two-room cottage. He spent his early boyhood years on the edge of the village surrounded by farmlands. His parents, relatives, and many neighbors were Quakers whose daily lives were centered on their faith's beliefs. Herbert's mother Hulda tended to him and his siblings, Theodore and Mary. She also served as a recorded minister in the Quaker meeting. Jesse, a devoted father, worked hard as a blacksmith and businessman. Together they played major roles in forming the character of the boy who would become the 31st president of the United States.\" To the right of the introductory text, a quote from Herbert Hoover reads: \"My grandparents and parents came here in a covered wagon… The most formative years of my boyhood were spent here. My roots are in this soil.\" Below Hoover's quote, more text reads: \"The park is a commemorative landscape conceived by the Hoover family, the Hoover Birthplace Society, and the National Park Service.\" The illustration stretches across the width of the panel, providing a look at Hoover's boyhood neighborhood. A caption poses the question, \"How has the street changed?\" On the illustration, the view starts at a bridge on the left. Moving to the right, a white picket fence surrounds Hoover's modest birthplace cottage. A woman stands in the doorway. A caption notes that the cottage was \"built in 1871 by his father Jesse and grandfather Eli.\" A line connects the view of the old cottage with a modern photograph in the sky overhead. A caption reads: \"Tour the interior of Hoover's birthplace across the street.\" Doors stand open at Jesse Hoover's Blacksmith Shop and we can see someone working inside. A caption notes: \"Original 1871 shop faced Downey Street.\" Next to the Blacksmith Shop, a steeple stands tall at a Methodist Church. A caption reads: \"Built 1870, razed 1913, historic house moved here.\" The Garvin House occupies the property next door. A few children play outside. Farther on, the Crook's Hotel, a two-story building, is the last building shown on the illustration. Captions tell us that the Garvin House was built in 1872, and the hotel was built in 1870. The illustration shows a man riding a horse along Downey Street, and two men ride on a horse-drawn cart full of sacks. Walking toward the cart, another man carries a sack over his shoulder. On the street today, the blacksmith shop is now farther from Downey Street than the birthplace cottage and faces Penn Street, and the church no longer stands. End of message Historic Homes on Downey Street 201 words Historic Homes on Downey Street. One and a half minutes. Second of two descriptions at this location. Downey Street is a beige gravel road about 12 feet wide, running north-south through the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site. The road is only for pedestrians. There’s a wooden boardwalk on either side of Downey Street, separated from the roadway by a strip of grass. A few trees and benches punctuate the grass borders. The boardwalks can be slick in wet weather, so watch your step. There are five historic homes on Downey Street between the South Downey Bridge in the south and Wetherell Street to the north. On the east side of the street, from south to north, they are the Varney House, the Leech House, and the Laban Miles House. On the west side of the street, from south to north, you’ll find the C.E. Smith House and Garvin Cottage. These homes are not open to the public. Each is described separately in its own stop. A few of the homes have stepping stones and hitching posts in front. One of the hitching posts is decorated with a small metal horse’s head. End of message.",

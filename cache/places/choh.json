The black and white sign is titled in the top left corner: <br />Abner Cloud House<br />Text below describes the history of the Abner Cloud House:<br />This house witnessed the building of the C&O Canal. Abner Cloud, a miller who had come here from Pennsylvania, built the house in 1801. Cloud's mill was about 200 yards upstream. The basement of the house was used by Cloud to store grain and flour, and the family lived in the upper floors. Restoration was completed in 1976, with much assistance from the Colonial Dames of America, Chapter III. The top two floors are now their headquarters.<br />The full background of the sign is an active scene of a three-story white house sitting alongside a canal. A canal boat passes on the right, two people canoe from the left, and three more people float by on a boat at the canal's far end. Next to them on the path is a donkey-drawn carriage being followed by a dog. A man on a horse walks in front of them, amongst three women in dresses. Other women and girls in dresses with a dog watch from the close side of the canal. Text at the top center reads:<br />This painting of the C&O Canal depicts the Abner Cloud House as a bustling place of commerce and tourism during the mid to late 1800s.<br />In the upper right corner is an image of a man sitting at the front end of a long, thin canal boat floating from right to left. A second man is back in the far end of the boat. Text to the left of them reads: [LINK 3]<br />George Washington's Patowmack Canal, completed in 1802, provided Cloud access to Georgetown markets. Long, narrow boats, called sharpers, transported his flour, entering the Potomac River just upstream from here, near Little Falls.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

You will pass the three-story white Abner Cloud House on your left. <br />Continue straight over a ten-foot-long bridge and stone tunnel to your right. The gravel road will turn left and descend as you go into a tunnel after about two hundred feet. This portion of the road is poorly deteriorated. <br />Upon exiting the one-hundred-foot tunnel, you will reach an open gravel space about sixty feet long. To the right, in the northwest corner is a two by three-foot wayside. The white sign is titled in the top left corner and reads:<br />Abner Cloud Mill<br />Echos of Milestones<br />Text beneath describes activity that occurred at the mill:<br />Baking bread, frying cornbread and eating \"stick to your ribs\" oatmeal, all have one thing in common: their ingredients started out at a grist mill. Decades before the sounds of lockhorns and mule hooves clopping by, mills were popping up along the Potomac River and the early Patowmack Canal that skirted Little Falls. The area in front of you was occupied by the grist mill, built and operated by Abner Cloud in 1801. Water supplied to this mill came from the Patowmack Company Skirting Canal.<br />Cloud operated the mill until his death in 1812, and his widow, Suzanne, continued to operate it until 1852. The mill changed hands throughout the following decades, at various times known as the Frizzle Mill and Cloud-Edes Mill. The National Park Service uncovered the building remains in 2010. It is speculated that wheat, corn, and oat flour milled here was carried by the C&O Canal boats. As you view the ruins, imagine the sound of the water wheel on the nearby stream pushing the mill stones as they clatter round and round.<br />The sign features a black and white picture in the upper right corner of the ruins of a two-story stone building. Three sets of window or door openings are on the first floor and three window openings line the 2nd floor front. Two more openings are on the first and second floor levels on the side of the building, which stands amongst a dead tree and brush. Text below reads:<br />Cloud Mill ruins, ca. 1914.<br />Photograph from the Rambler Collection, <br />Courtesy Historical Society of Washington, DC.<br />The bottom half of the sign shows a black and white photograph of four canal boats sitting in line in still water on a canal. <br />Six feet to the left of the sign is a thirty-foot wooden bridge with handrails on both sides. The bridge carries over a rushing canal that feeds into the Potomac River. Stone blocks line the inner south wall of the canal and three steel beams span the stream on the north side of the bridge.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

The top of the aqueduct has a water way for canal boats and a towpath for mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 15 feet wide and its bottom is about four feet lower than the towpath. To get to the aqueduct start from the Antietam Creek Parking Lot. From the parking lot head towards the wooden pedestrian bridge that passes over a small creek to the towpath. The bridge is at the midway point of the western edge of the lot. The bridge has wooden railings on both sides. Walk across the bridge and turn left onto the towpath. Follow the towpath for three tenths of a mile to reach the aqueduct. Here the towpath narrows to about three feet. On your left is a drop of about five feet to the bottom of the canal waterway. There is no barrier between the towpath and the drop. On your right you can see the Antietam creek flowing into the Potomac River. There is a metal rail between the towpath and the river.",

Designated a <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/heritageareas/index.htm\">National Heritage Area</a> in 2019, AFNHA covers sixteen counties in West Virginia (Barbour, Braxton, Grant, Greenbrier, Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral, Morgan, Nicholas, Pendleton, Preston, Pocahontas, Randolph, Tucker, Upshur, Webster) and two counties in western Maryland (Garrett, Allegany). <br /> <br /> Forest heritage is the ongoing story how the forest shapes history and culture, and how both nature and humans shape the forest. The mountains and forests have played a central role in central Appalachian life since the first indigenous inhabitants, and the landscape continues to cultivate local traditions, folkways, language, crafts, dance, music, festivals, and fairs. Logging after the Civil War fueled the industrial revolution and provided an important livelihood for workers, but the demand for timber decimated the forests. Today, scientific forestry and public land holdings have allowed the forests to regrow, providing sustainable forest products while offering an abundance of outdoor recreational opportunities, including hiking, biking, fishing, hunting, camping, climbing, and skiing. The history of the region is represented by its plentiful historical societies, museums, and historic preservation efforts. Forest communities and main streets offer a variety of small town experiences, with arts, shopping, local foods, and a hearty welcome for visitors. <br /> <br /> AFNHA is managed by the grassroots nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.appalachianforest.us/about.htm\">Appalachian Forest Heritage Area, Inc.</a> (<strong>AFHA</strong>). AFHA partners with organizations with shared goals and is developing a management plan to coordinate partnership efforts to conserve the area’s forests and strengthen rural communities through conservation, historic preservation, education, heritage tourism, and sustainable economic development.<br /> <br /> Notable points of interest in the region include:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.appalachianforest.us/DiscoveryCenter/index.htm\">Appalachian Forest Discovery Center</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Canaan_Valley/visit/plan_your_visit.html\">Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/choh/index.htm\">Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historical Park</a> </li> <li><a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/mnf/\">Monongahela National Forest</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pohe/index.htm\">Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail</a></li> <li><strong>Excursion trains, such as the <a href=\"https://wvstateparks.com/park/cass-scenic-railroad-state-park/\">Cass Scenic Railroad</a></strong></li> <li><strong>Historical societies and small museums</strong></li> <li><strong>State parks and state forests </strong></li> <li><strong>Welcoming rural communities</strong></li> </ul>",

Ferry Hill is best known as the home of Henry Kyd Douglas, Confederate Officer and author of his Civil War personal account, \"I Rode With Stonewall.\"<br /> <br /> In the 18th and early 19th century German settlers migrated from Pennsylvania south into Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, where they then farmed the rich soil. These settlers crossed the Potomac using Packhorse Ford and later Blackford's Ferry below Ferry Hill. Come the 1830s the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal crossed this north/south route, tapping the river waters to provide a controlled water transportation route into western Maryland.<br /> <br /> John Blackford who built and resided at Ferry Hill benefited from this crossroads of commerce. Unlike southern plantations, Ferry Hill profited from not just one cash crop, such as tobacco or cotton, but from a variety of crops, including grains, wheat, corn, an orchard, and even lumbering.<br /> <br /> \"I was with the company that set fire to [the bridge], and when . . . I saw the glowing windows in my home on the hill beyond the river . . . I realized that the war had begun.\"<br /> - Henry Kyd Douglas, 1861<br /> <br /> By 1860, Ferry Hill shifted through marriage into the Douglas family as Reverend Robert Douglas. As the Civil War began in 1861, Reverend Douglas' son Henry Kyd enlisted in the Confederate army where he served under Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson. Both young Douglas and Ferry Hill became fully engaged in the war. Douglas and his unit burned the bridge crossing the Potomac to limit Union forces from entering into Virginia, and Union forces burned the Ferry Hill barn.<br /> <br /> Throughout the war, Boteler's Ford, also known as Packhorse Ford, a mile downstream from Ferry Hill, provided a frequently used crossing for soldiers from both North and South. Due to its strategic location on the border, Ferry Hill was occupied at various times by both armies. During the 1862 Antietam campaign Ferry Hill served as a headquarters, hospital and artillery base for Confederate forces. During the Battle of Antietam residents of Sharpsburg, fled west along the C&O Canal towpath and sought shelter at Killiansburg Cave, waiting for the fighting to pass. One resident noted that the cave \"... was crowded with a variety of people of all classes.\" Following Antietam, the Battle of Shepherdstown played out along the river below the Ferry Hill. As troops moved on to fight elsewhere, Ferry Hill was scarred with it fences burned, livestock gone, and fields trampled.<br /> <br /> \"We encamped near Shepherdstown and I visited my home across the Potomac and saw the desolation of war. My beautiful home was a barren waste and a common, and the blackened walls of the burnt barn stood up against the sky as a monument of useless and barbarous destruction. I felt that it would be hard for me, going into Pennsylvania, to set aside all ideas of retaliation.\"<br /> - Henry Kyd Douglas, \"I Rode With Stonewall\"<br /> <br /> Then during the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863, and the Monocacy Campaign in 1864, Boteler's Ford provided a crossing for both Union and Confederate troops. And, Ferry Hill again suffered the impact of the war.<br /> <br /> At the end of the Civil War, Ferry Hill lost its previous grandeur. Henry Kyd Douglas moved to Hagerstown to pursue his career as a lawyer as the site then went into the hands of Henry Kyd's sister, Nancy. In the 20th century, Ferry Hill operated as a pig farm, and by mid-century, as a restaurant. In 1979, the C&O Canal National Historical Park headquarters moved into Ferry Hill and operated here until 2002. For the past ten years, Ferry Hill shifted into a slower period as the house was opened for tours during summer weekends.</p>",

A six-foot long wood bench is set on the north side of the space. Just beyond the sign, to the south six-foot wide gravel and wood steps that leads down to the Crescent Trail pedestrian path below. A few feet north beyond the bench about six black granite blocks lay partially buried alongside the towpath.<br />The yellow sign is titled across a black border on the top that reads: \"Georgetown Incline Plane.\" Text below describes the creation of the Georgetown incline plane:<br />Here, in 1876, an engineering marvel was built. The largest incline plane in the world and the first built in the United States, carried canal boats to and from the Potomac River. The incline plane was used to help clear heavy boat traffic in Georgetown; canal boats often log-jammed while waiting to unload. Boats left the canal through a lock and entered the incline plane's large water filled car; the water from the car was drained as two stone-filled, counter-balancing cars, moving in the opposite direction, lowered the boat 480 feet to the river, and on to its Georgetown port.<br />To the right is a black and white image showing canal boats lined up along the right, A border to the left divides a road on the left. Text below reads:<br />The incline plane helped move boats to Georgetown docks faster.<br />The bottom two thirds of the sign show a color drawing of a ramp with a canal boat to the left and an arrow indicating its movement to the right. At the right side, two rows of four boxes are moving up the ramp to the left. A canal runs across the top of the image from left to right. A point indicates that you are standing at the intersection of the ramp and the canal. In the top left, a second canal boat waits to enter the ramp. At the bottom right, the ramp leads back down into a river.<br />A faded black and white photograph to the right shows a view looking up from the lower end of a ramp. Two boxes are lined up in a row on the ramp. Text to the left reads:<br />The incline plane was one of the structures selected to represent American engineering achievements at the Paris Exposition of 1878.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Along the west side of Lock 5, a cement-paved area, fifty feet to the north and south, runs eighty feet to the west where it connects to the Inlet Canal that runs parallel to Lock 5. The area rises about four feet along its northern end.<br />From the Lock 5 bridge west side, a second wood bridge about eighty feet across the gravel path, with railings on both sides, carries about forty feet over the Inlet Canal and connects to the south end of the C&O Canal towpath. Water from the inlet canal flows underneath the bridge and connects to water from Lock 5.<br />At the west end of the bridge, to the right, sits a two by three-foot wayside. The faded sign is titled across a block border in white lettering to read:<br />Inlet Locks<br />Text along a yellow border below reads:<br />Eight dams and one steam pump were built along the river to funnel water into the canal in times of drought of low water, usually during the height of summer; river levels dropped dramatically. The canal could not get enough water from the river and the boat traffic would stop. This caused a loss of revenue for the canal company and the loss of a living for boat captains.<br />To the right is a faded and scratched color image of a man in a tan jacket and hat facing to the right. Text to his left reads:<br />As a young man, George Washington surveyed the Potomac River and discovered its riches. Part of the Patowmack Canal, which he championed, ran from here to the Abner Cloud House at mile 3.1.<br />Dam 1, a Little Falls, diverted water to this inlet lock, watering the canal from Lock 5 to Georgetown.<br />A faded image further right appears to be a map of a canal. A sign reading \"You Are Here\" indicates your location to the left.<br />Three-fourths of the sign below are a color image of a river flowing over a wide dam, a strip of land and towpath to the right, and further right a canal with water flowing top to bottom. An inlet lock is identified just north of the dam along the strip of land. Below is a mule crossover bridge with bridge wall lining the river's edge. Mules walk up the towpath from the south.<br />Text in the top left corner reads:<br />Inlet Lock<br />Dams and inlet locks were the engineering devices used to provide water for the canal.<br />A trail to the left of the sign runs north about one hundred fifty feet to the Inlet Lock. A small brown sign set to the right of the trail reads \"Inlet Lock.\" Two wood doors, angled inward slightly, block the lock's lower south end. Cement walls about six feet long are on either side. A wood railing sits atop the gate.<br />Along the west side of the lock, six four-foot wide cement steps lead up to the top of the lock and an eight-foot high cement wall lines the left side of the steps. A metal fence runs along the lock's east side. The trail continues around to the backside of the lock, where canal water flows in from the north. The lock doors are angled out slightly toward the north at this end.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

By closing and opening the lock gates in the right order, one can fill or empty the lock chamber.

Today, visitors can still travel the towpath, tracing the same route as mules and canal boats more than 100 years ago.<br /> <br /> From the shore of Rock Creek, you can get a view up through Lift Lock 1 and see the staircase of the four lift locks in Georgetown.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(262 words)<br />C&O Canal Lock 1 is the southernmost and easternmost lock in the Chesapeake and Ohio canal system. It is located in downtown Washington, DC in the Georgetown area, east of 29th street, NW, south of M street and Pennsylvania avenue, and north of K street. <br />From the intersection of M and 29th streets, travel south on 29th street four hundred feet. Turn left onto the brick walkway and proceed about two hundred feet.<br />A one foot long brown sign with white lettering is set in the grass lawn about four feet off the brick walkway to the right that reads: \"Lock 1\"<br />Twenty feet to the south is the C&O Canal. Water passes through the twenty-five-foot-wide canal from west to east and empties into Rock Creek about two hundred yards to the west.<br />The wood remains of the lock are set along the canal edge, including a twenty-five-foot-long wood beam that runs parallel to the canal. A wood gate resembling a ladder sits on the face of the brick canal on its opposite side. The canal is about fifteen feet deep and shallow water flows slowly at the bottom. Ivy has overtaken much of the lock on the opposite side and hangs over the canal edge.<br />The grass lawn is about twenty-five feet wide and slopes down about five feet from the brick walkway above. A one-foot border of stone blocks lines the grass lawn edge as it meets the canal. The lawn spans about one hundred yards, from Rock Creek Parkway on the west end to 29th street to the east.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(318 words)<br />C&O Canal Lock 2 is located in downtown Washington, DC in the Georgetown neighborhood, west of 29th street, NW, east of 30th street, south of H Street Main street, and north of K street. <br />From the intersection of M street and 29th street, proceed south on 29th street about two hundred seventy feet. Turn right onto the brick walkway and proceed eighty feet. Set in the ground about ten feet off the walkway on the left, to the south, is a one-foot wide brown sign that reads in white lettering: \"Lock 2\"<br />A brick office building is on the north side of the walkway at this location. To the south, a strip of grass runs about one hundred feet west and fifteen feet south to a one-foot stone border that lines the canal edge. As you face the canal to the south a forty-foot oak tree is ten feet to the left, along canal's edge. Another twenty feet to the left a 29th street bridge goes over the canal.<br />Still facing the canal, about forty feet to the right are two twenty-foot long wood lock beams set above both sides of the canal, connected to wood frames that line the canal walls. The beams are angled upward from west to east above the canal edge. Water in the canal drops from this point about five feet down as it flows from right to left.<br />Further to the right, about twenty wood beams, six feet long each, lay across the canal floor in tall grass, about two feet apart. This is the dry dock. The walkway and canal rise to the west, as they approach a bridge over the canal on 30th street. The canal widens about four feet from east to west after the lock. The walls of the canal arch inward again and narrow about four feet at the bridge underpass to the west under 30th street.<br /> END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(426 words)<br />C&O Canal Lock 3 is located in downtown Washington, DC in the Georgetown neighborhood, west of 30th street, NW, east of Thomas Jefferson street, south of M street, and north of K street. <br />From the intersection of M and 30th streets, travel south on 30th street about three hundred seventy feet. Turn right and proceed along the brick walkway about one hundred twenty feet. Lock 3 will be on your left.<br />Lock 3 has been restored and the twenty-five-foot wood beams, gates, components, and stone blocks that line the canal walls all appear new. Two sets of wood lock gates sit about ninety feet apart from each other in the canal. Water cascades down about four feet from the upstream western gate and passes through the downstream eastern gate and under the 30th street bridge.<br />The south side brick plaza of Lock 3 features a two-foot high wood bench that spans about sixty feet along the walkway. Five six-foot tall young trees are set in the plaza along the canal on this side.<br />The north side is situated with four wood benches set about ten feet back from the canal's edge. In front of them is a one-foot wide brown sign that reads: \"Lock 3.\" Behind the benches is a small patch of grass, about twenty by ten feet. A water fountain is at the east end of the lawn. Set at the western end is a bronze bust statue. <br />The bust is about three feet tall and depicts Justice William O. Douglas in open collared dress shirt. It rests on a four-foot-tall, two square foot granite pedestal. Etched on the pedestal front face is written:<br />In Recognition of Justice William O. Douglas for his Contributions Toward the Establishment of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historic Park<br />National Park Service <br />May 17, 1977<br />At the north east corner of 30th street and the canal walkway sits a one square foot bronze plaque with cement base atop a brick platform. An inscription on the plaque reads:<br />Georgetown Historic District<br />Has Been Designated a Registered National Historic Landmark<br />Under the Provisions of the Historic Sites Act of August 21, 1935 This Site Possesses Exceptional Value in Commemorating and Illustrating the History of the United States<br />U.S. Department of the Interior<br />National Park Service<br />1967<br />Towards the west end of the lock, the canal widens about four feet on either side. The walkway rises slightly at an incline towards the west end and a bridge carrying over Thomas Jefferson street, where another wood gate sits underneath the bridge.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "audioDescription": "(1012 words)C&O Canal Lock 4 is located in downtown Washington, DC in the Georgetown neighborhood, east of 31st street, NW, west of Thomas Jefferson street, south of M street, and north of K street.From the intersection of M and Thomas Jefferson streets, travel south four hundred forty feet on Thomas Jefferson street. Turn right along the brick walkway about seventy feet and Lock 4 will be on your left.A red wood railing runs along the edge of the walkway. Just beyond is a one-foot wide brown sign that reads: \"Lock 4.\" A three by four-foot wayside sign sits two feet left along the rail. The sign is titled in the top right corner: \"At All Hours.\" A subtitle in read below reads:It shall be their duty, at all hours, by night as well as by day, to pass all boats and floats presenting themselves at their locks.Charles Mercer, President, C&O Canal CompanyText below describes the operation of the canal lock operators and system:At All HoursIt shall be their duty, at all hours, by night as well as by day, to pass all boats and floats presenting themselves at their locks.Charles Mercer, President, C&O Canal CompanyEvery time his boat passed through a lock, a boat captain put his life and livelihood in the hands of the locktender. The wooden lock gates were a delicate balance between safety and efficiency. They had to be light enough to allow one man to move them, yet strong enough to hold back 140,000 gallons of water. A skilled locktender could judge and adjust the flow of water in or out of the lock to minimize the risk to boat and lock.Locktenders were responsible for the safe operation and maintenance of liftlocks. Neglect or carelessness could mean disaster. In exchange for a small monthly salary, an acre of land and a house, locktenders heeded the horn blast of boatmen even at 2 a.m. or on Sunday. After all, time was money.A black and white picture below shows a canal boat sitting at a lock. A man holds ropes connected to the boat from the towpath on the right. A woman stands behind him further along the towpath.Along the right side of the sign are three drawings with green backgrounds showing a boat as it passes through the blue water of a canal and lock. The top of the column states: How A Lock WorksLift locks raised and lowered boats to overcome changes in elevation.The top image shows a boat entering a lock. The upstream gate is open. Text below reads:A boat heading downstream enters the lock. Mules are unhitched and the locktender closes the upstream gates.The image below shows the upstream gate closed. The boat seems to be sitting lower in the canal. Text reads:The locktender opens the downstream paddles. Water flows out and the boat is lowered.In the bottom image, the boat is leaving the lock area, and continuing down the canal. Text reads:With water levels equal, the locktender opens the downstream gates. The mules are hitched and the boat moves on.The wayside stands between the upstream and downstream lock gates. To the right about twenty feet an oak tree sits along the canal edge. Just beyond it is a wood walkway, about ten feet long, that leads from the brick walkway to the canal's edge. Wood rails line the sides and the space is chained off at the walkway. A six-inch wide cobblestone border lines the walkway edge. Six feet to the right along the path and before a second oak tree is another wayside, titled:Creating a National ParkAn image above shows about ten people walking along a path A man in white hat and shirt is in the center. Text in the top right corner reads:Douglas, in the white shirt, and his companions hiked over 20 miles a day. Few hikers could maintain Douglas's pace.Text below reads:Creating a National ParkIt is a refuge, a place of retreat, a long stretch of quiet and peace at the Capital's back door...William O. DouglasLook around you. The park you stand in exists because people cared. In January 1954, William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court of the United States responded to a Washington Post editorial recommending that the C&O Canal be turned into a parkway. Writing in support of preserving the canal as a national park, Douglas wrote, \"It is a sanctuary for everyone who loves woods - a sanctuary that would be utterly destroyed by a fine two lane highway.\" He invited the editors and other reporters to join him on a hike of the entire canal to enjoy its beauty and better understand his point. Merlo Pusey, who wrote the editorial, and his editor Robert Estabrook accepted the challenge. On March 22, 1954, the hike began near Cumberland. Douglas and his companions invited authorities on the natural and cultural history of the Potomac River and the C&O Canal to join them. The hikers learned about the canal and enjoyed the scenery. After the hike, Estabrook wrote an editorial in the Post supporting setting the canal aside as a national park. The walk, and the news stories it generated, motivated hundreds to fight to save the canal.",

Two wooden pedestrian bridges span the locks to the towpath and the lockhouse on the other side. The bridges have wooden railings. After going over the first bridge continue straight for about 10 feet to reach the second bridge. About five feet past the second bridge is the towpath, which is parallel to the locks. The lock walls are made of stone blocks. Four walls create two lock chambers that are about ten feet deep each. At the upstream and downstream entrance to the locks are wooden swing gates.",

This is where the entrance road meets the parking lot. Follow the entrance road about two tenths of a mile, until on the left a gravel access trail splits from the road. Follow the access trail for about one tenth of a mile and turn left onto the towpath. The lock is 40 feet up the towpath on the right. It sits about eight feet from the towpath and runs parallel to it. The lock walls are made of stone blocks. The two walls create the lock chamber which is about twelve feet deep. The upstream and downstream entrance gates are missing. A wooden pedestrian bridge spans the lock at the halfway point. The bridge has two wooden railings. Near the bridge entrance stand two info panels. One on the left and one on the right.",

    "audioDescription": "(328 words) Lock 62 is located along the towpath in Oldtown, Maryland. To access it, go to the Paw Paw Tunnel Drive-in Campground parking area off of MD-51. From the parking lot is a short, 50-foot path with a slight incline that leads up to the towpath. Once on the gravel towpath, make a right to head downstream towards Lock 62. Lock 62 is about 1.9 miles down the towpath but at about a half a mile, you will approach Paw Paw Tunnel. It is 3,118 feet long with wooden railings on the left side and the wall of the tunnel on the right. These are the original railings and contain rope burns from when the canal boats were pulled through the tunnel by mules. At the downstream exit of the tunnel is a wooden boardwalk with railings on the left side. Stay on this for about 0.15 of a mile until getting back on the gravel section of the towpath. Head down another 0.9 of a mile and the lock will be to your left. The lock is about 2 feet from the towpath and runs parallel to it. The lock is about 95 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep. Two large walls of stone and treated wood make up the sides of the lock. The upstream and downstream wooden lock gates are missing. A wooden bridge crosses over the upstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Crossing the bridge puts you in a grassy area between the lock and a bypass flume. Across from the lock, on the other side of the towpath are the remains of the stone foundation of the lockhouse. It is about 5 feet away from the towpath. On the downstream side of the foundation is a water pump with potable water and about 100 feet further downstream is a chemical toilet about 5 feet from the towpath on the right.

    "bodyText": "Along the 184.5 miles of the canal are 74 lift locks. These locks were put into place to help boats overcome the 605-foot elevation change between Georgetown and Cumberland. The C&O Canal is like a staircase, canal boats traveled along the flat sections and used the locks to take a “step up or down” about eight feet. The locks typically had hand-operated miter gates that were simple and followed Leonardo da Vinci’s original 1485 design. Entering the lock was the most demanding part of canalling.  <br /> <br /> Lock 68, also known as Crabtree’s Lock, was completed in late 1849 or early 1850. It is the 10th of the upper 13 locks that was constructed as a “composite lock”, or a lock made with more than one material. It is made of kyanized (treated) wood and uncut stone. The use of wood created many problems and some sections eventually had to be replaced with concrete. On the other side of the lock is a bypass flume that allowed water to bypass the lock to water the level below.<br /> <br /> The nickname of the lock comes from two generations of the Crabtree family serving as locktenders in the two-and-a-half story lockhouse that is adjacent to the lock.<br /> <br /> At this site, there is also an old steel and wooden bridge that once connected Rt. 51 to a ferry that crossed the Potomac River to South Branch Depot (later known as French Station on the B&O, and then, just South Branch) in West Virginia. The bridge was rebuilt in 1865 and again in 1918. The original was a wood pivot bridge that was destroyed during the Civil War. The current bridge follows a Warren Truss design.<br /> <br /> On the other side of the lock is the Potomac Forks Hiker-Biker Campsite.<br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "(314 words) Lock 68 is located along the towpath in Oldtown, Maryland. To access it, go to the Town Creek Aqueduct parking area. Through the gates is a small gravel path with a slight decline that veers to the left after about 30 feet. Go straight about 30 more feet to get to the gravel towpath. Turn right to head upstream and walk about 2 miles to get to Lock 68. It will be on your right. Just before Lock 68, you will go under an old steel bridge. A few feet past the bridge is a 10-foot wide grassy berm that runs along the downstream end of the lock and leads to a 15-foot wide grassy strip in between the lock and the bypass flume. The lock is about 95 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep. Two large walls of stone, treated wood, and concrete make up the sides of the lock. A wooden bridge crosses over the upstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Crossing the bridge from the towpath also puts you in the 15-foot wide grassy strip in between the lock and the bypass flume. Straight across from the wooden bridge, is another wooden bridge with railings that passes over the bypass flume. On the other side is a camping area. There is a small dirt path that veers to the left for about 15 feet, that then develops into a straighter path that runs parallel to the canal. Straight ahead, about 30 feet, is a picnic table with a small grill right behind it. About 30 feet further is a well pump with potable water. From the towpath, the lock sits about 5 feet away. On the other side of the towpath is a two-and-a-half story white frame lockhouse that is about 3 feet from the towpath. End of description.",

The parking lot is laid out as a circle, but the parking spots don’t start until about 100 feet in from the turn off from Green Spring Road. In the first row of parking spots, on the side closest to the parking entrance within the circle, is a park bulletin board. Just to the left, is a little dirt walkway with a slight incline that veers to the left. This little 20-foot path leads to a grassy area along a watered section of the canal.

There is a small, 15-foot wooden bridge that crosses over the upstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Once across the bridge, walk about 5 more feet to get to the gravel towpath. Turn left to head downstream. About 70 feet ahead are gates blocking vehicles from entering the towpath from Green Spring Road with enough space for pedestrians and cyclist to pass through. After walking past these, about 10 feet away is Green Spring Road. Once you cross the road, there will be another set of gates blocking vehicles from entering the towpath. Go straight through and head down about a quarter of a mile. On the left, about 5 feet from the towpath, is the lock, which runs parallel to the towpath.

In the first row of parking spots, on the side closest to the parking entrance within the circle, is a park bulletin board. Just to the left, is a little dirt walkway with a slight incline that veers to the left. This little 20-foot path leads to a grassy area along a watered section of the canal. Once on flat surface, walk about 20 feet forward and the canal will be about 30 feet away from your right. About 50 feet straight ahead is Lock 70. There is a small, 15-foot wooden bridge that crosses over the upstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Once across the bridge, walk about 5 more feet to get to the gravel towpath. Turn right to head upstream and walk 0.34 of a mile. Lock 71 will be to your right. It is about 5 feet from the towpath and runs parallel to it. The lock is about 95 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 16 feet deep. Two large walls of stone, treated wood, and concrete make up the sides of the lock. The upstream and downstream wooden lock gates are missing. A wooden bridge crosses over the upstream section of the lock. There are wooden railings on both sides of the bridge. Crossing the bridge puts you on the other side of the lock on a grassy berm with the remnants of a bypass flume a few feet from the downstream edge of the lock. Across from the lock, on the other side of the towpath, is a two-and-a-half story white framed lockhouse. It is about 10 feet away from the towpath. End of description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>Georgetown was once an industrial area. The building across the canal is the former Capital Traction Powerhouse, which provided power for the streetcars in Georgetown. There were outtake pipes that were used to blow off steam from the boilers. Early on the morning of September 11, 2016, the Spong family was moored to the concrete wall theat ran beneath the powerhouse, right at a steam pipe. At usual time, 6 am, the powerhouse blew out the boilers and the steam burst and forced super hot steam into the cabin of the boat where the children were sleeping. Mrs. Spong tried to save them and was severely scalded. Mr. Spong also rushed to save his children. Tragically, all three children, John (age 13,) Samuel (age 11,) and Sarah (age 6) were fatally injured.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "(241 words)<br />The C&O Canal Outtake is located west of Wisconsin avenue, NW along the C&O Canal in the Georgetown neighborhood in Washington, DC.<br />From the intersection of M street and Wisconsin avenue NW, travel south on Wisconsin avenue about two hundred seventy-five feet. Turn right, before the bridge overpass, and proceed about one hundred feet through a brick plaza area. A staircase leading down will be on the left. Follow the staircase and turn right at the towpath. Proceed about two hundred feet and you will be at the C&O Canal Outtake.<br />The canal is overgrown with tall grass at this location. Shallow water gently flows through the grass and reeds. The north side of the canal towpath is bordered by a seventy-foot tall stone wall. Across the canal is the red brick side of a two-story building. Along the bottom of the building is an old stone foundation about three feet tall. Set in the foundation is a round open pipe, about one-foot wide, curved to face downward two feet above the water line. A second opening sits one foot to the left. Ivy grows up the side of the brick building.<br />To the east, the Wisconsin avenue bridge is visible a few hundred yards away, running about forty feet above. The 31st street bridge sits one block beyond. To the west about two hundred feet, a pedestrian walkway connects to the second-floor level of the brick building across the canal. <br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "The C&O Canal aqueducts are “water bridges” that carried canal boats over the creeks and rivers that flow into the Potomac River. Built in 1832, the Catoctin Aqueduct is the fourth of eleven such “works of art” on the canal.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The Catoctin Creek Aqueduct was known as the \"Crooked Aqueduct\" because canal boats had to make a sharp turn to cross it. From its original creation, the Catoctin Creek Aqueduct's structural integrity was questionable. The elliptical arch in the center was not as structurally sound as the semicircle arches on either side. The aqueduct began sagging in the early 1900s. It leaked and was prone to flooding. In 1973, two years after Congress established the C&O Canal National Historical Park, it collapsed, leaving only a small piece standing.<br data-text=\"true\" /> <br /> The Park Service gathered up the aqueduct’s stones and buried them with the hopes that someday the aqueduct would be restored. Nearly 35 years later, a restoration project gained enough funding to rebuild. The four hundred and fifty-nine stones where uncovered and the engineering crew began to fit the blocks together like a giant 3-demensional puzzle. Each stone was measured, and the crew used those measurements to create foam stones. Historic photos were then used to identify where individual stones were positioned. Missing stones or those in poor condition were replaced. In a little over a year, construction was complete. Today, new viewing areas and waysides allow visitors to learn about the structure and the efforts to rebuild it.",
    "audioDescription": "(268 words) Catoctin Aqueduct is located along the towpath in Jefferson, Maryland. It is 92 feet long with a three-arch construction. This aqueduct has an elliptical center arch with two semicircle arches on either side of the center arch. The top of the aqueduct has a water way for the canal boats and a towpath for the mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 15 feet wide and its bottom is about six feet lower than the towpath. To get to the aqueduct start from the Lock 29 (Lander) parking lot. Head Northwest from the parking lot to reach the road you drove in on. On the road, head Southwest, about 80 feet, or until you reach the wooden bridge. The pedestrian bridge crosses the middle of lock 29 and has two wooden railings. Continue past the lock to where the towpath intersects with the road, about 10 feet past the lock. Turn right onto the towpath and continue six tenths of a mile until the path forks. To the right is access to the aqueduct waterway. To the left is access to the aqueduct towpath. The waterway sits about six feet lower than the towpath. Select a path and walk another 350 feet to the aqueduct. On the waterway path you can see stone blocks forming walls on either side of you that are about 6 feet tall. On the towpath you can look down into the waterway on your right or look to the left at the river. The towpath has a fence on the river side and two-foot bumpers on the waterway side.",

    "bodyText": "<p>C&O Canal aqueducts are \"water bridges\" that carry canal boats over creeks and rivers that flow into the Potomac River. Built from 1833 to 1835, the Conococheague Aqueduct is the fifth of eleven such \"works of art\" on the canal. It consists of three equal 60' arch spans extending 196' between abutments.</p> <p>In August 1863, Confederate soldiers damaged the Conococheague Aqueduct in an effort to stop the canal's transportation of coal to Georgetown where it was used by the Union. Repairs took four days and the canal returned to operation. In April 1920, a canal boat broke through the upstream wall of the aqueduct, falling into the creek below. This shut down the canal for over four months. Repaired with a timber wall, this version of the aqueduct functioned until two 1924 floods closed the canal for good.</p> <p>In 2019, the NPS completed restoration of the Conococheague Aqueduct, reopening this exciting feature on the C&O Canal. The restored Conococheague Aqueduct provides a watered section of the canal to allow for canal boat operations and other public uses between Lock 44 and approximately 450 feet upstream of the existing aqueduct (approx. 0.70 miles). The $10.2 million project took two years to complete, and was funded through federal, state, local and private dollars including national park entrance fees and Maryland's Transportation Alternatives and Bikeways programs. </p> <p>Williamsport is now the only place in North America where visitors can view a variety of canal features in one place, including an operational lift lock and refurbished lockhouse, a railroad lift bridge, a canal turning basin and warehouse, and now a watered aqueduct. </p> <h3><br /> Conococheague Aqueduct Restored </h3> <p>The National Park Service would like to acknowledge and thank those involved for their support with this projects.

The project also restores a significant historic resource and provides unique opportunities for visitors. <br /> <br /> <strong>How can I access the towpath at the Williamsport Visitor Center?</strong><br /> Pedestrians and cyclists are able to cross the canal at the historic railroad lift bridge (adjacent to Rt. 11). Parking is still available by the Cushwa Warehouse. <br /> <br /> <strong>What is the railroad lift bridge? </strong><br /> Originally used to allow trains to cross the canal, visitors are now able to cross the bridge on a newly constructed stairway, which includes a low bike rail. (This is a great spot to get a view of the canal and aqueduct!). <br /> <br /> <strong>Where can I find accessible parking near the towpath?</strong></p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Parking is also available close to the towpath at Lockhouse 44 parking lot and from the Bollman Bridge at River Bottom Park. These are the best access points for visitors with bike trailers, strollers, or wheelchairs. Dam 5 is the next closest location along the towpath that also has parking. <br /> <br /> <strong>Who can I contact if I have further questions regarding the restoration? </strong><br /> For more information, please contact the C&O Canal Williamsport Visitor Center by calling 301-582-0813.</p> <br />  ",

Dams create a large barrier that restricts or stops the flow of water, which allows it to be used for irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigation. Dam 3, built in 1799, was meant to serve the armory at Harpers Ferry. It was built using the natural rocks of the Potomac River which created a unique zig-zag structure. Unfortunately, the dam proved ineffective. It was rebuilt in 1820, and then in 1832 the infrastructure of dam was used by the C&O Canal to build its Dam No. 3, which watered the Canal down to Seneca.",

Walk 280 feet and then turn right onto a stone staircase. The staircase has a stone wall on the right side and a metal railing on the left. At the bottom of the staircase turn left onto a wooden bridge that spans the canal. The bridge has wooden railings and ends in a staircase. Once down the staircase you are on the towpath. Turn right, or Northwest, onto the towpath. After 1.1 miles the dam will appear on the left. At a half a mile you will pass lock 34 and a water pump. Water availability dependent on conditions and time of year. At 1 mile you will pass lock 35. At 1.1 miles the Dam 3 will be in the Potomac River on the left.

Once at the parking lot, head Southeast toward the lock and the two bridges that span the top of them. The wooden bridges have handrails on both sides. Once over the bridges, turn right onto the towpath. Walk about 4.5 miles to reach a fork in the path. The path on the left takes you over the aqueduct via the towpath. The path on the right takes you over the aqueduct via the canal waterway. Select a path and walk another 130 feet to reach the aqueduct. Once on the aqueduct, you will see the canal waterway, which is created by two, three-foot walls. On top of the left most wall is the towpath. If you took the left path at the fork, this is where you would be standing. There is a metal fence on the outside edge of the towpath.

    "audioDescription": "(621 words)<br />The C&O Canal Lock 5 Parking Lot is located on the west side of Canal Road, NW Washington, DC about one-eighth of a mile north of Chain Bridge Road.<br />The parking lot is a gravel space, about sixty-feet wide and one hundred-feet long. The lot is set immediately off Canal Road and is bordered by gravel at its east entry side.<br />Two portable bathrooms sit at the northeast end of the lot, on the right as you enter from Canal Road, about twenty feet from the roadside.<br />The lot is all gravel and surrounded by trees, including three thirty-foot tall trees located at the south end. A picnic table sits beneath them. <br />As you travel west a three-sided four by three-foot wayside sits at the trailhead in front of the canal and a ten-foot wood bridge that carries over it. The south side is titled at the top: River Warnings! Text below warns about various hazards associated with the Potomac River:<br />River Warnings!<br />The Potomac River is a hazardous force that deserves our constant respect. The 22-mile section of the river from Georgetown to Seneca has four dangerous areas that are unsafe for any type of water related recreation including boating, canoeing, fishbone, swimming, wading or rock hopping. Do not enter the water. This warning applies to the river areas around the Washington Aqueduct Dam, Great Falls, Little Falls Dam, and Little Falls Rapids. Serious and often fatal accidents occur at these locations every year.<br />A map to the right identifies areas too dangerous to enter the river and to avoid. These are Washington Aqueduct Dam, Great Falls, Little Falls Dam, and Little Falls Rapids:<br />Washington Aqueduct Dam:<br />A water supply dam for Washington, D.C. located just above the Great Falls. If this hazardous dam doesn't stop you, the falls just below it will! The Great Falls, MD parking lot is the last take-out before the dam.<br />Great Falls:<br />Where the Potomac River drops 40 feet over a steep jagged rock wall and into a narrow gorge. The falls are impassible. Use the C&O Canal to bypass the dam. You can reenter the river at Rocky Cove below the falls.<br />Little Falls of the Potomac<br />Located just upstream from Chain Bridge, this narrow chute of extremely powerful currents is hazardous. Many boaters and fishermen have drowned here. Take your boat out along the canal in the immediate vicinity of Sycamore Island. You can reenter the river at Fletchers Boat House.<br />Little Falls Dam:<br />Located four miles downstream from Cabin John Bridge, this innocent-looking small vertical drop is deadly. The river flowing over the dam is recycled back toward the dam wall rather than downstream. Trapping any object including people in the backwash. Many who end up in this vicious backwash drown. Stay away! The last take-out before the dam is the C&O Canal in the immediate vicinity of Sycamore Island.<br />The east-facing side of the sign is a map titled at the top to read:<br />C&O Canal National Historical Park - Locks 1 through 25<br />The map shows the C&O Canal in blue, flowing down from Cumberland, MD, around the edge of Washington, DC to Thompson's Boat Center in Georgetown where it enters into the Potomac River. A boxed map to the right identifies C&O Canal National Historic Parks, the C&O Canal, and Canal locks 1-25 from Cumberland to Georgetown.<br />The third side of the sign is titled \"Lock 5\", and shows general information about the C&O Canal, including safety warnings to wear life jackets at all times when boating, rafting, or tubing, a message that pets must be leashed, ice skate at your own risk, fishing licenses are required, canal boat rides are available, and information is available online at www.canaltrust.org.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "<p>Georgetown became a port city soon after its 1751 founding. Located on the Potomac River, it was a logical choice for the canal's terminus. Canal activity further spurred Georgetown's economic growth. By the late 1800s, it was a bustling industrial port, with loads of cargo transferring between ocean-going ships, smaller boats, and wagons. On the canal, mule-drawn coal boats sidled up alongside Georgetown's warehouses to unload their freight. After their week-long journey down the 184.5 mile canal, canal families looked forward to the sights and sounds of Georgetown.<br /> <br /> Construction of the canal began in 1828. Thousands of men, primarily immigrants, performed the backbreaking, dangerous work of digging and blasting through soil and rock. The skilled laborers, including stonemasons, carpenters, and blacksmiths created the dams, locks, culverts, aqueducts, and the Paw Paw Tunnel. Though each section of the canal started operating as it was completed, the entire route between Cumberland and Georgetown officially opened on October 10, 1850. After years of decreasing profits and devastating floods, operation of the canal ceased in 1924.</p> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "(1224 words)The Georgetown visitor center is located in downtown Washington, DC in the Georgetown neighborhood, at the northeast intersection of Thomas Jefferson Street, NW and the C&O Canal.The location is a two-story end unit row house, set at the northwest corner of Lock 3 of the C&O Canal. The red-brick building's front door is located on Thomas Jefferson Street. Four brick steps lead up to the white painted front door. An alcove with three windows is on the right, and three windows line the second floor. The visitor entrance is located on the southern, canal side. Two swinging glass windows are above on the first floor, and a single window sits on the top level. Four other windows and a door with an iron gate are set along the south side. A two by four-foot brown sign sits on the south, canal side that reads: \"Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park.\" The visitor entrance is set in a ten square foot alcove area lined with a two-foot high wood ledge bench. To the right of the door is a glass sign featuring Georgetown Visitor Center information. Along the northern side of this area are three white signs, about six feet tall set from ground level. The left sign features on its top third a brown and white picture of an industrial waterfront. Smokestacks and iron riggings are visible from across a wide river. The bottom of the sign features a timeline which spans all three signs. This portion covers 1825 to 1865. Noted at the top is \"1828 Ground Broken for Canal\" and \"1861-65 Civil War.\" The below are three photographs. The left picture, beneath the year 1825, shows men with horses on a wide and barren dirt landscape. Text above them reads: The canal was initially envisioned by its supported as a trade route between east and west. However, by the time the canal reached Cumberland, plans to extend it to the Ohio River at Pittsburgh had been abandoned for financial reasons. The middle picture, beneath the year 1850, shows a horse drawn carriage next to a railroad track in a dirt trench along a river above. A white house sits at the river's edge and smoke billows from machinery along the riverbank to the left. Text above reads. The canal was most active and profitable between 1865 and 1900. Over five hundred boats carried nearly one million tons of cargo annually between Cumberland and Georgetown. More than 90% of the boats arrived in Georgetown filled with coal. The final picture of the right shows an image of a canal crowded with nine canal boats sitting in the water. Text above them reads: The canal stretched 184.5 miles between Georgetown and Cumberland. Rising 605 feet in elevation along the journey, the canal averaged 60 feet across, six feet deep, and included seven dams, 11 aqueducts, and 74 lift locks. The middle sign is titled at the top: The Canal through Georgetown Below is map showing the canal as it passes from Rock Creek on the right, across the sign to the Aqueduct and Key Bridge on the left. The map shows locks one through four on the right side, and an arrow indicates your location between locks three and four. A dark blue line indicates the canal, and a brown line laid next to it shows the towpath. The bottom third of the sign is a continuation of a timeline that runs through all three signs. Represented here are:1890 B&O Railroad Takes Over Canal1914-18 World War 11924 Floods Close Canal Three black and white pictures line the bottom of the sign. Furthest left, below the year 1875, is an image of a canal, full of water and lined with four story brick row houses and buildings. A building with two tall smokestacks sits along the canal's right side. Text above reads: Georgetown grew to accommodate the canal's business. New wharves supported the distribution of coal, stone, and timber. Flour, paper, and cotton milling became successful industries in the town, using the canal as a new source of water power. The middle picture, under the year 1900, shows a canal scene crowded with canal boats lined up in the water. A man sits on the boat in the left foreground, and two girls stand along the towpath on the right. Text above reads: The Georgetown section of the canal includes four locks. As boats approached Georgetown and lined up to unload cargo, they created traffic jams on the canal. Boat crews sometimes waited days to unload before they could begin the return trip. The right-side picture, under the year 1925, shows a man in overalls and boots turned and facing away as he stands atop a boat in a canal. A boy and girl are at his sides, also facing away. He holds their hands as they float down the canal. Text above reads: Canal families eagerly anticipated their arrival in Georgetown. After a week on the boat, traveling through rural country and small towns, parents would allow their children to go up the city's streets to buy candy, ice cream or see a movie. The right sign has along its top third a black and white image of a man in hat and suspenders walking along a canal towpath with three horses.",

Built between 1836 and 1838, the Licking Creek Aqueduct is the seventh of twelve such “works of art” on the canal. It was the first single arch aqueduct to be built on the canal. The Canal company described the 90-foot aqueduct as “one of the longest, if not the longest aqueduct arch” in the United States. It was later surpassed by the 297-foot arch of the Cabin John aqueduct at mile 7.6.",

The top of the aqueduct has two parts, a water way for the canal boats and a towpath for the mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 11 feet wide and its bottom is about four feet lower than the towpath. To get to Licking Creek Aqueduct, start at the Handcock Visitor Center parking lot (about 6.5 miles from the aqueduct). From the parking lot, walk about 80 feet to the east and turn left (South) onto the towpath access road. Follow the road about 300 feet, until the path meets the towpath. Turn left (east) onto the towpath. The lock is 6.5 miles down the towpath. Once on the aqueduct, you will be walking in the canal waterway. On your right, the wall that makes the side of the waterway sits about 4 feet tall. On top of the wall is the original towpath. A metal fence sits on the far side of the towpath, between the path and the drop to the creek. On the left, the canal wall no longer exists, giving an unobstructed view of Licking Creek. There is no barrier between the path and the drop.",

To access this area, walk from Lower Town across the footbridge over the Potomac River to the C&O Canal towpath then take a left and walk along the path until there is signage for the Maryland Heights trail.<br /> <br /> Maryland Heights is the highest mountain overlooking Harpers Ferry. Its southern face is a 300-foot vertical cliff that towers over the Potomac River, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. The mountain is steep, rugged, and primitive, with a thick veneer of Civil War history.<br /> <br /> Maryland Heights hosted the first battle between Union and Confederate troops in Maryland. The first combat on Northern soil between the two armies occurred on Maryland Heights. Maryland Heights was the most important strategic target of the Confederate army in the Battle of Harpers Ferry, which took place from September 12-15, 1862. Without the seizure of Maryland Heights, Robert E. Lee's Confederates could not entrap the Union garrison and complete Lee's assignment outlined in Special Orders 191.<br /> <br /> Lee selected Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws to lead the advance upon Maryland Heights, expecting McLaws to snare the Union garrison from the north. McLaws arrived at the eastern base of the mountain on September 12 with 8,000 men. Discovering nearly 4,000 Union soldiers stationed atop the mountain, McLaws directed William Barksdale's Mississippi brigade and Joseph Kershaw's South Carolina brigade to ascend Elk Ridge north of Maryland Heights and to take the Union position. Battling at Maryland Heights lasted from 6:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on September 13, and eventually, the Union troops under Colonel Thomas H. Ford's command abandoned their position. The loss of Maryland Heights cut off the Union forces escape routes and helped lead to the surrender of the Union garrison on September 15.<br /> <br /> The significance of Maryland Heights is further attested by the Union occupation of the mountain two days following the Battle of Antietam. By securing the heights on September 19, the Union, once again, occupied Harpers Ferry and to ensure the protection of the position, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan ordered that extensive fortifications be constructed on Maryland Heights. Union engineers quickly surveyed the terrain, and during the fall of 1862, work commenced on the Stone Fort and the 30-pounder Battery, along with improvements at the Naval Battery. Ten months later, as General Lee threatened Harpers Ferry with his second invasion during the Gettysburg Campaign; construction hastened which resulted in the Interior Fort, the Exterior Fort, and the 100-pounder Battery. This latter battery boasted a 100-pounder Parrott Rifle that could hurl a 100-pound shell more than two miles and the tube of this cannon weighed nearly 10 tons.<br /> <br /> The fortifications of Maryland Heights played a major role in the Confederacy's third and final invasion of the North. Confederate Maj. Gen. Jubal Early spent four days attempting to maneuver the Union out of the forts, but he failed. During the time Early spent worrying about Maryland Heights, the Union was able to send reinforcements to Washington, ultimately helping to save the United States capital. The Union army would occupy the forts of Maryland Heights until June 30, 1865. The final time the big cannon boomed was in memory of President Lincoln following his assassination.<br /> <br /> Though Maryland Heights was occupied by Union forces the most, Maryland Heights occupation was by Confederates. Col. Thomas Jonathan Jackson seized the mountain in May 1861. Recognizing the strategic value of the high ground, Jackson was sure he could not defend Harpers Ferry without holding Maryland Heights. Jackson's aggressiveness created major turmoil when he positioned his troops in neutral Maryland, a state that the Confederacy was trying to get to join their cause. Despite the political firestorm set off by Jackson, he refused to abandon the position. The Confederates left on their own volition on June 14, 1861, when the Confederates abandoned Harpers Ferry five weeks before the First Battle of Manassas (Bull Run).</p>",

Built from 1829 to 1833, the Monocacy Aqueduct is the third of twelve such “works of art” on the canal. With just one glace, visitors are struck with the magnitude of this marvelous seven arched structure. The glistening white and pink quartz sandstone structure is the longest aqueduct along the C&O Canal measuring in at 516 feet. At the time of the Civil War, during the Maryland Campaign of 1862, the Monocacy Aqueduct was nearly destroyed by Confederate General D.H. Hill. However, concerned Lockkeeper Thomas Walter persuaded the Confederate troops that destroying Lock 27 would be far more impactful in their pursuit. Today, the Monocacy Aqueduct still stands thanks to restoration work that was completed in 2004 and continual preservation of this structural gem.  ",
    "audioDescription": "(337 words) The Monocacy Aqueduct is located along the C&O Canal Towpath in Dickerson, Maryland. This granite stone bridge is 516 feet long and spans the Monocacy River. It has seven arches and each arch spans a distance of approximately 54 feet. The base of the arches, called piers, are six feet wide. There are six piers. The top of the aqueduct has a water way for the canal boats and a towpath for the mules. The waterway of the aqueduct is about 20 feet wide and its bottom is about six feet lower than the towpath. The walls on either side of the aqueduct are about 8 feet wide. To get to the aqueduct start from the Monocacy Aqueduct Parking Lot. From the parking lot head back toward the road you drove in on, near the northern edge of the lot. Once back on the road, head northwest about 100 feet toward the gravel access path. The path forks about 60 feet down the access path. To the right is a path that leads to picnic tables and a scenic view of the aqueduct. To the left the access path continues to the towpath. Continue down the access path on the left another 220 feet. The access path will dead end into the towpath. Once on the towpath turn right toward the aqueduct. About 200 feet down the towpath is a fork in the path. To the right is access to the aqueduct waterway. To the left is access to the aqueduct towpath. The waterway sits about six feet lower than the towpath. Select a path and walk another 200 feet to the aqueduct. On the waterway path you can see stone blocks forming walls on either side of you that are about 6 feet tall. On the towpath you can look down into the waterway on your right or look to the left were the Monocacy River meets the Potomac River. The towpath has a fence on the river side and two-foot bumpers on the waterway side.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The Old Stone House is the oldest structure on its original foundation in Washington, D.C. Built in 1766 in the British colony of Maryland, the house was already 59 years old when the British invaded Washington, D.C. in 1814. Although it is preserved for its architecture today, it was originally preserved through a case of mistaken identity and a desire to remember George Washington.</p> <p>In 1791, George Washington and city planner Pierre L'Enfant were surveying the newly established District of Columbia. L'Enfant's ambitious plan for the city's layout depended on negotiating with local landowners for right of way. During one of these meetings, Washington and L'Enfant stayed in Georgetown's Fountain Inn at 31st and K Streets. The inn was better known to locals as Suter's Tavern, after its owner John Suter. </p> <p>Over on Bridge Street (now M Street), John Suter's son, John, Jr., ran a clock shop in today's Old Stone House. As the years passed, local memory conflated the two buildings associated with the two John Suters. Thus, the desire to honor and remember George Washington's 1791 visit combined with a fuzzy memory led to the Old Stone House's preservation while so much changed around it.</p> <p>The house was the site of a car dealership when the federal government purchased the property in 1953. The National Park Service opened the house to the public in 1960. Today, the house is a rare example of pre-Revolutionary architecture. Among the House's furnishings, you may find a clock built by one-time owner John Suter, Jr.</p> <h4>Hours:</h4> Open daily (ground floor only), with holiday hours from 11:00 a.m.-7:00 p.m.",

    "bodyText": "The Paw Paw Tunnel is one of the most significant engineering features on the Canal. To save building six miles of canal along the river, the C&O Canal Company decided to construct a tunnel through a steep topographic ridge now called Tunnel Hill. When work began on the tunnel in 1836, the builders estimated the project would be completed within two years. The tunnel ultimately required 14 years to complete due to labor issues and violence, funding shortfalls, work stoppages, and the challenges of digging a 3,118-foot tunnel through the hard, loose shale. The tunnel opened in October 1850 with rockslides continuing to be a challenge throughout the tunnel’s history. <br /> <br /> Today, when you plan your visit to the Paw Paw Tunnel, bring a flashlight and discover the weep holes, rope burns, rub rails, as well as brass plates marking every 100-feet that bring the tunnel’s history to life. Following your travels through the tunnel, enjoy the two-mile long Tunnel Hill Trail where you can discover breathtaking views of the Paw Paw Bends.  <br /> <br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "(142 words) Paw Paw Tunnel is located along the towpath in Oldtown, Maryland. To access it, go to the Paw Paw Tunnel Drive-in Campground parking area off of MD-51. From the parking lot is a short, 50-foot path, with a slight incline that leads up to the towpath. Once on the gravel towpath, turn right and at about a half a mile, you will approach Paw Paw Tunnel. It is 3,118 feet long with wooden railings on the left side and the wall of the tunnel on the right. The tunnel contains the original railings and contain rope burns from when the canal boats were being pulled through the tunnel by mules. Along the wall are circular, brass plates that mark every 100 feet. At the downstream exit of the tunnel is a wooden boardwalk with railings on the left side. End of description.",

    "audioDescription": "(191 words)<br />The Alexandria Aqueduct, also called the Potomac Aqueduct, is located just south of the C&O Canal Towpath in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, DC.<br />Travel west along the towpath about four hundred feet from the Key Bridge. Turn left and proceed south about one hundred seventy feet and you will be at the top of the aqueduct. <br />Facing south from this location an open grass and dirt field about one hundred feet wide and sixty feet long leads up to a chain link fence. Beyond the fence is the granite aqueduct structure, two, two hundred-foot spans of bridge about thirty feet apart. In between them is a grass surface about six feet below the top of the bridge spans, which stretches out about fifty feet.<br />Stairs about seventy feet to the west lead down to Water Street and the lower level of the aqueduct. Two arches of the aqueduct, about fifty feet wide each and constructed with granite blocks, are visible underneath. One carries over the end of Water Street and the trailhead of the Crescent Trail to the west. The second arch runs to the edge of the Potomac River.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

    "bodyText": "Built in 1923 by the Western Maryland Railway, the railroad lift bridge is one of several one-of-a-kind features on the C&O Canal. Operating like an elevator, this structure lifted the railroad tracks to allow canal boats to pass beneath. The tracks, for transporting coal, led to the power plant between the river and the canal. In 1924, the C&O Canal closed making the lift bridge unnecessary. The bridge was lifted in 2016 to allow boats to pass underneath, and in 2019 a wooden staircase was installed to allow visitors to cross the bridge to reach the towpath.",
    "audioDescription": "The railroad lift bridge is located on the towpath in Williamsport Maryland. To get to the lift bridge start at the Cushwa Basin Visitor Center parking lot. From the parking lot, head to the southern most point of the lot to reach the towpath access path. Once on the access path, walk about 20 feet to reach the staircase at the base of the lift bridge. There are wooden railings on both sides of the staircase. You can see rail road tracks to the left of the staircase. The bridge spans upward and downward, forming a metal cage like structure. Atop the bridge, you can see the Bollman Bridge crossing the canal on the left. On the right, you can see the bridge into West Virginia crossing over the towpath. Past this bridge, you can see the towpath stretching toward the Conocogue Aqueduct. The bridge is about 35 feet long, and ends at a stairwell that turns to the right. Wooden railings are on both sides of the stairs. The end of the staircase points you Northwest onto the towpath, towards the Conocogue Aqueduct.",

The waterway of the aqueduct is about 20 feet wide and had two walls, which created a six-foot-deep canal. Atop the southern wall is the towpath mules use to travel on. To get to the aqueduct start from the Lock 56 parking lot. Head to the Southwest corner of the lot to reach an access trail to the towpath. Walk about 80 feet on the access trail and then turn right (west) onto the towpath. Walk 6 tenths of a mile to the aqueduct. Once on the aqueduct, you will be walking in the canal waterway. On your left, the wall that makes the side of the waterway sits about six feet tall. On top of this wall is the original towpath. A metal fence sits on top of the wall, on the far side towpath, between the towpath and the drop to the creek. On the right, the canal wall no longer exists, giving an unobstructed view of Sideling Creek. In the distance a metal bridge crosses the creek. You can also see concrete and metal bracers stabilizing the aqueduct. There is no barrier between the path and the drop.",

Built by the Army Corps of Engineers from 1853 to 1863, it was a monumental engineering achievement. Its designer, Army Engineer Montgomery C. Meigs, supervised the project until 1861, when he was appointed Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army. The construction and successful operation of the Washington Aqueduct symbolizes the Army Corps of Engineers importance in the field of public works and reflects the military influence on life in antebellum America. The Washington Aqueduct, constructed over 150 years ago, still supplies the nation's capital with public water today.<br /> <br /> In the 1850s, the growing population of Washington and the memory of two devastating fires forced Congress to acknowledge that the nation's capital required more than wells and springs to provide its water. In 1853, Congress commissioned a public water system. One year later, construction of the Washington Aqueduct began in Great Falls, Maryland. Meig's plan was to divert the water from the Potomac River into a large, underground conduit. Gravity, and later pumping stations, directed water through the conduit to reservoirs where it could then be pumped into the city's pipelines.<br /> <br /> To accomplish this feat, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed a masonry dam across the Potomac, a control gatehouse at Great Falls, a twelve-mile conduit, eleven tunnels, six bridges, several pipelines, and two reservoirs. By 1863, the Corps had completed three resevoirs. Wagons and boats on the C&O Canal brought supplies like cast iron, sand, concrete, brick, and Seneca sandstone to the construction sites. The initial dam reached halfway across the river. In 1890, in order to meet the District's increasing demand for water, it was extended to the Virginia side. Meigs designed the dam to be anchored to the river bottom, not to block its flow but to divert it.<br /> <br /> Although no longer in service, the first gatehouse still stands next to the historic Great Falls Tavern along the C&O Canal in Maryland. Inside was a system of 20 small cast iron slide gates that filtered the largest debris from the water.<br /> <br /> The conduit stretches almost twelve miles downriver from the intake at Great Falls to the Georgetown Reservoir. The underground, circular tube, built of brick, stone, and mortar, is 9 feet in diameter. A road ran parallel to the conduit to facilitate cleaning, repairs and inspections. The road was originally named Conduit Road; today it is MacArthur Boulevard.<br /> <br /> As part of the original Washington Aqueduct water system, workers constructed six bridges to carry the conduit over streams and creeks. Only three, Bridge #3, Cabin John Bridge (also called Union Arch Bridge) and Rock Creek Bridge, remain today. Cabin John Bridge, built of granite and sandstone, held the record as the world's longest masonry arch structure (220 feet) for 40 years. Today, Rock Creek Bridge’s 200-foot arch is still one of the longest unsupported metal pipe arches in the world. <br /> <br /> Aqueduct water spilled into two reservoirs, Dalecarlia Reservoir at the District line and the Georgetown Reservoir two miles downriver. By allowing the murky river water to stand in these reservoirs, debris settles to the bottom before distribution throughout the city. However, the process never successfully removed all of the sediment and thus, Washington City's public water had a muddy-yellowish color until the installation of a rapid-sand filtration system in 1928. Today both reservoirs have been completely modernized.<br /> <br /> Several inscriptions at various places honor the engineers who designed and built the Aqueduct. Meigs had his own name and his assistant’s name, Alfred L. Rives, engraved on the Cabin John Bridge. When Rives quit the US Army to join the Confederate Army in 1861, Meigs replaced his name with the Latin phrase <i>Esto Perpetua</i>, or “Let It Stand Forever.\" After former US Secretary of War Jefferson Davis became the president of the Confederacy, his name was removed from the bridge as well. In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt ordered it be re-engraved.<br /> <br /> While building the Washington Aqueduct, Meigs was also Chief Engineer for the extensions and new dome of the U.S. Capitol, and the enlargement of the General Post Office Building. Both of these buildings are now National Historic Landmarks. After his work with the new aqueduct, Meigs served as Quartermaster General of the United States Army, both during and after the Civil War. During this tenure, he designed the Pension Bureau building, now the National Building Museum (also a National Historic Landmark). During the Civil War, Meigs helped establish Arlington National Cemetery, where he is buried.<br /> <br /> In the twentieth century, the aqueduct’s capacity was expanded many times. As of 2017, it produces 300 million gallons of filtered water per day, has a storage capacity of 44 million gallons, and serves 1.1 million customers. The aqueduct provides public water for all of Washington, DC, Arlington County, and Falls Church City in Virginia. The continual effectiveness of the historic water system is a testament to Meig’s design and the professional work of the Army Corps of Engineers who continue to operate it today. A portion of the aqueduct runs through the Cheasapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, where you can see the originial engineer's house and gatehouse. </span></span></span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"> </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Sources:<br /> <span style=\"color:null;\">\"The Washington Aqueduct System.\"</span> National Park Service.</span></span></span><br />  </p> <p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\">Ways, Harry C. <em>Washinton Aqueduct: 1852-1992.</em> US Army Corps of Engineers.</span></span></span></p>   <p> </p> <p><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><a href=\"http://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=6d960253-5f0c-4d15-a2a2-84735ea482f2\"><span style=\"color:blue\">National Historic Landmark Nomination</span></a> of the Washington Aqueduct.</span></span></span><br />  </p> <p><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><i><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nhl/index.htm\"><span style=\"color:blue\">National Historic Landmarks (NHLs)</span></a> are historic places that possess exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States.

Miners extracted some of the world’s richest uranium ore from this mine and shipped it to Canada for refining. After refining, the ore arrived at one of several plants in the United States that processed the uranium ore into pure uranium metal and shaped the uranium into billets. Workers loaded the billets onto railcars and shipped the billets to Hanford where they arrived at the fuel fabrication site, also known as the 300 Area. Here, machines milled the uranium billets into cylinders and sealed the uranium cylinders in aluminum jackets creating fuel slugs for the nuclear reactors. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9e8fb5e4-2009-41a9-8688-fcedc05b85c8}{224}\" paraid=\"944978060\">Workers drove the fuel slugs across the Hanford Site to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/b-reactor.htm\">B Reactor</a> and its two siblings, D and F reactors, for irradiation. After irradiation in a nuclear reactor, workers carefully loaded the highly radioactive fuel slugs into shielded, water-filled casks on train cars for transportation to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/t-plant.htm\">T Plant.</a>  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9e8fb5e4-2009-41a9-8688-fcedc05b85c8}{240}\" paraid=\"518970519\">At T Plant, the fuel went through a series of complex chemical process to separate plutonium from uranium and other radioactive byproducts. Scientists in Los Alamos, New Mexico, assembled the core of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/trinity-site.htm\">Trinity Test</a> device and the Fat Man atomic bomb using Hanford’s plutonium. The chemical separation process created millions of gallons of toxic waste that is stored in underground tanks. Safe disposal of this waste is the biggest challenge at Hanford today.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a2d7978b-50c4-4737-b5b3-2b9da5c4f40c}{2}\" paraid=\"1679476392\"> Construction and operation of fuel fabrication facilities began in 1943. The 300 Area also contained experimental and laboratory facilities where scientists tested their theories and conducted experiments that enhanced their understanding of plutonium production. At one time, six small-scale test reactors operated in the 300 Area. Like other Hanford Site Manhattan Project facilities, the 300 Area remained a critical component of the United States defense program during the Cold War and operated into the 1970s. Many of the buildings in the 300 Area have been demolished as part of the US Department of Energy’s cleanup efforts.   </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{68d95b83-737d-43ce-9fce-aaa7da1a162a}{194}\" paraid=\"167794074\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{68d95b83-737d-43ce-9fce-aaa7da1a162a}{194}\" paraid=\"167794074\"> The Department of Energy offers <a href=\"https://manhattanprojectbreactor.hanford.gov/\">tours of the B Reactor,</a> the world’s first full-scale nuclear reactor.

However, these workers were not given the same access to goods, services, recreation, entertainment, and housing that their White coworkers enjoyed. Reflecting the segregation throughout the United States during and after World War II, this racial divide extended to houses of worship as well.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{678d300b-f85e-4a38-accd-d91d0cfc3e78}{49}\" paraid=\"546597550\">The lack of recognized organized recreational events or community development groups in the African American hutments led a local White Baptist minister to call for more religious opportunities for African Americans of Oak Ridge, saying “much could be accomplished in the religious life of this group as a whole…if a qualified, high-type negro minister could be found.” Historically, churches had been the center of community for African Americans in the South, providing a place of security and the opportunity to build social bonds and community in a seemingly unjust and unpredictable world of Jim Crow segregation. Several Black churches were founded by Oak Ridge residents during 1945 and 1946 with the help of established Knoxville congregations. The government eventually constructed a community church called “Chapel on the Hill” to meet the residents religious needs.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{678d300b-f85e-4a38-accd-d91d0cfc3e78}{51}\" paraid=\"1476414786\"> A prayer group that began in 1944 in the hut of Mr. and Mrs. David Rodgers formally organized as A.M.E. Zion Church of Oak Ridge in July 1945. The same month, a reverend from Knoxville came to Oak Ridge to help establish the First African Missionary Baptist Church, considered by the congregation to be the first Black Baptist Church in the city. The congregation first met in the hutment recreation hall, but eventually moved into the “Chapel on the Hill.” Oak Valley Baptist Church was organized in October 1946. The City of Oak Ridge offered the fledgling congregation room to meet in an East Village building. Church leaders declined the offer because the East Village was located miles from African American housing and no African Americans could live in the East Village area. Oak Valley Baptist Church instead met in “The House on the Side of the Road.”    </p> <p paraeid=\"{678d300b-f85e-4a38-accd-d91d0cfc3e78}{53}\" paraid=\"988143625\">Besides offering religious guidance, African American churches filled a social void in the Black community of Oak Ridge. They sponsored barbeques, singing groups, and fundraisers for church and member needs. Churches also helped organize the first adult education courses offered to African American workers in Oak Ridge. The First Methodist Church started an adult recreation program in the hutment area in 1947, which morphed into work-skill classes including typing, shorthand, sewing, reading, writing, and elementary arithmetic.   </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{678d300b-f85e-4a38-accd-d91d0cfc3e78}{53}\" paraid=\"988143625\">Continue Your Journey </h2> <br /> <a href=\"https://oakvalleybc.com/\">Oak Valley Baptist Church</a> and <a href=\"https://church.org/churches/Tennessee/37830/mount-zion-baptist-church-oak-ridge-tennessee\">Mt.

Your contributions, vital to the war effort, helped to drastically change the world. Yet, you were forced to live in dilapidated housing and were not allowed to access the same goods, services, and entertainment opportunities as many of your co-workers. For many African American Manhattan Project workers, this disparity was unfortunately all too common.  <br />  <br /> A “colored hutment area” was located on this site. Hutments were the lowest form of permanent housing for workers and only housed a few White men but mostly Black men and Black women. Hutments were 16 X16 foot (4.8 meters) structures made of plywood with screenless windows with shutters and a central oil stove. Residents experienced sweltering summers and freezing winters in these hutments. Four to six residents shared each hutment. A communal bathhouse served 12 hutments each. The women’s hutment area was surrounded by roughhewn fence made of scrap lumber. The “women’s pen”, as it was called, had a strict 10:00 pm curfew and no men were allowed.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{08800c12-c1e5-433b-9ff6-aff09ec6a6b2}{102}\" paraid=\"1441913868\">As World War II was ending, Manhattan Project contractors constructed several “family” hutments in the African American hutment area. They consisted of two hutments connected by a small shed. Located near the single hutment area, the family hutments had no electricity or running water. These were distributed on a first come-first serve basis and were the only African American family housing option during the war. When the war ended and the pressure for housing was lessened, White workers were moved out of the hutments, but the African American hutments were used for several years after World War II.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f8fc80e5-afd0-451e-92b1-830c454259ec}{117}\" paraid=\"579669331\"> </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{f8fc80e5-afd0-451e-92b1-830c454259ec}{117}\" paraid=\"579669331\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{25fac312-7f0a-4bf3-b411-3b929706d4e1}{168}\" paraid=\"273429714\">The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/scarboro-community-center.htm\">Scarboro</a> community was developed as a direct result of backlash brought on by the sub-standard hutment conditions after World War II. Today, nothing remains of the site where the majority of African American hutments once stood. As with many historical locations throughout the United States, the original location of the hutments is now a modern commercial development. </p>",

But loud, urgent noises and blinding light streaming into his farmhouse bedroom soon woke him up. Allard rushed outside, worried that his barn was on fire, only to find the cause of this unusual phenomenon. Forty of his friends from White Bluffs had parked their cars around his house and were shining their lights on his bedroom and honking their horns to summon him to a surprise birthday party that lasted into the wee hours.  <br />  <br /> As this anecdote demonstrates, Allard was a well-regarded member of the pre-war White Bluffs community. Allard moved to this area in 1908, helping build and later operate the hydroelectric plant and irrigation pumping station at Coyote Rapids. Allard ran the pumphouse for thirty years. Local farmers, who needed irrigated water to transform the arid shrub steppe grassland into profitable farmland, found Allard’s mechanical talents immensely valuable.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bcaf5d2e-7d1b-43e6-a78c-8dfb96ac05d9}{174}\" paraid=\"1845067229\">Allard served his community as a County Commissioner, Grange (a farmer’s social/advocacy organization) leader, and President of the White Bluffs Commercial Club. In 1941, Samuel Allard relocated from his ranch to a new home in the nearby community of Prosser. Allard died in 1945. His grave is located with other White Bluffs residents at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/prosser-cemetery.htm\">Prosser Cemetery</a>.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{bcaf5d2e-7d1b-43e6-a78c-8dfb96ac05d9}{185}\" paraid=\"1737099053\"> Irrigation made farming this area possible. This facility, which supported struggling homesteaders and wealthy orchardists alike, provides a sense of how farmers transformed the area into productive farmland after years of hard work.

    "audioDescription": "Viewed from the front the pumphouse is a rectangle. Made of concrete blocks, the flat-roofed building is now just an empty shell with openings where windows and the double-wide entrance once were. There is a narrow, decorative ledge around the top of the building. A low parapet extends around the roof with blocks spaced around it leaving indentations in between like the crenellations of a medieval castle. A rectangular tower rises at the center back of the roof. From the intersection of the gravel access roads in front, soil forms a ramp up to the front entrance. A chain across the opening blocks entry. Above the door engraved lettering reads “H.I.P. Company. 1908.” Looking through the doorway you can see the dirt floor covered with scattered stones. On the back wall there are several arched niches. The building sits at the bottom of a low ridge at the very edge of the river. The bank has been cutaway, so that from the side, the building extends down another story with the water lapping at its base. The banks along the river and the low ridge leading down to the building are covered with sagebrush and grasses and an occasional small tree. Looking out over the river, there is a long low island near the far bank to the left.",

    "audioDescription": "This site consists of low stone walls outlining a number of small rooms. From the sidewalk, they are three or four rooms deep in front of you and stretch out to either side. The walls are made of rows of wide, flat rectangular stones, ranging from two to four rows high. One room to the right is semicircular in shape with a small stone circle in the middle. In front of the site is a small graphic panel. Text in the upper left reads, \"Ancestral Pueblo Site. Around 1225, this site was home to a group of Tewa-speaking people who possibly came from Mesa Verde or Chaco Canyon. They built structures out of tuff (welded volcanic ash). This pueblo housed two to three families and consisted of bedrooms, kitchens, storage rooms, and a semicircular kiva, which was used for ceremonies and meetings. Drought, depleted soils, declining numbers of game, and an increasing population caused the Ancestral Puebloans to leave the Pajarito Plateau around the 1500s. This site was reconstructed in the early 2000s with help from experts at Bandelier National Monument and input from local Pueblos. Please respect its history and remain on the sidewalk.\" At bottom left is a black and white photograph of a pueblo, the smooth-sided, rectangular rooms stacked in layers like a wedding cake reaching up to four stories in places. A couple of wooden wagons sit in front. The caption reads, \"Taos Pueblo is one of the longest continually occupied Pueblo dwellings in the United States.\" At upper right is a photograph of an oval stone, carved in an image of a lion head. It has two eyes and two nostrils in the muzzle below with a flat ruff around its neck. The caption reads, \"This lion head, believed to have been carved from local stone by an Ancestral Puebloan, was found in a cave near White Rock in 1955 by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory Archaeologist, Charlie Steen.\" End of Description.",

In those days, the small pond occasionally went dry, but it provided opportunities for swimming and canoeing in the summer and hockey and skating in the winter. When the pond froze over in winter, staff cut out blocks of ice and stored it in the nearby Ice House for summer use.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{5d8217c5-a23a-481b-9124-12a148a60a6a}{60}\" paraid=\"1963664493\">In 1942, Manhattan Project leaders scouted locations for their weapons development laboratory.

This imposing building opened the door to this new reality. At Hanford, and specifically in the B Reactor, the first full-scale nuclear reactor ever constructed, scientists and engineers harnessed the power of the atom and pioneered the processes to produce plutonium on an industrial scale.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{70d94c7c-50df-4766-9ec0-fde0c13f52be}{188}\" paraid=\"1504423616\">In 1942, Physicist Enrico Fermi and his team designed Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1), the world’s first artificial nuclear reactor. CP-1 went critical for the first time on December 2, 1942. Scientists further refined nuclear reactor technology for plutonium production at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/x-10-graphite-reactor.htm\">X-10 </a>Graphite Reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. X-10 went into operation on November 4, 1943. </p> <p paraeid=\"{70d94c7c-50df-4766-9ec0-fde0c13f52be}{251}\" paraid=\"789452983\">Less than two years after Fermi’s successful CP-1 experiment, DuPont Company contractors and Manhattan Project scientists, used Fermi’s CP-1 reactor designs to begin the construction of the B Reactor on June 7, 1943. Despite not having precise blueprints or a firm understanding of the nuclear physics critical to B Reactor’s success, the reactor went critical for the first time on September 26, 1944. </p> <p paraeid=\"{73859b1e-248b-4b7f-8e38-77bf7ad61262}{36}\" paraid=\"1843896078\">Some of the earliest workers at the B Reactor were African American laborers who poured the 23-foot (7 meters) thick concrete foundation for the reactor. High wages enticed African American workers to move to the Tri-Cities. Their job site was rigidly segregated, with African Americans working under all black crews with white foremen and residing either in segregated barracks at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hanford-high-school.htm\">Hanford Construction Camp</a> or in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/lewis-street-underpass.htm\">East Pasco</a>, the only community in the Tri-Cities without rigid racial restrictions.  <br />  <br /> The B Reactor is the centerpiece of a global and local story that required tremendous effort and ingenuity from many people. The uranium that fueled the B Reactor was mined primarily in the Belgian Congo and refined in northern Canada. Several processing plants in the US further refined and milled uranium into billets. The billets were then shipped to Hanford’s <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/300-area-fuel-fabrication-site.htm\">fuel-fabrication area</a> Machines shaped the billets into fuel slugs and sealed the uranium slugs in aluminum jackets.  <br />  <br /> Transported across the Hanford Site by truck, the fuel slugs, which are roughly the size of two Snickers bars stacked end to end, arrived at the B Reactor ready for irradiation. Workers individually loaded sixty-four thousand fuel slugs weighing approximately 500,000 pounds (226 metric tons) by hand into the 2004 process tubes on the front face of the reactor. Fuel spent several weeks to a year in the reactor. Every four to six weeks, workers pushed 10-20% of the irradiated uranium out of the back of the reactor into the water-filled fuel-storage basin. Here, the fuel slugs would thermally and radiologically cool off for approximately two to three months underwater before being shipped to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/t-plant.htm\">T Plant</a> to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium and other radioactive byproducts. This plutonium was shipped to Los Alamos and formed into the core of an atomic weapon.  <br />  <br /> Hanford’s plutonium powered the first man-made atomic explosion at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/trinity-site.htm\">Trinity test</a> on July 16, 1945 and the Fat Man atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. Japan surrendered on August 14, 1945, bringing World War II, the deadliest conflict in human history, to an end. By the end of 1945, over 200,000 people had died as a result of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{73859b1e-248b-4b7f-8e38-77bf7ad61262}{36}\" paraid=\"1843896078\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{73859b1e-248b-4b7f-8e38-77bf7ad61262}{36}\" paraid=\"1843896078\"> <br /> You may only visit the B Reactor on a Department of Energy <a href=\"https://manhattanprojectbreactor.hanford.gov/\">B Reactor Tour</a> ,which are typically offered spring through fall.

    "audioDescription": "This building looks like a pile of rectangular blocks of different sizes. The central rectangle is stacked the highest, with shorter blocks on all sides. The structure is made primarily of gray concrete blocks with a couple of the smaller rectangles made of sheets of concrete asbestos. One of the metal sections forms a low wing extending 80 feet out to the front from near the center of the building. On top of it there is a gridwork of metal girders. Along the side of this extension is a trailer with portable restrooms. On the far side of that section and extending even farther to the front there is a short section of railroad track. At the left end are two locomotive engines, boxy rectangles with a small arche over the engineer’s compartment. Behind the engines are two flat cars. The first one has a central platform that is lowered down between the front and rear wheels. A large rectangular black box sits in that well. The rear car is short, with a lower surface. On top of it is a tall rectangular box with a metal ladder attached to one side. Behind the building, a 200-foot smokestack towers over everything. The entrance is in a one-story section at the right front corner of the building. Double glass doors lead inside. On either side of the entrance are solid, green metal doors that can be closed over the glass entrance. A green bench is located in front of a small extension at the right. To the left are several picnic tables. In front of the entrance is a sign with several plaques on it. Text on the sign reads, “B Reactor, 1944-1968. The World’s First Full-Scale Reactor. 50th Anniversary – American Nuclear Society.” At top center of the sign is an oval plaque that reads “National Historic Landmark, 2880, National Park Service.” Across the lower part of the sign are three rectangular plaques. The one at left reads, “National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark, Hanford B Reactor. Construction begun: June 1943. Reactor loaded: September 1944. This nuclear reactor was the first to demonstrate the practicality of producing large quantities of plutonium and was a major milestone in the United States Atomic Energy Program. Constructed by” E.I. DuPont de Nemours Company. Designed by: Enrico Fermi, John A. Wheeler, Eugene Wigner, and Staff. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 1976.” The middle plaque reads, “B Reactor. As the first full-scale nuclear reactor in the world, B Reactor successfully demonstrated large-scale energy generation using the fission process. Designated as a Nuclear Historic Landmark, October 1992, by the American Nuclear Society.” The plaque at the right reads, “National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, American Society of Civil Engineers. Hanford B Reactor, Manhattan Project. World’s first full scale nuclear reactor. Designated 1994.” Small signs with the radiation symbol to the right of the doorway warn that there are internally contaminated systems and fixed contamination areas inside. As you enter through the doors, a wide hallway in front of you leads to the front face of the reactor. There are some informational graphics on the wall, including logos for NPS and DOE, and a table with a guest register to the right.",

He asked Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. to supply 6,000 tons of silver for this new top-secret undertaking. Stimson wanted assurances that it would be discreetly supplied and discreetly returned at a later date. The Manhattan Project secured approximately 13,540 short tons (395 million troy ounces) of silver from federal government vaults at West Point, New York. It cost over $300 million in contemporary dollars, but a key component of the calutron magnets was now available.<br /> <br /> Beta 3 (9204-3) continues to house the original calutron arrays, or beta “racetracks” used during the Manhattan Project era, operated in conjunction with the alpha racetracks at the neighboring Y-12 Pilot Plant . Also within Beta 3 are the original control rooms where workers including the cubicle operators known as the “Calutron Girls” operated the arrays, separating uranium isotopes with powerful electromagnets. These women helped provide enriched uranium-235 for use in Little Boy, the world’s first atomic bomb. The final product of enriched uranium used in Little Boy came from these beta racetracks. By the end of 1946, all nine alpha racetracks and six beta racetracks had ceased operation, as the gaseous diffusion method used by nearby <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/k-25-gaseous-diffusion-plant.htm\">K-25</a> became the preferred uranium-enrichment method used throughout the Cold War.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{3e1c1b26-fbdf-4138-a4c4-d49239d7eb37}{76}\" paraid=\"1458936377\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{3e1c1b26-fbdf-4138-a4c4-d49239d7eb37}{76}\" paraid=\"1458936377\"><br /> The Y-12 beta racetracks survive as the only production equipment from the electromagnetic isotope separation method.

During the war, between 100 and 225 railroad cars carrying military supplies and equipment arrived here every single day. Soldiers unpacked and repackaged supplies such as jeeps and construction equipment destined for America's allies in the distant Soviet Union and for nearby military facilities in the Pacific Northwest.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8796277b-fd12-4b3d-9d9d-68cec5d3021f}{141}\" paraid=\"1569888381\">Big Pasco consisted of two facilities, the “Pasco Holding and Reconsignment Point,” which primarily handled materiel shipped onward to American allies and the “Pasco Engineer Depot,” whose mission was to supply units and facilities including the Hanford Engineer Works. Big Pasco opened on August 15, 1942, with 1,039,000 square feet (96,526 square meters) of storage space, making it one of the largest wartime logistics centers in the United States.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8796277b-fd12-4b3d-9d9d-68cec5d3021f}{145}\" paraid=\"2063146373\">Due to wartime worker shortages, which also impacted hiring workers for the Manhattan Project at Hanford, approximately 300 Italian POWs labored at Big Pasco from 1944 to 1945. These Italians were among approximately 50,000 Italian soldiers who surrendered on the battlefield and were brought to the United States to serve as workers. Though still enemy prisoners of war, these men were paid the same wages they received in the Italian military, plus $18 per month to spend at the on-site canteen.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8796277b-fd12-4b3d-9d9d-68cec5d3021f}{149}\" paraid=\"987121933\">The Italians contributed mightily to Big Pasco’s mission, “perform[ing]necessary labor operations which have heretofore been neglected because of the impossibility of obtaining sufficient manpower,” according to the Pasco Herald. They especially enjoyed operating heavy equipment and driving American military vehicles, which they had less access to in Italy. During their time in Pasco, some of the Italians attended church at St. Patrick’s Church in Pasco, socialized with local people, and enjoyed foods not found in Italy at the time, such as cornflakes. The prisoners became so well integrated into the surrounding community that they held a Christmas performance for their American coworkers and practiced popular dances such as the boogie-woogie so that they could impress American women at social events. </p> <p paraeid=\"{8796277b-fd12-4b3d-9d9d-68cec5d3021f}{155}\" paraid=\"115662052\">In 1959, the Port of Pasco purchased a portion the World War II army depot. Now known as the Big Pasco Industrial Center, manufacturers, shippers, and produce packers use the industrial center to create, package, and transport their goods to distant markets.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{2798ec98-85a5-4794-8fa4-25a5415330d0}{167}\" paraid=\"1180227080\"><strong>Continue Your Journey </strong></h2> <p paraeid=\"{2798ec98-85a5-4794-8fa4-25a5415330d0}{173}\" paraid=\"83715152\"><br /> Naval Air Station Pasco, now preserved as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/naval-air-station-pasco-pasco-aviation-museum.htm\">Pasco Aviation Museum</a>, was another WWII-era military facility in the Tri-Cities region. The USO club that Naval Air Station Pasco and Big Pasco shared was one of the few integrated USO clubs during World War II. The Tri-Cities was highly segregated during World War II.

The milder climate of the region allowed valuable crops, such as the Bruggemann’s cherries, to ripen early. These crops arrived at market sooner than those grown elsewhere in Washington, which greatly increased the prices local farmers received for their produce.  <br /> <br /> In 1913, the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad completed a spur line to the nearby Priest Rapids area.This allowed farmers to ship perishable produce reliably and profitably to urban markets in the Pacific Northwest and beyond.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3f128691-ad59-41c9-958c-72cb5ab49194}{186}\" paraid=\"37230656\">The cobblestone building material of the Bruggemann Ranch demonstrates the backbreaking labor required to transform this arid grassland into farms.

    "audioDescription": "The main structures here consist of two separate buildings nestled close together. A tall chain link fence with barbed wire on top surrounds the structures. Both are made of concrete faced with stones cobbles ranging in size from three inches to about a foot across. Closest to the entrance road is an L-shaped, one story building, 40 feet deep, with the 30-foot long base of the L extending along the front to the right. The structure is gutted and there is no roof. To the right of that building is a 65-foot-long rectangular building tucked into the corner of the L and extending out to the right, leaving a narrow passageway between the two buildings. Also made of the stone cobbles it is covered with the remains of a peaked roof, now consisting of horizontal planks with wide gaps between them. A stone chimney sits on top of the ridgeline about 15 feet from the left end. Two sets of wide, sliding, wooden doors sit in the middle of the side wall with two openings for windows at the left end. The other sides also have window openings and there is a wooden door in the middle of the back. To the left of the buildings, outside of the fenced area is a large pile of stone cobbles about 50 feet wide and 40 feet deep. From the building side, the cobbles form a ramp to the top of the pile. At the end of the ramp on the far side of the pile are broken pieces of old timber. The land surrounding the structures is flat and covered mostly with grasses, with scattered brush and tumbleweed. Out in the fields there are other remains of walls and concrete foundation footings.",

In March, most residents received eviction notices giving them just 30 days to leave their land and crops. While the majority moved on, others wanted to return to their orchards and fields by day to harvest their spring crops—generally their only source of income. Focused on building the plutonium production facilities, the US Army saw these requests as both a logistic and a security impossibility and denied the requests.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{9525f346-02ff-423f-bdb0-d4816859df9c}{231}\" paraid=\"1509830267\">Farmers protested. Their concerns reached President Franklin Roosevelt just as his administration became concerned about the nation’s food supply. A bipartisan committee led by Senator Harry S. Truman to investigate waste and fraud in wartime spending sent a letter to the Department of War, questioning the military’s need for “such an extensive tract of farmland.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{9525f346-02ff-423f-bdb0-d4816859df9c}{239}\" paraid=\"1001240640\">Colonel Franklin Matthias, commander of the Hanford Engineer Works, reacted to this political pressure by negotiating a contract with Federal Prison Industries, a US government agency responsible for finding uses for and deploying inmate labor. Under the contract, the army would build and maintain a prison camp on the Hanford Site. Federal Prison Industries agreed to provide inmates and undertake the maintenance of “all good orchards, vineyards, and some of the better farm lands . . . and retain all harvested fruit and produce.” The army would supply “all necessary automotive and fencing equipment and would furnish power and coal for the camp.” Minimum security prisoners from McNeill Island, a federal prison in Puget Sound, transferred to Camp Columbia.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bcb7f57f-8641-4d8e-9725-72d317215f6f}{8}\" paraid=\"712839569\">When it opened on February 1, 1944, the camp consisted of 11 wooden buildings salvaged from a former Civilian Conservation Camp in Montana. They served as offices, a hospital, mess hall, and storage buildings. The inmates lived in Quonset hut barracks identical to those that housed construction workers at Hanford. Later, an additional dozen smaller Quonset huts housed administrators and prison guards, plus their families. There was no security fence because there was no need for one. There was no place to go. Most men served their time without incident. Twelve prisoners escaped from Camp Columbia but were quickly apprehended.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{bcb7f57f-8641-4d8e-9725-72d317215f6f}{16}\" paraid=\"1947923370\">The prisoners harvested crops from 550 acres (222.5 hectares) of orchards, 280 acres (130 hectares) of hay and potatoes, 125 acres (50.6 hectares) of vineyards, and 73 acres (29.5 hectares) of asparagus. Altogether, they harvested nearly 5,669 tons (5,142.8 metric tons) of produce.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{bcb7f57f-8641-4d8e-9725-72d317215f6f}{22}\" paraid=\"132858765\">Camp Columbia closed October 14, 1947, after America’s nuclear program transitioned from the army to the Atomic Energy Commission. Camp facilities continued in use until 1950, briefly housing men who worked on the Hanford Site railroad, Columbia River levee projects, and McNary Dam. No structures from Camp Columbia remain on the site. </p> <p paraeid=\"{bcb7f57f-8641-4d8e-9725-72d317215f6f}{28}\" paraid=\"1952825262\">Today, Camp Columbia is <a href=\"https://www.co.benton.wa.us/pview.aspx?id=55234&catid=0\">Horn Rapids County Park</a> operated by Benton County.

Interpretive signs along the trail tell the story of the ice age floods. A rock monument on the trail at elevation 1,250 feet (381 meters) marks the highest shoreline of ancient Lake Lewis. Remnants of the ice age floods visible along the trail include large boulders called “erratics,” transported hundreds of miles in icebergs that melted and dropped their heavy cargo in the ancient lake.

In 1942, General Leslie R. Groves, military leader of the Manhattan Project, directed Lieutenant Colonel Franklin T. Matthias to search the United States for a place to produce plutonium. After viewing several locations, Matthias visited Hanford on December 22 and knew he found an ideal place to produce plutonium. Groves wanted a large, sparsely populated area with ready access to water and electricity. The towns of Hanford, White Bluffs, and Richland were near the site, but all were small farming communities. The Columbia River could supply the water needed to cool the nuclear reactors. The project could get the massive amounts of electric power required for plutonium production from Grand Coulee Dam, which began operating in 1942. On January 16, 1943, Groves approved the Hanford Site as the center for plutonium production.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{ef818f3e-1512-4f65-abd6-34fcefea064a}{58}\" paraid=\"465420822\">From the summit, you can see the 300 Area north of Richland. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/300-area-fuel-fabrication-site.htm\">300 Area Fuel Fabrication Site</a> turned hundreds of thousands of tons of uranium into fuel slugs that the Hanford nuclear reactors irradiated to produce plutonium for the war effort. In the west along the river, the 100 Area contained the nuclear reactors, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/b-reactor.htm\">B Reactor</a>, the world's first full-scale nuclear reactor. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/t-plant.htm\">T Plant</a> and the other plutonium separation facilities were in the 200 Area on the central plateau. The complicated chemical reactions that extracted plutonium from the uranium left vast quantities of chemical and radiological waste held in solid waste burial grounds and leak-prone underground storage tanks. Much of the Department of Energy’s cleanup effort at Hanford today addresses safe disposal of that waste. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ef818f3e-1512-4f65-abd6-34fcefea064a}{141}\" paraid=\"1851129442\"> </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{3f168227-ca77-4d3d-a94b-999aaf405487}{77}\" paraid=\"975299362\">Continue Your Journey </h2> <p paraeid=\"{3f168227-ca77-4d3d-a94b-999aaf405487}{77}\" paraid=\"975299362\">There are many places in the Tri-Cities to enjoy the outdoors.

Outside of the typical day-to-day stresses, you have to adjust to life inside a secret city during wartime America. How would you seek peace and solitude? Where would you go to reflect or worship? <br /> <br /> Oak Ridge had no churches or designated sacred spaces in the early days of the Manhattan Project. Congregants gathered in theaters, schools, and cafeterias to hold religious services. Local civilian leaders requested Manhattan Project administrators provide a dedicated place of worship as a way of developing a more defined sense of community. The Chapel on the Hill fulfilled that need.<br /> <br /> Completed in October 1943, this standard military 700-series chapel was one of three military chapels constructed at Oak Ridge during the Manhattan Project. A Baptist minister named the chapel “Chapel on a Hill” during a prayer of dedication on September 30, 1943. Like many other Manhattan Project buildings, this 700-series chapel was intended to only last for the duration of World War II. Congregants could sit on the main floor as well as above the chapel entrance. The Chapel on the Hill provided people with a space to hold religious services and weddings, as well as community events. After World War II, worshipers added stained glass to the front of the building. <br /> <br /> Many congregations worshiped at the Chapel on the Hill during the Manhattan Project era from Baptist, Catholic, Methodist, and Jewish faiths. Worshipers were not only separated by denomination; they were also segregated by race. Tennessee’s Jim Crow laws required African American and white congregants be segregated while in Oak Ridge’s places of worship. Due to the demand on the Chapel, congregations had at least 200 members. The Catholics held the majority, followed by the Baptists and Methodists. The Chapel on the Hill did not have the capacity to host all the congregations’ services and events, so worship services and events continued to be held in school gymnasiums and auditoriums, theaters, and recreation halls. The Army avoided showing favoritism by denying all church congregations space for their churches.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{2be57b80-eae9-42bf-b38d-06ed43472036}{186}\" paraid=\"1441407626\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{2be57b80-eae9-42bf-b38d-06ed43472036}{186}\" paraid=\"1441407626\"><br /> The United Church, a non-denominational congregation, purchased the Chapel in 1955 and continues services to this day. Over 4,000 weddings were performed here in the chapel’s first 50 years. The Chapel on the Hill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 as part of the Oak Ridge Historic District. The Chapel on the Hill is located directly behind the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/the-guest-house-alexander-inn.htm\"><b>Guest House</b></a> (Alexander Inn) and has limited availability for visitation and special events outside of worship services and hours.

    "audioDescription": "A white wooden church with shingle clad steeple at the top of a grassy hill. From this slanted graphic panel a sidewalk leads to the right, climbing a gentle slope. To the right of the sidewalk is a drive with parking along both sides. At the top of the rise, the drive ends in a parking circle. At that point a series of steps leads up another slope to the left, ending in front of the small church. The wooden building sits on top of the hill with trees on the far side. The door at the front is covered by a small portico with a round window in the peak formed by the roof. On top of the roof is a short steeple. The rectangular building extends back from the front with tall windows along the side. The background of the graphic panel has a black and white photograph of the chapel taken from the hill to the right, looking across the parking circle to the side of the building. The caption reads, “Chapel on the Hill, one of three US Army chapels built in Oak Ridge during World War II, 1944.” Text across the bottom of the panel reads, “In the early days of the Manhattan Project, people gathered in theaters, cafeterias, and schools to attend religious services. Leaders of these groups appealed to administrators to provide dedicated places of worship. Completed in October 1943, a standard military 700-Series chapel was made available for weddings, worship services, and other functions. At peak wartime activity, more than 20 separate congregations, including Jewish, Baptist, Catholic, and Methodist denominations shared the chapel for round-the-clock services. The name ‘Chapel on the Hill’ comes from a prayer of dedication made by the Baptist minister on September 20, 1943. Still in use today, the church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 as part of the Oak Ridge Historic District as a contributing property.” About halfway along the sidewalk up to the church is a state historical marker which reads, “Built in 1943 near the main business district (Jackson Square), this standard Army chapel was soon known within the Manhattan Project as ‘The Chapel on the Hill.’ On 30 September 1943 it was dedicated for Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant worship. The United Church, a non-denominational congregation founded 18 July 1943, purchased the chapel in 1955 and continues to worship here. More than 4,000 weddings were celebrated in this ecumenical chapel during the first fifty years.”",

For almost 30 years schoolchildren of Oak Ridge learned in this building, the former Highland View Elementary School.<br /> <br /> In July of 1943, residents began moving into their Oak Ridge homes. The school year began on October 4th with just over 600 students enrolled in Oak Ridge schools. By the end of the school year, enrollment had swelled to 5,000 children. For the next two years, Oak Ridge continued to build schools for its rapidly growing population. Pine Valley opened in December 1943, Cedar Hill in early 1944, and Highland View and Glenwood later that same year. Towards the end of World War II, school enrollment had reached 11,000 students. The Oak Ridge school system could not keep up with the population growth. Frequently, children and teachers made due without books, desks, pencils and paper. Oak Ridge's educational system depended heavily on teachers. Because of its lack of resources, the schools used a collaborative approach in administration and teacher involvement in curriculum planning.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{f6322e54-c861-4dd8-a5b1-e517b5fbddfc}{119}\" paraid=\"210574793\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{f6322e54-c861-4dd8-a5b1-e517b5fbddfc}{119}\" paraid=\"210574793\"><br /> Teachers continued to hold classes here after the war, up until 1973. In 1974, the building reopened as the Children’s Museum of Oak Ridge. Today, visitors of all ages are welcome to enjoy a wide array of exhibits, including hands-on learning opportunities in art, science, environmental studies, history, and world cultures. The Children’s Museum of Oak Ridge is also home to the Manhattan Project National Historical Park Oak Ridge Visitor Center. Visitors can speak with National Park Service rangers and volunteers, watch a short film on the history of the Manhattan Project, stamp a passport book, get a Junior Ranger booklet, and get literature on the various Manhattan Project-related historic sites throughout the secret city.</p> <p paraeid=\"{782e970f-76d3-4340-a644-e080d26697fc}{132}\" paraid=\"1162946309\">For more information on the Children’s Museum of Oak Ridge, please visit their <a href=\"https://childrensmuseumofoakridge.org/\">website</a>. For more information on the Manhattan Project National Historical Park’s Oak Ridge visitor center, please visit the park's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/mapr/planyourvisit/oakridge-visitorcenter.htm\">website</a>.</p> <p paraeid=\"{782e970f-76d3-4340-a644-e080d26697fc}{156}\" paraid=\"1858929428\"> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "There is a slanted graphic panel here along the sidewalk at the edge of this quiet street. From here, there is a small bank down to the parking lot which stretches in both directions along the front of the long building. The museum is housed in a former school and consists of a central rectangle with a long wing extending out to each side. The entrance to the building is in the middle of the left wing. The right wing is set back, intersecting the central structure halfway back. A peaked roof forms a portico in front of the main entrance which may be reached by a set of three steps in front or by a ramp on the right side. An oval sign at the peak of the portico reads “Children’s Museum of Oak Ridge.” There is another sign on the side of the building to the right of the ramp which reads “Manhattan Project National Historical Park” and has the National Park Service arrowhead logo on it. Inside the front doors, the information desk for the museum is in front of you and slightly to the right. An open doorway immediately to your left leads into an exhibit area. Another opening straight ahead, past the information desk, leads to other areas of the museum. To the immediate right is an information desk for the Manhattan Project National Historical Park. A small gift shop may be reached by going to the right between the two information desks. The graphic panel in front has a black and white aerial photograph of the building taken from a viewpoint about 45 degrees to your right as you face the sign. The two wings can be seen along with the back of the central structure that is built into the slope which falls away behind the building. Houses surround the building on all sides. Text at the bottom of the panel reads, “The rapidly increasing population of Oak Ridge during the early 1940s led to a high demand for housing. At one point, homes within the Secret City were being completed every 30 minutes. Oak Ridge needed a school system to meet the educational needs of its community. “General Leslie Groves, military commander of the Manhattan Project, insisted that the schools be of the highest quality, if he wanted to keep scientists in rural Tennessee. The school system hired the most highly qualified teachers from all over the country and from neighboring communities. How? By paying them more. “Schools were constructed within walking distance of most homes, and by 1946, three years after Oak Ridge was established, had roughly 7,000 students enrolled in 10 elementary schools, one high school, and one junior high. “The building you see before you today was Highland View Elementary, one of the few remaining original Oak Ridge school buildings.”",

Military personnel were often placed in barracks within the military section of Los Alamos, while civilian staff were housed in one of four civilian dormitories in town, in what is now downtown Los Alamos. Designed by Willard C. Kruger, who also designed many non-military facilities for Project Y, dormitories were some of the earliest buildings to be built on the mesa. T-178, a men’s dormitory, first appears on a map in August 1943, this map also included the first Women’s Army Corps (WAC) barracks in the military section in the Western area. In total, four civilian dormitories were constructed on the mesa, two male dormitories and two female dormitories, the female dormitory is all that remains today.  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{66d159ee-e16a-4548-8530-c76101dd813b}{187}\" paraid=\"512117054\">Sometimes called “Priority Dorms,” civilian dormitories, were in high demand, and always had a wait list because they were known to be plush, with a shared bathroom. In an interview, Rebecca Bradford Diven speaks about her life as civilian personnel for the Manhattan Project and what life was like living in a civilian dormitory. <a href=\"https://www.manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/rebecca-bradford-divens-interview\">Listen to her interview through the “Voices of the Manhattan Project.”</a> Diven describing the dormitory setting and what was provided to her by the project said, “We had army blankets, army sheets, army towels, army washcloths. And it was a little startling when you picked up the washcloth and towel and things and every one said USED, U-S-E-D, United States Engineer Detachment, and we all had great jokes about our “used” linens. The dorm cost $15 a month, including maid service, laundry, and they cleaned the rooms. And the mess hall, I don’t know if I remember what it cost, it must have been maybe $25, I think, a month for three meals a day, and I just had forgotten to include that in the dormitory.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{1b3360a8-c648-4d5d-a563-38d120158b50}{228}\" paraid=\"7750137\"> </p>",

This watering hole provided water for people and livestock as they began settling middle-Tennessee in the 19th century. During the Manhattan Project prior to the swimming pool’s construction, many workers in the new secret city used the pond to cool off during the summer months. The 58,630 square foot (5446.9 sq meters) swimming pool holds approximately 2.2 million gallons (8,327,905.9 liters) of water, making it one of the largest spring-fed swimming pools in the United States.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{212346b5-3425-4ca1-9316-42793b7c2e9a}{43}\" paraid=\"1568858046\">For White workers, the community swimming pool provided much needed respite from the daily grind of top-secret atomic weapons development. Segregation during World War II prevented Black workers and their families from enjoying facilities such as this pool and other community centers throughout Oak Ridge. After working long hours at top-secret uranium separating facilities, White Manhattan Project workers would often come here to relax in the sun and enjoy the cool water.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{212346b5-3425-4ca1-9316-42793b7c2e9a}{43}\" paraid=\"1568858046\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{212346b5-3425-4ca1-9316-42793b7c2e9a}{43}\" paraid=\"1568858046\"><br /> In Oak Ridge, community centers like <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/jackson-square.htm\">Jackson Square</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/grove-center.htm\">Grove Center</a> provided white residents with an escape from the daily grind, as did recreational facilities like the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/community-tennis-courts.htm\">tennis courts</a>. <br /> <br /> The pool, located across from Grove Center, is open during the summer months.

Along with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/community-swimming-pool.htm\">community swimming pool</a>, the community tennis courts helped to provide much-needed recreation for workers and residents. Being one of the few paved outdoor spaces in the Secret City, the tennis courts also became an ideal location for dances on pleasant evenings. The first tennis court dance was held on July 22, 1944 and soon became a weekly event with dozens of couples in attendance. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6f29c9cc-eaa5-4dbf-9ed9-c5fdd4991448}{106}\" paraid=\"214913916\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{6f29c9cc-eaa5-4dbf-9ed9-c5fdd4991448}{106}\" paraid=\"214913916\"><br /> The community tennis courts remain open to this day.

Manhattan Project families established the <a href=\"https://www.richlandplayers.org/\">Richland Players</a>, which is still a thriving local theater company. Formal and informal arts classes also began during the Manhattan Project and led to the 1948 founding of <a href=\"https://www.galleryatthepark.org/\">Allied Arts</a>, an organization dedicated to bringing more creative opportunities to the postwar atomic city. </p> <p paraeid=\"{11436043-1b24-491b-99c5-02d4ebc1f793}{169}\" paraid=\"375127906\"> <br /> Richland’s residents played a pivotal role in the Cold War, producing much of the plutonium used in the United States’ nuclear weapons.

Access to the highly-secured Clinton Engineer Works (Oak Ridge) was a top priority in order to provide transportation for both people and equipment to the area. Seven security gates operated 24 hours a day 7 days a week, providing armed security at the Clinton Engineer Works’ access points. <br /> <br /> One of seven gates controlling access to Oak Ridge, the Edgemoor Gatehouse controlled traffic entering the reservation via Edgemoor Road connecting to Highway 25, providing access from Knoxville. As the number of people involved in the Manhattan Project grew, construction workers converted Highway 25 into a 4-lane highway in 1945. The expansion began in July of 1945 but was not completed until April of 1946, over six months after the war's end. In addition to the expansion of Highway 25, improvements to Edgemoor Bridge and Edgemoor Road had to be made due to the high traffic volume that occurred along the route.<br /> <br /> The Edgemoor Gatehouse opened on March 19, 1949 when Oak Ridge officially opened to the public. That same day, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/elza-gate.htm\"><b>Elza Gate</b></a>, Solway Gate, and Oliver Springs Gate opened.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{86bf4d82-d37f-4fb0-8a1c-caffd6b6686f}{83}\" paraid=\"329115204\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{86bf4d82-d37f-4fb0-8a1c-caffd6b6686f}{83}\" paraid=\"329115204\"><br /> The Edgemoor Gatehouse no longer exists.

Inside, nearly 10,000 Oak Ridge residents mingled with Hollywood movie stars, including Donald O'Connor, Adolph Menjou, Patricia Neal, Virginia Mayo, and Jack Bailey. Following fifteen minutes of brief speeches, Dr. George T. Felbeck, the Union Carbide executive responsible for building and operating the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/k-25-gaseous-diffusion-plant.htm\">K-25</a> plant, used atomic energy from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/x-10-graphite-reactor.htm\">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a> to ‘cut’ a symbolic ribbon, which then disappeared in a puff of smoke. Elza Gate no longer guarded the perimeter of the city. The secret city of Oak Ridge was open to the public. <br />  <br /> The Elza Gatehouse, named after a small, nearby community, operated as one of three checkpoints positioned within the secret city. Many considered Elza the main entrance to Oak Ridge. During World War II, armed guards stood at the gatehouse 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They ensured that access to Oak Ridge remained continuously controlled, only allowing authorized personnel to pass through. When Oak Ridge opened to the public, the city soon became famous for its technological achievements. <br />  <br /> At the time of the Elza Gate’s opening, this revolutionary scientific community still produced enriched uranium at K-25, but the future of nuclear production was uncertain. Over 20,000 workers had lost their jobs with the closure of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/y-12-national-security-complex.htm\">Y-12</a> plant. An ongoing bus strike prevented many locals from attending the opening ceremonies. These difficulties reflected the uncertainty Oak Ridge faced as the Manhattan Project came to an end and the site sought a new purpose. The city’s opening ceremony featured a parade with 16 trained riders, numerous floats, and 20 marching bands. It publicly announced that the Manhattan Project’s extreme secrecy was over and signaled to Oak Ridge residents that the town’s main employer, the Atomic Energy Commission, had fully committed to the city’s future economic growth.  <br />  <br /> This gatehouse operated as part of a security system that controlled access to Oak Ridge during the Manhattan Project. It employed 4,900 civilian guards, 740 military police officers and over 400 civilian police officers.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{4163da4f-2448-4075-a885-7d9ce1936c4f}{114}\" paraid=\"2065867719\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{35c1e394-57d6-45b5-bdee-94452bcedf60}{216}\" paraid=\"1775048978\">Guests visiting other former gatehouse sites, such as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/midway-gatehouse.htm\">Midway Gatehouse</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/turnpike-gatehouse.htm\">Turnpike Gatehouse</a>, can gain a sense of the tight security during WWII.

The library’s solid structure demonstrates the early settlers’ desire to create a permanent and well-educated community in their new home. The building itself is an important historic structure from Pasco’s pre-Manhattan Project past. The community served as a major railway center where farm products from the Columbia Basin, such as sweet cherries and grapes, were shipped to consumers throughout the nation. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4114db47-3546-42e3-9b68-289eb68a32f8}{125}\" paraid=\"1604298030\">While the railroad and agriculture sustained Pasco’s businesses and people in the early 1900s, World War II really spurred massive local population increases. Constructed in 1942, Naval Air Station Pasco was a major training facility and defensive air base that brought approximately 4,000 airmen to Pasco.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{4114db47-3546-42e3-9b68-289eb68a32f8}{143}\" paraid=\"1636441901\">Also constructed in 1942, Big Pasco was one of the largest military freight depots in the United States and brought additional workers and military personnel to Pasco. The Manhattan Project’s Hanford Site, which began construction in 1943, used Pasco as the receiving site for the workers, equipment, and building materials that arrived by rail. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4114db47-3546-42e3-9b68-289eb68a32f8}{161}\" paraid=\"135713415\">Visit <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/franklin-county-historical-society.htm\">Franklin County Historical Society</a> to learn more. <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{4114db47-3546-42e3-9b68-289eb68a32f8}{172}\" paraid=\"883861560\"><strong>Continue Your Journey </strong><br />  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{4114db47-3546-42e3-9b68-289eb68a32f8}{178}\" paraid=\"667973145\">Nearby there are several sites where you can learn more about life in the Pasco during World War II. <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/big-pasco.htm\">Big Pasco</a> was the site of a major logistics and transportation hub for the wartime US military.

When General Leslie Groves approved Oak Ridge as the site for one of the largest wartime scientific programs in history on September 19, 1942, several factors had already determined that the secret city was the ideal location for the massive uranium-enrichment effort. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9a91a33f-b128-4196-b433-915e1aa4c710}{152}\" paraid=\"207271720\">Surrounded by rivers and railways, Oak Ridge had massive hydroelectric resources from the nearby Tennessee Valley Authority dams and efficient means of transporting goods and services via an existing railroad. Manhattan Project personnel only needed to lay a short railroad spur to move goods to and from the site. </p> <p paraeid=\"{9a91a33f-b128-4196-b433-915e1aa4c710}{198}\" paraid=\"1163993340\">In addition, with the United States just coming out of the Great Depression, there was an abundance of laborers looking for work and willing to travel from nearby communities and states. Also, Manhattan Project administrators bought the land at rock bottom prices when they displaced the rural farm communities. At approximately $40 per acre, this was a low price considering 59,000 acres were ultimately purchased to create the massive uranium-enrichment facilities and the surrounding community infrastructure. </p> <p paraeid=\"{bd04326b-5ac5-45d7-b154-7481346617d0}{11}\" paraid=\"2042974088\">Lastly, Oak Ridge’s topography featured long rolling ridges with steep, narrow valleys. These individual valleys provided an ideal location to build the uranium-enrichment facilities, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/k-25-gaseous-diffusion-plant.htm\">K-25</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/y-12-national-security-complex.htm\">Y-12</a>. With each facility resting in its own steep, narrow valley, Manhattan Project administrators could be assured that if an accident or enemy attack occurred at one facility, it would not affect the operations of another nearby. The main community of Oak Ridge was laid in a longer, more centralized valley, with the uranium-enrichment facilities hidden from view. </p> <h3 paraeid=\"{bd04326b-5ac5-45d7-b154-7481346617d0}{11}\" paraid=\"2042974088\">Continue Your Journey</h3> <p paraeid=\"{bd04326b-5ac5-45d7-b154-7481346617d0}{11}\" paraid=\"2042974088\"><br /> As you tour Oak Ridge today, take a moment to notice the locations of K-25, Y-12, and ORNL with respect to the community itself. What do you notice about the layout of the Secret City? Do you think General Groves and his team were correct in selecting this area for top-secret atomic weapons development? </p>",

The rivalry between the US and the Soviet Union led both nations to rapidly increase their stockpile of nuclear weapons. Consequently, the US needed more plutonium for its nuclear weapons. This increased demand for plutonium led to the construction of additional reactors and processing facilities, a constant influx of new workers, and a need for more housing. The Gold Coast Historic District is one of the neighborhoods that sprang up in Richland at the start of the Cold War.  <br />  <br /> Constructed in 1949, these early Cold War era homes retained the standardized design and minimalist architecture familiar from the earlier alphabet homes built during the Manhattan Project. The homes’ easy construction enabled the Atomic Energy Commission, which took control of the Hanford Site after the war, to comfortably house workers moving into this booming community. Like earlier <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/richland-laundry-and-alphabet-homes.htm\">alphabet homes</a>, these houses initially were government property, and residents were renters who were strictly limited in their ability to renovate or alter their residences.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{52dadcff-f39e-400f-899f-7e66dbc44356}{134}\" paraid=\"1441275063\">This area near the Columbia River was known as the “gold coast” because the homes were larger and more expensive than earlier homes and tended to house professionals. It is still a sought-after neighborhood, demonstrating the enduring impact of the Manhattan Project in the Tri-Cities region and how postwar Richland continued to grow in tandem with the United States’ atomic energy program. </p> <h2>Continue Your Journey</h2> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/uptown-shopping-center.htm\">Uptown Shopping Center</a>, one of the first car-friendly shopping malls constructed in the postwar United States, was also built during the same boom period as the Gold Coast alphabet homes. It was a marked contrast from the Manhattan Project era’s pedestrian-friendly shopping district <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/the-parkway.htm\">The Greenway</a> (Richland Parkway), which was situated so that workers in the earlier alphabet homes could reach it by foot. Several buildings near the Parkway, including <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/gresss-meat-market-frost-me-sweet.htm\">Gress’s Meat Market</a> (Frost Me Sweet), and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/dyer-building-gallery-in-the-park.htm\">Dyer Building</a> (Gallery at the Park) were originally part of the pre-war village of Richland. These buildings are excellent places to contemplate how the early years of the Atomic Age and plutonium production changed and shaped the history of Richland",

This bridge replaced a dated ferry system that could only transport six cars at a time across the river. Like two other bridges that span the Columbia River, the Longview Bridge (now the Lewis and Clark Bridge) and the Bridge of the Gods, the Pasco-Kennewick Bridge was a steel cantilever truss. A cantilever bridge is a structure that project horizontally into space and a truss is a is an assembly of beams, connected by nodes, that creates a rigid structure. </p> <p paraeid=\"{086c5d60-8fd6-472d-ae10-5489c265c623}{251}\" paraid=\"71053221\">Construction required 1,115 tons (1,011,511 kg) of steel for the 3,300-foot (1,006 m) structure and more than a million board feet of timber in the decking and approaches. It was the first the steel cantilever truss bridge to be built across the Columbia River. The simplistic design reflects the structural advice of J.A.L. Waddell, a writer and leading bridge engineer in the early 1900s. At its completion, green paint covered the steel bridge earning it the nickname “the Green Bridge.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{ac624926-5fb2-4e1c-94e4-1d795409ee9a}{6}\" paraid=\"700760852\">Groundbreaking took place on the Pasco side on March 15, 1921. Cars paid .75 cents, bicycles paid .20 cents, and trucks weighing less than one ton paid $2.00 to cross the bridge. The bridge you see here today, the Cable Bridge, officially called the Ed Hendler Bridge, replaced the Green Bridge in 1978. The Green Bridge was demolished in 1990 at age 68. The Historic American Engineering Record of the National Park Service recognizes the Green Bridge as a significant engineering achievement. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ac624926-5fb2-4e1c-94e4-1d795409ee9a}{16}\" paraid=\"870755329\">The Green Bridge began as a symbol of unity and progress. No one could have known then that the bridge would eventually gain a new and menacing significance, one of exclusion. The Green Bridge became dividing line between Kennewick, a community that sought to exclude Blacks, and Pasco, a community that sought to confine Blacks.

As car ownership rose, Eastern and Western Washington wanted to expand the road system and economic opportunities. The two sides of the state collaborated on building a bridge across the Columbia River to replace a ferry between the rural towns of Pasco and Kennewick. The bridge became part of the transcontinental highway system and earned the nickname “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/green-bridge.htm\">Green Bridge</a>” due to its green-colored paint. </p> <p paraeid=\"{fd2238e6-a44c-4b89-b1a1-a07b0eb6741a}{193}\" paraid=\"1159744960\">No one could have known then that the Green Bridge would eventually gain a new and menacing significance, one of exclusion. The Green Bridge would become a dividing line between Kennewick, a community that sought to exclude Blacks, and Pasco, a community that sought to confine Blacks. <br />  <br /> The change came with World War II as an influx of Black and White workers flooded the Hanford Construction Camp as part of the top-secret Manhattan Project. The camp was located upstream of Pasco and Kennewick on the Hanford Site. The workers knew they were building facilities related to national defense. They didn’t know that those facilities would produce plutonium for the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan in 1945.<br />  <br /> Most general laborers came from out of state since the army chose to build the Hanford Site in a rural part of the Inland Northwest. The army’s main contractor, the DuPont Corporation, mainly recruited workers from the South where wages were low. DuPont promised Black and White women and men from the South higher wages if they would migrate to Hanford. <br />  <br /> Hanford and the surrounding communities boomed overnight. About 15,000 Blacks arrived in what is now known as the Tri-Cities in 1943-45. At its peak, Hanford employed more than 50,000 workers. Although the pay was better, Blacks encountered a system of racial segregation much like the Jim Crow laws of the South.<br />  <br /> The lack of housing was an acute issue for Blacks. Hanford Construction Camp offered some onsite segregated housing, but not enough to accommodate all the Black workers. Kennewick refused to allow Blacks to live within its community or stay in its hotels. Because Blacks were only hired as temporary workers, they could not live in the planned government community of Richland that was only for permanent workers like scientists. <br />  <br /> The DuPont Corporation negotiated with Pasco to put one barrack and one bunkhouse in East Pasco for Blacks. Traditionally, the eastern side of the railroad tracks in Pasco had been a community for non-White railroad workers since Pasco birth as a railroad town in the late 1800s. This non-White community, which included several Black families, remained relatively small until Dupont and the rest of the Tri-Cities considered East Pasco the de facto place where Blacks should live outside of the segregated Hanford Construction Camp housing. <br />  <br /> The one barrack and one bunkhouse didn’t fully ease housing needs. Some Blacks were forced into makeshift residences like trailers, shacks, and tents in East Pasco. Unlike West Pasco, East Pasco lacked basic city services like sewage connections, trash collection, paved roads, fire hydrants and streetlights into the 1960s.<br />  <br /> While Pasco was trying to confine Blacks, Kennewick was trying to exclude them. Kennewick police would routinely stop Blacks passing through. Kennewick posted a sign on the Green Bridge that declared Kennewick as a sundown town, a place where Blacks aren’t allowed after sunset. <br />  <br /> The exclusion continued after World War II ended and many Blacks left the Tri-Cities. The Hanford Site expanded in response to the Cold War and a second wave of Black migrants moved to the Tri-Cities. Katie Barton and her husband moved to Pasco in 1949 to work at Hanford. Katie Barton said, “They didn’t even want no Black people in Kennewick. You couldn’t buy a house there; you couldn’t go to the movies there; they wouldn’t put you in jail there. [The] Tri-Cities was worse than the south ever was because you knew where you stood there. But you didn’t know here you stood here.” <br />  <br /> Today, a bridge still connects Kennewick and Pasco although it is no longer the Green Bridge. After engineers built a new cable bridge between the two cities in 1978, the citizens of Kennewick and Pasco voted to demolish the Green Bridge. Although almost all traces of the Green Bridge are gone, visitors can still see a piece of railing from the Green Bridge that is displayed in front of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/visit-east-benton-county-historical-museum.htm\">East Benton County Historical Society & Museum</a>.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{fd2238e6-a44c-4b89-b1a1-a07b0eb6741a}{250}\" paraid=\"1019348115\">Continue Your Journey  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{fd2238e6-a44c-4b89-b1a1-a07b0eb6741a}{250}\" paraid=\"1019348115\">Visit the original location of the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/green-bridge.htm\">Green Bridge</a> to learn more about the construction of the bridge.

George Gress built and operated Gress’s Meat Market here from 1915 until 1943 when the Manhattan Project displaced most of Richland’s existing businesses and residents. The building has no side windows because butcher Gress had anticipated a growing commercial district. Since closure of the meat market, this building has served as a newspaper office, tavern, library, chocolate store, restaurant, and a sweet shop. <br />  <br /> Long-time Richland resident Laverne Sloppy mentioned Gress’s butcher shop in an oral history interview. He noted that Gress stored frozen meat for the surrounding farms that operated without electricity. Sloppy remembered visiting the market where George Gress “always would give us sausage. He'd hang one of those sausages around the kid's neck and stuff.” Like most pre-war residents, the Sloppy family lost their Richland farm to the Manhattan Project.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{10fa9f7d-2d89-4384-a8ac-598431ba3f73}{156}\" paraid=\"2093038042\">A dusty farming town founded in 1905, Richland suddenly became a secret city with the arrival of the Manhattan Project. Population swelled from about 250 residents in 1940 to approximately 15,000 residents in August 1945. The newcomers lived in compact, planned suburban neighborhoods of standardized “<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/rodney-block-park.htm\">alphabet homes</a>” designed for streamlined construction. By the end of the war, most buildings and streets in Richland would have been unfamiliar to a pre-war resident. Today, Richland is a thriving community, many of whose residents focus on cleaning up the nuclear and chemical waste from the Manhattan Project and Cold War plutonium production. </p> <h2>Continue Your Journey</h2> <br /> The area surrounding Gress’s Meat Market was the center of Richland during the Manhattan Project. It still is today.

Grove Center comprised a grocery store, clothing store, a shoe store, and other businesses. Grove Center’s main attraction, though, was the <a href=\"http://thegrovetheater.org/\">Grove Theater</a>.

During the Manhattan Project, many concerts were held at the theater, ranging from classical violinists to gospel groups. The popular music group the Oak Ridge Boys began their career here.  Formed in nearby Knoxville in 1943, the group, originally named Wally Fowler and the Georgia Clodhoppers, performed for Manhattan Project workers so often they ultimately changed their name to the Oak Ridge Quartet in 1947, and finally settled on the Oak Ridge Boys in 1961. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{b905dc5b-a499-47b3-b774-3fb7637d9968}{123}\" paraid=\"878343945\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{b905dc5b-a499-47b3-b774-3fb7637d9968}{250}\" paraid=\"1182863200\">Today the Grove Center offers similar shopping, dining, and entertainment experiences found during the Manhattan Project. The closest Manhattan Project-era historic site within walking distance of Grove Center is the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/community-swimming-pool.htm\">Community Swimming Pool</a>, located directly across the street. </p>",

After graduating from West Point in 1918, he was assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers. He was a dominant, controlling personality, a practical-minded military engineer, brusque, egotistical, and confident. He would later tell his associates, “If I can’t do the job, no one man can.” He had overseen the construction of the Pentagon in Washington, DC in 1939.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{86f1fe00-8628-42ed-9610-ff673599c3f9}{125}\" paraid=\"1226349053\">Groves needed to find a director for the scientists who would ultimately design and build the bomb. That person also had to possess unique characteristics. Groves and the scientists came from different worlds. They found Groves overbearing and demanding. He found them theoretical and totally oblivious to the practical problems associated with building huge and complicated construction projects quickly. He needed someone to bridge the gap.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{86f1fe00-8628-42ed-9610-ff673599c3f9}{131}\" paraid=\"110610015\">He ultimately chose 38-year-old Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, a charismatic theoretical physicist at the University of California at Berkeley. The son of a wealthy New York textile importer, he graduated summa cum laude in physics in three years. He received his PhD degree at twenty-three and accepted a teaching position at the California Institute of Technology. Already familiar with the design concepts of a bomb, Oppenheimer would be Groves’ intermediary with the scientists and direct all research on the bomb in one location.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{86f1fe00-8628-42ed-9610-ff673599c3f9}{137}\" paraid=\"1575854966\">The thin, chain-smoking Oppenheimer was “eccentric” by his own admission, had relatively little administrative experience, had not won a Nobel Prize, and had family members who were suspected of being communist sympathizers. Despite all that, Groves personally issued his security clearance in July 1943 over the objection of the FBI. The two formed a special relationship, understanding that the bomb might be the route to future fame for them both.  </p> <h2>Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{7ebd83c8-df26-4a4c-97b1-2fa62560ac2e}{159}\" paraid=\"1556811485\"><br /> As you walk around downtown Los Alamos, you can explore the rest of the Los Alamos Historical Society campus.

It included an assortment of typical ranch buildings, but also included a large, flat stretch of land perfect for gun emplacements. A bordering canyon provided natural protection for the control building.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{bea4bb79-1c62-45b4-a068-3bce0998d713}{221}\" paraid=\"874977691\">The firing range gave researchers a chance to study projectile movement, the effects of impact, interior ballistics, and more. Using a large periscope, researchers had a full view of the test range during shots. The site had one major disadvantage. It proved difficult to protect the nearby road during tests. Despite best efforts to blockade traffic, cars occasionally slipped through. Fortunately, researchers managed to carry off their tests safely.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{6d0c2570-e859-4f22-973e-acd89566b7ab}{2}\" paraid=\"1220767407\">When the laboratory began to focus on implosion, early explosives efforts started at Anchor Ranch as well. Working with pentolite, the researchers soon discovered issues in exploding high-density charges of the substance. Their work underscored the inadequacy of current knowledge of high-explosives. Eventually, as the explosives program expanded, tests moved to S-Site.   </p> <h2 aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{34c8dad7-39af-4a4f-b480-32ebd858df5c}{104}\" paraid=\"2140785079\" role=\"heading\">Continue Your Journey </h2>   <p aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{34c8dad7-39af-4a4f-b480-32ebd858df5c}{110}\" paraid=\"875594665\" role=\"heading\">Behind the fence, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/the-concrete-bowl.htm\">Concrete Bowl</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/quonset-hut-ta-22-1.htm\">Quonset Hut TA-22-1</a>, were important to the creation of the atomic bomb.

    "audioDescription": "This site features bunker-style structures with exposed fronts made of weathered concrete. The sides and backs of the structures are covered with soil. As you face the structures, the long front wall on the left has two entrances, one for TA-8-3 at the far left and one for TA-8-1 near the middle. To the right is a third structure, TA-8-2. Between the two structures is a narrow gravel road leading up a wooded slope behind the buildings. The section at the far left has a set of wooden steps leading up to a wood porch that stretches a third of the way along the section. At the right side of the porch is a set of wooden double doors. At the left side is a single-door-sized opening covered with a sheet of plywood. The wall around the doors is painted a cream color. There are four metal grills surrounding the double doors, two on either side at floor-level and the other two directly above those, just above the height of the doors. Higher up on the wall above the doors are two rusty cylinders. Pipes come out of the wall below each, enter the base of cylinder and exit out its top. The entrance in the middle of the building has a raised concrete porch in front of it with wooden steps on the left. The rectangular opening in the concrete is filled with a wooden wall section painted turquoise. On the left side of the wall is a wooden door with four panes of glass on its top half. The door is painted dark green. Signs posted near each of the entrances identify each building as a Manhattan Project National Historical Park Historic building. On the right third of the building is another door-sized opening, this one covered by a sheet of plywood. To the right of that door, there is a long, horizontal window, about six feet long and two feet tall. A long, two-foot-high concrete curb sits on the gravel in front of the door and window. The next building on the right side of the gravel road extends back into the hill. The narrow end towards us is rounded. On the far side, away from the road, is another concrete porch with two sets of green metal doors. End of Description.",

In 1943, the Manhattan Project used the government’s power of eminent domain to take Hanford’s land, evicting the people who had made this arid landscape into a home that they loved.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{4944ae25-e946-4397-a46d-167d906f5936}{167}\" paraid=\"773313741\">Constructed in 1916, this building is one of the few surviving structures from the town of Hanford. The school caught fire in 1936, and Hanford students commuted to neighboring White Bluffs High School while it was repaired. The situation reversed a few years later when White Bluffs High School burned. Farmers’ children often had to cut their education short to support their families. Yet Hanford’s children graduated at a much higher rate than most Americans who lived in farming communities. This building’s solid construction further demonstrates the importance of education to the farmers and ranchers who homesteaded in Hanford before the war. <br />  <br /> The Manhattan Project converted the high school into offices. The surrounding area became a bustling construction camp that housed the workforce that built <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/b-reactor.htm\">B Reactor</a> and Hanford’s other plutonium production facilities. The camp opened in 1943 and soon had a population of over 40,000. By the summer of 1945, it was the third largest city in Washington State. Its eight mess halls could serve over 10,000 meals at a single sitting. Most of the labor force lived in huge barracks, segregated by sex and race. Managers and supervisors lived with their families in hundreds of tiny house trailers. Other professional staff tended to live in Richland, which became a family-oriented town with numerous amenities. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4944ae25-e946-4397-a46d-167d906f5936}{182}\" paraid=\"1831781846\">The camp’s approximately 1,175 buildings were moved or demolished once plutonium production began. Their location near the nuclear reactor and processing plants gave easy access to the construction sites, but it would have placed people who continued to work at the site at risk when the facilities they had built started up.   </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{0ab5ae06-6d1c-4883-a281-aba8c7a5550b}{223}\" paraid=\"658902464\">Continue Your Journey   </h2> <p paraeid=\"{0ab5ae06-6d1c-4883-a281-aba8c7a5550b}{223}\" paraid=\"658902464\"><br /> Nearby historic structures, such as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/t-plant.htm\">T Plant</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/b-reactor.htm\">B Reactor</a>, demonstrate the hard work that Manhattan Project laborers performed in this top-secret weapons program.

    "audioDescription": "The remains of the Hanford High School form a two-story concrete shell. The front right corner of the building faces the intersection of the two roads here. Looking at the front façade of the building makes it clear that the left part of the building was a later addition. The right half features closely spaced window openings and a horizontal ridge near the roofline. The main entrance sits in the middle of this half of the building with a roof covering the wide door opening in the first floor with wide windows above it and an ornamental peaked façade on top with raised letters that read “High School.” The left half of the building has a plain roofline and larger, more widely spaced, window openings. You can look through any of the window openings to see grasses and brush growing inside to match the fields surrounding the structure. Only the walls are standing so the sky is visible through the window openings as well. The entire structure is surround by a tall, chain link fence with barbed wire on top. A sign on the fence in front of the main entrance reads “Hanford High School, 1916-1943.” The land surrounding the school building is flat, fallow fields with sage brush, tumbleweed and grasses. To the left of the building is a low ridge which hides a view of the river. On the far side of the building, stretching close to a mile parallel to the river at left is the site of the Construction Camp. No structures remain, although the old roads made of rounded pebbles in an asphalt base are still there, along with a few scattered trees.",

Jones Construction Company began building housing for temporary workers involved in construction of the K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant and development of the Manhattan Project's Oak Ridge operations. The housing area’s population ranged from 9,000 to almost 15,000 people during the Manhattan Project. The community included a theater, grocery store, bowling alley, 100 homes, 900 trailers, men’s dorms, mess hall, barracks, a school, a recreation center and more. A smaller, more rudimentary workers’ community existed nearby for the segregated African American population. </p> <p paraeid=\"{438d4471-737a-41db-81da-7fc557b027f4}{154}\" paraid=\"472123313\">Happy Valley was a vital part of the Manhattan Project and the nation’s quest to develop an atomic bomb during World War II. The construction camp was demolished by the mid-1950s and the property was allowed to re-vegetate and became a mixed pine and hardwood forest. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{438d4471-737a-41db-81da-7fc557b027f4}{154}\" paraid=\"472123313\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{438d4471-737a-41db-81da-7fc557b027f4}{154}\" paraid=\"472123313\"><br /> The Happy Valley community no longer exists.

Over time, bells like the International Friendship Bell took on a different purpose: to deliver messages of freedom, remembrance, and peace. Cast in Kyoto, Japan in 1993, the International Friendship Bell is a symbol of peace and unity between the United States and Japan.<br /> <br /> In 1987, Shigeko Uppuluri, an Oak Ridge resident born in Japan, and her husband Dr. Ram Uppuluri, an employee of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), traveled to Tokaimura, Japan, for research at the Japan Atomic Energy Institute. While visiting the nearby Buddhist Gannyu-ji Temple, the Uppuluris were awestruck by the temple’s bonshō bell. Dr. Uppuluri was so inspired that he developed a plan to bring a similar bell to Oak Ridge. His initial proposal did not focus on creating a bell for peace. Instead, Dr. Uppuluri originally intended to attract tourists to Oak Ridge with a unique bell, though he did suggest “Project Peace Bell” as a potential name for the Oak Ridge bell. In 1990, Oak Ridge became a sister city of Naka-machi, Ibaraki, Japan. That same year, Oak Ridge started planning for the 50th anniversary of the town’s establishment. In honor of the anniversary, a community contest was announced for a new monument to represent the anniversary’s theme: <em>Born of War, Living for Peace, Growing Through Science.</em> The newly formed International Friendship Bell Committee submitted a new bell proposal written by Ethel McDonald and signed by Shigeko Uppuluri. The proposal was selected and work on the bell soon commenced. <br /> <br /> Oak Ridge artist Suzanna Harris designed the bell’s two outer panels. One panel includes Tennessee symbols and the second panel Japanese symbols. The panels connect through a rainbow that ends in an atomic symbol. The International Friendship Bell features engravings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as well as images of Mt. Fuji and flying cranes. The crane has a special meaning as it is a Japanese symbol of peace. A third panel was inspired by the tragedies of war. The dates of Pearl Harbor, V-J Day (Victory Over Japan Day), and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki mark the third panel. Ethel McDonald’s proposal also included a performing arts pavilion. In 1991, Professor Jon Coddington designed the pavilion, also known as the “bell house,” to house the International Friendship Bell. Professor Coddington combined elements of Asian and Western architecture and based the bell on East Tennessee’s cantilevered barns. The Uppuluris commissioned renowned Japanese bell maker Sotetsu Iwasawa from Kyoto to cast the International Friendship Bell. In 1993, Iwasawa visited Bissell Park and agreed to cast the bell at a discounted rate of $83,000. The International Friendship Committee, led by the former director of ORNL, Dr. Alvin Weinberg, raised most of the $750,000 in donations for the project. On July 14, 1993, the Uppuluris and 12 other contributors to the bell project traveled to Kyoto and took part in the Bell’s ceremonial casting. After its casting, the bronze bell weighed 8,000 pounds (3629 kilograms) and stood seven feet (2.13 meters) tall. Shigeko Uppuluri’s brother negotiated the free transport of the bell from Kyoto to Oak Ridge with the Honda company. Honda shipped the bell to Savannah, Georgia. An ORNL truck picked up the bell from Savannah and delivered it to Oak Ridge City Hall. <br /> <br /> The International Friendship Bell is one of many monuments commemorating World War II. Since its placement, the bell has borne witness to weddings, birthday celebrations, peace vigils, as well as memorials for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US. Manhattan Project leaders established Oak Ridge for the Manhattan Project’s enrichment of uranium which was used to create the “Little Boy” atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6th, 1945. Oak Ridge and Hiroshima are forever connected by the events that occurred during World War II.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{0b612586-d752-4a8b-81e4-636b63f98b7c}{222}\" paraid=\"864451357\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{0b612586-d752-4a8b-81e4-636b63f98b7c}{222}\" paraid=\"864451357\"><br /> Located in the Peace Pavilion at <a href=\"http://exploreoakridge.com/attractions/a-k-bissell-park/\"><b>A.K.

    "audioDescription": "The bell sits in the middle of a paved circular plaza about 80 feet across. Near the center a rectangular concrete pillar stands with a wide rectangular arm extending out over the middle of the circle. The bell hangs underneath with a covering made of horizontal boards mounted edgewise leaving 12-inch gaps. The large bronze bell is about six feet high and hangs with its bottom three feet above the ground. It is cylindrical with a rounded top and no flair at the bottom as most American bells have. Raised lettering on one side reads “Hiroshima, August 6, 1945. Nagasaki, August 9, 1945.” On another side it reads “Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. VJ Day, September 2, 1945.” Vertical lettering between those two panels reads “Peace.” On the other two sides of the bell are relief carvings of birds, flowers, and mountains. Each scene is topped by a rainbow that ends in the symbol for an atom, the central nucleus surrounded by long oval orbits. Lettering between those two panels reads “International Friendship.” Feel free to touch. On the side away from the support pillar is the striker, a long wooden pole that hangs five feet above the ground. At the end away from the bell a rope hangs down allowing you to swing it and ring the bell. Around the edge of the plaza are long curved sections of concrete bench. Between two of the bench sections are six short vertical markers with names of donors. Nearby is a Zen-style garden with raked gravel and several small boulders. Outside the circle are shorter sections of benches, some with backs. A grassy park surrounds the plaza with a couple of small streams running through., one of which is crossed by a shallow arched footbridge.",

This is your time to shop and socialize. Jackson Square buzzes with activity, and familiar faces cross your path. 165 businesses are available to you. After you pick up your boots from one of the six shoe repair shops, you walk to the drugstore and meet friends at the soda fountain. A haircut is also in order. With 13 barbershops and eight beauty salons in the square, you should be able to fit in a trim before catching the last bus home. <br /> <br /> At the onset of the Manhattan Project, architects and administrators knew that if they wanted workers to stay in these newly-built secret communities they would have to include shopping and entertainment districts with the same amenities found in other communities throughout the United States. Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the largest and most populous planned community of the Manhattan Project, provided housing, transportation, shopping, and entertainment for its workers and their families. Jackson Square was the first of several Oak Ridge developments where Manhattan Project workers and their families found respite from their top-secret way of life. <br /> <br /> Town Center No. 1- later called Jackson Square- opened in 1943. It offered 24-hour grocery shopping with 12 grocery stores and 10 farmers’ markets, eight gasoline service stations and garages, seven department stores, six restaurants and lunchrooms, three insurance companies, a pharmacy, a bowling alley, banking services, a movie theater, a dance hall, a flower shop, a portrait studio, and an international correspondence school. Architect Louis Skidmore based the city center’s design on his hometown of Lawrenceburg, Indiana. After the war, when the secret city opened to the general public, Jackson Square became an inspiration for several shopping centers around the nation. The National Park Service added Jackson Square to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 as part of the Oak Ridge Historic District.<br /> <br /> With its central location, Jackson Square provided a place for people to gather. The fire hall, high school, and guest house were all in central Jackson Square. When news of the US victory in World War II reached Oak Ridge, atomic workers and their families flocked to Jackson Square to celebrate. However, as communal as Jackson Square was, not all members of the community were welcome. The US government respected the South’s Jim Crow Laws and segregation at Oak Ridge. African American workers and their families could not attend first-run movies at the theater. They couldn’t enter some businesses. And because Black workers earned lower wages than white people at Oak Ridge, they simply couldn’t afford much of the merchandise and services. In addition, people of color could not work at places that did not have separate restrooms. Churches held segregated services. Housing for Black people consisted of segregated hutments that were further segregated by sex, regardless of marital status and family ties. Black children were not permitted to live on the townsite until 1946.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{552a4a68-3d6f-4562-b63f-5aadcd90e14f}{176}\" paraid=\"564105109\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{552a4a68-3d6f-4562-b63f-5aadcd90e14f}{176}\" paraid=\"564105109\"><br /> Jackson Square remains a vibrant shopping center, providing similar goods and services to visitors that Manhattan Project workers would have found during World War II. Some of the commercial center buildings remain the same while others were remodeled or converted. Jackson Square is within walking distance to several Manhattan Project-related historic sites, including the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/the-guest-house-alexander-inn.htm\"><b>Guest House</b></a> (Alexander Inn), the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/chapel-on-the-hill.htm\"><b>Chapel on the Hill</b></a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/community-tennis-courts.htm\"><b>Community Tennis Courts</b></a>. </p>",
    "audioDescription": "This town square has retail buildings along two sides, each with covered sidewalks in front. The third side has a covered walkway that connects office and administrative buildings on either end. The fourth side is bounded by a street. The center of the square is park-like with a circular plaza in the center with rectangular paving blocks and a circle of metal benches. The corners outside the circle are grassy with small trees. Near one corner is a slanted graphic panel in a metal stand that is titled “Jackson Square, the Secret City’s headquarters for Commerce.” The background of the panel has a bird’s eye view of the square with the flat-roofed retail areas on either side as is the case today. In the photograph the center of the square is all parking. Text along the bottom of the panel reads, “Town Center Number 1, later renamed Jackson Square, in 1945, served as the town’s primary commercial center and social hub for off-duty residents. It provided 24-hour shopping, banking entertainment, and a barbershop for a non-stop population. Jackson Square is part of the Oak Ridge Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. “Designed by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merril, Louis Skidmore based this design on his hometown of Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Although a modest shopping center by today’s standards, following World War II, however, Jackson Square was used as a model and inspiration for new planned communities in other parts of the country, like Reston, Virginia.”",

You soon find out your new workplace is a massive, top-secret facility, a giant U-shaped building longer than two Empire State Buildings laid side by side. The massive K-25 building demonstrates the lengths to which the country went to protect itself from foreign adversaries and the determination to be the first country in the world with atomic weaponry. <br /> <br /> Constructed in 1943 by the New York-based Kellex corporation, the K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant was the largest building in the world at the time. It covered a 44-acre tract (178,062 sq. meters) over one-half mile long (0.8 km) and 1,000 yards wide (914 meters). This top-secret facility with its distinctive U shape employed over 10,000 workers at it’s the height of its operation in 1945. No facility like K-25 had ever been built. Although smaller laboratory experiments indicated that the gaseous diffusion process would efficiently produce enriched uranium, there was no initial assurance that the process would work on such a large scale.<br /> <br /> The K-25 gaseous diffusion plant separated lighter uranium 235 from heavier uranium 238. This uranium separation also occurred at nearby Y-12 and S-50. Unlike the processes used at Y-12 and S-50, K-25 relied on over 3,000 gaseous diffusion steps through which uranium hexafluoride gas passed through. This process allowed for smaller uranium 235 atoms to pass through the tiny pores in the barriers of each step, enriching the gas and creating a higher concentration of uranium 235. This gaseous diffusion method proved cheaper and more efficient than Y-12's electromagnetic separation process and S-50's liquid thermal diffusion process. Uranium 235 is an unstable uranium isotope that will sustain a nuclear chain reaction, making it an ideal fuel for an atomic bomb. The Little Boy atomic bomb used enriched uranium produced at Oak Ridge. The US Army Air Force dropped Little Boy on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6th, 1945, the first time an atomic bomb was used in war. Three days later on August 9th, 1945, the US dropped the plutonium-fueled Fat Man bomb on Nagasaki, Japan, thus far the last atomic weapon used in war. Japan surrendered on August 14, 1945, bringing World War II, the deadliest conflict in human history, to an end. By the end of 1945, over 200,000 people had died as a result of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br /> <br /> K-25 produced enriched uranium for defense and commercial purposes until 1987. Its benchmark gaseous diffusion method was the only uranium-enrichment method used by the United States during the Cold War. In 2013, due to its deteriorated condition, US Department of Energy contractors demolished K-25.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{7c157338-88be-4f01-b134-c82138284b28}{134}\" paraid=\"533182234\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{7c157338-88be-4f01-b134-c82138284b28}{134}\" paraid=\"533182234\"><br /> Even though the K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant is demolished, you can still see remnants of various outbuildings throughout the complex.

K-25 was not only exceptional for its size, but also for the groundbreaking technology inside. Scientists pioneered gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment technology at the K-25 building.<br /> <br /> The Oak Ridge reservation included three industrial processes for uranium enrichment and experimental plutonium production. Buildings 9731, 9204-3, and K-25 together enriched a portion of the material for the uranium bomb, Little Boy, dropped over Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. In 1941 and 1942, gaseous diffusion held a lot of promise as a way to enrich uranium. However, despite the soundness of the theory, the process had yet to produce any samples of enriched uranium. Before construction of K-25 began in late summer 1943, scientists and engineers decided K-25 would produce a material that was about 50 percent uranium 235, which would then be fed into <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/y-12-national-security-complex.htm\"><b>Y-12's</b></a> Beta tracks for final enrichment. This would eliminate the troublesome upper part of the cascade. But even 50 percent enrichment was not assured, since a barrier for the diffusion plant still did not exist. The scientists’ decision to downgrade K-25 was part of a larger decision to double Y-12 capacity, which fit with General Leslie Groves' new strategy of utilizing a combination of methods to produce enough fissionable material for bombs as quickly as possible.  <br /> <br /> There was no doubt in Groves' mind that gaseous diffusion still had to be pursued vigorously. Physicists and engineers had already invested a lot of time and money in the program, and Groves hoped the diffusion method might yet prove successful. As 1944 began, construction of a plutonium production plant at the Hanford site in eastern Washington moved along at breakneck speed. Meanwhile, scientists at Oak Ridge continued to work on the gaseous diffusion method, but without success. A workable barrier design might still put K-25 ahead in the race for the bomb, but no one had been able to fabricate a barrier of sufficient quality; the uranium gas was simply too corrosive, the necessary tolerances too fine. By summer 1944, the ongoing barrier crisis made it apparent that the material produced by K-25 would be of such low enrichment that it would first have to be run through Y-12's Alpha tracks before it would be ready for the Betas. To accomplish even this low level of enrichment, Groves ordered a crash barrier program. Still, the production of enough uranium-235 for just one bomb by 1945 now appeared to be very much in doubt.<br /> <br /> The K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant would go on to play a key role in World War II and the Cold War. Due to the K-25 structure’s deteriorated state, the enormous facility was demolished as part of an effort to clean and transform the site for reuse. The last shipment of debris from the K-25 demolition project left the site in 2014. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{0f0a64ca-f4ab-4ba0-8532-0464ad432b56}{170}\" paraid=\"277049203\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{0f0a64ca-f4ab-4ba0-8532-0464ad432b56}{170}\" paraid=\"277049203\">Located near the footprint of the K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant, the newly-opened <a href=\"https://k25historycenter.org/\">K-25 History Center</a> provides visitors with a deeper understanding of K-25’s role in enriching uranium during the Manhattan Project and the Cold War.

A metal overhang covers the front corner and the double doors that lead into the building. Paralleling the sidewalk on the left as you approach the building is a fence. The bottom two feet is made of concrete which then has a chain link fence along the top. Between the sidewalk and the fence are two square seating areas, with long wooden benches along the sides and the back. Flanking the seating areas and separating the two spaces are planting areas surrounded by a raised curb. Beyond the seating area farthest from the building is an area with a row of metal spacers for bicycle parking. Across the sidewalk from the seating areas a set of steps leads down a short bank to the street.",

    "audioDescription": "This site features three structures, each with an earthen berm covering the roof and three sides with only the front uncovered for access. All three buildings have signs in front designating each as a Manhattan Project National Historical Park Historic building, a historic facility eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, and a sign with the arrowhead-shaped logo of the National Park Service. Building TA-11-1, the control building, has a concrete front wall with a heavy wooden door in the middle. The door has very large hinges down the left side. To the left of the door is a metal electrical box with metal conduit extending out the top. To the right of the door is a piece of metal duct work curved downward to point to the ground. At either side of the wall are retaining walls extending out towards us, slanted from the top of the building down to the ground, with the earthen berm on the other side. All the walls and the door are painted pinkish-tan. The tops of the walls are capped with metal flashing painted blue. The other two structures sit back-to-back, with the space between filled by the earthen berm. Structure TA-11-3 is the Cloud Chamber. Like the control structure, its entrance is set back between slanted retaining walls with a narrower opening between them. In addition to the heavy door on the front-facing wall, there is another door on the left retaining wall. A flat roof extends over the back half of the alcove. Above the back door there is metal ductwork and vertical metal piping. On the right wall are electrical boxes. Along the left retaining wall is a metal staircase leading to a small platform above the entrance. The third structure, TA-11-2 housed the betatron. The structure is a small building with vertical metal siding painted brick red and a flat roof that slants upward over the rear of the structure that extends into the earthen berm behind. The door is gray metal. A fire extinguisher hangs to the left of the door. A chain link fence extends out from the front left corner. End of Description.",

In 1963, Jack Tanner, head of the Pacific Northwest NAACP declared Kennewick \"The Birmingham of Washington\" because no Black people were allowed to live in Kennewick and less than 10 Black people worked there, all in unskilled positions. Many civil rights protests took place on this strip. Kennewick was reputedly so segregated that according to Marion Barton, who grew up in East Pasco, \"they wouldn't even put you in [their] jail if you were Black.\" Instead, at First Avenue and Washington Street the police at one point handcuffed or tied a Black man they arrested to a lamppost \"and called Pasco and said 'Come get him’\" because Pasco was the only community in the Tri-Cities at that time with Black residents and the Kennewick jail was considered unfit for Black prisoners.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; letter-spacing: -0.25px;\">Continue Your Journey </span><br /> <br /> Do you want to see other sites that tell the African American story of East Pasco?

The Hanford Site was no exception. DuPont, the government contractor that built and managed the site during the Manhattan Project, required African American employees who resided offsite to live in East Pasco, the area south of Lewis Street. Separated from the rest of Pasco by railroad tracks, East Pasco lacked many city services, including a city park.  <br /> <br /> Not having a city park east of the railroad tracks, local children created a baseball diamond--clearing tumbleweeds, filling holes in with shovels, wiring in a backstop—in the field where Kurtzman Park is located. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, local children created a baseball diamond in the field that became Kurtzman Park, clearing tumbleweeds, filling holes, and wiring in a backstop. Rebecca Heidlebaugh, a White attorney and civil rights champion, assisted a group of boys who successfully sought the donation of a 6 acre (2 hectare) tract of land to transform into a park. Members of the community, including the parents of the children who had lobbied for the park, leveled the ground, dug trenches, installed recycled pipes to create a water system, and planted trees. The City of Pasco seeded, landscaped, and maintained the open space. A sign for Candy Cane Park went up next to newly installed red-and-white playground equipment, but at the request of the land’s former owner, the City of Pasco renamed it Kurtzman Park.  <br /> The community also constructed Kurtzman Park Youth Center, using materials a local business donated. The center hosted tutoring programs, youth activities, a library, and community meetings. Virgie Robinson, for whom the nearby elementary school is named, served as the first manager of the youth center. Later, the city placed a police mini-station inside two rooms of the concrete-block building. <br />     </p> <p paraeid=\"{6d54dbe3-bc3a-4bde-bedc-65b68f7fd31e}{214}\" paraid=\"387247716\">Kurtzman Park’s dedicated board members have kept the park alive.

Water and wind eroded the exposed canyon walls over time, creating holes in the canyon faces. The Ancestral Pueblo people used hand tools to enlarge and shape these holes into shelters called cavates, and used blocks of volcanic tuff to build structures along the cliff faces.

The federal government has operated the Hanford Sites since 1943, maintaining its isolation and limited commercial development. The size of the Hanford Site and its relative isolation helped fuel a new scientific project almost 50 years later.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{623d9d06-3522-43ef-a63d-20ae3a4e61db}{218}\" paraid=\"1652898836\">In 1992, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) was built near Hanford Site to detect gravitational wave vibrations from outer space. Its instruments, called interferometers, have arms that stretch to about 2.5 miles (4 km) long. The instruments are very sensitive to local vibrations like those from human activity. LIGO selected the Hanford area for one of its two interferometers because Hanford is still relatively isolated from a lot of human activity. The Hanford area also has the required space for the massive scientific project. Scientists use the instruments to help study major stellar events like the collision of black holes. </p> <p paraeid=\"{623d9d06-3522-43ef-a63d-20ae3a4e61db}{224}\" paraid=\"629932519\">LIGO is a modern example of Hanford’s history of high-technology research and scientific discovery that dates to the Manhattan Project and the construction of the B Reactor.

Later, Black railroad workers were restricted to the same general area, as were the thousands of African American migrants who came to Pasco during and after World War II. </p> <p paraeid=\"{290dc532-70c5-4549-bda7-a1281ce7a1f0}{15}\" paraid=\"1050958975\">Designed by the Northern Pacific Railway, the Lewis Street Underpass was constructed along a main east-west arterial through downtown Pasco in 1937. Previously, citizens were forced to walk over the railroad tracks to get between downtown and East Pasco. The underpass allowed cars and pedestrians to travel between the two areas even when long trains rolled on the tracks above. The railroad tracks divided Pasco, with East Pasco as the proverbial “other side” of the tracks. </p> <p paraeid=\"{290dc532-70c5-4549-bda7-a1281ce7a1f0}{25}\" paraid=\"1440345106\">In keeping with widespread practices of the time, the Hanford Site was a rigorously segregated space until the 1960s where laws and customs created separate and very unequal job opportunities and living conditions for African Americans and Whites. Kennewick excluded Blacks from living within city limits and Pasco relegated Blacks and other racial minorities east of 4th Street. In Richland, the government-run secret city, Blacks were not explicitly excluded. However, only those hired for permanent positions were allowed to live in Richland. Initially Blacks were only hired for temporary jobs like construction. There was no organized policy to keep Black workers out of Richland, but federal contractors hiring practices had the same effect. No Blacks lived in Richland until the late 1940s when hiring practices began to change. As such, the only place in the Tri-Cities that Blacks could call home was East Pasco, an overcrowded community that lacked such basic services as sewers, trash collection, paved roads, sidewalks, fire hydrants, or streetlights.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9c6db655-4585-4cdb-b853-353faf6d2f41}{93}\" paraid=\"83705791\">As White residents fled, “East Pasco” became code for “Black.” African Americans developed their own community that included churches, hotels, shops, restaurants, and other businesses, most of which no longer exist. Some places, such as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/morningstar-baptist-church.htm\">Morning Star Baptist Church</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/kurtzman-park.htm\">Kurtzman Park</a>, are still important places to the African American community of the Tri-Cities.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9c6db655-4585-4cdb-b853-353faf6d2f41}{117}\" paraid=\"1201559792\">While the intersection of Lewis Street and Oregon Avenue became the business center of East Pasco, crossing the tracks was an almost daily necessity. Only one school, Whittier Elementary, was located on the east side until 1965. Going through the unmonitored and largely unlit underpass was anxiety-inducing for pedestrians. Despite lack of community services and economic deprivation that residents spoke out against in the 1970s, a strong sense of pride and community filled East Pasco.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9c6db655-4585-4cdb-b853-353faf6d2f41}{135}\" paraid=\"1050652621\">The railroad tracks may have been the divider, but the Lewis Street Underpass was the gateway to the robust African American community in the Tri-Cities during the second half of the 20th Century.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9c6db655-4585-4cdb-b853-353faf6d2f41}{151}\" paraid=\"1491997374\"> </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{9c6db655-4585-4cdb-b853-353faf6d2f41}{151}\" paraid=\"1491997374\">Continue Your Journey </h2> <p paraeid=\"{9c6db655-4585-4cdb-b853-353faf6d2f41}{157}\" paraid=\"1292309567\">Nearby, you can explore more sites that share East Pasco’s African American history. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/green-bridge-historical-marker.htm\">Green Bridge</a>—the dividing line between Kennewick, a community that sought to exclude Blacks, and Pasco, a community that sought to confine Blacks. Stop by <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/kurtzman-park.htm\">Kurtzman Park</a> and learn about the grassroots efforts that created the first community park in East Pasco.

    "audioDescription": "From the parking area beside a small city park, the bridge begins as a 600-foot walk down Lewis Street to where the street plunges beneath several railroad tracks. A concrete barrier pierced by arched openings separates the street from a dead end, dirt street that leads to the pedestrian passage under the tracks. A sidewalk runs along the dirt street on the opposite side from the barrier with Lewis Street. Chain link fencing with barbed wire on top prevents access to the tracks. Two sets of stairs lead down to the pedestrian tunnel with a short landing in between. The concrete barrier continues on the left side and there is a metal railing on the right. Signs above the pedestrian tunnel entrance read “No loitering or littering.” At the bottom, the sidewalk passes through an arched tunnel with a solid concrete wall on one side and a series of tall concrete arches on the side next to the street. The arched openings are covered with chain link mesh. A similar passageway is on the far side of the street. The tunnel under the track is about 200 feet long. Although there are lights in protective metal mesh attached to the ceiling of the tunnel, during the day the only illumination comes from the daylight at each end of the tunnel. Many of the concrete surfaces have graffiti on them or places where graffiti has been painted over.",

Oak Ridge High School, being on a federal reservation, desegregated in the fall of 1955 with few protests. Meanwhile, African American students from nearby Clinton, Tennessee had to ride a bus 30 minutes to a Black Knoxville high school. To change this, U.S. District Judge Robert Taylor ordered Clinton High School to integrate by the fall of 1956. Twelve Black students registered at Clinton High School that fall. Protesters, mostly from outside the area, harassed the students, teachers, and Principal. Soon thereafter the Tennessee State Police and the Tennessee National Guard were called in to protect the students from interference in their education.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{eaa9b7c9-2693-48a5-8a63-1f8c9e00aaf6}{119}\" paraid=\"2054859212\">Election day was December 5, 1956. Several pro-segregationists were running in the local elections. That same day Reverend Paul Turner, pastor of First Baptist Church, along with other community leaders, walked the African American students to Clinton High School in a show of solidarity. On his way back to his church, several men assaulted Reverend Turner. The news of his beating affected the outcome of the local election; the pro-segregationists were defeated.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{eaa9b7c9-2693-48a5-8a63-1f8c9e00aaf6}{123}\" paraid=\"1667730264\">Two years later on October 5, 1958, Clinton High School was rocked by over 100 sticks of dynamite in a racially-motivated bombing. Although no one was injured, students at Clinton High School now needed a safe, undamaged place to attend classes. Linden Elementary School, one of several schools in Oak Ridge whose student body population had decreased after the end of the Manhattan Project, offered to help. Volunteers had Linden Elementary ready for the new students in just three days. On October 9, the Oak Ridge High School marching band welcomed the staff and students to their temporary school by playing the Clinton High School alma mater.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{eaa9b7c9-2693-48a5-8a63-1f8c9e00aaf6}{127}\" paraid=\"2082888650\"> No arrests were ever made in the Clinton High School bombing.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{e05f9138-ebe9-4bee-b48b-f8abe60cca44}{227}\" paraid=\"1585883888\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{e05f9138-ebe9-4bee-b48b-f8abe60cca44}{227}\" paraid=\"1585883888\"><br /> Linden Elementary School remains a school to this day in a different location, with approximately 500 local students.

The Los Alamos Little Theatre Group formed in an effort to stave off boredom, and their legacy has lasted through to today. The group performed wherever they could find space until 1971, when they secured permeant headquarters in a wartime cafeteria.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8f14eb25-7ab2-49c0-abea-59bb8d10204d}{177}\" paraid=\"494798300\">Project Y, at its core, functioned as a military operation. Various cafeterias and mess halls provided civilians and military personnel with inexpensive meals and gathering places. In 1945, the East Cafeteria opened in Los Alamos with seating capacity for 400 people. East Cafeteria offered a wider variety of foods than other mess halls, and provided a more restful environment with welcoming furnishings and décor, helping to boost morale. Military and civilian workers alike chose to dine at East Cafeteria. </p> <p paraeid=\"{8f14eb25-7ab2-49c0-abea-59bb8d10204d}{189}\" paraid=\"858608483\">After the war, the building served as a recreation hall. In 1971, while Los Alamos County was planning to tear down the building, the Little Theatre company stepped in and renovated the old mess hall. Today the building continues to function as a performing arts center supported entirely by volunteers.  Visit the <a href=\"http://lalt.org/\">Los Alamos Little Theatre website</a> for more information about their schedule and history. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{74efc7a5-2d4d-498f-879c-0d10283471a5}{170}\" paraid=\"1761290749\">Continue Your Journey</h2>   <p paraeid=\"{98c99368-5630-49e3-a0fb-da773412216d}{123}\" paraid=\"1056081816\">As you walk around downtown Los Alamos, you can explore the Los Alamos Historical Society campus, which includes the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/los-alamos-history-museum.htm\">Los Alamos History Museum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hans-bethe-house.htm\">Hans Bethe House,</a> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/fuller-lodge.htm\">Fuller Lodge,</a> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/romero-cabin.htm\">Romero Cabin,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/ancestral-pueblo-site.htm\">Ancestral Pueblo Site.</a> </p> <p paraeid=\"{98c99368-5630-49e3-a0fb-da773412216d}{174}\" paraid=\"1740914188\">Just across Central Ave from Fuller Lodge you'll find <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/ashley-pond.htm\">Ashley Pond</a>, another centerpiece of the Los Alamos community.

As Valles Caldera formed, ash and lava flows up to 1,000 feet thick covered much of the surrounding area. The ash eventually cooled and formed a soft rock deposit called tuff, is characterized by pink, tan, and orange rock layers, which can be seen in exposed cliff faces. Los Alamos is located on the broad, sloping layer of tuff called the Pajarito (pa-ha-REE-toe) Plateau which extends from the Jemez (HEH-mez). Mountains in the west to the Rio Grande Valley in the east. Runoff from the mountains dissected the Pajarito Plateau into a series of long, thin mesas separated by canyons. Overtime, win and water gradually eroded away softer areas of tuff, creating holes in the exposed canyon faces. With hand tools, Ancestral Pueblo people enlarged and shaped cliff openings into useful shelters called cavates (CAVE-eights). They used tuff blocks to build an apartment-like homes along the cliff faces in front of the cavates.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{40af3121-d3de-4c37-a227-d64f07397f1a}{204}\" paraid=\"526276083\"><strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A black band at the top of the wayside says, “Manhattan Project National Historical Park Los Alamos, New Mexico” On the right of the black band is the National Park Service log o and the U.S. Department of Energy logo.

In 1963, the Los Alamos National Laboratory embarked on a full-scale cleanup of the Bayo Canyon site. Contaminated buildings and materials were disassembled and buried on the site. Today, the former firing site at the bottom of the canyon retains little evidence of its wartime use. Buried within a 1.5-acre plot associated with former purification laboratory have been identified as being radioactivity contaminated and are monitored by the U.S. Department of Energy.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{da9ec174-0450-4f7f-8a68-629858bbe7c7}{188}\" paraid=\"526276083\"> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A black band at the top of the wayside says, “Manhattan Project National Historical Park Los Alamos, New Mexico” On the right of the black band is the National Park Service log o and the U.S. Department of Energy logo.

By the late 1930s about 36 families had established homesteads on the plateau, which they used for seasonal farming, ranching, and gathering of resources, such as timber, game animals, and wild edible plants. These summer farms helped sustain farms helped sustain families whose permanent homes were in nearby villages and land grant settlements, such as San Ildefonso, Pojoaque, Jacona, and Española. The Hispano connection to the land of the Pajarito Plateau is rooted in centuries of traditional use. Many families saw homesteading as a means to reclaim lands from Spanish and Mexican land grants that were lost after the annexation of the New Mexico Territory from Mexico in 1848. Homesteading on the Pajarito Plateau came to an end in 1942 when the land was appropriated by the U.S. government for the Manhattan Project. Many of the homesteaders returned to work at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Their descendants, as well as other family members from the surrounding Hispanic communities, continue to work at Las Alamos National Laboratory and play a crucial role in fulfilling the laboratory’s mission.  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{9568b8dc-f322-4215-8ee4-0602a61817ba}{208}\" paraid=\"526276083\"><strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A black band at the top of the wayside says, “Manhattan Project National Historical Park Los Alamos, New Mexico” On the right of the black band is the National Park Service log o and the U.S. Department of Energy logo.

Manhattan Project scientist developed a bomb design that could create an inward explosion, or implosion, that scientists believed would detonate the plutonium pit of a nuclear weapon. The code name for this design was “Fat Man.” The Bayo Canyon site was a remote experimental facility where Manhattan Project staff conducted hundreds of high-explosives firing experiments to test their bomb-designs. The test were known as the RaLa program, which was named for the isotope radiolanthanum, a potent but short-lived source of gamma radiation. “Now we have our bob,” said Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos laboratory during the Manhattan Project, upon viewing the RaLa test results. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3ed7bfb2-7d54-4b7f-a264-9866d412e71c}{208}\" paraid=\"526276083\"> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description </strong><br /> A black band at the top of the wayside says, “Manhattan Project National Historical Park Los Alamos, New Mexico” On the right of the black band is the National Park Service log o and the U.S. Department of Energy logo.

The Ancestral Pueblo people lived here from approximately A.D. 1150 to 1550. Using the local volcanic tuff, they built canyon-side dwellings and mesa-top villages. Pueblo people also planted corn, beans, and squash and supplemented their diet with native plants and meat from deer, rabbit, and squirrel. By 1550, the Ancestral Pueblo people had moved from this area to pueblos along the Rio Grande, such as San Ildefonso Pueblo, whose lands adjoin Bayo Canyon. According to oral tradition, the land on the plateau could no longer support the people and a severe drought added to what were already becoming difficult times. With the appropriation of land on the plateau by the Manhattan Project in 1942, local Pueblo groups, although not displaced through the official taking of land, were no longer allowed access to the plateau, effectively restricting their ability to practices centuries-old traditions. Further, tribal communities’ cultural and spiritual practices are tied to the natural world by performing ceremonies and rites that are linked to specific places. Local Pueblo communities contributed to the success of the Manhattan Project, and tribal members continue to be an integral part of the Los Alamos National Laboratory today.   <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{c82b68b5-212d-48b9-a3dc-0ba28e330a00}{216}\" paraid=\"526276083\"><strong>Exhibit Panel Description </strong><br /> A black band at the top of the wayside says, “Manhattan Project National Historical Park Los Alamos, New Mexico” On the right of the black band is the National Park Service logo and the U.S. Department of Energy logo.

In 0.8 miles (1.28 km), past Ashley Pond, and the Aquatic Center, turn right onto Diamond Drive. Pass the Los Alamos High School and the Los Alamos Golf Course to the San Ildefonso roundabout located 2.4 miles (3.86 km) from the intersection of Central and Diamond. Bear right on San Ildefonso. Head south, then east on this road, passing the Los Alamos Middle School. About 0.1-mile (0.16 km) past North Mesa Road on the left, turn left onto an unnamed road heading toward the stable area. The road swings to the right and ends at a parking area at the North Mesa Tennis Courts. The trailhead is on the left of the playlot. <br />  </p>",

Before reaching the security gate, however, newcomers to Project Y had to go through Dorothy McKibbin. Known as the gatekeeper of Los Alamos, Dr. J.

African American workers who migrated primarily from the South to work on the Hanford Site expected to escape segregation and discriminatory treatment when they moved to Washington State but found that Jim Crow had followed them north. <br />  <br /> Morning Star Baptist Church was the literal and figurative center of East Pasco’s African American community. Reverend Johnnie Steward founded the church in 1946 to support the growing Black population’s spiritual and social needs. Its long history of service extended to congregants and community members forced to settle in East Pasco due to housing segregation and discrimination in Richland, Kennewick, and Pasco with the exception of East Pasco. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3aaf5ba5-d308-4edb-8316-720d3b2c82c5}{172}\" paraid=\"433159422\">Reverend Sam Coleman, one of the handful of Black residents in Pasco before World War II, had preached to black workers since 1944 on property he owned on Shoshone Street, just west of the railroad tracks. Coleman’s efforts to construct a formal church were forcibly blocked. In the 1950s and 60s, Morning Star Baptist Church served as a gathering place for the local civil rights movement. Other local African American churches including New Hope and Greater Faith Baptist Churches, and to a certain extent St. James Methodist Church, sprung from Morning Star.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{3aaf5ba5-d308-4edb-8316-720d3b2c82c5}{172}\" paraid=\"433159422\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{3aaf5ba5-d308-4edb-8316-720d3b2c82c5}{172}\" paraid=\"433159422\">Nearby, you can explore more sites that share East Pasco’s African American history.

At the corner of the building nearest the street corner there is a square, flat-topped tower. There is an entrance on either side of the tower with a peaked arch framing a window over the doors. Above each door is a large, dark red, painted cross. To the left of the entrance on the right side is a granite block that reads, “Morning Star Baptist Church, Founded 1946, Dedicated 1953.” Down the right side of the building are three, high pointed arched windows. Down the left side are two peaked windows and a larger set of double doors, also with a peaked arch over it. That entrance is reached by a long ramp along the wall which extends from the far end of the building. All of the windows and door trim is painted dark red to match the crosses. There are parking spaces along each street and parking lots along the other two sides of the building. Large, well-trimmed shrubs sit along the side street and near the entrance doors. Near the street corner is a brick structure with a sign that gives the times of Sunday services.",

In 1909, Charles A. Zornes moved from St. Louis to Walla Walla, where he designed and built experimental airplanes. In 1911, he leased 40 acres (16.1 hectares) of flat land facing the Columbia River in Pasco. There he built aircraft and established the Zornes Aviation School, the first flying school on the West Coast. During World War II, it became the site of the Pasco Holding and Reconsignment Center (<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/big-pasco.htm\">Big Pasco</a>), a major depot used to store and ship military equipment to the Soviet Union, as well as to Northwest military installations and the Manhattan Project. </p> <p paraeid=\"{28398502-5d79-4b91-9bca-02cf3ccf7713}{71}\" paraid=\"1353953455\">In February 1942, the US Navy purchased 2,285 acres (925 hectares) of land next to the small airport for $5,000. The navy relocated Seattle's Sand Point Naval Air Station to Pasco to make it less vulnerable to Japanese attack. Soon, a vast network of runways, hangars, and barracks were bulldozed out of the bunch grass and sagebrush to become one of the busiest naval training bases in the country. Originally used for pilot training and for repairing damage aircraft returning from the Pacific, the Pasco Naval Air Station would later transition experienced pilots into newer aircraft types. It also holds the distinction of being the first place where the WAVES—Women Accepted in Volunteer Emergency Service―were allowed to live on base. They served primarily as “ferry pilots,” flying aircraft to Alaska and Russia as part of our military assistance to that nation during the war. </p> <p paraeid=\"{28398502-5d79-4b91-9bca-02cf3ccf7713}{89}\" paraid=\"756320543\">On June 9, 2011, the Port of Pasco Commissioners agreed to preserve the old Navy-built control tower.

Puiblic access is not currently available through the US Department of Energy.</em><br /> <br /> “There wasn’t very much except go to church, go to school and work. That is about all you did” in the Bethel Valley, according to former resident S.E. Coley. As a child in Bethel Valley, Dot Bussell “went to a one-room school and I can recall going down, and everybody drank out of the same dipper, going down and getting the water from the spring and bringing it back.” Though it has long ceased operating, this church hosts periodic reunions for residents displaced by the Manhattan Project, who keep the memory of their former homes alive at this cherished space. <br /> <br /> Located inside the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the New Bethel Baptist Church survives as one of the few remaining structures from the pre-Manhattan Project Scarboro community. The congregation was founded in 1851 but this structure was built in 1924. Many of the graves on site reflect the age of the community; some date back to the 1850s, and mark the burial places of people who fought in the War of 1812. The church had very strict rules governing proper behavior, and members of the congregation could find themselves “dechurched” for disobeying these rules. During services, men and women sat on different sides of the church.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{664f895e-b6bf-4c70-812d-79d5cbcdafb3}{186}\" paraid=\"871960234\">When the Oak Ridge site was purchased for the Manhattan Project in 1942, residents were told this church would be torn down. To commemorate the church’s impending destruction, churchgoers compiled all the money in the church treasury to build and dedicate a monument that is now located behind the church. Rather than tearing the church down however, Manhattan Project administrators designated the church as a meeting room for scientists. The building played a significant role in post-WWII research in nuclear physics. It was used to measure neutron absorption cross sections for as many elements as possible and to measure absolute cross sections for providing calibration points for the many relative measurements that were being made at the time.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{664f895e-b6bf-4c70-812d-79d5cbcdafb3}{216}\" paraid=\"1231654377\">In 1991 the church was opened to remaining members and their descendants for the first time since World War II. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{664f895e-b6bf-4c70-812d-79d5cbcdafb3}{216}\" paraid=\"1231654377\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{664f895e-b6bf-4c70-812d-79d5cbcdafb3}{255}\" paraid=\"615434847\">The church is still used today for special events. New Bethel Baptist Church is on Oak Ridge National Laboratory property.

    "audioDescription": "This small white church with siding of narrow boards faces the road. In the center of the front is a set of double doors made of wood. In front of the doors is a set of worn and cracked concrete steps, four steps up to the doorway. A railing of a plain iron pole sits down the center of the steps. Under the railing on the top step are raised numbers that read “1924.” A simple painted sign over the door reads, “New Bethel Church. Established 1851. Opened 1924. Closed 1942. Reopened 1991.” At the center of the peak of the roof over the door is an air vent and on top of the metal roof near the front is a short square bell tower. A single window sits on either side of the door. Down the side of the church are three more plain windows. On the right side, nearest the small parking lot, is a flagpole. At the entrance to the parking lot from the road is a green sign that reads, “New Bethel Church Interpretive Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.” Extending out behind the church is a cemetery surrounded on the other three sides by woods. Between the back of the church and the cemetery is a tall stone monument, a rectangle with a peak on top that reads “Erected in Memory of New Bethel Baptist Church.”",

Enter Oak Ridge’s alphabet housing. </p> <p paraeid=\"{4a6e9b43-5168-4672-875b-4e2a4374c3bd}{101}\" paraid=\"145945789\">Alphabet housing in Oak Ridge ran the gamut of style, space, and structure. From Type A through H Cemesto homes- Cemesto being a mix of cement and asbestos- to Types A, B, C, S, and V Flat-Top designs, Oak Ridge’s architectural style was unique in its simplicity, form, function, and space.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{4a6e9b43-5168-4672-875b-4e2a4374c3bd}{123}\" paraid=\"752659643\">One of the principal designers of housing in Oak Ridge, architectural firm Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill (the firm also designed <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/jackson-square.htm\">Jackson Square</a>), designed the houses based on the sequence of letters in the alphabet. For example, Type A homes generally had less square footage and features than Type D homes and so on. The earlier the letter in the alphabet, the greater likelihood there would be less people residing in it; the higher the letter, the greater likelihood it would be a family home. However, African American workers in Oak Ridge during the Manhattan Project were not given access to alphabet housing at all. Instead they were assigned <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/african-american-hutments.htm\">hutments</a>, mostly tiny one-room shacks with only the barest of features. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{4a6e9b43-5168-4672-875b-4e2a4374c3bd}{123}\" paraid=\"752659643\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{4a6e9b43-5168-4672-875b-4e2a4374c3bd}{143}\" paraid=\"73575590\">Today, many of Oak Ridge’s alphabet homes still stand as private residences. As you drive throughout the city, see if you can spot the different styles. In addition, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/childrens-museum-of-oak-ridge.htm\">Children’s Museum of Oak Ridge</a> maintains an original Type A Flat-Top house on its grounds. You are welcome to accompany a National Park Service ranger to view the exterior.

Central Bus Terminal, constructed on the Oak Ridge Turnpike in February 1944, was the first to be opened within the residential area, followed by Jefferson Terminal in May 1944. Bus services were also available to areas off the reservation, providing transportation to work, as well as places of recreation to both employees and residents. In the span of just one year, annual ridership grew from 200,000 in 1944, to over a million by 1945. In that same time, the number of residential routes also grew from five, to 21. Buses on residential routes ran every 2-30 minutes, which ensured buses were near compacity. Bus systems were added for local schools as well. In March of 1944, school bus services provided transportation to 500 children daily, which increased to approximately 7,700 children by December of 1946. </p> <p paraeid=\"{ba0b82e8-f691-49ea-aeca-43ab67691dfb}{172}\" paraid=\"526276083\">Photo text: Central Bus Terminal on Oak Ridge Turnpike, 1949<br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong> <br /> A black and white exhibit panel on a black frame approximately four feet tall.

Leaders of these groups appealed to administrators to provide dedicated places of worship. Completed in October 1943, a standard military 700-Series chapel was made available for weddings, worship services, and other functions. At peak wartime activity, more than 20 separate congregations, including Jewish, Baptist, Catholic, and Methodist denominations shared the chapel for round-the-clock services. The name “Chapel on the Hill” comes from a prayer of dedication made by the Baptist minister on September 30, 1943. Still in use today, the church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 as part of the Oak Ridge Historic District as a contributing property. </p> <p paraeid=\"{a5fce817-bd24-4451-a171-572af94b079c}{178}\" paraid=\"526276083\">Photo text: Chapel on the Hill, one of three US Army chapels built in Oak Ridge during WWII.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong> <br /> A black and white exhibit panel on a black frame approximately four feet tall.

Elza, like several other entry gates guarding access to Oak Ridge, was named after local communities that existed there before the Manhattan Project establishment in 1942. Other gate names included Edgemoor, Solway, and Oliver Springs. On March 19, 1949, the city opened its gates to the public with a large parade and ceremonial ribbon cutting at Elza Gate. The ribbon was “cut” with an electrical charge sent from the X-10 Graphite Reactor. Today, the location of Elza Gate is a busy intersection with some visible remnants of a time when the Secret City was once a restricted area. </p> <p paraeid=\"{27317806-37aa-4226-9a18-19a5b59c4c75}{208}\" paraid=\"526276083\">Photo text: Elza Gate Military Police conducting a routine search. 1945. <br />  <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description </strong><br /> A black and white exhibit panel on a black frame approximately four feet tall.

Along with their Victory Gardens, many also planted flower beds. These not only caught the attention of people, but also vital pollinator species, such as bees, butterflies, hummingbirds, bats, and beetles.

Grove Center stores included Tulip Town Super Market, Wender’s Men’s Shop, and Burton’s Shoe Renewery. Of special note was the 1,000-seat Grove Theater, which opened on September 28, 1944. Residents could enjoy a movie for 35 cents (11 cents for kids), or enjoy a concert. The carefully designed theater produced superb acoustics. In its early years, a variety of renowned and talented musicians played here, including world-famous violinist Isaac Stern, the Oak Ridge Boys gospel group, and more. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c9c1bfe-79b1-4423-8b92-c2068c1fc664}{207}\" paraid=\"2052063542\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c9c1bfe-79b1-4423-8b92-c2068c1fc664}{211}\" paraid=\"1224378656\">Photo text: Aerial view of Grove Center area with the swimming pool above, theater at center and Alliance Church below.  <br />  <br />  <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description </strong><br /> A black and white exhibit panel on a black frame approximately four feet tall.

    "bodyText": "<h2>A Growing Community</h2> <p>In May 1943, Manhattan Project administrators awarded J.A. Jones Construction Company, a contract to construct the K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant. To construct the 44-acre building and support structures, a large on-site construction force was needed to lessen travel time for the thousands of workers. By June 1943, construction began on a housing camp in Happy Valley, 10 miles southwest of Oak Ridge. This “mini-community” started as 450 hutments and several cafeterias, but as construction progressed so did the workforce housing demands.<br /> <br /> An assortment of 900 trailers, multiple dormitories, army barracks, and Victory Houses developed along the turnpike. With a larger workforce, support infrastructure soon followed including a school, shopping center, recreation center, theater, and bowling alley. Eventually Happy Valley housed nearly 15,000 people by 1945. Whereas white workers had multiple housing options and community amenities, there was a segregated construction camp of hutments for African American workers which operated under ever-present Jim Crow laws.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<h2>Housing Was A Reflection of One’s Social Standing</h2> <p>Housing assignments for employees and residents of the Manhattan Project were dictated by one’s job and race. There was a dizzying array of potential housing with the best set aside for upper-echelon civilian/military personnel, and hutments being the lowest form of permanent housing, set aside for primarily cooks, cleaners, and construction workers. White hutments did exist, but since black residents were only allowed to work as a janitor or laborer, hutments were truly an African American experience during the Manhattan project. No white women lived in hutments. Originally, army-style barracks were planned, but ultimately scrapped due to scarcity of necessary resources to build them. Hutments were single-sexed, 16’x16’ plywood structures with 4-6 beds, a single heating stove, and little else.<br /> With no plumbing in the hutments, central bathhouses existed, providing the only runningwater, showers, and four toilets to accommodate 48-72 residents. There was no glass in thewindows, only drafty wood shutters. Because of the perceived need by officials for moreintense policing of the African American population, hutments were fenced off and frequently patrolled at all hours by guards, who were free to enter units at will, searching for violations of rules. The black women’s hutment area had a strict 10:00 PM curfew. No men were allowed. After the war, men living in white hutments were moved into better accommodations. African Americans were not given the same opportunities for financial and professional growth and continued to live in hutments until 1950.</p>",

The concept of the bell came about when Oak Ridge residents Dr. Ram Uppuluri and his wife, Shigeko visited Japan in 1987. After seeing the value of a bonshō bell hanging in Buddhist Gannyu-ji Temple, they launched “Project Peace Bell.”Designed in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 1991 by Suzanna Harris and cast in Kyoto, Japan, in 1993 by renowned Japanese bell-maker Sotetsu Iwazawa, the relief panels display peaceful images inspired by Tennessee, Japan, as well as tragedies of war between the two nations. Recognizing the potential significance of the bell, $750,000 in donations was ultimately raised to design, fabricate, deliver, and install the bell, by citizens and foundations in communities in both Japan, and in Oak Ridge. The bell was not without controversy when it was dedicated in 1996. There were concerns over potential noise from the bell, as well as some interpreting it as an apology for destroying Hiroshima. Visitors are encouraged to ring the bell in times of celebration and remembrance. </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{87f729be-bdf3-4a2d-944b-5f2598970355}{26}\" paraid=\"2119931676\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{87f729be-bdf3-4a2d-944b-5f2598970355}{48}\" paraid=\"2059748618\">Photo text (quote): “The bell was built to honor the workers of the Manhattan Project, to commemorate the 50th birthday of Oak Ridge, and to become a symbol and everlasting monument for the peace.

The growing needs of the Manhattan Project required the architectural firm developing the city, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, to quickly plan and construct new neighborhoods. The dispersed population within Oak Ridge and space constraints at the original shopping center, Town Center No.1 (later Jackson Square) necessitated multiple shopping centers serving the local community rather than a traditional downtown that residents may have been accustomed to back home.The West Town Shopping Center (later Jefferson) became a community hub, providing not only day-to-day necessities from private businesses but also community events at the Jefferson Recreation Hall, entertainment at the Jefferson Theatre, and transportation from a bustling bus terminal. With assigned housing by race, gender, marital status, and job title, new residents had no choice in where they would be assigned to live. Jefferson served this neighborhood of both family housing to the north and the dormitories to the south.</p>",

Board of Education (1954) that the “separate but equal” doctrine was unconstitutional, and Oak Ridge High School, being on federal land, desegregated in the fall of 1955 with few protests. African American students from Clinton, however, had to ride a bus one hour to Austin High School, in Knoxville. US District Judge Robert Taylor ordered Clinton High School to integrate by the fall of 1956. Twelve students registered at Clinton High School that fall. Protesters, mostly from outside of the area, harassed the students, teachers, and principal. Eventually, the Tennessee State Police, then the Tennessee National Guard were called in to protect the students.<br /> <br /> There was relative peace in town for a while, until October 5, 1958, when Clinton High School was destroyed by dynamite during early morning in an act of terrorism. With several schools in Oak Ridge vacant due to the loss of population when the Manhattan Project came to an end after World War II, the city offered Linden Elementary as a place to hold classes for the Clinton students. Volunteers had the school ready in just three days. On October 9, the Oak Ridge High School marching band welcomed the staff and students to their temporary school by playing the Clinton Alma Mater. No arrests were ever made in the bombing.</p>",

Solutions were found: the use of alternative building materials such as gypsum board instead of wood for walls of the Alphabet Houses and providing less permanent accommodations for lower wage employees. Plant workers, guards, firefighters, clerical personnel, construction workers and others earning less than $60 per week were assigned to the most temporary of housing, trailers and hutments. African American workers were further segregated within the hutments, separate from the hutment area for single white men.<br /> <br /> Nearly 4,000 trailers formed dense communities here in present-day A.K. Bissell Park, along Oak Ridge Turnpike and Illinois Avenue, in Gamble Valley, and near K-25. Like other housing areas, the trailer camps had stores, theaters, cafeterias, recreation and community buildings, and schools. Residents used shared bathhouses for showers, water collection (residents filled a tank in their trailer daily, and the trailers had no bathrooms) and other needs. Most trailers were government owned and transferred to the project from other government agencies such as Tennessee Valley Authority. Many of the trailers had been relocated by 1947.</p>",

In early August 1944, an African American baseball league was formed of six teams named after Clinton Engineer Works contracting companies: Roane-Anderson; Stone and Webster; J.A. Jones; Ford, Bacon and Davis; Keith Williams; and Carbide and Carbon. Games were held at sites throughout Oak Ridge including a segregated baseball diamond near the African American hutment area and an integrated diamond near much of the segregated housing at K-25.<br /> <br /> This African American league could have been the genesis of the Oak Ridge Bombers, a semi-pro team created and managed by Robert Lee and James Capshaw in the late 1940s. Lee and Capshaw organized the African American men excluded from playing on white teams. These players, primarily workers from the postwar Oak Ridge plants, would work fulltime jobs and play traveling baseball on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays throughout the Southeast. The Oak Ridge Bombers continued to play into the mid-1960s, well after Jackie Robinson integrated professional baseball in 1947.",

At one point, homes within the Secret City were being completed every 30 minutes. Oak Ridge needed a school system to meet the educational needs of its community. General Leslie Groves, military commander of the Manhattan Project, insisted that the schools be of the highest quality, if he wanted to keep scientists in rural Tennessee. The school system hired the most highly qualified teachers from all over the country and from neighboring communities. How? By paying them more. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6829a920-abb7-4a33-8de8-dabe1b5123a3}{197}\" paraid=\"1774715046\">Schools were constructed within walking distance of most homes, and by 1946, three years after Oak Ridge was established, had roughly 7,000 students enrolled in 10 elementary schools, one high school, and one junior high. The building you see before you today was Highland View Elementary, one of the few remaining original Oak Ridge school buildings.  <br /> <br /> Photo text: Highland View Elementary School. 1944  </p> <p paraeid=\"{6829a920-abb7-4a33-8de8-dabe1b5123a3}{213}\" paraid=\"393553105\"> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description </strong><br /> A black and white exhibit panel on a black frame approximately four feet tall.

General Kenneth Nichols, District Engineer of the Manhattan Engineer District, is quoted stating that Oak Ridge, itself, consumed one-seventh of the electricity produced in the United States, from 1943 to 1945. Such enormous demands for electricity required a reliable source of clean flowing water, and the Clinch River, along with hydroelectric power generated at nearby Tennessee Valley Authority’s Norris Dam provided that. The waterway was important for another reason – it provided a natural security barrier, surrounding Oak Ridge on three sides. Today, the Clinch River System continues to provide an important source of electricity as well as a popular destination for outdoor recreation.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a9379c9b-0ebb-4c5c-81e7-826a1e9068bc}{175}\" paraid=\"129689903\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{642e6088-fd0a-4376-9653-efba36b1881c}{27}\" paraid=\"1112134330\">Photo text: Thermal Diffusion Process Building (S-50 Plant).

After the war, couples were reunited and allowed to move into housing euphemistically named “Victory Cottages” which consisted of two units. These had slight improvements over the hutments in terms of security and privacy but provided limited space and low-quality amenities. In 1950, Scarboro Village opened without restrictions based on race, which allowed more permanent housing for the African American population. Town leaders organized the creation of churches and other social organizations, which instilled a sense of community and stability. The former Gamble Valley Elementary School was used in the new community and renamed Scarboro School. That same year Scarboro High School was established with a teaching staff of 2.5 paid positions and volunteer teachers offering courses in math, biology, and physics. The year following the landmark Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education (1954), 40 African American children enrolled at Oak Ridge High School and 45 attended Robertsville Junior High, making Oak Ridge the first Southeastern school system to integrate.",

Since its establishment in 1942, the high-security town of Oak Ridge jumped to a population of 75,000 by 1945. Due to security concerns, very few employees lived outside the town’s boundaries, resulting in chronic housing shortages. In an effort to accommodate the growing population, construction of dormitories was nonstop. Ultimately, 90 dorms were constructed; some were set aside for males, some for females, and some for married couples (members of the opposite sex were routinely found in the wrong dorm). As the city’s population continued to grow, a 2-person room quickly became 3-person and 4-person rooms with people coming and going at all hours due to shift work at the plants. Following the war, many of the dormitories were converted for other uses such as apartments, warehouses, and office buildings. Today, two small portions of dormitories remain standing: Cambridge Hall on Tyrone Road and Lakewood Hall on N. Lincoln Circle. </p> <p paraeid=\"{eb95a942-4878-4598-b2df-4afcc8e4407a}{213}\" paraid=\"2069118472\">Photo text: The dorms along Central Avenue near Jackson Square. 1944  </p> <p paraeid=\"{eb95a942-4878-4598-b2df-4afcc8e4407a}{227}\" paraid=\"526276083\"> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong><br /> A black and white exhibit panel on a black frame approximately four feet tall.

Unlike other structures that were hastily built for temporary use, the Guest House was carefully built with visitor comfort in mind. It hosted several Nobel Laureates, such as Niels Bohr, Arthur Compton, Ernest Lawrence, and Enrico Fermi, who registered under assumed names for secrecy reasons. The rate for all guests, no matter their status, was $2 per night for a room with a connecting bath, or $1.50 per night for a room with a communal bathroom. The Guest House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 as part of the Oak Ridge Historic District as a contributing property. </p> <p paraeid=\"{89e69c78-7ac1-4027-811d-1da08c5128fd}{190}\" paraid=\"2113684831\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{89e69c78-7ac1-4027-811d-1da08c5128fd}{194}\" paraid=\"1244915333\">Photo text: The Guest House, as it appeared in 1945  </p> <p paraeid=\"{89e69c78-7ac1-4027-811d-1da08c5128fd}{204}\" paraid=\"1665038592\"> <br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description </strong><br /> A black and white exhibit panel on a black frame approximately four feet tall.

The community of Robertsville grew on that land. Complete with a school, churches, gristmill, blacksmith shop, and a handful of stores, Robertsville grew to a modest-size community. However, with the US involvement in WWII, the upward trajectory of the community ceased with the establishment of the town of Oak Ridge for the Manhattan Project. Constructed in 1915, Robertsville School taught students of all grades from the surrounding area until the 1942 Christmas holiday, when the land was acquired by Clinton Engineer Works and renamed as Jefferson Junior High School. In 1954, the school’s namesake returned to this location, where it is known as Robertsville Middle School today. After several renovations over the years, the only remaining section of the original Robertsville School is the auditorium, which served as the gymnasium in pre-Manhattan Project times.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e820a5eb-06cb-4a4d-a6cf-cce091292a39}{203}\" paraid=\"578865958\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{e820a5eb-06cb-4a4d-a6cf-cce091292a39}{207}\" paraid=\"1904877492\">Photo text: Students socializing before a day of classes at Robertsville School. 1942 </p> <p paraeid=\"{e820a5eb-06cb-4a4d-a6cf-cce091292a39}{215}\" paraid=\"1613563800\"><br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description </strong><br /> A black and white exhibit panel on a black frame approximately four feet tall.

During World War II, a town sprung up seemingly overnight, complete with shopping centers, movie theaters, bowling alleys, sporting facilities, and recreation halls. Residents of the Clinton Engineer Works could escape the summer heat and enjoy their leisure time cooling off across the street from Grove Center. There is some uncertainty as to when the pool was constructed, although photographic records indicate that the concrete pool was poured in June 1945. This 58,630-square-foot swimming pool holds 2.2 million gallons of water and is reputed as being one of the largest spring-fed swimming pools in the United States. In 1992, the pool underwent renovations and the wooden raft island was replaced with a permanent structure, and roughly 400 gallons of paint was used to recoat the pool.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{edb34667-2417-4c26-a087-7b0a5d921bb1}{193}\" paraid=\"1840286210\"><br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description </strong><br /> A black and white exhibit panel on a black frame approximately four feet tall.

Tennis courts, baseball diamonds and a pool were built. Tennis courts, however, were used for more than just tennis. Being one of the few places in town that was paved, tennis courts were ideal for dancing on warm summer nights when recreation halls were too hot. The Tennessee Eastman Girls Club requested that William “Bill” Pollock, a Tennessee Eastman engineer, hold a dance at the tennis courts. Bill had previously wired the cafeteria, recreation halls and other buildings throughout town for music in his free time. The first tennis court dance was July 22, 1944, at 8:30 pm. They became a weekly event.Bill would organize mixer dances, where men would hold hands, forming a circle, and women would hold hands forming a circle inside the men. The circles would go in opposite directions and when the music stopped, whoever you were paired up with was who you danced with next. The song “Sleepy Time Gal” marked the end of the dance for the night. When news of the Japanese surrender was released on August 15, 1945, people gathered on the tennis courts and danced in celebration. </p> <p paraeid=\"{7a14911c-4239-491f-bdad-a1ddf9d27057}{215}\" paraid=\"1385344917\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{7a14911c-4239-491f-bdad-a1ddf9d27057}{219}\" paraid=\"134961190\">Photo text & Quote: Image -- Oak Ridge residents folk dancing on a tennis court. 1948 </p> <p paraeid=\"{7a14911c-4239-491f-bdad-a1ddf9d27057}{227}\" paraid=\"1955984559\">“Then we danced and had a good time.

    "bodyText": "<h2>Keeping the Lines Ready</h2> In late summer 1943, Manhattan Project administrators awarded a construction contract to Ford, Bacon, and Davis, Inc. to build support facilities for the K-25 plant. A new housing camp, Wheat Colony, was quickly built to provide housing, stores, and recreation to the 2,000 residents. Though Ford, Bacon, and Davis was originally just a construction contractor, operation of these buildings was also assigned to the firm until early 1945 when Carbide and Carbon took over full operation of the K-25 Complex.<br /> <br /> The gas processed at K-25, uranium hexafluoride (UF6), is highly corrosive and reactive creating challenges to the enrichment process. Since UF6 reacts to moisture in the air, large pipes were plated with nickel, a nonreactive metal, and smaller ones constructed of copper. Workers cleaned and conditioned every pipe, valve, pump, and converter using solvent degreasing, alkaline cleaning, acid pickling, scratch brushing, and surface passivation; this would assist in preventing accidental contamination. When finished, the parts were sealed until they could be installed within K-25.<br /> <br /> The Wheat Colony construction camp, and the other housing in Happy Valley, was removed by 1947. K-1401 would continue to operate throughout the Cold War and demolished in 2008.<br />  ",

It was operated by the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and controlled access to the K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant from 1949-1953. As the city of Oak Ridge opened to the public on March 19, 1949, access to the K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant remained restricted. Built with concrete and bullet-proof windows, these silent sentinels serve as a reminder to the heightened security conditions that existed during early Cold War years. Two other identical checking stations controlled access to the Y-12 Plant (Bear Creek) and X-10 Graphite Reactor (Bethel Valley Road). Virtually unchanged since their time in operation, all three checking stations were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. <br /> <br /> Photo text: This checking station has changed little since this photo was taken July 21, 1953 </p> <p paraeid=\"{550689ba-9889-43d9-82d2-2d461220e977}{217}\" paraid=\"1513823374\"><br /> <strong>Exhibit Panel Description</strong>  </p> <p paraeid=\"{550689ba-9889-43d9-82d2-2d461220e977}{227}\" paraid=\"898266619\">A black and white exhibit panel on a black frame approximately four feet tall.

By 1928, the Los Alamos Ranch School hired Edith Warner to take care of freight delivered by railroad. Warner stayed in a small adobe house on San Ildefonso Pueblo Reservation, near the Otowi Bridge. In 1942, a man that Warner had known because of his many trips to this area, came by and said, “Your life’s going to change.” That man was Robert J. Oppenheimer, the soon to be wartime director of the top-secret Los Alamos Laboratory. Soon, scientists and staff were coming from the Lamy Train Station to the secret city of Los Alamos, New Mexico, the instructions were clear – cross the Rio Grande at the Otowi Bridge and continue on up “the hill.” </p> <p paraeid=\"{f9719147-d112-4266-ad3d-ec39af67ebd1}{140}\" paraid=\"830131404\">Edith Warner and her Pueblo companion, Tilano, set up a tea house and store in a little adobe structure near the Otowi Bridge for passing travelers. Before long, convoys of army vehicles and buses could be seen crossing the bridge on their way to Los Alamos. Oppenheimer eventually arranged for Edith Warner to host dinners for residents living behind the fence in Los Alamos. While trips to Santa Fe required a special day pass, staff and their families did not have to get a day pass to enjoy a meal at the tea house. Shortly after, Edith Warner’s tea house became a popular destination for scientists and their families, enjoying tea and Warner’s famous chocolate cake.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{f9719147-d112-4266-ad3d-ec39af67ebd1}{190}\" paraid=\"548123850\">Today, the Otowi Bridge is part of the National Register of Historical Places. However, the bridge was closed to vehicular traffic in the late 1940s when the two-lane steel bridge was constructed to facilitate the increase of workers, supplies, and equipment moving to the secret city and laboratory. Edith Warner’s adobe home can still be seen from the newly constructed bridge, giving a glimpse into the life of locals living on the outskirts of the once secret citiy.  </p> <h2 aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{4015abbc-ff3c-4039-a32d-a9768cbcf048}{3}\" paraid=\"453355119\" role=\"heading\">Continue Your Journey </h2> <p paraeid=\"{4015abbc-ff3c-4039-a32d-a9768cbcf048}{9}\" paraid=\"1679134851\">From the Otowi Bridge continue on up “the hill” to Los Alamos, stopping at <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/main-gate-park.htm\">Main Gate Park</a> for an iconic photo.

Its rustic appearance belies the role it played in groundbreaking plutonium research.<br /> <br /> Before Ashley Pond established the Los Alamos Ranch School, he started the Pajarito Club, a commercial ranch that failed after a few years. One building, now known as Pond Cabin, remains today as the only standing log structure on lab property from the Homestead period.<br /> <br /> During the Manhattan Project, Emilio Segrè used the cabin as an office for his plutonium research team. When Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer asked Segrè to join Project Y in late 1942, the Italian headed the laboratory’s Radioactivity Group under Robert Bacher. In fall of 1943, Segrè moved into a new workshop, off the mesa and away from the main lab where his instruments would be better protected from radiation. Segrè described that workshop, the Pond Cabin, this way:<br /> <br /> <em>At this time I acquired a small laboratory for measuring spontaneous fission, the like of which I have never seen before or since. It was a log cabin that had been occupied by a ranger and it was located in a secluded valley a few miles from Los Alamos. It could be reached only by a jeep trail that passed through fields of purple and yellow asters and a canyon whose walls were marked with Indian carvings. On this trail we once found a large rattlesnake. The cabin-laboratory, in a grove shaded by huge broadleaf trees, occupied one of the most picturesque settings one could dream of.   </em></p> <h2 aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{4dae50f5-31f5-4461-8328-b6313ac6139c}{186}\" paraid=\"1127836084\" role=\"heading\"><strong>Continue Your Journey </strong></h2>   <p paraeid=\"{4dae50f5-31f5-4461-8328-b6313ac6139c}{192}\" paraid=\"2080352433\">On the US Department of Energy tour to Technical Area 18, you go inside the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/slotin-building.htm\">Slotin Building,</a> which bears the name of physicist Louis Slotin who was fatally exposed to radiation in that building. Additionally, you may see <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/cavates-at-ta-18.htm\">Cavates,</a> dwellings carved into tuff cliffs by Ancestral Pueblo people.

    "audioDescription": "This two-room cabin is constructed of horizontal logs, notched at the corners where they overlap, with chinking filling the cracks. The cabin is rectangular, wider than it is deep, and has a peaked roof made of rusty corrugated metal panels, some darker and more weathered than others. On the right end, as you face the cabin, is a stone chimney with a wide base. A door made of vertical planks is slightly left of center with a six-paned window to the right. Another door and window are on the back side, directly opposite those on the front. Two windows, side by side, are on the left end of the cabin, one covered with plywood. The ground immediately surrounding the cabin is mostly flat and covered with mulch and patches of grass. Inside the sparse cabin are a few pieces of rustic log furniture, including a picnic-style table placed perpendicularly in front of the wide stone hearth with a chair carved from a single, thick, vertical log. An interior divider log wall runs front to back to the left of the door. An opening near the rear of the cabin leads into the small room at the end where there is a simple bed frame mounted to the wall and a small, rusty wood stove in the corner. On the front wall of the cabin are two small signs between the door and the window. The larger one reads, \"18-29.\" The smaller one reads, \"A registered Cultural Property, State of New Mexico. Pond Cabin. Ashley Pond built this log cabin office in 1914 for the Pajarito Club which he and his partners intended to establish on the Ramon Vigil Grant. Site number 1502.\" End of Description.",

A large tree stands just to the left of the doorway and underneath it is a metal table surround by four metal chairs. Near the street to the right of the sidewalk is a small graphic panel. Text at the upper left reads, \"Power House. This building housed the Los Alamos Ranch School's power generators in the early 1930s. Foreman Jim Womelsduff and his assistants were responsible for maintaining the diesel power plant, which included complete disassembly to scrape out the caked-on carbon. During the Manhattan Project, housing was so scarce that explosives expert and E Division Group Leader George Kistiakowsky moved into it. His friends built a tool shed next to the house resembling an outhouse and, as a joke, even carved a half-moon on the door. Since World War II, it periodically served as a Red Cross Chapter House.\" Below the text is a photograph of the side of the building taken in December 1942, prior to the closing of the Los Alamos Ranch School. At the top right is a photograph of George Kistiakowsky, circa 1947-1948. Pictured in a jacket and sweater vest, he is smiling with a pipe clutched in his teeth.

The front is at one end of the half-cylinder, with metal double doors located in the middle of the arched, semi-circular wall. The building is covered with silver-colored, corrugated metal siding. The rippled metal is horizontal on the front and back and vertical on the sides, following the arch up and over the roof. Near the doors are three metal signs that identify the building as a Manhattan Project National Historical Park Historic building, a historic facility eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, and include the arrowhead-shaped logo of the National Park Service. On either side of the doors are two pairs of square windows. The ones on the right are covered by solid shutters with a wire mesh on top. The ones on the left are higher, above the height of the doors. They have multiple panes of glass and are covered from the rear. They, too, have a wire mesh over them. Down the left side of the building is a row of tall, multi-paned windows. They are covered with silver paint to match the siding. Spaced down the side above the windows are six metal ducts extending out from the wall and point to exhaust downward. The right side of the building has fewer windows, spaced more widely and only a couple of ducts. End of Description.",

Founded shortly after the city of Richland in 1909 by the local Odd Fellows Lodge, Resthaven Cemetery is one of the few still functioning institutions from Richland’s pre-war era. Many of early Richland’s settlers are buried in this cemetery. It contains the remains of individuals who were major figures in the community’s history. These early residents could have never imagined the profound and lasting change the Manhattan Project would bring to their community, nor that the remains of Oregon inmates, whose bodies provided crucial information to atomic scientists, would come to rest among them.    <br />  <br /> During the Cold War, the Oregon Bureau of prisons donated the remains of 115 inmates to the Atomic Energy Commission. All of these people died prior to the first atomic weapons test in 1945. Scientists studied the remains to understand how nuclear detonations impacted the radiation in the environment, and how humans processed this atmospheric radiation. They carefully measured radiographic markers in human teeth, which allowed them to develop a baseline for the naturally occurring radiation prior to the creation of atomic weaponry. This ultimately enabled future scientists to see how their activities increased radiation levels in the environment.  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{11df8db6-96f2-4d2c-868c-da2c2ad9eaff}{22}\" paraid=\"781087576\">The cremated remains of these individuals remained in the permanent collection of the Battelle National Laboratory for 39 years after completion of the study. A special committee composed of scientists, faith leaders, and attorneys met in the 1990s to determine how best to honor these individuals. In 2004, the committee decided to reinter the cremated remains of these individuals, with honor, at Resthaven Cemetery. Each person now rests in an individual gravesite with an individual headstone so that they can be visited by their family members and descendants.  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{8d0d5ba6-203e-48a8-bb1c-790f5fd2cace}{111}\" paraid=\"272577404\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{8d0d5ba6-203e-48a8-bb1c-790f5fd2cace}{111}\" paraid=\"272577404\"> <br /> You can learn more about the pre-war communities of this area by taking a scheduled a <a href=\"https://tours.hanford.gov/HistoricTours/\">Pre-War Historic Sites </a>tour offered by the Department of Energy.

Nearby, you’ll find the buildings of downtown Richland that served secret city residents. The laundry, retail stores, restaurants, and theater were purposely located within walking distance of the alphabet homes so residents could easily walk from their homes to drop off the laundry, shop, go out to eat, and enjoy a movie.    </p> <p paraeid=\"{e82899fc-6efd-4667-9554-95ba34691e5d}{175}\" paraid=\"1426847768\">The laundry could not keep up with the busy secret city’s high demand for laundry services. In 1944, the Richland Bulletin informed readers that \"the local Laundry (sic) cannot promise less than ten to twelve days service\" for clothes washing or dry-cleaning service. This information was part of a larger article explaining how \"laundries throughout the country are being taxed to the limit\" due to wartime demand. This strain fell particularly hard on Richland, a boomtown whose population increased from approximately 250 to 15,000 people over the course of the war.  <br />  <br /> The carefully planned community of Richland was designed to be comfortable and livable for the professional workers that the Manhattan Project most needed to retain. Hanford was segregated by both race and profession. The men (Black and White) who built Hanford’s facilities predominately lived in the temporary housing at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hanford-high-school.htm\">Hanford Construction Camp</a>. Many Black workers also lived in the segregated community of East Pasco. East Pasco lacked many of the most basic city services such as sidewalks, sewer system, and public parks, while their neighbors and co-workers in Richland lived in an idyllic intentionally planned community.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{2480c60a-0ff9-4d43-a34d-73965d87f319}{114}\" paraid=\"1426847768\">  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{2480c60a-0ff9-4d43-a34d-73965d87f319}{114}\" paraid=\"1426847768\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{2480c60a-0ff9-4d43-a34d-73965d87f319}{133}\" paraid=\"537796417\"><br /> From here you can walk to the nearby alphabet homes and downtown Richland to get a sense of what life was like in Richland during the Manhattan Project. While downtown, you can see such sites as <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/the-parkway.htm\">The Greenway</a> (Richland Parkway), the hub of commerce and social life during the Manhattan Project, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/c-c-anderson-department-store-ariel-gifts.htm\">CC Anderson’s Department Store</a> (Roma House), Richland’s only department store during WWII, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/richland-laundry-and-alphabet-homes.htm\">Richland Players Theater</a>, which was the local movie theater at the time. </p>",

During the week of April 14, 1944, The Richland Bulletin announced the Richland Theater program for the week included “Princess O’Rourke,” “Lifeboat,” “The Lodger,” and several other films. Hollywood contributed mightily to the Allied victory by creating popular art that explained the war’s purposes and instilled American soldiers and war workers with a sense of purpose.   <br />  <br /> Manhattan Project workers worked long hours, while secrecy rules prevented them from discussing their activities. In the 1940s, movie theaters showed more than feature films. They often played short documentary news features, called newsreels, that showed patriotic Americans on the home front and the war’s frontlines. Recreational facilities like theaters were essential components of the Manhattan Project because they provided a way to relax, build community, and provide a sense of normalcy for those living in the isolated community.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{a4375629-bcb4-4e1a-b90d-6aea09d2e797}{127}\" paraid=\"354945301\">Continue Your Journey<br />   </h2> <p paraeid=\"{a4375629-bcb4-4e1a-b90d-6aea09d2e797}{143}\" paraid=\"1780067695\">The <a href=\"https://www.richlandplayers.org/\">Richland Players</a>, the building’s longtime and current occupant, are also a legacy of the Manhattan Project.

They imagined how irrigation and hard work could transform the Columbia Plateau’s sandy soil into fertile farmland. Howard S. Amon settled in Richland in 1904 and became a pivotal leader in Richland’s establishment and growth. His vision and legacy live on in this lush park that offers an abundance of outdoor recreation activities for local residents and visitors alike.  <br />  <br /> Howard Amon platted the land that became the city of Richland. He also created an irrigation company to entice farmers to settle on his land and brought telephone service to the Richland area. In 1911, Howard Amon deeded this land to the city of Richland as a public park. It has been a popular destination since that time.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{7f9cbc12-ebd9-42b4-b279-c866fb80aa6e}{140}\" paraid=\"7713520\">Generations of Richland residents, including many Manhattan Project workers, have enjoyed spending time in Howard Amon Park. Over the course of the 1920s, numerous improvements were constructed in the park, such as a swimming pool, bathhouse, and bandstand for concerts and celebrations. Richland was a small, tight-knit community remembered by a pre-war resident as “an interesting place to grow up because you were involved in all the activities,” which included boat races and concerts in Howard Amon Park. </p> <p paraeid=\"{7f9cbc12-ebd9-42b4-b279-c866fb80aa6e}{144}\" paraid=\"952343919\">In 1943, as the Manhattan Project transformed the community, the park’s name changed to Riverside Park. By 1968, though, community leaders decided to honor Amon’s contributions to Richland by renaming the park after him. This park was one of the premier centers for community events such as Fourth of July celebrations and outdoor recreation. For Manhattan Project workers who had moved to Richland from towns and cities across the country, this park provided a sense of community.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{7f9cbc12-ebd9-42b4-b279-c866fb80aa6e}{144}\" paraid=\"952343919\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{7f9cbc12-ebd9-42b4-b279-c866fb80aa6e}{144}\" paraid=\"952343919\"><br /> Several buildings nearby are from the pre-war town of Richland. The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/dyer-building-gallery-in-the-park.htm\">Dyer Building</a> (Gallery at the Park), and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/gresss-meat-market-frost-me-sweet.htm\">Gress’s Meat Market</a> (Frost Me Sweet) were also part of Richland as it changed from a small farming town to a secret city.</p>",

This park is one of many open green spaces included in the plans for the secret city.  <br />  <br /> The Army Corps of Engineers hired Gustav Pehrson, an architect from Spokane, to design and develop Richland. His plan included “an abundance of open green spaces running into the center of the town, with tree-lined parkways dividing the town naturally into neighborhoods.” Alphabet homes designed predominately by Pehrson surround this park. He named the different home models after letters of the alphabet, hence the name, “alphabet homes.” Their standardized designs made these houses easy to construct. During the rush to construct the city, Army contractor DuPont built an average of 120 houses each month.  <br />  <br /> Pehrson planned neighborhoods to have a mix of home styles. Duplexes and single-family homes of various sizes and construction costs created neighborhoods with mixed income levels. Alphabet homes belonged to the United States government. Residents, regardless of social status or wealth, rented their houses. Tenants could not make repairs or significantly alter their homes. Officials even decided what colors alphabet home residents could paint the inside of their houses.  <br />  <br /> In the decades since the Manhattan Project, some alphabet homes have fallen victim to the wrecking ball. The surviving structures around this park still provide a sense of domestic life in Richland during the Manhattan Project. They also show the difference between this permanent community and the far more temporary one at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hanford-high-school.htm\">Hanford Construction Camp</a> where the workers who constructed Hanford’s industrial facilities lived. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f1186f37-65fd-4a5e-8c52-d1725d6c5234}{12}\" paraid=\"1059730305\"> </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{0439aeeb-664a-4b05-a4eb-01634365685d}{107}\" paraid=\"1445128511\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{e83176f8-a2ae-4ab3-9d3a-73dc816f5f22}{22}\" paraid=\"712326422\">Take a walk through the neighborhood and see if you can identify the different models of alphabet homes.

Victor’s parents, David and Francisquita Romero, lived in their own homestead nearby. The family farmed corn and beans and tended a variety of animals. In the 1930s, they made improvements to the home, including a new roof. Unlike many homesteaders in other parts of the country, the Romeros and most of their homesteader neighbors were not newcomers to the area. They also had homes and farms in the Española Valley, and would work their mesa-top homesteads seasonally and return to the valley over the winter.   </p> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{78341940-147e-404c-90f2-eb7844436301}{11}\" paraid=\"2119210858\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">The Manhattan Project required the Romeros and the other families on the plateau to abandon their homesteads in 1942. In 1985, an agreement between Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Los Alamos Historical Society moved the cabin to its present location in downtown Los Alamos. Today, fully restored, the cabin makes up part of the Los Alamos History Museum’s campus. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{74efc7a5-2d4d-498f-879c-0d10283471a5}{170}\" paraid=\"1761290749\">Continue Your Journey</h2>   <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{78341940-147e-404c-90f2-eb7844436301}{11}\" paraid=\"2119210858\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">As you walk around downtown Los Alamos, you can explore the rest of the Los Alamos Historical Society campus.

Manhattan Project administrators built three massive facilities in Oak Ridge to achieve this revolutionary scientific goal: the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/y-12-national-security-complex.htm\">Y-12 Electromagnetic Isotope Separation Plant</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/k-25-gaseous-diffusion-plant.htm\">K-25 Gaseous Diffusion Plant</a>, and the last-built and shortest-lived S-50 Liquid Thermal Diffusion Plant.

In order to enrich uranium using the liquid thermal diffusion process, 2,142 rounded columns were installed at S-50, each 48 feet high. These columns had a tiny layer of uranium hexafluoride spacing within to allow for the liquid thermal diffusion process. <br />  <br /> Although the S-50 plant was constructed in just 69 days, the liquid thermal diffusion process proved too costly and consumed too much power per enriched uranium output and was far less effective than K-25. In addition, due to the rush to build the plant and get it operating, S-50 had a higher rate of accidents during construction than K-25 or Y-12. Fortunately, none of the accidents were fatal. The S-50 plant was deactivated in 1946 and torn down a few years later. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{3be696f3-8b27-457d-b4e2-7d6afb8eab37}{87}\" paraid=\"1588554691\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{3be696f3-8b27-457d-b4e2-7d6afb8eab37}{115}\" paraid=\"631158834\">Today, nothing remains of the S-50 Liquid Thermal Diffusion Plant.

They were immediately met by Yakama and Wanapum who sold them much needed food and gave them information about the area. The following day, William Clark explored the Columbia River to the north in search of another river he heard about from local Native Americans the night before. After paddling up-stream for about 10 miles (16 km), Clark and his two companions found the mouth of what is now the Yakima River at present-day Richland, Washington. By 1810, fur traders had followed explorers into the Pacific Northwest.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{228}\" paraid=\"2126314892\">Following the War of 1812, the United States and Great Britain jointly occupied this region from 1818 until1846, when the Oregon Treaty finally decided the border between the two nations. During this period, the British controlled the fur trade and local economy but were unable to successfully colonize the region. US settlers, on the other hand, increasingly moved into the region, arriving either by sea or over the Oregon Trail. </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{234}\" paraid=\"1132912260\">Roman Catholic missionaries arrived in the region in 1826 to minister to the French-Canadian and Native American trappers employed by the fur companies. Protestant missionaries began to arrive 10 years later. Perhaps the most well-known of those were Dr. Marcus Whitman and Narcissa Whitman, who in 1836 established a mission among the Cayuse Indians and fur trappers in the Walla Walla Valley. While the missionaries were not successful in their efforts to convert Cayuse Peoples to Christianity and a settled agricultural lifestyle, the mission station provided aid to some Oregon Trail immigrants from 1843-1847. </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{240}\" paraid=\"893900717\">In 1847, a devastating outbreak of measles occurred among the Cayuse, killing nearly half the tribe. Dr. Whitman’s medical care seemed to work on the white measles patients, however appeared to be ineffective in helping the Cayuse patients with measles. Some Cayuse people feared that Dr. Whitman was intentionally poisoning them instead of healing them. These fears were not ill-founded; there had been multiple poisoning incidents stemming from the mission station in the years leading up to the measles epidemic. Dr. Whitman was cautioned multiple times that he was endangering himself if he stayed. On November 28, 1847, he was once again warned to leave the mission. He did not heed this last warning. By evening of the following day both missionaries and many of the adult men at the mission were dead. Forty-seven others at the mission station were held hostage for one month.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{246}\" paraid=\"1863855212\">Officials of the British Hudson’s Bay Company arranged the release of the 47 people still at the mission site. News of the event quickly spread across the continent and back to the United States where reactions were so severe that Congress moved to create the Oregon Territory in 1848. As a result of the actions at the mission station the Oregon Volunteer Militia and, later, the US military fought the Cayuse War against the Cayuse Nation, leading to further deaths and suffering. To end the persecution they faced from the military, Cayuse leaders surrendered five men in 1850.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{81ffd20b-71fa-4c5d-9684-cee3c9a1cf93}{252}\" paraid=\"260227017\">In 1855 several thousand tribal members from present-day Idaho, Oregon, and Washington met in the Walla Walla Valley to discuss agreements between sovereign tribal nations and the United States. In less than a month, leaders from both sides signed three treaties that created the Nez Perce, Umatilla-Cayuse-Walla Walla, and Yakama reservations. These treaties were ratified in 1859 and became supreme law of the land, part of the constitutional fabric of the United States. These treaties guarantee the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Nez Perce, and Yakama nations legal status and their government-to-government relationship with the United States. These treaties are still in place today. The Wanapum people never fought white settlers and never signed a treaty with the US government. As a result, they did not retain federally recognized land rights. </p> <p paraeid=\"{df73a8d7-b9ab-4232-9eb6-eec3316158b9}{5}\" paraid=\"1320234732\">The treaties of the Walla Walla Council of 1855 also guaranteed Native American signatories access to resources such as salmon, game, and medicinal plants at their “usual and accustomed places,” retaining some of their traditional lifeways even though they lost million acres of land and billions of dollars in resources. The influx of white settlers that continued throughout the 1800s and 1900s severely impacted indigenous communities and led to conflict between Native Americans and settlers over environmental resources. This conflict continues today.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{df73a8d7-b9ab-4232-9eb6-eec3316158b9}{11}\" paraid=\"1124500813\">Native Americans were again displaced from a portion of their traditional homelands with the arrival of the Manhattan Project in 1943. The Manhattan Project’s need for a large safety and security perimeter would further dispossess Native Americans when the federal government appropriated 670 square miles (1740 sq kilometers) of land for the Hanford Site. Tribes lost access to their “usual and accustomed places” for fishing, hunting, and gathering on the Hanford Site that were guaranteed to them in the treaties of 1855. Today, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Nez Perce, Wanapum, and Yakama nations actively consult with the US Department of Energy at Hanford to ensure protection of their sacred places and tribal resources, including the Columbia River, on the Hanford Site.  </p> <h2 lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d93888d2-45b8-4c47-bca6-2707f8d0ebc4}{243}\" paraid=\"1124500813\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{d93888d2-45b8-4c47-bca6-2707f8d0ebc4}{243}\" paraid=\"1124500813\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><br /> The <a href=\"https://www.parks.wa.gov/575/Sacajawea\">Sacajawea Interpretive Center</a> features interactive exhibits on the Lewis and Clark expedition, Sacajawea, and the Sahaptian-speaking tribes of the region.

Groves, military leader of the Manhattan Project, directed Lieutenant Colonel Franklin T. Matthias to search the United States for a place to produce plutonium. After viewing several locations, Matthias visited Hanford on December 22 and knew he found an ideal place to produce plutonium. Groves wanted a large, sparsely populated area with ready access to water and electricity. The towns of Hanford, White Bluffs, and Richland were near the site, but all were small farming communities. The Columbia River could supply the water needed to cool the nuclear reactors. The project could get the massive amounts of electric power required for plutonium production from Grand Coulee Dam, which began operating in 1942. Upon seeing this area, Matthias believed he “found the only place in the country that could match the requirements for a desirable site.” On January 16, 1943, Groves approved the Hanford Site as the center for plutonium production.  <br />  <br /> Still, the Hanford Site presented challenges as well as opportunities. Heavy windstorms inundated workers’ homes with sand. These storms were known as “termination winds” because they drove workers to resign. The site’s isolation enabled the Manhattan Project to maintain secrecy while limiting the health and safety impact of plutonium production on nearby residents. The Hanford Site’s rocky soil protected large industrial facilities safe from earthquake damage. These favorable conditions led the Atomic Energy Commission, which assumed management of the nation’s nuclear weapons program from the Army Corps of Engineers at the end of the World War II, to greatly expand Hanford’s plutonium production capacity during the Cold War. Plutonium production at the Hanford Site ended in 1987. Since then, the area has been the focus of extensive environmental cleanup work. <br />  <br /> Today, Saddle Mountain lies within the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/hanford_reach/\">Hanford Reach National Monument</a>, administered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The Hanford Reach preserves the last free-flowing (not dammed) section of the Columbia River. From the top of Saddle Mountain, you can see the foundations of the military barracks where soldiers guarded the Hanford Site from potential aerial attack. These barracks were later abandoned when three Nike missile sites were built on the valley floor. Though no maintained trails exist to the summit of Saddle Mountain, hiking on informal trails and cross-country travel is permitted. Hiking, watersports, and other outdoor activities are available at numerous other locations within the national monument. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{df85ef5e-f04b-41f1-b7a9-bfc227362966}{148}\" paraid=\"326202942\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p paraeid=\"{df85ef5e-f04b-41f1-b7a9-bfc227362966}{148}\" paraid=\"326202942\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{7d11dbda-b945-4fd8-8cf9-7bba561c7b5e}{54}\" paraid=\"1350751819\">The Department of Energy offers tours of the <a href=\"https://manhattanprojectbreactor.hanford.gov/\">B Reactor</a> and the  <a href=\"https://tours.hanford.gov/HistoricTours/\">Pre-War Historic Sites Tour</a>  that visit sites such as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/bruggemann-ranch.htm\">Bruggemann Ranch,</a> the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/white-bluffs-bank.htm\">White Bluffs Bank</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hanford-high-school.htm\">Hanford High School</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/allard-pumphouse.htm\">Allard Pumphouse</a> where local people lived, worked, and came together as a tight-knit community prior to the arrival of the Manhattan Project. </p> <p paraeid=\"{7d11dbda-b945-4fd8-8cf9-7bba561c7b5e}{96}\" paraid=\"1731835376\">If you are unable to attend one of these tours you, can see the former White Bluffs community from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/white-bluffs-overlook.htm\">White Bluffs Overlook</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/hanford-high-school-overlook.htm\">Hanford High School Overlook </a>from the White Bluffs trail on the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/hanfordreach/\">Hanford Reach National Monument. </a>  </p>",

Few had more experience with the design and construction of nuclear weapons than Slotin. Nonetheless, when his hands slipped during an experiment in May of 1946, Slotin caused a criticality accident in this building that exposed him to lethal doses of radiation.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{0456587c-09c9-4e37-826c-c8f7554c88c7}{188}\" paraid=\"71466085\">Slotin grew up in Winnipeg, Canada, where he earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the University of Manitoba. He moved to London for his doctoral studies, earning a degree in physical chemistry from King’s College London in 1936, then to Chicago, where he helped build the first cyclotron in the Midwest at the University of Chicago. Slotin joined the Manhattan Project while working in Chicago, moving to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and eventually Los Alamos to contribute his expertise to the project.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0456587c-09c9-4e37-826c-c8f7554c88c7}{194}\" paraid=\"924704642\">In Los Alamos, Slotin worked under Robert Bacher at the Weapon Physics Division. He conducted criticality tests, helping determine the critical mass values of uranium and plutonium samples. The experiments carried a high risk of danger, requiring scientists to bring the radioactive cores just to the brink of criticality. Because of his expertise, Slotin assembled the core of the Gadget, the world’s first atomic device detonated in the Trinity Test on July 16, 1945.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{0456587c-09c9-4e37-826c-c8f7554c88c7}{228}\" paraid=\"878789385\">After the war, Slotin made plans to return to teaching. As “one of the few people left here who are experienced bomb putter-togetherers,” Slotin had to stay in Los Alamos to train his replacements. On May 21, 1946, he performed a criticality test involving two half-sphere shells of beryllium and a small plutonium core—the same one that had killed fellow Manhattan Project scientist Harry Daghlian less than a year before. While keeping the shells slightly separated with a screwdriver, Slotin’s hand slipped and the shells collided, immediately going critical. A wave of heat flooded the room, the air glowed blue with air ionization, and the burst of hard radiation had done its damage.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{0df7ddcc-9361-447b-b0df-bb724914775e}{3}\" paraid=\"81486527\">Slotin immediately experienced a sour taste in his mouth and felt a burning sensation in his hand. He vomited as soon as he left the building, and colleagues rushed him to the hospital. At the hospital, Slotin’s condition rapidly deteriorated. He experienced a series of radiation-induced traumas. Blisters, swollen hands, intestinal paralysis, and internal radiation burns eventually turned to mental confusion and a “total disintegration of bodily functions.” After slipping into a coma, Slotin died on May 30 at the age of 35, becoming the second casualty of the “demon core” of plutonium. </p> <h2 aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{0df7ddcc-9361-447b-b0df-bb724914775e}{43}\" paraid=\"419463494\" role=\"heading\"><strong>Continue Your Journey </strong></h2>   <p paraeid=\"{0df7ddcc-9361-447b-b0df-bb724914775e}{49}\" paraid=\"991562762\">On the US Department of Energy tour to Technical Area 18, you can see <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/cavates-at-ta-18.htm\">Cavates</a>, dwellings carved into tuff cliffs by Ancestral Pueblo people. Additionally, you may peer into the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/pond-cabin.htm\">Pond Cabin </a> windows, where Emilio Segre conducted his plutonium research. You walk near <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/battleship-bunker-creutz-test.htm\">Battleship Bunker - Creutz Test</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/battleship-bunker-magnetic-method.htm\">Battleship Bunker - Magnetic Method</a>  sites where scientists conducted early implosion tests prior to the  <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/trinity-site.htm\">Trinity Test</a>.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0df7ddcc-9361-447b-b0df-bb724914775e}{122}\" paraid=\"1562233218\">Can’t get on a Department of Energy tour? Learn more about the history of the Manhattan Project by visiting the <a href=\"https://www.lanl.gov/museum/\">Bradbury Science Museum</a>! The museum’s interactive exhibits share stories from the project and provide a glimpse of other “behind the fence” historical sites.  </p>",

The cavernous building, often referred to as “Queen Mary” by Manhattan Project workers, was unlike any other industrial facility previously constructed. Inside this massive structure, workers used remote controls, the world’s first CCTV system, early robotics, and engineered controls including thick concrete walls and leaded glass to protect workers from the tremendous amount of radiation given off by the irradiated uranium fuel slugs. Despite the enormous challenges that such a complicated and novel operation presented, engineers designed and built the T Plant in about a year and a half—less time than it typically takes to build a highway bridge today.<br /> <br /> T Plant was designed to process about a half-pound (250 grams) of plutonium metal from one ton (907kg) of irradiated uranium each day. That is like separating the weight of a hamster from a mass that weighed as much as an average automobile! The chemical separations process that enabled Manhattan Project personnel to recover miniscule amounts of plutonium from the irradiated uranium were developed by University of California chemist Glenn Seaborg. His original experiments were conducted with minute amounts of plutonium. T Plant’s separations processes used a billion times the amount of chemicals that Seaborg used in the lab.<br /> <br /> Uranium billets were extruded into fuel slugs and sealed in aluminum jackets in Hanford’s <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/300-area-fuel-fabrication-site.htm\">fuel-fabrication area</a>. The fuel slugs were transported to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/b-reactor.htm\">B Reactor</a> for irradiation. After several weeks to a year in the reactor and a roughly 90-day underwater cooling off period, B Reactor workers used 20-foot (6 meters) long tongs to load the still highly radioactive fuel slugs into water-filled casks on rail cars, which were then moved by train to the T Plant.<br /> <br /> Inside the T Plant, a series of complicated chemical reactions extracted plutonium from the uranium and other radioactive by-products resulting in a significant amount of chemical and radiological waste that was put into underground storage tanks. Once separated, further processing turned the viscous plutonium into thicker, paste-like plutonium nitrate for safer shipping to Los Alamos, where the plutonium was fabricated into the core of atomic weapons.<br /> <br /> Plutonium produced at Hanford was used for the world’s first atomic explosion, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/trinity-site.htm\">Trinity test</a> on July 16, 1945, and in the Fat Man atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. T plant continued operating as a Cold War facility and is still in operation. Its current mission is radioactive sludge storage. <h2> </h2> <h2>Continue Your Journey</h2> <br /> T Plant is not open to the public. You may visit the B Reactor on a Department of Energy <a href=\"https://manhattanprojectbreactor.hanford.gov/ \">B Reactor tour</a>. Tours are typically offered spring through fall.

By the end of 1945, it cost an estimated $390 million to create the plutonium for the Manhattan Project—that is around $5.6 billion in today’s money. During the Trinity Test, Project Y scientists planned to carry out a test with half the world’s plutonium, so tensions were understandably high. If the Trinity Test did not succeed, scientists needed a way to recover the precious plutonium rather than losing it on a failed test.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{6d0c2570-e859-4f22-973e-acd89566b7ab}{122}\" paraid=\"1397255913\">Manhattan Project researchers discussed several possible recovery approaches; no approach was too far-fetched because of the scarcity of the material. One idea was the “water recovery method.” Researchers constructed a concrete bowl 200 feet in diameter and built a water tank on a tower in the center.

In addition to the Umatilla, the Nez Perce, Wanapum, and Yakama tribes have called the Hanford area home since ancient times. This land provided everything the Native peoples needed to survive and thrive. They lived according to the seasons in an annual cycle of gathering, fishing, hunting, trading, and preparing for the next season. Elders taught the children the ways of their people. Today, tribal people continue to follow these traditions by hunting, gathering, and processing subsistence foods in a seasonal cycle. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6c1bfaa3-111d-43c2-8be7-b4fea0d0234b}{255}\" paraid=\"628883190\">Lewis and Clark arrived at the confluence the Snake and Columbia Rivers on October 16, 1805, where Sacajawea Historical State Park is today. They were immediately met by Yakama and Wanapum who sold them much needed food and gave them information about the area. The arrival of these explorers where a harbinger of the significant change white settlers would bring to the Pacific Northwest. Fur trappers followed the Lewis and Clark Expedition into the Pacific Northwest. Missionaries and white settlers followed the fur trappers.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{3300ad71-0ef8-41e3-a9c7-f9689a914915}{10}\" paraid=\"1191847894\">In 1855, after many years of conflict between Native Americans, missionaries, and settlers, several thousand tribal members from present-day Idaho, Oregon, and Washington met in the Walla Walla Valley to discuss agreements between sovereign tribal nations and the United States. In less than a month, leaders from both sides signed three treaties that created the Nez Perce, Umatilla-Cayuse-Walla Walla, and Yakama reservations. These treaties were ratified in 1859 and became supreme law of the land. These treaties guarantee the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Nez Perce, and Yakama nations legal status and their government-to-government relationship with the United States. These treaties remain in place today. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3300ad71-0ef8-41e3-a9c7-f9689a914915}{18}\" paraid=\"802793393\">The treaties of the Walla Walla Council of 1855 also guaranteed Native American signatories access to resources such as salmon, game, and medicinal plants at their “usual and accustomed places,” retaining some of their traditional lifeways even though they lost million acres of land and billions of dollars in resources. The Wanapum people never fought white settlers and never signed a treaty with the US government. As a result, they did not retain federally recognized land rights. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3300ad71-0ef8-41e3-a9c7-f9689a914915}{26}\" paraid=\"1368199476\">Native Americans were again displaced from a portion of their traditional homelands with the arrival of the Manhattan Project in 1943. The Manhattan Project’s need for a large safety and security perimeter would further dispossess Native Americans when the federal government appropriated 670 square miles (1740 sq kilometers) of land for the Hanford Site. Tribes lost access to their “usual and accustomed places” for fishing, hunting, and gathering on the Hanford Site that were guaranteed to them in the treaties of 1855. Tribes continued to protect their fishing rights through lawsuits and protests that led to the restoration of many of their treaty guarantees in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Due to these efforts, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Nez Perce, Wanapum, and Yakama nations are now partners in the Hanford Site’s cleanup process with a legally mandated role in determining the proper methods of protecting and enhancing water quality. </p> <p paraeid=\"{faadcfbc-a0fc-42a5-906c-e614b76b7017}{105}\" paraid=\"641106968\"> </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{faadcfbc-a0fc-42a5-906c-e614b76b7017}{105}\" paraid=\"641106968\">Continue Your Journey</h2> <p lang=\"EN-US\" paraeid=\"{fbb6b1a1-a245-4372-8b18-c7bd91f0aed4}{79}\" paraid=\"24376758\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><br /> The Gathering place was created in partnership by the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Tamástslikt Cultural Institute, and the Port of Kennewick.

In fact, this atomic boom town was carefully planned to make workers and their families as comfortable as possible to entice them to stay for the duration of the Manhattan Project. Like spokes on a wheel, sidewalks connected neighborhoods to the Greenway, the commercial and social center of the community. Green spaces served as inviting, natural buffers between commercial and residential neighborhoods.  <br />  <br /> Spokane architect G.A. Pehrson developed a master plan to quickly build the secret city. Drawing upon pre-war traditions of garden suburbs, Richland was organized into distinct but integrated residential and shopping districts. During the Manhattan Project, the center of the Greenway was one of the few green open spaces in Richland, hence the name, the Greenway. Now known as the Richland Parkway, the Greenway was Richland’s commercial anchor point, where secret city residents could shop, visit the library, or watch a movie all within walking distance from their homes. <h2>Continue Your Journey</h2>    <br /> Many of the buildings that you can see from here are surviving structures from this period, such as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/c-c-anderson-department-store-ariel-gifts.htm\">CC Anderson’s Department Store</a> (Roma House), <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/richland-players-theater.htm\">Richland Players Theater</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/gresss-meat-market-frost-me-sweet.htm\">Gress’s Meat Market</a> (Frost Me Sweet), and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/dyer-building-gallery-in-the-park.htm\">Dyer Building </a> (Gallery at the Park).

The Guest House hosted such dignitaries as physicists J. Robert Oppenheimer and Enrico Fermi and Secretary of War Henry Stimson.” The front of the building has a two-story portico extending over the main entrance in the center of the building, supported by four square white pillars. On either side of the portico, a single-story roof covers a verandah which extends the full length of the building. Large wooden planters and rocking chairs are placed along the verandah. The background of the graphic panel has a 1945, black and white photograph of the front of the guest house with old model cars parked along the circular drive in front. Text at the bottom of the panel reads, “Realizing early on the need for a place for Secret City visitors to stay, construction of the Guest House began in the spring and finished in July of 1943, one of the first buildings finished during the Manhattan Project. Unlike other structures that were hastily built for temporary use, the Guest House was carefully built with visitor comfort in mind. It hosted several Nobel laureates, such as Niels Bohr, Arthur Compton, Ernest Lawrence, and Enrico Fermi, who registered under assumed names for secrecy reasons. The rate for all guests, no matter their status, was $2 per night for a room with a connecting bath, or $1.50 per night for a room with a communal bathroom. The Guest House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 as part of the Oak Ridge Historic District as a contributing property.”",

The museum takes its name from Hanford Reach, the longest free flowing (undammed), non-tidal section of the Columbia River. The 51mile (82 kilometer) Reach marks the northern and eastern boundary of today’s Hanford Site. Its waters were critical to the site’s plutonium production mission during the Manhattan Project and Cold War.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{49f545e2-d2c0-4786-899e-9b4d1559c5a4}{197}\" paraid=\"965213920\"> <br /> The Hanford Reach’s wild and untamed nature is a direct legacy of the Manhattan Project and the Cold War. Manhattan Project officials removed pre-war agricultural operations and prohibited further development. This formed a large security buffer surrounding the project and inadvertently preserved the shrub steppe ecosystem. When plutonium production stopped, the reduced size of the Hanford Site opened the opportunity for creation of the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/hanford_reach/\">Hanford Reach National Monument</a>, the US Fish and Wildlife Service’s first national monument. </p> <p paraeid=\"{49f545e2-d2c0-4786-899e-9b4d1559c5a4}{238}\" paraid=\"826909703\">  <br /> The REACH Museum features rotating and permanent exhibits, including robust presentations on the Manhattan Project, Cold War, indigenous peoples, and cataclysmic ice age floods. An outdoor learning area displays a sampling of the shrub steppe and riparian ecosystems and provides hands-on, interactive activities that are fun while teaching important themes including irrigated agriculture, hops cultivation, local animals, native plants, and land formation.

Ground Zero was at the foot of the tower. Equipment, instruments, and observation points were established at varying distances from Ground Zero. The wooden observation shelters were protected by concrete and earthen barricades, and the nearest observation point was 5.7 miles (9.17 km) from Ground Zero. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c4b810c-3a03-4fa3-9ac4-47d6492d7805}{211}\" paraid=\"850171604\">An incredible flash of light illuminated the sky as air temperatures rose to over 9,000oF (4982oC). Within seconds, witnesses saw the first mushroom cloud ever created by atomic weaponry. To most observers—watching through dark glasses—the brilliance of the light from the explosion overshadowed the shock wave and sound that arrived some seconds later. A multi-colored cloud surged 38,000 feet (11.58 km) into the air within seven minutes. Where the tower once stood was a crater one-half mile (804 m) across and 8 feet (2.43 m) deep. Sand in the crater was fused by the intense heat into a glass-like solid, the color of green jade. This material was given the name trinitite. The explosion point was named Trinity Site. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3c4b810c-3a03-4fa3-9ac4-47d6492d7805}{245}\" paraid=\"600140929\">Although no information on the test was released until after the atomic bombings of Japan on August 6 and 9, 1945, the flash of light and shock wave made a vivid impression over an area with a radius of at least 160 miles (257.49 km). Kenneth Bainbridge, director of the Trinity Test, called it “a foul and awesome display.” Despite months of speculation and wondering over what would happen, “the atom bomb did not fit into any pre-conceptions possessed by anybody,” according to future Los Alamos National Lab director Norris Bradbury. After three years of directing the project’s scientists and much anxious chain smoking at the Trinity Site, Robert Oppenheimer simply said to his brother, “it worked.”    </p> <p paraeid=\"{f197d3e8-a282-434f-9f9c-2ad819788073}{12}\" paraid=\"891882858\">After the explosion, Trinity Site was encircled with more than a mile (1.6 km) of chain-link fencing. Signs were posted to warn people of radioactivity. By 1953, much of the radioactivity had subsided, and the first Trinity Site open house was held in September of that year. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f197d3e8-a282-434f-9f9c-2ad819788073}{26}\" paraid=\"1906230811\">In 1965, Army officials erected a monument on Ground Zero. In 1975, the National Park Service designated Trinity Site as a National Historic Landmark. The landmark includes base camp, where the scientists and support group lived; the McDonald ranch house, where the plutonium core was assembled; as well as Ground Zero. </p> . <h2 aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{fb57b1e2-78e6-48c3-b2e5-4183d1a5bb3a}{30}\" paraid=\"453355119\" role=\"heading\">Continue Your Journey </h2>   <p paraeid=\"{fb57b1e2-78e6-48c3-b2e5-4183d1a5bb3a}{36}\" paraid=\"1679134851\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/k-site.htm\">K-Site,</a> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/q-site.htm\">Q-Site,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/l-site.htm\">L-Site</a> were critical locations for studying and understanding implosion before the Trinity Test.

Directly across the busy five lane street is a very small square building with a flat roof that overhangs all sides. It has the slot windows on the sides facing the street and the side facing back towards the city. There is a door on the opposite side.",

The Triton used two nuclear reactors for power and propulsion, enabling it to safely travel long distances underwater. The nuclear reactors that powered the Triton are direct descendants of Hanford's nuclear reactors like the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/b-reactor.htm\">B Reactor</a>, the first full-scale nuclear reactor ever constructed.   <br />  <br /> Hanford’s innovations not only enabled the US military to produce atomic weaponry, they also made a nuclear-powered navy possible. Nuclear-powered submarines, such as the Triton, were important elements of the US defense strategy during the Cold War. They monitored Soviet nuclear activities and often carried atomic weapons of their own. <br />  <br /> This park preserves the Triton’s sail, the top part of the submarine. When submarines are above the water’s surface, the sail serves as a command center and observation platform. Underwater, the sail provides vertical stabilization. The USS Triton was the largest and most expensive submarine ever built at the time of its construction in 1959. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0e6707e7-3ef9-4772-a04d-417155ad724c}{160}\" paraid=\"503954472\">It originally served as a radar picket, scanning the skies and seas to detect signs of a possible Soviet invasion but was made obsolete after two years of service by advances in aircraft technology. In 1968, the Triton was the first nuclear submarine to be taken out of service by the US Navy. From 2007 to 2009 the Triton was dismantled and recycled in Bremerton, WA. During this process, the Port of Benton acquired the Triton Sail and in 2011 installed it in this park.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0e6707e7-3ef9-4772-a04d-417155ad724c}{168}\" paraid=\"923342167\">On a Triton Sail tour, you can enter the sail itself, examine the original controls, and touch the periscope to get a better sense of what life was like on a Cold War era nuclear submarine. The sail also includes a well-preserved conning tower, the submarine’s command center where the captain directed attacks and navigation. From the Triton Sail parking lot, you can access the Richland Riverfront Trail and walk or bike along the Columbia River to downtown Richland. Learn more about the <a href=\"https://portofbenton.com/our-properties-facilities/wine-tourism-agribusiness/uss-triton-sail-park/\">USS Triton Sail Park and tours</a>. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0e6707e7-3ef9-4772-a04d-417155ad724c}{201}\" paraid=\"43535916\">The Department of Energy offers regular tours of the <a href=\"https://manhattanprojectbreactor.hanford.gov/\">B Reactor </a>where visitors can learn about plutonium production activities at Hanford during the Manhattan Project.

Although the Manhattan Project officially ended in 1947, the Hanford Site continued producing plutonium throughout the Cold War. The mall exemplifies the type of prosperity that the US Atomic Energy Commission promised to nuclear industry workers during the Cold War. Today, an atomic-age design enlivens the center’s walls.  <br />  <br /> Before the Manhattan Project, Richland was a small settlement consisting mainly of farmers and ranchers, with few choices for shopping and services. Selection of the Hanford Site for plutonium production changed Richland almost overnight from a small village to a secret city of scientists, engineers, and army officials. People did not expect the Hanford Site to operate beyond the end of World War II. Early city planning reflected this short-term vision and emphasized building new homes as quickly as possible.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{183}\" paraid=\"253340764\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{187}\" paraid=\"1727397623\">Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Richland grew from 250 to about 15,000 residents. The government built approximately 2,500 standardized homes to house the thousands of new residents. Richland’s existing downtown was reconfigured into a modest shopping district for this new, walkable village.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{193}\" paraid=\"105068225\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{197}\" paraid=\"1536706714\">Although additional retailers came to Richland during the Manhattan Project, the temporary nature of the project, coupled with limited planning for retail space, led to complaints. Many residents spent their money in Pasco or Walla Walla’s more extensive shopping districts. Then the Cold War changed everything, creating a long-term demand for plutonium to fuel the US nuclear weapons program—and for a wider selection of shopping options for the thousands of new workers who moved here to make this plutonium. Unlike wartime Richland, the Uptown Shopping Center contained a variety of local restaurants, national chain stores, and independent retailers. <br />  </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{203}\" paraid=\"2082875523\">Continue Your Journey  <br />  </h2> <p paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{209}\" paraid=\"1592602972\">To better understand what came before the Uptown Shopping Center, you can visit a few sites remaining from the farming village of Richland and the Manhattan Project years. They include <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/gresss-meat-market-frost-me-sweet.htm\">Gress’s Meat Market</a> (Frost Me Sweet), the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/dyer-building-gallery-in-the-park.htm\">Dyer Building </a> (Gallery at the Park), and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/riverside-park-howard-amon-park.htm\">Riverside Park</a> (Howard Amon Park).  </p> <p paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{234}\" paraid=\"1284207963\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{eda2e7d8-3156-463e-99a7-9c810937ae9c}{236}\" paraid=\"488768312\">During World War II, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/the-parkway.htm\">The Greenway</a> (Richland Parkway) was the hub of activity, where Richland residents went to shop, dine, check out a library book, or see a movie.

The wood windows and doors are painted dark green. The structure at the right end is a high-bay building, roughly square-shaped and about as tall as a two-story building. At the front right corner is a set of double doors, about two and a half times the height of a regular door. To the left of the doors are two square, multi-paned windows set about 10 feet above the ground. Hanging on the front near the middle is a rusty, red metal sign. In faded white is the number 516. On the front corner of the left side of the building is a regular-sized door with glass panes on the top third. Three more windows are in a row across that side above the door. Attached to the high bay at the back-left corner is the second building, one story high. The left half of its front features wide double doors, about one and a half times the height of a standard door. To the left of the doors is a window. To the left of the shorter building is a solid wooden retaining wall, painted green, which stretches out a distance equal to the width of the building. At the far-left end of the wall are six rusty electrical boxes. On the other side of the wall is an earthen berm which is almost as high as the single-story building and covers that building's sides and back. To the right of the high-bay structure is a heavy wooden fence, about eight feet tall, with a two-paneled gate leading to the rear of the structures. Scattered around the site are three slanted graphic panels. One is titled \"V-Site, Where the Gadget was born.\" Another is titled \"Cerro Grande Fire, V-Site.\" The last one is titled \"Preserving V-Site's History.\" End of Description.",

Just upstream was the small agricultural hamlet of Arrowsmith, composed largely of homesteaders. Native Americans regularly used this area as a seasonal fishing camp, taking advantage of the massive salmon runs headed to spawning sites throughout the Columbia River drainage. In the mid-1800s, a Chinese immigrant community operated hydraulic gold mines along the riverfront using water from the Columbia River.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{0657abda-325b-462b-8d73-7b3add1cc446}{166}\" paraid=\"1171517251\">Extensive irrigation works enabled settlers in the late 1800s and early 1900s to build the farming communities of White Bluffs and Hanford on nearby land.  People in these agricultural communities regularly interacted with their indigenous neighbors, worked long and strenuous hours, and enjoyed hunting, fishing, and swimming in the Columbia River. </p> <p paraeid=\"{0657abda-325b-462b-8d73-7b3add1cc446}{192}\" paraid=\"782010247\">The federal government claimed this land and displaced these communities through eminent domain to build plutonium production facilities for the Manhattan Project.  Today, few traces remain of the places these people called home.

It was a model community” in the memory of Bonita Irwin, who was raised there. She fondly recalled a place where “Our neighbors was real good. We loved everyone. I mean, if one was in trouble, they had help. Everybody went in to help them.” In her memories, Wheat was a thriving place, renowned for its peach orchards and home to educational activities and numerous social activities and clubs. In addition to holding religious services, the George Jones Memorial Baptist Church was the primary gathering center for Wheat residents, where clubs met, potlucks were held, and this tight-knit community lived until it was forcibly displaced by the Manhattan Project. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5dda0f7e-dfa3-4cfa-8239-7c4b594b290b}{165}\" paraid=\"1964635695\">The Wheat Church, or George Jones Memorial Baptist Church, was a centerpiece of the Wheat community, which ultimately became the K-25 site. Officially named in 1881 by local postmaster Henry Franklin Wheat, the Wheat community boasted a post office, several schools, Masonic lodge, service station, three churches, a small college, and a number of residences and farms. The George Jones Memorial Baptist Church, constructed in 1901 and named for a local reverend who donated 250 acres of his land to the church, is the last surviving structure of the Wheat community. </p> <p paraeid=\"{5dda0f7e-dfa3-4cfa-8239-7c4b594b290b}{213}\" paraid=\"1182863200\"> In 1942, the federal government selected 59,000 acres of land in East Tennessee to develop what would become Oak Ridge. Manhattan Project administrators offered residents of Wheat and nearby communities between $35-45 dollars per acre to give up the land with no relocation expenses provided; many were told to vacate within two weeks. Some Wheat residents accepted this sacrifice; Don Watson’s mother said at the time: \"If it'll get the boys home, they can take the home. I will not complain.\" Eulah Cooper confirmed this sentiment, saying that “it was just something I feel like people, more or less, felt like they had to do.” For other residents however, it was very hard. Some resented it very much. And frankly, “there were some problems” such as the inability to retain family heirlooms and gather crops in the ground prior to forcible removal . Some residents of the Wheat community had been previously displaced by the federal government.. Just a few years prior, Tennessee Valley Authority construction and the establishment of Great Smoky Mountains National Park forced their relocation. Wheat’s removal was “more traumatic I think for those people than it was for some of the rest of us,” according to Eulah Cooper.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{5dda0f7e-dfa3-4cfa-8239-7c4b594b290b}{213}\" paraid=\"1182863200\">Continue Your Journey </h2> <p paraeid=\"{139673c6-6bf6-4b30-9dd3-a83580f9bc47}{46}\" paraid=\"971453106\">The George Jones Memorial Baptist Church is located a short distance from the K-25 site. A brief walk from a small, gravel parking lot leads to the church. Ranger programs often take place at the church.

    "audioDescription": "This small church sits on the top of a low ridge. The front looks down a long slope, over the gravel access road, to the four-lane highway below. The church is covered with narrow wood boards painted white with a high peak over the front. A single door is located at the left front, reached by a set of five worn concrete steps with a metal railing at the right. Another door is on the left side about 10 feet back from the front corner. A ramp leads up to that door. There are windows on all sides of the building, two on the front and six down the left side. All the windows are tall, narrow double hung, with two, four-pane sections. The bottom panel on each window is covered by a solid white shutter. A square bell tower sits at the left front corner of the roof, tall enough so that its pointed roof extends above the peak of the building’s roof. The tower has a small window at the very top of each side. The tower’s roof has dark shingles, but the main building has a green metal roof, rusted in places. A narrow chimney sits on the center ridge of the roof about a third of the way back from the front of the building. A sign across the front of the building reads “George Jones Memorial Baptist Church, established 1901, Wheat, Tennessee.” To the left of the building is a cemetery enclosed by barbed wire fencing. It covers the top of the ridge from a tree line at the rear down the front slope to the gravel access road.",

She desperately sought a new home with steady employment opportunities. She wrote letters to community leaders across Washington state inquiring about their towns. She received the most persuasive replies from White Bluffs. The bank operator sent her \"glowing letters about the fruit\" grown in the area and emphasized the excellent local job opportunities. Convinced that she could find a better quality of life in White Bluffs, she moved her family to this small, isolated farming town.  <br />  <br /> Moving to find a better life was a common experience in White Bluffs. In the first twenty years of Euro-American settlement, the town of White Bluffs itself moved three times. The first two locations were too close to the Columbia River. Homes and fields were flooded, hampering the new settlers’ dreams of agricultural prosperity. When a major railroad was built through the area, White Bluffs’ town center moved once again to take advantage of easier agricultural shipping and greater commercial opportunities that the railroad offered. White Bluffs residents made sacrifices and chased opportunities in order to realize their ambitions. They established a thriving community along the Columbia River for decades, until the arrival of the Manhattan Project in 1943.  <br />  <br /> White Bluffs Bank, built around 1908, is the only surviving building from the small community. When built, The First National Bank of White Bluffs boasted of its massive and secure vault, but the building nonetheless suffered two robberies during its approximately 30 years of operation. This building once stood in the community center. Nearby, Fred Gilhauly operated a Ford dealership and the town’s small service station, and Pop English owned a drugstore.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a5ee0bb5-3e53-4376-b44d-036b68126b8a}{140}\" paraid=\"409516438\">Former White Bluffs residents fondly remembered that Pop \"made the best ice cream in the world.” Pop also directed the White Bluffs High School band. These residents recalled that, in the springtime, young women wearing “little ballerina type dresses\" gathered at the city park to perform choreographed dances \"around this maypole.\" At summer events such as boat races \"Mr. Killian used to slice his big watermelons and sell them\" while the community band played.  <br />  <br /> One resident remembered Fourth of July celebrations where “picnic tables [were] set out underneath the trees, and a lot of people being there. Everybody ha[d] a good time. In the summer, traveling carnivals occasionally set up temporary operations on the riverside area where Native Americans came to catch and smoke salmon in the fall.”  </p> <p paraeid=\"{a5ee0bb5-3e53-4376-b44d-036b68126b8a}{148}\" paraid=\"67877074\">In 1943, the Manhattan Project used eminent domain to seize the town of White Bluffs and ordered its people to leave their homes. White Bluffs moved once again, this time not as a community but as individuals. Dick Wiehl, who grew up in White Bluffs, reflected on this process and what was lost, “A town should, once started, should live out its natural life. And this did not happen with White Bluffs. Its natural life was truncated suddenly by Presidential decree.”    <br />  <br /> The Department of Energy offers <a href=\"https://tours.hanford.gov/HistoricTours/\">Pre-War Historic Sites Tours</a> that explore the communities of Hanford and White Bluffs, which were displaced by the Manhattan Project. At the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/allard-pumphouse.htm\">Allard Pumphouse</a>, you can see remnants of the massive irrigation works that made farming possible in the arid Mid-Columbia region. Surviving buildings at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/bruggemann-ranch.htm\">Bruggemann Ranch</a> demonstrate the prosperity that large farmers attained before the Manhattan Project.

For decades, the local ferry was powered by horses who walked on treadmills that provided the energy that propelled a boat across the Columbia River. Prior to white settlement, generations of indigenous people came to this area to fish for salmon, crossing the river in well-crafted canoes. Tribes lost access to this land when the US government appropriated the for Hanford Site for the Manhattan Project’s plutonium production facilities in 1943.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{91aa9338-1f37-4fe2-83b3-45f4f1d7f20d}{252}\" paraid=\"1768889165\">The Hudson’s Bay Company, a fur-trading conglomerate, installed a trading post on the east side of the river in 1826, to purchase pelts from the local native population. White settlers began operating a ferry at this site shortly after White Bluffs’ founding in 1861. Soon, thousands of gold miners arrived looking for transportation across the river as they made their way to gold mines in British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana. The White Bluffs ferry was a critical transportation hub for these miners. A local farmer operated the ferry as a part-time job that supplemented farm income. The town of White Bluffs included farmland and settlement on both sides of the Columbia River. This ferry knit them together, helping to make it a more cohesive community.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{91aa9338-1f37-4fe2-83b3-45f4f1d7f20d}{252}\" paraid=\"1768889165\">Continue Your Journey </h2> <p paraeid=\"{91aa9338-1f37-4fe2-83b3-45f4f1d7f20d}{252}\" paraid=\"1768889165\"><br /> The Department of Energy offers <a href=\"https://tours.hanford.gov/HistoricTours/\">Pre-War Historic Sites Tours</a> that explore the communities of Hanford and White Bluffs, which were displaced by the Manhattan Project.

The ramp is just wide enough for a single vehicle. Both banks of the river are low and covered with brush and grasses. On this side, a few trees are clustered on either side of the road. Looking across the river to the left, distant mountain peaks can be seen. To the right there are tall towers supporting power lines across the river.

These deposits were further shaped by the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/iafl/index.htm\">Ice Age floods</a>, a series of cataclysmic floods at the end of the last Ice Age some 12,000 to 17,000 years ago.

Fur trappers arrived in the 1820s to purchase pelts from area tribes. White settlers began arriving about 30 years later, displacing many Native American communities. Settlers relied on extensive irrigation to grow a wide array of agricultural products, including cherries, asparagus, alfalfa, peppermint, and many other marketable commodities.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{cbc5f220-9922-4149-89a4-3e486878b031}{252}\" paraid=\"1461050986\">On January 16, 1943, General Leslie R. Groves, military leader of the Manhattan Project, approved the Hanford Site as the center for plutonium production displacing tribal and settler communities. The federal government appropriate 670 square miles (1740 sq kilometers) of land for the Hanford Site. Atomic Energy Commission, which assumed management of the nation’s nuclear weapons program from the Army Corps of Engineers at the end of the World War II, greatly expanded Hanford’s plutonium production capacity during the Cold War. Plutonium production at the Hanford Site ended in 1987. Since then, the area has been the focus of extensive environmental cleanup work. </p> <h2 paraeid=\"{735b4091-559d-402c-9336-789958dd852c}{181}\" paraid=\"1461050986\">Continue Your Journey </h2> <p paraeid=\"{735b4091-559d-402c-9336-789958dd852c}{185}\" paraid=\"1211366847\">At the White Bluffs Overlook, you may walk across the white bluffs themselves.

The reactor consisted of a large block of graphite surrounded by concrete and pierced by 1,248 horizontal channels. Workers inserted uranium control rods into the channels, and cooling air circulated around the control rod channels. After a period of time, scientist/workers inserted fresh rods into the face of the reactor as irradiated rods fell from the back through a chute and into a water-cooled bucket. </p> <p paraeid=\"{f86a01c5-092d-4b8f-822f-fb120b9623e7}{129}\" paraid=\"6607122\">Though the reactor never produced fissionable quantities of plutonium, it did supply Los Alamos scientists with experimental quantities of plutonium necessary to design Fat Man, the world’s first plutonium-fueled atomic bomb used in war.

    "audioDescription": "This building is covered with vertical metal siding, giving it the appearance of vertical slats with grooves in between. This end of the building is two stories with several doors on the ground floor, each with a small overhang. The upper floor has a row of windows, many with air conditioning window units. The middle of the building rises another 25 feet with another row of multipaned windows about halfway up. As you enter the building a wide passageway stretches in front of you into the middle of the building. Along the left wall are miscellaneous items, such as a wooden desk and a couple of chairs, as well as two exhibits. Along the center of the wall is a floor-to-ceiling representation of the periodic table of the elements and isotopes. It is a wooden cabinet with a square, glass-fronted compartment for each element. Past that is a display case on a wooden stand with a model of the Oak Ridge Research Reactor with a graphic panel beside it. At the far end of the wall are the restrooms and water fountains. On the right as you enter there is a concave curved wall with a large painted mural. Past that is an opening into a side room with 18 graphic panels. To the left of the entrance into that room is a wall plaque with a sculpted relief of a man in a suit and tie and wearing glasses. The plaque reads, “Nuclear energy offers a Faustian bargain. It offers the World an inexhaustible source of energy. But in return, it demands a vigilance and longevity of our social sciences to which we are quite unaccustomed. Alvin M. Weinberg, 1915-2006.” Past that in the middle of the room is an open area with several rows of benches that face the wall to the right. Here, the space is open all the way up to the top of the building about four stories high. The right wall is covered with the Graphite Reactor Loading Face. The white wall is covered with a grid of different colored circles about two inches across. A legend at top identifies the color codes. At the lower part of the grid, three mannikins of workmen handle a long metal rod. At the far end of the open area a set of steps zig-zags to the second floor level to an enclosed space with a sign that reads “Reactor Control Room.” Going through the control room alongside the left face of the reactor leads into one of the south face experimental rooms. Sitting on the far side of the stairs is a large display case on a table with a scale model of the reactor. Tucked into the corner on this side of the stairs is a small display on the first generation of electricity from nuclear fission. To the left of that is a four-foot tall metal safe. The two doors stand open showing the inside with shelves in the middle, large drawers at the bottom and small drawers and cubbyholes at the top. Along the wall to the right of the reactor face is a long display case titled “Loading Fuel into the Graphite Reactor” with a model of the inside of the reactor. Around the corner of the wall to the left of this display case two metal plaques hang on the wall. The top one identifies the Graphite Reactor as a National Historical Landmark by the American Society for Metals. The lower one identifies the reactor as a Registered National Historic Landmark.",

Developed by University of California at Berkeley scientist Ernest Lawrence, electromagnetic isotope separation was based on the concept that lighter uranium atoms (U235) would move more tightly in a circle than heavier uranium atoms (U238). The creation of a cyclotron, a vacuum tank with a strong magnetic field, could separate the atoms into two paths as they revolved. The lighter U235 was captured in a separate container from the heavier U238. Lawrence had created a mass spectrometer cyclotron, or calutron, at his Berkeley lab in late-1941, but Manhattan Project scientists determined  a much larger facility would be required to produce the separated U235 needed to develop an atomic bomb in a timely fashion. This necessitated construction of the much larger Y-12 Plant, which began on February 18, 1943. <br />  <br /> At its peak, the Y-12 Plant employed 22,000 people to operate the calutrons, nicknamed “racetracks” for their oval shape. While the facility at Berkeley had only been operated by scientists, a wartime labor shortage meant young women, many of whom had just graduated high school, were assigned the task of operating the calutrons at Oak Ridge. These women, nicknamed “Calutron Girls,” were vital to the development of enriched uranium, a key component of the Little Boy atomic bomb.</p> <h2 paraeid=\"{6774b6cd-29f0-4171-8a69-2f7de1e1e888}{109}\" paraid=\"214913916\">Continue Your Journey </h2> <p paraeid=\"{6774b6cd-29f0-4171-8a69-2f7de1e1e888}{170}\" paraid=\"1070920689\">Y-12 is still in operation to this day, helping to ensure a safe and effective U.S. nuclear weapons deterrent. Y-12 also retrieves and stores nuclear materials, fuels the nation’s naval nuclear reactors, and performs complementary work for other government and private-sector entities. The Y-12 National Security Complex is a highly-secured facility. Unauthorized visitation is not permitted. However, a public museum, the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/new-hope-visitor-center-at-y-12.htm\">New Hope Center at Y-12</a>, is located nearby. There you can find information and exhibits on Y-12 from the Manhattan Project through the Cold War to the present day. </p> <p paraeid=\"{6774b6cd-29f0-4171-8a69-2f7de1e1e888}{240}\" paraid=\"1017530734\"> </p>",

There is a variety of geological and geographical features, such as rocky terrain, red cliffs, forests, and rivers.The Colorado River (including its tributaries), wind, and rain have physically shaped this region, which helped to create its canyons, arches, and gullies. Also of interest are Native American sites and cliff drawings, highlighting the years before settlement of Mormon Pioneers.",

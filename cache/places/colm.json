    "bodyText": "The Bookcliff View Shelter is located on the Saddlehorn loop road and is perched on the canyon rim. The final design of the shelter is credited to NPS architect Phil Romigh, even though initially conceptualized by Cecil Doty.  Doty’s design was similar to today’s fan-shaped structure, but had a concrete roof supported by three stone pillars. The final results appeared to be a marriage between the designs of these two architects. It was initially put out for bid in 1964 along with the amphitheater, but then placed on hold because of the expense.  The final bid went out again in Jan 1965 and the shelter was completed between June and September of that year.<br /> <br /> Its design is a curved modern structure with a roof cantilevered out in a fan shape that offers visitors unimpeded views of the surrounding canyon and valley.  The structure’s use of natural stone and wood also blends well with the surrounding landscape.  It’s one anchor of Canyon Rim Trail offering visitors a resting place to enjoy the view (the visitor center is the other anchor.)<br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "As approached from the Saddlehorn loop road, most of the structure is below the level of the road with just the upper wall and roof peeking above the surroundings. 5 stone steps descend into the stone shelter with curved walls back against the slope of the hillside. Standing in the shelter the roof overhead is a cantilevered fan extending out toward the canyon. The unobstructed view spans from the Grand Valley along the Colorado River up through Wedding Canyon and beyond into Monument Canyon.",

This residence was completed about April 9,1935 and the garage was completed by April 1936. The CCC was said to have assisted with its construction while the Local Experienced Men (LEM) trained them.  Many of these LEMs were stone masons of Italian descent.<br /> <br /> Both buildings are rectangular, one-story structures designed by the National Park Service and constructed of native red sandstone masonry. The style exemplifies NPS Rustic Architecture.  Both buildings were “built by detail,” not only were the wall's gross dimensions specified by the architect, but also each component block’s shape, size, and location. The stone blocks were quarried by the CCC men. There are various stone quarries located in the park.  Each building has cedar shingles. The exterior of the residence has not been modified, except for the installation of metal storm sash doors and windows in the 1970s, so retains a high degree of integrity from the historic period to this day.  <br /> <br /> The garage for the caretaker's residence is located at the southwest corner of the property. This one-story nearly square structure was constructed in a similar manner as the residence. The foundation of the garage is concrete. The exterior walls are constructed of native sandstone blocks, which are set in a coursed ashlar pattern. The lower courses are stepped. Constructed from massive native red sandstone blocks on a concrete foundation, the opposing side walls of the structure are mirror images of one another, and the placement of blocks in the front and back walls are also symmetrical with reference to their respective centerlines.<br /> <br /> Today the residence is office space for the park staff. It is not open to the public.<br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "The residence was built using large native red sandstone blocks. This one-story structure has a wood shingled roof. There are three stone steps up to the front door which is in the center of the structure. There is one multi-paned window on each side of the door. The back of the building is three to five feet longer than the front to accommodate additional rooms. The garage is also constructed of large red sandstone blocks with a wood shingled roof. There is one large dark brown garage door.",

Did you know there is a lot of biological activity in dirt? Have you noticed the bumpy, knobby, and sometimes dark soil along the trails? That’s biological soil crust! Just like a coral reef is formed over time by lots of small organisms living together, soil crust is formed the same way. Moss, lichen, green algae, cyanobacteria (sigh-AN-oh bacteria), and microfungi all work together to hold sand grains in place and create an environment where seeds can grow. We as people are a bit like the earth’s crust. We have a lot going on inside ourselves that help us be strong: we give our bodies rest, we give our bodies nutrition, some of us get exercise by playing with friends or playing sports. One of our “crust layers” we want to keep intact are our friendships. We want people in our lives who won’t BUST OUR CRUSTS. We want to keep ourselves, our friends, and each other intact. Think about being bullied – that can really bust our crust! Now think about spending time with someone you really like – doesn’t that feel good? Like the biological crust – a single footprint off the trail can erase decades of growth. Bullying, teasing, and intimidating break us down just like crust. Build others up – positivity is contagious!<br /> <br /> Take a few moments to reflect on some things that “bust our crusts”. Not too long – we don’t want to spend too much time focusing on the things that bother us. Now, take a moment to think about the people in your life who help build up your crust. Maybe it’s your best friend who always makes you laugh or shares the best memes. Or perhaps it is someone online you play video games with. Maybe it’s a grandparent or someone you play sports with. These positive people, the ones who “build up our crust” are the people we want to surround ourselves with. Not people who break us down – and bust our crusts! When we form friendships and bonds with positive people, we let them in to see who we truly are. It can be scary to open up and be vulnerable with another person, but it’s worth it! These are the people who you can lean on when the times get hard – and I bet you can return that favor to them when they need a positive influence in their lives. We help build each other’s layers – just like the geology in the rocks all around you here at Colorado National Monument.</p> <h4 paraeid=\"{3488a1b9-e393-4f16-ac7e-96f237afb0ca}{24}\" paraid=\"1657202048\">Third Code Clue</h4> <p paraeid=\"{3488a1b9-e393-4f16-ac7e-96f237afb0ca}{24}\" paraid=\"1657202048\">Clue: being this eight-letter word builds us up, and builds our crust, being negative break us down.<br /> <br /> Write down your answer and save it for later.

    "bodyText": "The Mission 66 initiative began taking shape in early 1955. The main goal was to complete various projects by the 50th Anniversary of the National Park Service (NPS) in 1966. Major projects/ideas considered in this initiative were visitor centers, campgrounds, improved roads and trails systems, and the addition of more park personnel to handle the increased influx of park visitors.Over 100 visitor centers were constructed during this time period. This was the major concept of Mission 66, providing visitors with a “one-stop” service unit equipped with an information desk, uniformed rangers, lobby exhibits, illustrated talks, museum, library, and restrooms, along with administrative areas.<br /> The Saddlehorn Visitor Center was started in 1962 and officially opened on Colorado National Monument’s 52nd anniversary on May 24, 1963.  Prior to the visitor center, visitors obtained information from park staff at the entrance stations and through the park’s brochure. This visitor center was designed by NPS architect, Cecil Doty, and was true to the Mission 66 form of being stylish and modern for the time period.  It was encapsulated with sandstone to match the surrounding canyon walls with large glass windows and an outside back porch area offering outstanding vistas of the monument.  <br /> Inside the exhibit hall highlights the monument’s geology, wildlife and history through displays and a short film. The visitor center is also the monument’s headquarters, with several administrative offices, an informational lobby, as well as the Colorado National Monument Association’s gift shop.  <br /> Two of the exterior doors along the breezeway (west side) of the visitor center would have led to the original public restrooms (now offices).  There have been several major changes over the decades, with one of the largest being the addition of the restroom/comfort station complex southwest of the visitor center, around 1980.  You will notice the newer building mimics and complements the Visitor Center design and sandstone rock work.  It does not diminish the integrity of the original building.<br /> The original flagstone steps that led down to the visitor center’s front doors were also replaced with a concrete ramp to comply with American Disabilities Act requirements.The plaque recognizing the first director of the National Park Service, Stephen Mather, was installed in 1987, along with the small exhibit board area providing visitors with basic monument information directly across from the plaque.  In 1995, a plaque and statue of John Otto on his horse was placed along the north wall of the restroom building.In 2022, the visitor center was returned to most of its original 1960s color scheme after all exterior/interior surfaces/doors were painted brown and tan circa 1980.<br /> Note in the 1960's photograph the Kentucky blue grass “lawn” in front of the Visitor Center. It was replaced with more appropriate desert garden landscaping in the 1980s.<br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "This light brown sandstone building is built with the 1960's characteristic almost flat roof, floor to ceiling glass windows in the main lobby and small high windows in the administrative offices on the left side of the building. The right side of the building is the restroom facility also constructed of light brown sandstone. In front of the building is a flagpole, a kiosk with bulletin boards with information about the monument and a low stone structure with a plaque honoring Stephen Mather, the first director of the National Park Service.",

Th NM-2 camp was also the location of park headquarters. The historic view in this post was taken from the top of the Saddlehorn rock formation. Today, this site is almost indestinguishable from the surrounding landscape.<br /> The buildings in this camp not only housed barracks and a dining hall, but also a library, infirmary and offices.

    "bodyText": "Rim Rock Drive is a 23 mile paved, two-lane road through Colorado National Monument. This road was primarily constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s and 1940s. The east side was completed by the Works Progress Administration during the 1950s. This construction allowed Serpent's Trail to become a walking/hiking trail.<br /> The road climbs from a valley elevation of 4,690 feet to the highest point on the mesa at 6,640 feet. It employs a series of switchbacks on both ends, with two short curved tunnels on the west side and one longer tunnel on the east side. While initially a dirt road, it was paved between 1947 and 1951.<br /> The purpose of Rim Rock Drive was to allow travelers scenic vistas and views of the magnificent geologic formations of the monument. In addition to the scenic views a eagle-eyed visitor will notice rock retaining walls, guard walls, drainage tunnels and drop inlets. These features contribute to the historic nature of the road.<br /> Turnouts or overlooks were an intergral part of this scenic roadway permitting motorists to apuse while viewing the geologic formations and natural vistas along Rim Rock Drive. Many of these turnouts feature informational signs explaining the significance of the area.<br /> The image is from an area about approximate 3 miles from the Visitor Center.",
    "audioDescription": "Rim Rock Drive is a 23 mile paved road through Colorado National Monument. The road travels up onto the mesas south west of the Grand Valley. One end of the road is near the town of Fruita Colorado and the other near Grand Junction, Colorado. Views along the road include a variety of geologic rock layers, Pinyon Pine and Utah Juniper forests. Occasionally a visitor might catch a glimpse of a bighorn sheep herd.",

    "bodyText": "When camping became popular as an inexpensive way to stay at parks, different services had to be considered.  Gone were the days of staying at the big lodges within park boundaries, as more people drove (versus train travel) and were looking for less costly accommodations. For Colorado National Monument, loops A and B were added in 1966 to further expand camping sites that originally were only located in what is now Loop C.  Since the park is usually open 24 hours, a simple kiosk was also constructed so campers could pay upon arrival (there was no reservation system back then.) <br /> Even though this kiosk was not fully documented (along with other small-scaled features constructed during CCC or Mission 66 eras), it’s still used today as a self-service fee station, and is being preserved to showcase the history of Mission 66 developments in Colorado National Monument.<br />  ",
    "audioDescription": "At the entrance to the A and B loops of Saddlehorn Campground is a self-service fee kiosk. This structure has two walls and a roof. On the left wall is a map of the campground and directions for paying the campground fee. The wall to the right has information about the campground and the monument. Between and just beyond the roof is a metal tube for inserting the fee envelopes and a wooden sign for temporary or urgent messages.",

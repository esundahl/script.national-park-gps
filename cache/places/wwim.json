WITH FEW REGULAR FORCES THE TASK OF TRAINING AND TRANSPORTING AN EFFECTIVE ARMY TO FIGHT IN FRANCE WAS FORMIDABLE. THE U.S. NAVY, ACTING SWIFTLY TO COMBAT THE GERMAN SUBMARINE MENACE, DISPATCHED FIGHTING SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT TO EUROPEAN WATERS, SIMULTANEOUSLY IT BEGAN THE ORGANIZATION OF CONVOYS FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS. TO UNDERTAKE THE TREMENDOUS WORK OF ORGANIZING THE AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCES, GENERAL PERSHING LANDED IN FRANCE ON 13 JUNE 1917.<br /> BEGINNING ON 21 MARCH 1918, THE GERMAN ARMIES LAUNCHED A SERIES OF POWERFUL ATTACKS ON THE WESTERN FRONT. ON THAT DATE THERE WERE ONLY 300,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN FRANCE MOST OF THEM BUT PARIALLY TRAINED. THE FIRST OFFENSIVE ACTION BY A U.S. DIVISION CAME ON 28 MAY WHEN CANTIGNY WAS ATTACKED AND HELD DESPITE VIOLENT ENEMY REACTION.<br /> SIMULTANEOUSLY THE GERMANS SURGED ACROSS THE AISNE RIVER AND ADVANCED RAPIDLY TOWARD THE MARNE. U.S. REINFORCEMENTS HURRIEDLY BROUGHT INTO POSITIONS DIRECTLY ACROSS THE GERMAN PATH OF ADVANCE TOWARD PARIS, STOPPED THE ATTACK, THEN, ON 6 JUNE, U.S. TROOPS, INCLUDING A BRIGADE OF MARINES, STRUCK BACK AND IN FIERCE COMBAT LASTING A MONTH, RECAPTURED BELLEAU WOOD AND THE TOWN OF VAUX. THE LAST GREAT GERMAN OFFENSIVE OF THE WAR CAME ON 15 JULY ALONG THE MARNE EAST OF CHATEAU-THIERR. IT WAS PROMPTLY REPULSED IN A SEVER STRUGGLE IN WHICH AMERICAN TROOPS PLAYED A LEADING PART. THE IMMEDIATE U.S.-FRENCH COUNTERATTACK ON 18 JULY AT SOISSONS MARKED THE TURNING POINT OF THE WAR.<br /> THEREUPON THE U.S. FIRST ARMY WAS ORGANIZED AS A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT AMERICAN ARMY WITH ITS OWN ASSIGNED SECTOR. AS GENERAL PERSHING HAD INSISTED FROM THE BEGINNING, UNDER HIS COMMAND. ON 12 SEPTEMBER, IT ASSAULTED THE ST. MIHIEL SALIENT WHICH HAD WITHSTOOD ALL ATTACKS FOR 4 YEARS. BY 16 SEPTEMBER, THE SALIENT WAS ELIMINATED. TEN DAYS LATER, THE FIRST ARMY LAUNCHED THE MEUSE-ARGONNE OFFENSIVE SUDDENLY CONCEIVED, HURRIED IN PLAN AND PREPARATION, AND BRILLIANTLY EXECUTED, THIS BATTLE, IN WHICH OVER 1,000,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS FOUGHT, STANDS OUT AS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN ARMS.<br /> DURING OCTOBER ALSO, U.S. TROOPS HAD SEIZED BLANC MONT RIDGE AND GENERAL PERSHING HAD ORGANIZED THE U.S. SECOND ARMY, WHICH ENTERED THE LINE ON THE RIGHT OF THE FIRST, ON OTHER BATTLEFIELDS, AMERICANS SERVING WITH THE BRITISH ARMIES HAD ATTACKED IN AUGUST NEAR YPRES, BELGIUM AND HAD TAKEN PART IN THE SOMME OFFENSIVE. IN SEPTEMBER, NEAR ST. QUENTIN, THEY HAD BROKEN THROUGH THE HINDENBURG LINE. DURING OCTOBER, THEIR ADVANCE CONTINUED, AND NOVEMBER SAW U.S. UNITS ADVANCING FURTHER INTO BELGIUM. ELSEWHERE, AMERICANS SERVED WITH DISTINCTION IN ITALY, NORTHERN RUSSIA, AND SIBERIA.<br /> DURING THE WAR, THE AIR SERVICE WAS EXPANDED INTO A STRIKING FORCE WHICH SUPPORTED THE GROUND TROOPS AND GAVE PROMISE OF THE VITAL ROLE THAT OUR AIR FORCES WOULD PLAY IN THE FUTURE. AT THE SIGNING OF THE ARMISTICE ON 11 NOVEMBER 1918, MORE THAN 2,000,000 AMERICANS WERE SERVING IN EUROPE, EITHER WITH THE COMBAT FORCES OR IN THE SERVICES OF SUPPLY, WHOSE UNHERALDED WORK MADE POSSIBLE THE BRILLIANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE ARMIES IN THE FIELD.<br /> DURING SEPTEMBER 1918 THE ALLIED FORCES LAUNCHED A GENERAL OFFENSIVE ON THE WESTERN FRONT. IN THIS OPERATION THE U.S. FIRST ARMY WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF BREAKING THROUGH THE EXTREMELY STRONG AND VITAL DEFENSIVE SYSTEM BETWEEN THE MEUSE RIVER AND THE ARGONNE FOREST. THE ATTACK STARTED ON 26 SEPTEMBER AND AFTER TWO DAYS OF INTENSE FIGHTING THE DOMINATING HILL OF MONTFAUCON WAS CAPTURED. THE GERMAN TROOPS STUBBORNLY DEFENDED EACH POSITION, BUT BY 30 SEPTEMBER HAD BEEN DRIVEN BACK SIX MILES.<br /> ON 4 OCTOBER, THE ASSAULT WAS RENEWED. THE RESISTANCE ENCOUNTERED WAS DESPERATE WITH THE ENEMY RAPIDLY POURING IN MORE DIVISIONS FROM OTHER BATTLE FRONTS. THOUGH DUBJECTED TO FURIOUS COUNTERATTACKS, THE ADVANCE CONTINUED RELENTLESSLY ON THE LEFT FLANK. A BRILLIANT ATTACK IN THE AIRE VALLEY MADE POSSIBLE THE CAPTURE OF THE ARGONNE FOREST. ON THE RIGHT U.S. AND FRENCH TROOPS CROSSED THE MEUSE WHERE SEVERE FIGHTING ENSUED FOR POSSESSION OF THE HEIGHTS BEYOND. ANOTHER ASSAULT ON 14 OCTOBER DEVELOPED INTO A PROLONGED STRUGGLE AGAINST VIOLENT RESISTANCE BUT THESE ATTACKS, NEAR CUNEL AND ROMAGNE, BROKE THROUGH THE GERMAN MAIN LINE OF DEFENSE AND PENETRATED THAT LINE BEYOND THE VILLAGES OF ST. JUVIN AND GRANDPRE.<br /> THE LAST GREAT OFFENSIVE BEGAN ON 1 NOVEMBER WITH THE CAPTURE OF THE FORMIDABLE POSITION ON BARRICOURT HEIGHTS. THREE DAYS LATER THE ENEMY WAS IN FULL RETREAT WEST OF THE MEUSE CONTINUOUSLY PURSUED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER. THESE SUCCESSES AND THOSE OF OUR ALLIES COMPELLED THE GERMANS TO ASK FOR AN IMMEDIATE ARMISTICE WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE 11 NOVEMBER 1918.</p>",

    "bodyText": "In front of you is an illustration of the sculpture that will be installed in this space in 2024. \"A Soldier's Journey\" depicts a series of scenes based on the myth of \"the hero's journey,\" in which a recurring figure of an American soldier embarks on a quest, wins victory in an epic struggle, and comes home changed by his passage through peril. The soldier also represents, on a second level, the American experience of World War I. This illustration shows the artistic process from initial sketch, to clay sculpture, to finished bronze.<br /> <br /> The sculpture is the work of Sabin Howard, who together with architect Joseph Weishaar won the competition to redesign Pershing Park as a national World War I memorial. Howard began by viewing thousands of photographs of the war. He then brought actors and models into his studio, where he posed them in scenes inspired by his research. Rather than putting them into static, artificial poses, he gave them stage directions to move through a scene, and then captured the motion in more than 12,000 photos. <br /> <br /> Howard then selected and assembled images into a series of tableaus similar to what is before you. As Howard took new photos and revised the images, the story evolved. The process culminated in a six-foot-long scale model or \"maquette\" of the proposed sculpture.<br /> <br /> Once the maquette was approved, Howard re-shot every figure in a rig holding 160 high-speed digital cameras. Working with Pangolin Editions foundry and Steve Russell Studios, Howard generated 3-D computer images from the terabytes of digital data. Pangolin then created full-scale polyurethane versions of the images, which formed the armatures for the sculpture. This process, which took about 15 months to complete, would have taken six years using traditional methods.<br /> <br /> Howard then applied clay to the armatures and began sculpting the figures. As each of four sections is completed, it is cast in bronze. When all four sections have been cast, they will be re-assembled and shipped here for installation. <h2>Photo captions</h2> Sculptor Sabin Howard sculpts a maquette of \"A Soldier's Journey.\"<br /> Howard works on the clay sculpture that will ultimately be cast in bronze.",

    "bodyText": "<h2>The Evolution of a City Block</h2> General John J. Pershing died in 1948. The troops he led to victory 30 years before in World War I wanted a memorial. of the potential locations, the block that you are standing on was the most appealing. It was available and it was next to the most famous street in the nation's capital.<br /> <br /> Pennsylvania Avenue is the symbolic and physical connection between the Capitol and the White House. Early on, the street attracted stores, hotels, and theaters. But after 120 years, the federal government needed more space. Workers demolished many blocks of old buildings, including this one. Offices were built on the other side of Pennsylvania Ave. but this block sat empty.<br /> <br /> By 1959, approvals and a design for a Pershing memorial were complete. The project only needed money. Then, John F. Kennedy rode up Pennsylvania Avenue during his 1961 Inauguration Day paratde. He noticed that this area was r un-down and reportedly told an aide to \"fix it.\" Kennedy's request became a priority and the Pershing Memorial went on hold while a larger plan was developed.<br /> <br /> The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation dedicated Pershing Park in 1981. In the intervening years, planners had changed the purpose of the block from a memorial to a place for many activities. A tribute to the general, designed by Wallace Harrison, was included.<br /> <br /> The rest of the site was a modernist landscape designed by M. Paul Friedberg. Grassy hills secluded the park from the city. A sunken area became a pool in warm weather and a skating rink in cold. A kiosk rented skates and sold food. Seating at the park's edges gave people a place to eat their lunches or watch skaters.<br /> <br /> As the 2014-2018 centennial of World War I approached, Pershings last living soldier, Frank Buckles, wanted a national memorial to the war. Authorities again proposed and considered locations and selected this site.

    "bodyText": "<p>The American flag was raised over the World War I Memorial for the first time on Friday, April 16, 2021 at the formal unveiling of the memorial that honors the 4.7 million Americans who served their nation in World War I, including 116,516 who made the supreme sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Built by the United States World War I Centennial Commission and designed by architect Joseph Weishaar, the new memorial incorporates the existing memorial to Gen. John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces during the war. The memorial also includes the Peace Fountain, a cascade of water behind an excerpt from the poem “The Young Dead Soldiers Do Not Speak” by Archibald MacLeish; engraved quotes and references to theaters, campaigns and battles in which American forces participated; and exhibits about the role of the United States in World War I.<br /> <br /> The memorial’s central feature, a sculpture titled <em>A Soldier’s Journey</em>, is scheduled for installation in September 2024. The 58-foot-long bas-relief sculpture by Sabin Howard will feature 38 figures depicting the journey of a recurring American soldier and representing the larger American experience of World War I. <br /> <br /> The memorial is located at the former Pershing Park, 1.76-acres along Pennsylvania Avenue NW between 14th Street NW and 15th Street NW, across from the White House Visitor Center. The World War I Memorial builds on the original design of Pershing Park, dedicated at the site in 1981 as the American Expeditionary Forces Memorial. </p> <h4><strong>Sculpture - <em>A Soldier's Journey</em></strong></h4> <p>Memorial architect Joe Weishaar calls Sabin Howard’s <em>A Soldier’s Journey</em> sculpture “The Everyman.” Thirty-eight separate figures, spread over approximately 58 feet of wall towards the western end of the Memorial Core, portray the experience of one American soldier. Starting from the left, the soldier takes leave from his wife and daughter, charges into combat, sees men around him killed, wounded, and gassed, and recovers from the shock to come home to his family. The figures are mounted on the wall.<br /> <br /> In the <em>departure</em>, the soldier’s daughter hand him his helmet, while his wife touches him with a restraining arm, as if to hold him back as he answers the call to battle – representing the debate over American involvement in the war. In the <em>initiation</em>, the soldier joins the parade to war, as the United States joins the epic battle in Europe.<br /> <br /> The parade, and the work as a whole, includes African Americans and other ethnic groups who answered their country’s call.<br /> <br /> In the middle scene, the <em>ordeal</em>, the parade devolves into the tension before the charge and then the tumult of desperate and violent combat. At the center our hero calls his comrades into battle, illustrating the famous American battle cry from Belleau Wood: “Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever?”<br /> <br /> The <em>aftermath</em> depicts the physical and mental wounds of the fighters. Here are represented American women who served at home and on the fighting front. And here the turbulent, left-to-right narrative pauses, as the hero stops and looks directly at the viewer. The soldier’s look of shock and loss – the thousand-year stare – along with the empty helmets piled at his feet, invite the viewer to stop and contemplate with him the costs of war.<br /> <br /> In the <em>return</em>, the soldier rejoins the homecoming parade. One figure look back with pride, while a flag bearer leads the country forward into “the American century.” Our soldier returns home and hands his helmet back to his daughter. She looks into the helmet and sees World War II, the war that will bring America back to Europe little more than 20 years later.<br /> <br /> Due to the size and complexity of the casting process, the sculpture will not be installed September 2024. Until then, artwork showing what the final product will look like will be in its place. The wall is surrounded by water and is viewed from a platform several feet in front of it.</p> <h4>The Belvedere</h4> <p>A belvedere is an architectural feature providing a particularly scenic view. At the World War I Memorial, the Belvedere is the conceptual center of the memorial, as it provides a commanding view of the elements and features of the memorial – the American Expeditionary Forces memorial and General John J. Pershing statue is located to the viewer’s left, the <em>A Soldier’s Journey </em>sculpture is to the front, and flagstaff are and quotes from President Woodrow Wilson and others are to the right.<br /> <br /> At the center of the Belvedere is a large rendering of the front of the World War I Victory Medal centered upon the memorial floor. The medal depicts a winged Victory holding a shield and sword on the front, heralding the dawn of a new era of peace.<br /> <br /> Exhibit panels along the Belvedere wall describe the American accomplishments of the war, roles played by Americans of all forces and the legacy of the war.</p> <p><br /> Encircling the exterior of the Belvedere are listed the names of the campaigns in which U.S. forces participated during the war.</p> <ul> <li>Cambrai</li> <li>Somme Defensive</li> <li>Lys</li> <li>Aisne</li> <li>Montdidier-Noyon</li> <li>Champagne-Marne</li> <li>Aisne-Marne</li> <li>Somme Offensive</li> <li>Oise-Aisne</li> <li>Ypres-Lys</li> <li>Saint Mihiel</li> <li>Meuse-Argonne</li> <li>Vittorio Veneto</li> <li>North Russia</li> <li>Siberia</li> <li>Atlantic Convoys</li> <li>Western Atlantic</li> <li>North Sea</li> <li>Mediterranean</li> </ul>",

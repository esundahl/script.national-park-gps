North of the bridge was the White section, with a golf course, pool, and many fields and courts. South of the Bridge was the Black section, a much smaller area with only courts and fields. Anacostia Park during this time was a clear representation of the failure of “separate but equal”. Segregation in Anacostia Park ended in 1949. </p> <p paraeid=\"{3581bfbc-8e54-488b-9e1a-81a488cffd02}{185}\" paraid=\"982161653\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{3581bfbc-8e54-488b-9e1a-81a488cffd02}{189}\" paraid=\"783562066\">The 11th Street Bridge first opened in 1965. Its construction coincided with the Interstate Highway System introduced by President Eisenhower. DC followed the trend of improved urban planning and infrastructure happening nationwide. In 2009, the bridge underwent a major renovation almost 50 years since its initial construction. The DC Department of Transportation (DDOT) replaced the bridge. At the time, it was the most expensive project they ever completed with an estimated cost of over $450 million dollars. This bridge is one of several bridges that connect DC on the east and west sides of the Anacostia River. From the bridge, it overlooks Anacostia Park to the north and south. It is where the political boundary lines for DC wards 6 and 8 meet. The bridge is 931 feet in length. On the eastern side of the bridge, 11th street ends and becomes Martin Luther King Avenue. </p>",

It is free and is open year-round during daylight hours. The trail is excellent for biking, jogging and walking. Pets are welcome along the trail as long as they are on a 6 foot or shorter leash. The trail is 3.5 miles long in Anacostia Park, but you have many options to extend your journey. You can do a 7.8 mile loop by crossing the Anacostia River and riding along the west bank or the river. You can also continue along the trail north to Bladensburg Park in Maryland, or south by going across one of the bridges into downtown DC to the Capitol Hill and Navy Yard neighborhoods.   </p> <p paraeid=\"{cbf3787d-d303-45ec-a1fa-ee27859c2d6f}{97}\" paraid=\"947513966\">Local attractions along the trail in Anacostia Park include the Anacostia Park Pavillion, where you can rent roller-skates from Memorial Day until Labor Day. The Anacostia Pool, tennis courts, basketball courts and many athletic fields provide the opportunity for sports and recreation.

Turn right and continue along Anacostia Drive about four hundred yards. Turn left into the parking lot. The Anacostia Roller Skating Pavilion sits beyond the parking lot, about one hundred feet to the northwest.<br />The pavilion is an open-air, one-story, rectangular structure, about two hundred thirty feet long and one hundred forty feet wide. <br />Round cement columns, about twenty feet apart, line each side and support the pavilion's wood roof. In each corner are one-story brown stone buildings, each about forty square feet with rounded ends. <br />The southeast building has a curved front window where a National Park Service attendant is available to provide skating equipment and park information. The northeast structure houses restrooms. Two additional brown, curved structures sit at the northwest and southwest corners of the pavilion.<br />A wide-open smooth cement roller skating surface sits underneath the pavilion roof. The open sides provide an abundance of natural light into the space, and two steps along the sides allow for seating. Metal girders above sit on the underside of the wooden beams of the roof. Brown panels line the north and south sides of the roof. On the east and west side, the roof line is open and the roof's metal girders are visible.<br />The parking lot spans over five hundred feet and a basketball court sits to the west of the pavilion.

Born into slavery in 1818, he escaped as a young man and became a leading voice in the abolitionist movement. Douglass moved to Anacostia in 1878. Douglass used to spend much of his time walking down the Anacostia River.

When a bill to give the veterans their payment early failed in Congress, many of the protesters moved on, but many also stayed, so President Hoover sent in the army - led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur - to push them out on July 28. The camp was still inhabited by about 10,000 people, who were driven off by the cavalry with tanks and tear gas while infantry set fire to the shanties. DC's hospitals were overwhelmed with the wounded. Deemed an operational success for the army, the political fallout was a disaster for President Hoover, who lost his re-election bid later that year.</p>",

The park sits along the east bank of the Anacostia River, providing great views of the flowing tidal river. Wildlife is abundant on the river including ducks, geese, beavers and river otters. Park amenities include a children's playground, a covered pavilion, two basketball courts (full court), two tennis courts and a paved walking trail. The trail is part of the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail that continues south to Anacostia Park and north to Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens.  <br />  </p> <p paraeid=\"{b12f48b7-5ef5-431d-8daf-c43ad01db329}{253}\" paraid=\"1056021538\">Adjacent to the park is the River Terrace neighborhood. Bordered by Interstate 295, Benning Road and Pennsylvania Avenue, the neighborhood is known as a \"modest jewel\" tucked away in NE Washington.

It was founded by Green, an art teacher in DC Public Schools, who enjoyed building boats in his free time. At first his application for the land was ignored, but after help from civil rights leader Mary McLeod Bethune, he was able to establish the club and rent the space. The Yacht Club is still thriving to this day and was an early advocate for stewarding the river. ",

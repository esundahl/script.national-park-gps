Shaw. The water gardens blended plant sales with aesthetic beauty. After 1912, Shaw's daughter Helen led the company. Together, family members and hired laborers dug ponds, planted, nurtured, and harvested aquatic plants. <br /> <br /> Along with being available for purchase by local residents, plant shipments were sent every week to New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago. </p> <h3>A Floral Experience in Washington, D.C. </h3> <p>Thousands of blooming flowers drew hundreds of Washingtonians to these aquatic gardens on summer weekends during the early 1900s. <br /> <br /> Visitors came from all walks of life and included government officials, plant lovers and those who just wanted to picnic for an afternoon. <br /> <br /> President Woodrow Wilson and his wife, as well as First Ladies Florence Harding and Grace Coolidge frequented the gardens and became friends with the Shaw family.<br /> <br /> In 1938, a Washington Post reporter wrote: \"The ponds are separated by dikes with grassy paths, shaded by large trees making a picture of satisfying beauty. Acres of blooms reach away in all directions, the surface of the water almost entirely with foliage and blossoms of white, pink, rose, crimson and blue...\"</p>",

This abundant aquatic life attracts herons, egrets, rails and other birds to feed. Over-hunting and draining of the wetland caused the decline of many bird species along the river. <br /> <br /> People dedicated to changing this trend included Paul Bartsch, a local bird watcher, conservationist and professor at George Washington University. The Smithsonian Institution published his study, <em>Herons of the Anacostia</em>, in 1903. <br /> <br /> Angry about losing so many birds to hunting, he and the National Audubon Society successfully lobbied Congress to pass some of the first nationwide laws protecting birds.<br /> <br /> The National Park Service, local governments and non-profit organizations continue restoring wetlands along the Anacostia River. As a result, many herons and egrets have returned.<br /> <br /> Effects are felt far beyond the Anacostia watershed as migratory birds use these wetlands as a stopover on their journeys.</p>",

The botanist and curator of the U.S. National Herbarium gave her a letter of introduction to directors of botanical gardens in the West Indies and South America. <br /> <br /> The business was progressive for its time. In addition to being woman-owned, Helen Fowler employed a number of local African American residents. She was the first woman in Washington, D.C. to have a commercial driver's license. <br /> <br /> Local women's organizations such as the YWCA and the Women's Improvement Club of Silver Spring, Maryland, recognized Helen's role as a business owner and invited her to speak on several occasions. <br /> <br /> \"Presiding over the whole establishment- ponds, pools, greenhouses, studio- is a woman, Mrs. Helen L.

    "audioDescription": "(650 words)<br />From the Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens parking lot trailhead, traveling west on the trail about 200 yards you will reach a fork in the path, with branches off to the left and right. Directly in front of you will be the \"Planting Time / Sembrar o no sembrar?\" wayside. To your left about 50 yards is the visitor center.<br />The three by four-foot tall wayside sits just off the trail on a grassy patch in front of a pons area. A large tree stands at the intersection, and trees and low bushes surround the pond area. Five-foot long railroad tie beams guard this side of the trail.<br />The sign has a brownish-green background throughout with five square color photos and two oval images. Text in the top left corner reads in English and Spanish:<br />Planting Time<br />Below is smaller text that reads in English, and Spanish, that reads:<br />To grow tropical plants in the mid-Atlantic region takes patience and know-how. For over a century gardeners have watched for cues that it's safe to plant fragile aquatic lilies outdoors. But now climate change alters when these cues appear, especially in spring and fall. Your photos can help us track nature's cues. Take photos on the nearby picture post to help us record changes here.<br />At the center-right on the sign is a large two by one-foot oval color image of a man in tan waders, short-sleeve shirt and a Panama hat standing knee-high in a pond. His is looking down and to the right at lily pads that he holds in both hands.<br />A circular image to the left shows what looks to be the same man wearing the hat, a white shirt, and gray pants bending down on his left knee at the edge of a pond and holding a round, quarter-sized white object just above of the water's surface. Below the image is text that reads in English and Spanish that reads:<br />When nature signals spring, Kenilworth's gardeners check pond water temperatures. Too low, and tropical lilies could die.<br />Four square color photos, about 3 by 3-inches each, grouped as a square. Text above the group of photos reads in English and Spanish:<br />Signs of Spring<br />The top left image is of a robin, sitting on a tree and look off to the left, showing its bright orange breast. Text above the image reads:<br />Robins arrive, cherry trees blossom.<br />Liegan los mirlos, los cerezos florecen.<br />The top right image is tree branch hanging horizontally with bright purple budding blooms on the top side of the branch. Text above reads:<br />Redbud blooms.<br />Ciclamores florecen.<br />The lower left image shows the edge of a pond, curving as it meets tall grass and another pond area beyond. Yellow lilies float throughout in the pond. Text at the bottom of the image reads:<br />Hardy lilies emerge in the ponds.<br />Los lirios resistentes emergen de las charcas.<br />The bottom right image is of two white tree flowers, side by side and in full bloom. Text at the bottom of the image reads:<br />Dogwood trees flower.<br />Florecen los cornejos.<br />On the middle far right side of the sign is a six by 5-inch color photo, with thin white trim, of a lily pond. Eight bright pink flowers bloom from lily pads throughout the pond. Text above the image reads in English and Spanish:<br />At the right time after the last frost and when water has warmed, gardeners move tropical lilies from the greenhouse (behind you) to the summer pond. Planting times must change now as the climate changes.<br />Text below this same image reads:<br />The gardeners' goal - ponds full of brilliant blossoms for July's annual Lotus and Water Lily Festival.<br />The bottom right corner of the sign has text and a scan code. The text reads in English and Spanish:<br />See more about caring for the lilies seasonally. Scan the code or visit go.nps.gov/cycle4<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

Where there is no railing, and 2-inch high wood curb lines the side of the boardwalk. The boardwalk is treelined on both sides, and a shallow river runs through a marshy and brackish landscape of the left.<br />At the 300-foot mark, the boardwalk makes a 45 degree turn to the left. At this point, on your left, will be the wayside sign. A tree rises right in front of the boardwalk just beyond the wayside, its thick branches fanning out right at eye level. This corner area is shaded but as the boardwalk continues to the left, it opens up immediately as it crosses over the river.<br />As you face the wayside, a three-foot wide wood bench is directly behind you on the other side of the boardwalk.<br />The four by three-foot wayside is titled across the top right side: \"Under the Boardwalk.\" Underneath the text and spanning the entire sign is a color image background of a muddy, brown and shallow riverbed. Marshy lily pads line the river to the left, right, and forward in the image. Beyond in the distance is a lush forest tree line, and bright blue sky with puffy clouds.<br />A column of black text runs down the left third of the sign. It reads:<br />A walk along this boardwalk will take you over one of the greatest environmental restoration efforts in Washington, D.C.<br />Starting in 1900, dredging, filling and other alterations to the Anacostia river, destroyed this marsh habitat.

The trail leads past lush marshland and tall grasses on both sides for about 50 yards to a more heavily forested area where the boardwalk begins and curves slightly to the right. A picnic table sits on a plot of land about 40 feet off the trail on the left side, and a wooden bench rests left of the trail right before it turns from gravel trail to the beginning of the wooden boardwalk. <br />The top quarter of the three by four-foot tall wayside has a black background. In large white lettering it is titled: \"Boardwalk to Tidal Marsh\"<br />Text in smaller white lettering reads:<br />Along the boardwalk, you will see tidal wetlands fed by the Anacostia River, with a tidal range of two to three feet. These wetlands support people and wildlife by serving as a natural water filter, acting as a storage basin for floodwater, and providing habitat for a wide variety of plants and animals. This area also includes some of the last original tidal wetlands in the nation's capital and some of the best wildlife viewing in the park. Keep your eyes open for herons, egrets, osprey, bald eagles, and beavers.<br />The middle of the sign features a large map about 3 feet wide by two feet tall showing a series of pond areas in blue surrounded by green areas. In the center of the map it is titled in black lettering: \"Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens.\" To the north and west around the pond area are rivers and creeks, represented in blue, and strips of land shown in green. The map points to the southeastern corner of the pond area and states: \"You Are Here.\"<br />The bottom quarter of the sign shows four color photos side by side, about four by three-inches each. They are laid atop a background image of a large pink flower, about one foot tall and two feet across the width of the sign.<br />The far-left photos show a wide and shallow, muddy riverbed with water flowing through a marshy landscape. A tall tree line is visible in the distance. To the right is a photo of a white crane, facing right and standing among weeds and tall grass in a shallow pond area. Right of that is a photo of a wooden walkway bridge, moving away from the camera left to right. Tall grass rises up on both sides and a tree with vibrant red autumn leaves stands on the right side.

The trail bends slightly to the left, through a deep and grassy field of trees.<br />The top third of the wayside has a black border with large white lettering that reads:<br />Welcome to Kenilworth<br />Aquatic Gardens<br />Text below reads:<br />All year round abundant wildlife flourishes in the park, including local and migratory birds, turtles, frogs, and dragonflies. Trails lead to scenic overlooks featuring tidal wetlands and the Anacostia River. In summer, stunning water lilies and lotus, both native and exotic, bloom in ponds established by Civil War veteran Walter B. Shaw. To begin your visit, follow the trail to the visitor center.<br />The middle section of the sign shows a map of the entire park. In the center of the map is a rectangular-shaped area showing a series of blue sections meant to represent ponds. A listing in the middle is labeled \"Lotus and Water Lily Park.\" Much of the west side of the map is blue, indicating an intertwined series of creeks and small rivers. Above this blue area in large black lettering states: \"Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens.\" On the right side of the map is an arrow pointing down to a location in the park labeled \"You Are Here.\" A trail labeled \"Garden Trail\" leads from right to left towards the blue pond area in the map's center.<br />The bottom third section of the sign shows a large five by six-inch closeup image of a bright pink flower. Four, six by four-inch color photos are laid on top of the flower image. The images from left to right are of a pink flower in full bloom, a black and white photo image of a crane in flight with wings extended, a color image of about a dozen bright green water lilies floating in a pond, and a wooden bridge with railings, extending away from close on the left and traveling away to the right. The bridge carries over a tall grassy area and past a tree showing its bright red autumn leaves.<br />END OF DESCRIPTION<br />",

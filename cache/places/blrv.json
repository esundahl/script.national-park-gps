    "bodyText": "George Draper gave rise to a new era in Hopedale. This Draper brother had a passion for finding innovative technology to make the production of cloth more efficient. He led the company's charge to become the nation's leading producer of machines for the cloth-making industry. The more idealistic Ebenezer, who had started the business as a member of the original Hopedale community, eventually left town. For him, finances came second to the fraternal order.<br /> <br /> Even without Ebenezer, the Drapers ran one of the most successful textile production companies in the world. Although their business got its start in the Little Red Shop, the Drapers’ ambition quickly outgrew their small, unassuming workshop. Over time, new buildings were constructed all over Hopedale, including a large brick complex that eclipsed all others in town.<br /> <br /> During the 1880s, Draper produced and sold more than six million new high-speed spindles to textile companies. By the 1890s, the Drapers dominated the nation's loom-making business.<br /> <br /> Workers in Hopedale manufactured every piece of the machines they used, including the nuts<br /> and bolts. Some processed raw steel in the foundry. Other laborers innovated and made new<br /> technologies, such as the bobbin battery, that would change the weaving world. At its height of production, the Draper Corporation employed more than 4,000 workers. For many years, their home base was a massive facility located opposite the present-day Draper museum.<br /> <br /> Many community institutions were built with money from the Draper business. But this era of<br /> prosperity did not last forever. After World War II, the Draper family slowly divested themselves of most of their town properties. The corporation was also acquired by an outside owner, Rockwell International. They closed the large plant on Hopedale Street in 1978.<br /> <br /> After decades of vacancy, demolition of the Draper complex began in August 2020 and<br /> continued through 2022. During your visit, you may see some signs of the factory that was once here. Most visitors will have to imagine what this huge presence was once like, however, in the space of its vacancy.",

He was a blacksmith, a patriot, and a man who married well. Fletcher was also part of the team that established the first cotton mill here. Throughout Whitinsville, there are many buildings with a connection to Fletcher’s family and particularly his descendents, including the forge, brick mill, stone mill, and large machine works complex that are all within close proximity to the homestead. However, this is one of only two buildings from the 1700s that still stand in town.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8468f8d0-6d4b-4f01-9aac-36d8f8e37f55}{191}\" paraid=\"17\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{8468f8d0-6d4b-4f01-9aac-36d8f8e37f55}{195}\" paraid=\"18\">From this location, we can begin tracing the rise of manufacturing in Whitinsville. When we think of the Industrial Revolution, it can be tempting to imagine a quick change. But the modern system of manufacturing came into being over time. The growth that Fletcher and his family saw from within this home was incredible and expansive—but it was not rapid, or simultaneous. One of the people raised in this home could have scarcely guessed just how important she would be in reshaping this farming community. Continue learning about the development of Whitinsville, and the alliances built between a few local families, by visiting the Old Brick Mill complex, located across the street.  </p>",

These relics of the commune era come from the Jones homestead, where early Community members held meetings.<br /> <br /> The Jones farmhouse was the “home base” for the Hopedale experiment. After crossing over that threshold, Ballou and others made their plans to build commune from the ground up. These kindred spirits (who believed in abolition, temperance, and equality of the sexes) imagined that others would want to make Practical Christian communities, too, and that they could all transform the world. Together, they worked hard to make “Fraternal Community No. 1” a reality. Ballou’s own house was once on this land. This is where he wrote his sermons and worked on The Practical Christian, the Community paper. The Ballou house was moved to Dutcher Street in 1900, and this statue was put in its place. The home still stands, but it is a private residence today.</p>",

Hopedale is a planned community with a complex history.<br /> <br /> In the 1840s, a small association of radicals started a commune here. They advocated<br /> temperance, abolition, women's rights, Christian socialism, and non-violence. Their experiment<br /> was relatively short-lived, but one business that came out of the commune proved to be a more<br /> lasting success. During this tour, you will learn about Hopedale’s early idealistic residents and<br /> the rise of the Draper company, which became one of the largest producers of textile machines in the world. Today, the physical imprint of Draper is much smaller than it used to be, but traces of the Drapers’ legacy—and some elements of that commune period— remain.<br /> <br /> We invite you to travel back in time, commune with nature, and discover the industrial legacy<br /> still imprinted on the Dale of Hope.",

Historian Thomas R. Navin argued that “it was Betsey Whitin whose force of personality dominated the firm and held it unified.” Near the end of her life, and in response to growing conflict between her sons, Betsy split the family business in 1864, giving her sons Paul, Jr., Charles, James, and John control of different holdings. By that time, the family had several properties here in Whitinsville and elsewhere in Northbridge and Uxbridge. Overall, the more successful operation that grew out of Whitinsville was the Whitin Machine Works. That enterprise came out of the 1826 partnership between Paul Whitin Sr. and his sons Paul, Jr., and John C. Whitin. After Paul Sr.’s death in 1831, Paul Jr. and John would run the textile business for decades. Under the watchful eye of Betsy Whitin, their textile machine shop would grow into the largest in the world. </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e68f279-a31d-4f18-a50e-8621dec10a8f}{119}\" paraid=\"89\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{8e68f279-a31d-4f18-a50e-8621dec10a8f}{123}\" paraid=\"90\">While building a mansion in town, John C. and his brother Charles P. Whitin also ordered the construction of the building you see on the street corner today. This Town Hall served a practical function and solidified the importance of the village to Northbridge overall. It was dedicated in honor of Betsy and Paul Whitin, whose children certainly left a lasting mark on this land.  </p>",

The water running over the dam is from the Mumford River, a tributary of the Blackstone River. It was far from inevitable that this place would become a base for industry. But local craftspeople saw the potential in tapping into the Mumford and the ground below them centuries ago. Their actions laid the groundwork for future industrial development.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8468f8d0-6d4b-4f01-9aac-36d8f8e37f55}{235}\" paraid=\"24\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{8468f8d0-6d4b-4f01-9aac-36d8f8e37f55}{239}\" paraid=\"25\">This area contains iron ore deposits. Colonists in the early 1700s established an iron works and ore yard near this spot to make tools. Some of the implements they made were likely for local farmers, for most colonists who settled around the Mumford were involved in agriculture.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{8468f8d0-6d4b-4f01-9aac-36d8f8e37f55}{247}\" paraid=\"26\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{8468f8d0-6d4b-4f01-9aac-36d8f8e37f55}{251}\" paraid=\"27\">On December 24, 1771, James Fletcher married Margaret Wood, whose father, Ezra Wood, owned rights to the falls on the Mumford River. Soon after, the Fletchers’ home was constructed (at 1 Elm Place) and James, a blacksmith by trade, purchased an ironworks forge. This operation ran for years while James and Margaret raised their children, including daughter Betsy. Her marriage to Paul Whitin would grow the family’s enterprise even more.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e9058913-cf6d-4d81-9e3e-48c774beaf36}{6}\" paraid=\"28\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{e9058913-cf6d-4d81-9e3e-48c774beaf36}{10}\" paraid=\"29\">While building their life together, there were major changes underway, downriver. Paul and Betsy’s 1793 nuptials took place in the same year that Slater Mill, the first successful cotton spinning mill in the United States, opened for business in Pawtucket, RI.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{e9058913-cf6d-4d81-9e3e-48c774beaf36}{18}\" paraid=\"30\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{e9058913-cf6d-4d81-9e3e-48c774beaf36}{22}\" paraid=\"31\">When 16-year old Betsy married Paul, it was the start of a long-lasting partnership, forged in iron. The Whitins’ ten children would expand their father and grandfather’s business operation, making tools such as scythes and hoes. At the time of James Fletcher’s death, in the 1830s, an entire village bore the name of his son-in-law, Paul Whitin. Keep exploring to learn about the vital role that Betsy played in keeping the business together, even if that meant dividing entire villages as family assets.  </p>",

He was a second-generation employee. At the end of his service, upon his return to Whitinsville, Kazarian no longer wished to work in the foundry, a hot and difficult job that paid less than other “skilled” positions. Another employee asked Kazarian, “it was good enough for your father, wasn’t it?” But the world, and Kazarian, had been greatly changed by the war. </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{166}\" paraid=\"135\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{170}\" paraid=\"136\">During the war, with men like Kazarian away, women in town had unprecedented opportunities to earn good wages at the company. They made steam engines and other products for the government in huge quantities and were granted an E for Excellence award multiple times. The end of the war did not bring immediate stability or an interest in returning to the status quo. A heightened interest in unionization among workers, and a successful union vote, led E. Kent Swift—the last of six generations of Whitins to run the company— to resign from his position near the end of World War II. In 1946, J. Hugh Bolton became President. This was not the end of the Whitin Machine Works, but it was the end of Whitin investment; they withdrew their financial stake and sold their town properties.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{186}\" paraid=\"137\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{190}\" paraid=\"138\">At a time when some wore 50 Year Club pins showing their many years of service to the company, others took to challenging the Whitin Machine Works. A long strike was led by workers in 1946. After the resolution of the strike, the company continued under Bolton’s leadership for two decades more.

In some cases, generations of residents worked either for the Whitins or in a supporting business.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{6}\" paraid=\"111\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{10}\" paraid=\"112\">By 1900, a passenger service on nearby Church Street made it possible for people to travel to and from the village with greater ease. Yet many of the thousands of workers for the company would reside very close to their place of work, for years or for a lifetime. Keeping amenities close and convenient was one way that the Whitins tried to secure loyalty. </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{18}\" paraid=\"113\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{22}\" paraid=\"114\">In 1865, the Whitinsville National Bank opened, almost directly across from the shop. From this spot, bankers printed approximately $2.7 million dollars of national currency. For many years, the bank was directed by members of the Whitin family and/or high-level executives of the Whitin Machine Works. Shortly after this bank was constructed, this part of town changed from a crossroads to the square you see today. In the years following the creation of the square, Aldrich High School was built at 14 Hill Street (in 1890). Construction for the large Village Congregational Church, located next to the bank, began in 1897.  </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{32}\" paraid=\"115\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{36}\" paraid=\"116\">For the people who frequented these streets, The Whitin Machine Works was more than a place to work. The wealth generated through this company made it possible to fund the town’s schools, churches, town hall, library, and recreational facilities. An article in the Boston Sunday Post from 1929, in the last summer before the Great Depression, noted: “Whitinsville is something more than a mere industrial centre. It is one of the model villages of the world.” Francis McCool, who lived in the village, considered the balance of power in Whitinsville and saw motive for making a “model” place to live. He would argue that the Whitins “did a lot of good for people…but don’t forget, the control was there.”  </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{52}\" paraid=\"117\"> </p> <p paraeid=\"{27ffd6b9-f523-45c8-af56-ba7665584787}{56}\" paraid=\"118\">A remarkable number of people stayed in Whitinsville for the better part of their lives, all for the relative stability of work at “the shop.”  </p>",

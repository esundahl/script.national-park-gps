Cherokee, Alabama to the north (population 1038) and Tishomingo, Mississippi (population 339) to the south, have a few food resources. The picnic area has no restrooms and the closest Parkway facilities are to the north at Colbert Ferry milepost 327.<br /> <br /> Bear Creek is within what is the homeland of the Chickasaw people. The Cherokee lived near-by to the east. Bear Creek is a large creek that flows from Tishomingo County, Mississippi, northward to the Tennessee River and has likely been used as a travel route for centuries. The creek teams with mussels, fish and other aquatic species, although the fauna composition has lost diversity in the lower 17 miles of the creek impounded by Pickwick Dam.<br /> <br /> After heavy rains, the site is frequently closed due to flooding. <br />  ",

In additions to bible studies, the missions’ agendas often included farming, carpentry, weaving, housekeeping, and the standard reading writing and arithmetic.The Choctaw story of creation includes that the Great Spirit molded the Choctaw people from the moist soil of Nanih Waiya, a mound located near Philadelphia, Mississippi.<br /> <br /> In the early 1800s, federal policy for the Choctaw Indians was that of Christian assimilation. Early nineteenth century Indian Agents such as John C. Calhoun and Thomas McKenney used Christian missionaries to mold indigenous people into what they felt was the model American society. While this policy aimed to negate the traditional beliefs of the Choctaw people, the tribes saw the benefits of learning reading, writing, and arithmetic, knowing these skills would aid them in doing business with the ever-increasing numbers of settlers.  <br /> <br /> Bethel Mission was a half mile northwest of the pull-off.",

    "bodyText": "Brashears Stand is named after Turner Brashears, who moved to the area in the late 1700s. He became a trader with the Choctaw and learned their language.<br /> <br /> In 1806 Turner Brashears placed an advertisement in the Natchez newspaper about his stand labeling it “A house of Entertainment on the road leading from Natchez to Nashville.” Travelers on the Natchez Trace generally seemed to be pleased with their treatment and accommodations at Brashears Stand. In 1807 Reverend Jacob Young, a Methodist preacher, wrote “Near the line that divided the Choctaw Nation from the Mississippi Territory stood a fine public house kept by a man by the name of Brashears...He treated us very well but knew how to make a high bill.” In addition to earning money from his stand operation, Brashears prospered by selling land and enslaved people.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>Slavery along the Natchez Trace</strong><br /> Each decade from the 1820s through the Civil War, roughly 200,000 enslaved people were forcibly moved from the upper south to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Many of these roughly 1 million enslaved people traveled the Natchez Trace on foot. Many stands along the Natchez Trace were home to enslaved people; they worked for the profit of stand owners and served travelers. Mount Locust, Colbert Ferry, the Gordon House, and numerous other stands relied on the labor of enslaved people to prosper. Some plantation owners, including Turner Brashears of Brashears Stand, became wealthy as traders of enslaved people.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately there are no remnants of Brashears Stand visible at the site.<br /> <br /> Brashears Stand is also a trailhead for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/walking-or-biking-the-chisha-foka-multi-use-trail.htm\">Chisha Foka Multi-Use Trail</a><br /> <br /> There is a boardwalk here that leads to the <a href=\"https://mscrafts.org/\">The Bill Waller Craft Center, Home of the Craftmen's Guild Of Mississippi.</a><br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional iformation.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "Near the bubbling waters of Buzzard Roost Spring, Levi Colbert (Itawamba Minko, \"Bench Chief\") built one of the many inns, called stands, along the Natchez Trace. Trace travelers no doubt talked about Levi's stand. It was nicer than most, and offered respite from the miles of footsteps that defined a Trace journey. Inns, or stands, provided occasional shelter for travelers along the Natchez Trace from the 1790s to the 1840s. These stands offered food to eat and food for thought: local news, information, and ideas. The ever-changing mix of diverse people – whites, American Indians, African Americans – interacted at the stands on a regular basis.<br /> <br /> It was Colbert's negotiating and language skills that sustained him as a tribal leader. Bilingual, with a Scottish father and Chickasaw Mother, he took advantage of the opportunities in both cultures. Across several decades, Colbert sat among the Chickasaw during treaty talks. Using his knowledge of both white and Chickasaw society, he protected both the Chickasaw homeland and his own interests. <br /> <br /> A dogged negotiator, at the time of his death in 1834, Colbert was trying to amend an 1832 treaty to gain better terms his the Chickasaw people.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately there are no remnants of Levi Colbert's stand visible at the site except for where the spring comes out of the ground. A short trail leads to the Buzzard Roost Spring where it is easy to picture how precious the small spring was to trace travelers. A short decent on steep steps will reveal a quiet haven set in a cool and shady glen, the perfect retreat for a hot summer day.  <br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>Slavery along the Natchez Trace</strong><br /> Each decade from the 1820s through the Civil War, roughly 200,000 enslaved people were forcibly moved from the upper south to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Many of these roughly 1 million enslaved people traveled the Natchez Trace on foot. Many stands along the Natchez Trace were home to enslaved people; they worked for the profit of stand owners and served travelers. Mount Locust, Colbert Ferry, the Gordon House, and numerous other stands relied on the labor of enslaved people to prosper. Some plantation owners, including Turner Brashears of Brashears Stand, became wealthy as traders of enslaved people.<br /> <br /> <strong>What happened to the stands?</strong><br /> Travel on the Natchez Trace declined as travelers used steamboats more and more for transportation to and from market towns such as Natchez, MS and New Orleans. Many stand owners relocated to more active trade routes or closed their doors. For decades after, however, settlers relied on sections of the Natchez Trace for local travel. With the establishment of the Natchez Trace Parkway many of the stands live on only in our history.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.",

The paved road winds around the forest area that is adjacent to the Parkway and leads to a large opening. The paved road continues and makes a loop around a small plot of grass and trees that are in the middle of the loop. At the southwestern end of the loop is a paved sidewalk that lead to a small sheltered exhibit that has brick ledges about two feet tall extending out about 15-feet on the eastern and western sides of it. Underneath the exhibit shelter are signs on the walls with depictions of American Indian life in the Middle Woodland Period. In the center of the eastern side of the sheltered exhibit is an information plaque that has an artists rendering of American Indian life during this time period and a button to press that gives an audio interpretation of the site. Directly behind the information plaque, the paved sidewalk continues eastward towards the two mounds. Along the sidewalk are small plaques that give more information about what the houses and structures that were once here looked like. As the sidewalk loops around, Mounds A and B are both to the east of the sidewalk. The mounds are grass covered and well maintained. Both are close to 15-feet tall and shaped like a large dome. Behind the mounds and surrounding the site on all sides is dense forest. The paved sidewalk ends at the northeastern part of the parking lot. In the center of the parking lot is another interpretive plaque that tells of the descendants that still visit the mound site.",

    "bodyText": "Today, Jackson is the capital of Mississippi and the center of government business, but in the 1800’s this region was the center of business between the U.S. Government and the Choctaw Indians. The Choctaw’s homeland (Chahta yakni aboha) included lands that became the states of Mississippi and Alabama, but the land was gradually ceded to the U.S. Government. The last cession was made in 1830, following the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek.<br /> <br /> Between 1807 until 1820 Silas Dinsmore held the job of Choctaw Agent. His job included representing the interests of the Choctaw while implementing U.S. policies. As part of his job, he checked passports, collected debts, insured that the Choctaw were paid for lands ceded to the United States, and taught farming methods. Because of the cessions of land, the Choctaw Agency had to move four times in order to remain within tribal boundaries. <br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/planyourvisit/chishafoka.htm\">Chisha Foka Multi-Use Trail</a> for additional information.",

This is also a trailhead for the Chisha Foka Multi-Use Trail. The multi-use trail is fully ADA accessible.",

    "bodyText": "George Colbert lived atop this ridge overlooking the Tennessee River.  As one of the many inns that dotted the Trace between Nashville and Natchez, it provided travelers with food and lodging. With a Scottish father and Chickasaw mother, George Colbert used his bilingual abilities and knowledge of both cultures to build a network of enterprises. As a Chickasaw, he gained the right, by treaty, to operate a ferry across the Tennessee River from 1800 to 1819. <br /> <br /> Colbert and his family were one of many slaveholding planters that emerged among the Chickasaw during this time period. Not only did he operate his ferry and stand, he also operated a large planation nearby that depended on the labor of 150 enslaved African American.  <br /> <br /> At this site you can take a short walk up to the ridge where the home once sat. An additional 20-minute stroll will take you along the Old Trace to the bluff overlook of the river. ",
    "audioDescription": "The parking area has room for several cars. At the parking area there is a short sidewalk to lead you to one large wooden information sign, and two smaller ones. There is one stone Daughters of the American Revolution marker located here as well. From the parking lot, there is a short walk on an uneven and not paved path that leads to the home site. The home site is large and open with trees surrounding it. There is one historic round metal sign with a picture of what the house looked like. If you walk through the open space where the house stood, you can see the river bank.",

This 750-foot trail will provide you with a mini experience of a swamp. <br /> <br /> Forests are fascinating places. Whole new worlds unfold to anyone who takes time to explore them. Across Cole Creek you will find a typical mixed hardwood forest. Here you can discover for yourself the many marvels in a bottomland forest which are more intriguing than you might expect. Time means little in a forest, but a 15 minute adventure along this short trail will take you through the last days of a Tupelo-Bald Cypress swamp and into the first stage of a mixed hardwood bottomland forest. Water Tupelo thrives in lowlands and swamps because it can survive with its roots completely submerged underwater. The swollen base, called a buttress, helps support the tree. Bald Cypress, another swamp lover, is easily recognized by its knees. It was once thought these knees were breathing organs but it is now believed they merely give additional support to the towering tree. As the swamp is filled, other species of trees are able to survive and reproduce. Beech, hickory, red oak, chestnut oak, ash, elm and many others comprise the mixed hardwood forest that is taking over the area. Cole Creek will always be here but as the swamp fills in and the hardwood forest becomes established the creek will be more and more limited to its banks. Someday the area will be a hardwood forest with a creek running through it, all evidence of the swamp gone.",

During this tenure, Aaron Burr came to the Mississippi Territory on January 10, 1807. Burr had recently been involved in the duel in which he killed Alexander Hamilton. When Cowles Mead learned of Burr's presence in the territory, he made plans to capture him. In order to avoid extradition, Burr surrendered to Mississippi officials in exchange for a guaranteed trial in the territory. Burr’s bound was established at $10,000, and Mead ordered the arrest of anyone that appeared hostile toward the Government's views or favorable to Aaron Burr <br /> <br /> Cowles Mead’s home, called “Greenwood,” was located here, a mile northwest of Clinton in Hinds County, set in a lawn of fifty acres of Bermuda grass, which he is believed to have introduced into the United States.  He was an enthusiastic gardener, and proudly entertained distinguished guests amongst the well landscaped grounds.

    "bodyText": "<h3> </h3> Many years ago, the Pearl River flowed here. The river changed course. A shallow area was created by the deposition of sediments as the river retreated. During periodic low water, seedlings of water-tolerant cypress and tupelo trees gained a foothold. The trees you see today are a result.<br /> <br /> Water tupelo and bald cypress trees can live in deep water for long periods. After taking root in the summer when the swamp is nearly dry, the seedlings can stay alive in water deep enough to kill other plants.<br /> <br /> The trail at this location leads through an abandoned river channel. As the channel fills with silt and vegetation, black willow, sycamore, red maple, and other trees will gradually replace the bald cypress and water tupelo. Also if you look closely you may see juvenile alligators sunning themselves on floating logs and other vegetation.<br /> <br /> This location is also a trailhead for the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yockanookanysection.htm\">Yockanookany Section of the Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail</a>. This trailhead is located directly across the paved Parkway from the Cypress Swamp site. Hikers may hike south 14.1 miles to the West Florida Boundary, north 8.9 miles to the Yockanookany Trailhead, or any distance they chose on this out and back trail.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natt/planyourvisit/conditions.htm\">Alerts & Conditions</a> for updates.",

    "bodyText": "<strong>The Ceremonial Center</strong><br /> Located about 10 miles northeast of Natchez, Mississippi, Emerald Mound is the second-largest Mississippian Period ceremonial mound in the United States, surpassed only by Monk’s Mound near Cahokia, Illinois. Built and used between the years 1200 C.E. (current era) and 1600 C.E., this 35-foot-high mound covers eight acres and measures 770 feet by 435 feet at its base. Two secondary mounds sit atop the primary mound, bringing the total height to approximately 60 feet. The larger one at the west end measures 190 feet by 160 feet by 30 feet high. Early records suggest there were six, smaller mounds located along the sides of the primary mound, but visual evidence of these smaller mounds has long since disappeared.<br /> <br /> <strong>Building the Mound</strong><br /> The builders of these flat-topped mounds are called Mississippians, named for the concentration of their villages and mounds in the Mississippi River Valley.<br /> <br /> Imagine groups of people walking with empty baskets, looking for the perfect location to collect soil for building the mounds. Once found, they may have used digging sticks or their own two hands to collect soil, load up their baskets, and walk back to their village. Baskets would have been emptied, soil stomped down, and the process repeated over and over again to create a mound that was 35 feet high. How many people, how many hours, days, or even years of labor were put into creating this mound?<br /> <br /> There are many mysteries that remain regarding mound construction.<br /> <br /> <strong>Social Significance of the Mounds</strong><br /> The villages of the Mississippians are marked by flat-topped earthen mounds that are scattered throughout the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. Sometimes a single large mound dominated the village or ceremonial center. More often, the mounds were arranged around a rectangular plaza. At Emerald Mound, however, the village ceremonial center was on top of the mound. There is evidence of a village site near the mound that was destroyed by cultivation. <br /> <br /> The mounds of the Mississippians were used for burials, temples and ceremonial structures. Archeologists believe the mounds were the setting for elaborate civic processions, ceremonial dances, and intricate and solemn religious rituals.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  ",

About 1812, he established his stand 900 feet to the northeast on the Natchez Trace.<br /> <br /> Because of the LeFleur's nationality, the area was often called \"French Camp,\" a name retained by the present village.<br /> <br /> LeFleur married a Choctaw woman. Their famous son who changed his name to Greenwood Leflore, became a Choctaw chief and a Mississippi State Senator. Named after him are the city of Greenwood and the county of Leflore.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were there stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River, so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land, many American Indian nations did, including the Chickasaw and Choctaw. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time, stands generally bore the last name of the owners.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.<br /> <br /> Just off the Natchez Trace Parkway you can visit our friends at the <a href=\"https://www.frenchcamphistoricvillage.com/\">French Camp Historic Village</a> and discover how early American life used to be in this quaint log cabin village.",

    "bodyText": "Somewhat stark and a little imposing, the Gordon House you see today masks the welcome it once gave to travelers and locals alike. The brick home of Captain John Gordon and his family, built in 1818, was one of the more impressive homes in the area. It was a landmark for travelers of the Old Trace, letting them know that soon they would be in Nashville, Tennessee, where simple human comforts could be found after weeks of walking on a well-traveled but rustic trail. The Gordon family called it home, but it was a business as well. A ferry provided a safe way for travelers and locals alike to cross the Duck River, and the grounds provided boatmen on their way home a place to sleep for the night.<br /> <br /> In the early 1800s, this site was just inside Chickasaw Territory, and any business needed a Chickasaw representative. In 1802, a partnership formed between Gordon and Chickasaw Chief William Colbert. <br /> <br /> <strong>Building the Gordon House</strong><br /> While Gordon was away again in 1818, Dolly maintained the home front. Gordon did, however, send her instructions at least once on how their new house should be built.<br /> <br /> “The windows to be placed on each side of the front door of the large room, and on the right of the door of the small room… The rest I leave with yourself.” <em>Letter from John Gordon to Dolly Gordon</em>, 1818.<br /> <br /> The house layout was typical for the time—a Federal-style, modified hall-and-parlor plan—but the brick from which it was made created one of the most elegant homes on the Tennessee frontier.<br /> <br /> <strong>If We Could See Inside</strong><br /> Even though you cannot enter the Gordon House today due to safety concerns, you can imagine a large, vibrant family filling the home. If we could pull back the curtains, we may see a well-worn floor from children playing. Through one front door, you may imagine seeing the family gathered around the fireplace—a room where many daily activities took place. The narrow staircase leads upstairs to two bedrooms. Through the other front door, you would see the formal parlor, where guests would visit during the day, or where people would sleep at night.<br /> <br /> The Gordon House was not the only building on the land, as you see today. An exterior kitchen, a smokehouse, barns, coops, and servant’s quarters are all possible buildings that filled the 1,515 acre site.<br /> <br /> <strong>From Family Home to Historic Site</strong><br /> Shortly after the Gordon House was completed, travel on the Old Trace started to slow down and almost came to a stop. The stand and trading post were no longer necessary, but the ferry remained operational for almost 100 years due to the high use by local residents. It was not until 1896, when a bridge was built over the Duck River, that the ferry was abandoned.<br /> <br /> When John Gordon died of pneumonia in 1819, Dolly continued to run the farm with the help of her children and enslaved people. Cotton, cattle, and hogs all helped to support her family. At the time of her death at the age of 80, her son-in-law wrote, “She bore the burdens of their home, and was as brave and heroic as he.” She lived here until her death in 1859.<br /> <br /> The Gordon House had numerous owners before the National Park Service acquired the site in 1973. In 1974, the home was nominated and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The exterior was soon restored to its 1818 appearance, as you see it today.<br /> <br /> For more information on the Gordon house see<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/gordonhouse.htm\"> Gordon House: A Home on the Nathez Trace</a>.",
    "audioDescription": "The Gordon House is two story red brick home. The front of the house has 2 white doors and 3 windows on the first floor and 3 windows on the second floor. All the windows are outlined in white. The home have a brick chimney on either side of the home. The doors and windows on the first floor are several feet off the ground. There is currently no porch or viewing platforms to see into the home. The home is roughly 100 yards from the parking area. There is a paved sidewalk 3 feet in width from the parking lot to the historic home. The restrooms, picnic tables and Parkway information bulletin board borders the parking lot on the north east side of the parking lot.",

    "bodyText": "Meriwether Lewis arrived at Grinder’s Stand on the evening of October 10, 1809. He was accompanied by Pernia and James Neelly’s, the US Indian agent to the Chickasaw, enslaved servant. James Neelly remained farther south, looking for horses that had escaped the previous night. Lewis stayed in the cabin while Pernia and Neelly’s enslaved servant stayed in the stables. Mrs. Grinder and her children stayed in the kitchen separate from the house. In the middle of the night Mrs. Grinder heard two gun shots and found Lewis bleeding from his wounds. By sunrise on October 11,1809, Lewis was dead. Historical accounts support the probability of suicide. When Neelly arrived later in the day, he arranged to have Lewis buried a few hundred yards from Grinder’s Stand.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately there are noknown drawings or descriptions of what Grinder's Stand look like. The house itself was destroyed before the state of Tennessee erected the monument to Meriwether Lewis in 1848. All that is left of the stand is hearth stones just past the Grinder's Stand sign.<br /> <br /> To explore the other areas of the Meriwether Lewis Death and Burial site along the Natchez Trace Parkway see <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/exploring-the-meriwether-lewis-site.htm\">Exploring the Meriwther Lewis Site</a>.",
    "audioDescription": "Grinder's Stand is no longer standing. It was located on the north side of the current Visitor Information Center, the log cabin, on site. All that marks the location is a metal sign saying Grinder House. Hearth stones are in the grass beyond the metal sign. The area is surrounded by mowed grass. Please watch your step for uneven ground and animal burrows.",

Nearby Fort Deposit was a supply depot for troops clearing the Trace in 1801-1802, and troops were assembled here during the Burr conspiracy allegedly to separate the western states from the Union. The site takes its name from a nearby water mill.<br /> <br /> The half mile-long trail to the left of the wooden sign takes you to the Old Trace and Grindstone Ford. Boatmen, also known as Kaintucks, on foot or horseback crossed here, northbound, after floating cargo down to Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans and Natchez, Mississippi. Soldiers splashed across from the north to protect the Natchez District from British and Spanish threats during the War of 1812. For post riders, American Indians, and preachers, Bayou Pierre was the line between two nations.<br /> <br /> Daniel Burnett's stand stood near here. Burnett was the speaker of the Territorial House of Representatives, a principal negotiator with the Choctaws, and a framer of the state constitution but his stand was unpretentious. His guests supped on mush and milk in a room filled with their own gear and Burnett's supplies. From here you may follow their path along the Old Trace to Grindstone Ford.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>What happened to the stands?</strong><br /> Travel on the Natchez Trace declined as travelers used steamboats more and more for transportation to and from market towns such as Natchez, MS and New Orleans. Many stand owners relocated to more active trade routes or closed their doors. For decades after, however, settlers relied on sections of the Natchez Trace for local travel. With the establishment of the Natchez Trace Parkway many of the stands live on only in our history.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional Information.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/war-of-1812-on-the-natchez-trace.htm\">War of 1812 on the Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.<br /> <br /> This site is not accessible to vehicles taller than 11 feet in height.",

This trail descends to Jackson Falls a beautifully sculptured cascade. This is one of two waterfalls along the Natchez Trace Parkway. The other waterfall is Fall Hollow located at milepost 391.9 near Hohenwald, Tennessee.<br /> <br /> Please do not climb on the falls it is very slick and dangerous and can lead to significant injuries.",

The bathrooms are in a round building made of red bricks. A pavilion is attached to the restroom building and under the pavilion is a picnic table.

The overlook features an exhibit that provides information about the natural history of the area, as well as the human history in the area. Towards the northern edge of the parking lot a trailhead can be found for the Little Mountain Trail.<br /> <br /> On February 15, 1934, while serving as U.S. Congressman from Mississippi, Thomas Jefferson Busby (1884-1964) introduced a bill authorizing a survey of the Old Natchez Trace. Four years later the historic road was designated a unit of the National Park System. This area is named in Jeff Busby's honor to commemorate his part in the Parkway's establishment.<br /> <br /> Little Mountain Trail is a 1/2-mile long nature trail that descends into a shady hollow. Visitors can easily complete the loop in around 30 minutes. However, the more time you allow, the more you will see and hear. A 1/2-mile long side trail from the loop leads to the campground.",
    "audioDescription": "A winding two lane road up the large hill leads to a paved parking lot that makes a 0.1-mile loop around the summit of the hill. To the west is a vast overlooking view of the Natchez Trace Parkway and the forested rolling hills that stretch out past it. In the southern corner of the loop is an informative sign that tells a brief history about Jeff Busby and why the area is named after him. At the southern most end of the parking lot is a dense forested area. On the western side of the loop is another vast scenic overlook of densely forested rolling hills as far as the eye can see. At the northern end of the loop near the entrance is a sign for the Little Mountain Trail. It describes the trail and how long it takes to complete it. The trailhead has two wooden guardrails and begins with a steep descent that is stepped by logs that were laid into the ground. In the center of the loop is a sheltered exhibit with bathrooms on the northern side of it. Underneath the shelter are signs with pictures of birds, cougars, bison, and other species that once roamed the area, as well as pictures depicting the American Indians that once lived in the area, the European settlers that later moved into the area, and some of the ways of life of these people. In the middle of the shelter exhibit are two picnic tables and the floor of the shelter is lined with glazed bricks in an interwoven pattern.",

    "bodyText": "Unlike the nations of today, American Indian tribes seldom recognized clear, exact boundaries to their lands. However, the Chickasaw and Choctaw Indians came to accept as a dividing line the stream that flowed through this valley. It remained the boundary until both tribes were forced to move to Oklahoma in the 1830's. Although the stream's course has been changed somewhat by a modern drainage canal, it is still called Line Creek.<br /> <br /> Near here, Noah Wall and his Choctaw wife had a stand where food and shelter were provided for travelers on the Natchez Trace.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "In frontier language, a stand was an inn or trading post--sometimes both--usually located on a well traveled route. Such a place was established on the Old Natchez Trace, near here, in 1849 by John McGlamery. Although the stand did not outlast the Civil War, the name did. The nearby village is still known as McGlamery Stand. This stand was established more than three decades after the height of travel on the Natchez Trace and was in operation for about 12 years before closing at the beginning of the Civil War.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately there are no remnants of McGlamery Stand visible at the site.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>Slavery along the Natchez Trace</strong><br /> Each decade from the 1820s through the Civil War, roughly 200,000 enslaved people were forcibly moved from the upper south to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Many of these roughly 1 million enslaved people traveled the Natchez Trace on foot. Many stands along the Natchez Trace were home to enslaved people; they worked for the profit of stand owners and served travelers. Mount Locust, Colbert Ferry, the Gordon House, and numerous other stands relied on the labor of enslaved people to prosper. Some plantation owners, including Turner Brashears of Brashears Stand, became wealthy as traders of enslaved people.<br /> <br /> <strong>What happened to the stands?</strong><br /> Travel on the Natchez Trace declined as travelers used steamboats more and more for transportation to and from market towns such as Natchez, MS and New Orleans. Many stand owners relocated to more active trade routes or closed their doors. For decades after, however, settlers relied on sections of the Natchez Trace for local travel. With the establishment of the Natchez Trace Parkway many of the stands live on only in our history.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https:///www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.",

    "bodyText": "Mount Locust is a location that has been settled on by many different people and under many different flags during its long history of human occupation that dates back as far back as 600 C.E. (Common Era), long before Europeans first stepped foot in the area. There is archeological evidence of two separate American Indian occupations on the site. The first was between 600 and 800 C.E during what is known as the Coles Creek culture and based on archeological findings it seems those who occupied the area lived in small, family-based groupings where they fished, hunted, and gathered, and made pottery much as their ancestors had in the past. The second occupation was a village site in a field southwest of the historic house that consisted of at least seven mostly circular structures that dated back to between 1000 to 1350 C.E during Plaquemine culture.<br /> <br /> Centuries later, John Blommart began what would become known as Mount Locust around 1780, but his stay was short. Blommart’s former business associate, William Ferguson, and his wife Paulina purchased Mount Locust in 1784 and built the Mount Locust historic house, which is now one of the oldest structures still standing in the area. William and Paulina owned and operated the farm until William’s death in 1801. A short time later Paulina married James Chamberlain, an overseer at Mount Locust, and they continued to build the growing plantation.<br /> <br /> Between 1785 and 1820, an increasing number of boatmen known as \"Kaintucks,\" were floating flatboats down the Mississippi River to sell their goods at the markets in Natchez and New Orleans. Without an efficient way to navigate back up the Mississippi River, the boatmen walked north on the Natchez Trace to make their way home. The growing number of travelers compelled the Fergusons to turn their home into a \"stand,\" which was nothing more than a crude inn. The family offered the boatmen a meal of corn mush and milk with meager sleeping arrangements on the porches and grounds. The boatmen paid just 25 cents for the much-needed food and accommodations the stand provided.<br /> <br /> After the invention of the cotton gin in the late 1700's, cotton became a popular cash crop in the South. Mount Locust was no exception as it was a thriving cotton plantation through the early to mid-1800's. During the, \"King Cotton\" era, a number of families were forced to endure the bondage of slavery and forced labor at Mount Locust. Archeologists believe 12 to 16 slave cabins once stood on the property, with four to five people occupying each dwelling. On the west side of Mount Locust, a cemetery holds the remains of 43 enslaved people.<br /> <br /> The end of the plantation system after the Civil War led to a slow decline at Mount Locust. Eventually the National Park Service took over the property in 1938, with the last of the Chamberlain leaving in 1944. Overall, Mount Locust was a home to the Ferguson-Chamberlain family for five generations.<br /> <br /> Visitors are encouraged to tour the grounds of Mount Locust. A short walk behind the house will take you to the enslaved person cemetery, the Ferguson-Chamberlain cemetery, and the brick kiln site, where slaves made the bricks to build parts of the Ferguson-Chamberlain home.",
    "audioDescription": "Walk through a breezeway between the visitor information center on your left and the bathrooms on your right. Take a left and walk down an asphalt path. Walk approximately 150 yards down that path towards a natural mound with the historic house on top. On your left and right are open fields peppered with various species of trees and wooden rail fences outlining the area. On your right are a set of twenty six brick steps leading you up to the house with handrails on both sides. The historic house is a four room structure with six wooden steps leading up to a front porch. The exterior is white with blue shudders and two brick chimneys. There is a brick path around the entire structure that takes you to the back porch.",

You can experience them all at this overlook that combines everything the Natchez Trace Parkway is about. <br /> <br /> Folks interested in nature and recreation can fish in the pond, watch turtles pile up and warm their shells in the sun, or imagine back more than 11,000 years ago and picture mastodons ambling to the creek.<br /> <br /> Walkers can stretch their legs on a short jaunt into the woods or down to Town Creek. Hikers can access the Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail and walk a little more than 2 miles south to the Chickasaw Village Site, or head northward for little less than two miles to the Beech Springs Trailhead. <br /> <br /> Over time, people have used this area in many ways. The human history of Old Town started with American Indians who settled here. The name Old Town was what the English called a large established Chickasaw village. <br /> <br /> Old Town was not always a peaceful bottomland. The 1914 DAR marker indicates that the Battle of Ackia took place near here, which is debatable, but we know that during the Civil War's Battle of Tupelo, on July 15, 1864, an intense battle was fought in the bottoms at the creek. <br /> <br /> Standing on the north side of the overlook, there are views of both natural and cultivated land protected by the Natchez Trace Parkway. The agricultural land is leased and planted with traditional crops to help conserve the rural beauty of the Parkway. ",
    "audioDescription": "The overlook road branches in two directions. From one side, the bottomland of Town Creek and part of the Belt Belt prairie can be seen from this overlook, along with agricultural land and the Parkway road. A trail passes by the site and a DAR marker from 1914 is prominent next to the interpretive sign. On the other branch of the road, there is a picnic table, and a pond situated between the overlook and the Parkway.",

Hoping to hold the frontier, Congress in 1800 established a post route from Nashville, Tennessee to Natchez, Mississippi.<br /> <br /> The Trace, then a series of American Indian trails, had drawn from the Secretary of State the bitter comment \"The passage of mail from Natchez is a tedious as from Europe when westerly winds prevail.\" To speed the mail, President Jefferson ordered the Army to clear out the trail and make it a road starting in 1803.<br /> <br /> Post Riders, carrying letters, dispatches, and newspapers, helped bind the vast, turbulent frontier to the Republic. However their day passed by the mid 1830s when steamboats, running from New Orleans, Louisiana to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, robbed the Trace of it usefulness as a main post road.",

Only the Natchez Trace, part of which remains here, made inroads into tribal territory.<br /> <br /> When the Chickasaw ceded the land to the United States in the early 1800s the Natchez Trace became a boundary. The land behind you became government property under the 1805 treaty. In 1816 the tribe ceded a much larger tract including the land in front of you.<br /> <br /> In 1837 the Chickasaw were removed from their homeland. Chickasaw Removal is the most traumatic chapter in Chickasaw history. As a result of Congress’ Indian Removal Act, the Chickasaw people were forced to remove to Indian Territory. The foresight and skilled negotiating practices of Chickasaw leaders led to favorable sales of Chickasaw lands in Mississippi. This allowed the Chickasaw Nation, unlike other tribes, to pay for our own removal.<br /> <br /> Chickasaw families were met with hardship and death along the Removal, traveling hundreds of miles in extreme cold and heat; however, Chickasaws suffered less than other tribes because they controlled their departures and chose favorable seasons to travel. This undoubtedly saved many lives that otherwise could have been lost.<br /> <br /> Other tribes removed to Indian Territory were the Cherokee, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole. The Chickasaws were one of the last to remove. In 1837, They signed the Treaty of Doaksville with the Choctaw Nation and purchased the right for the settlement of the Chickasaw people in their own district within Choctaw Territory. Most Chickasaws removed to Indian Territory from 1837-1851. However, Chickasaw families continued to arrive in Indian Territory up to the 1890s, as evidenced by Chickasaw tribal enrollment in the Dawes Rolls.<br /> <br /> As the Chickasaw began to move into their district, they discovered Plains Indian tribes roaming freely across the lands. These tribes still lived a migratory lifestyle and made frequent raids on Chickasaw homesteads. The Plains Indian tribes did not understand the United States removing other tribes onto their historic homeland. To fulfill the treaty promise to protect the removed Southeastern tribes, the federal government built Fort Washita and Fort Arbuckle to maintain peace between the various tribes. Chickasaws still desired their own separate territory to restore governmental authority for their people and separate affairs from the Choctaws. In 1856, the Chickasaws separated from the Choctaws and created their own constitution for their own separate lands.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/trail-of-tears-on-the-natchez-trace.htm\">Trail of Tears on the Natchez Trace Parkway </a>for additional information.",

Afterwards, with Choctaw permission, improvements to this section of the Old Trace began. In 1805, the Choctaw allowed inns, known as stands to be built along the route to provide basic food and shelter to travelers. By 1811, Noble Osburn opened a stand near this spot. He was known to treat equally his Choctaw neighbors and American travelers. In 1821 at <span style=\"color:null;\"><span name=\"_span_1\">LeFleur’s Bluff along the Pearl River, the city of Jackson was founded and a year later became the state capital. As a result, the postal route shifted slightly east from here to go through the new capital leading to the demise of the stands along this section of the Old Natchez Trace. <br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.</span></span><br /> <span name=\"_span_1\">S<span style=\"color:null;\">ee </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.</span>",

Recently, geologically speaking, these limestone ledges became exposed.<br /> <br /> Through the years, unknown and uncounted men have passed this ledge, ignorant of the wealth it held. Certainly, some of them needed the phosphate to revitalize their worn-out farms. <br /> <br /> About 1880, man learned the importance of phosphate as a fertilizer, discovered it here and began to mine it. <br /> <br /> From here north for approximately 40 miles the parkway passes through or near a geologic region of limestone rich in phosphate deposits. <br /> <br /> Abandoned mine shafts in limestone ledges on both sides of the Parkway in this immediate area are silent reminders of the past mining activity.<br /> <br /> A 5-minute walk starting at the right of the wooden sign leads to an abandoned railroad bed and a collapsed mineshaft in a limestone outcrop. ",

    "bodyText": "Pigeon Roost Creek is a reminder of the millions of migrating passenger pigeons that once roosted in trees in this area. The species has been completely destroyed.<br /> <br /> One mile east where the Natchez Trace crossed the creek, Nathaniel Folsom of New England and his Choctaw wife had a trading post before 1790. Their son, David, later operated it and accommodated travelers. When the Reverend Thomas Nixon stopped there in 1815, David's wife \"prepared suitable nourishment... and would have no pay.\" <br /> <br /> David Folsom, strong supporter of Christianity and American Indian education, was elected chief of the Northeast District of the Choctaw Nation in 1826.<br /> <br /> <strong>Why were the stands along the Natchez Trace?</strong><br /> The need for stands appeared when the US government wanted to improve the Natchez Trace into a post road to deliver mail from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> <strong>Slavery along the Natchez Trace</strong><br /> Each decade from the 1820s through the Civil War, roughly 200,000 enslaved people were forcibly moved from the upper south to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Many of these roughly 1 million enslaved people traveled the Natchez Trace on foot. Many stands along the Natchez Trace were home to enslaved people; they worked for the profit of stand owners and served travelers. Mount Locust, Colbert Ferry, the Gordon House, and numerous other stands relied on the labor of enslaved people to prosper. Some plantation owners, including Turner Brashears of Brashears Stand, became wealthy as traders of enslaved people.<br /> <br /> <strong>What happened to the stands?</strong><br /> Travel on the Natchez Trace declined as travelers used steamboats more and more for transportation to and from market towns such as Natchez, MS and New Orleans. Many stand owners relocated to more active trade routes or closed their doors. For decades after, however, settlers relied on sections of the Natchez Trace for local travel. With the establishment of the Natchez Trace Parkway many of the stands live on only in our history.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.<br />  ",

    "bodyText": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(70, 70, 70); font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;\">River Bend is a popular spot for picnics where you can enjoy scenic views of the Pearl River as it slows its flow and becomes the Ross Barnett Reservoir. Alligators can sometimes be seen in the water. Herons, egrets, and other water birds are common here. It's also a great spot for fishing.<br /> <br /> The Pearl River, named after French Explorer Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d’Iberville, for the many native plants that he found here, is the focus of this scenic area. The river marks a boundary between Mississippi and Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The Pearl River is a river in the U.S. states of Mississippi and Louisiana. It forms in Winston County, Mississippi from the confluence of Nanawaya and Tallahaga Creeks. It is 490 mi long. The Yockanookany and Strong Rivers are tributaries. Northeast of Jackson, the Ross Barnett Reservoir is formed by a dam.<br /> West of Picayune, MS, about 50 mi above the mouth, the river forks. The East Pearl River empties into Lake Borgne where the dredged Pearl River Channel meets the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The discharge flows eastward past Grand Island through St. Joe Pass and into the Mississippi Sound. The West Pearl River, on the other hand, flows into The Rigolets, then into Lake Borgne. Both discharges eventually reach the Gulf of Mexico.<br /> The Pearl River serves as the 116-mi boundary between Mississippi and Louisiana, in its lower reach near the Gulf of Mexico.<br /> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has undertaken three significant navigation projects in the Pearl River Basin. In 1880, Congress authorized a 5 ft navigation channel on the West Pearl River from Jackson to the Rigolets. That project was discontinued in 1922. Beginning in 1910, a channel was dredged from the mouth of the East Pearl River into Lake Borgne, a project which is maintained on an irregular basis. In 1935, the West Pearl River Navigation Project was authorized. It provided for a navigation channel from Bogalusa to the mouth of the West Pearl River. The project includes a canal with three locks. The Corps of Engineers placed the project in \"caretaker\" status in the 1970s because of a decline in commercial traffic. Maintenance dredging resumed in December 1988.<br /> In the 1950s, underwater concrete sills were constructed to help maintain water levels in the navigation channel. This has prevented Gulf sturgeon and other migratory species from accessing upstream areas. A rock ramp constructed in 2003 helps fish navigate over one of the sills, but environmental groups propose further work to mitigate the effects of the navigation project.<br /> Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 caused extensive damage in the Pearl River. Bottom sediments and marsh vegetation—including uprooted cypress and oak trees—blocked the mouth of the West Pearl and other parts of the channel, preventing navigation and diverting flow. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife & Fisheries and other agencies removed 27,000 cubic meters of debris.</span><br />  </p>",

Settlement of the area began in the late 1790's and continued until about 1860, reaching a peak of approximately 2600 people. Several businesses were established at different times, among them carpenters, wheelwrights, a well digger, cabinet makers, a cotton gin maker and blacksmiths. By the mid-1800's there was also a church, post office, a Masonic Lodge, and possibly a school.<br /> <br /> During the four years that the Civil War raged, many areas in both the North and the South would experience its devastation. A letter written in 1863 stated, \"My slaves, horses, and mules are carried off, my fences torn dowand my crops destroyed...\" <br /> <br /> In the summer fall of 1878, yellow fever struck the area. Pastor J.W. Sandwell on November 18, 1873, wrote that there were 180 yellow fever cases and 43 deaths. Although Rocky Springs tried to recover after the yellow fever epidemic, in the early 1900's boll weevil struck, a beetle that feeds on cotton buds and flowers, devastating the cotton crop. After this final disaster, the population declined rapidly and the last store in the area closed its doors during the 1930's.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the nearby spring no longer flows and today only the church and cemetery, two rustling safes and several abandoned cisterns remain of this once prosperous rural community.",

In 1800 most of the Natchez Trace ran through Choctaw and Chickasaw lands. A limited number of homesteads offered provisions on Chickasaw land.<br /> <br /> As trade and travel increased down the Mississippi River so did stands along the Natchez Trace. Many of these stands were owned by frontiersmen and their American Indian wives. While the United States did not recognize women’s rights to own land many American Indian nations-including the Chickasaw and Choctaw-did. Tribes preferred to manage their own businesses on tribal land. During this time stands generally bore the last name of the owners: Brashears Stand, for example.<br /> <br /> <strong>What were the stands like?</strong><br /> The stands along the Natchez Trace varied widely in size and services offered. Many stands offered very basic food along with meager accommodations. Advertisements by stand owners in Natchez newspapers focused on the travelers’ diet along the Natchez Trace. The highlights included ground coffee, sugar, biscuits, bacon, and whiskey. Corn was a staple served to Natchez Trace travelers. It usually took the form of hominy, a dish prepared by soaking the corn in lye. Lucky travelers would have the option to sleep on a crude bed, but a cleared spot on the floor was what they expected. Due to cramped and dirty conditions inside the stands, many travelers chose to sleep outside on the porch or yard under the stars.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natr/learn/historyculture/historic-stands-along-the-old-natchez-trace.htm\">Historic Stands along the Old Natchez Trace</a> for additional information.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/trail-of-tears-benge-route-on-the-natchez-trace.htm\">Benge Detachment</a> of Cherokee people on the Trail of Tears passed this location on an unimproved path into Hickman County Tennessee in late 1838.

    "bodyText": "Sweetwater Branch is a place where you can connect with nature. The trail is 2500 feet up and back. <br /> <br /> The terrain along the northern Parkway differs from that further south. Here, the land is rocky. Erosion is at work. The combined efforts of the stream, rain, and plants form a powerful force. Bedrock is being reduced to boulders, and boulders to stone, gravel, and sand. The eroded bedrock is then washed downstream.In the flatlands along most of the Parkway, sediments carried downstream settle out and come to rest, forming a soft, silty bottom. But a glance at the rocky streambed of Sweetwater Branch provides a vivid lesson in erosive power and undercuts the notion of “solid rock.”<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">What to look for:</span> <ul> <li>Interactions between plants, water, and rock</li> <li>Plants breaking down rocks</li> <li>The effects of erosion by water</li> <li>Running water gradually wears away small particles of rock, shrinking and smoothing the larger rock left behind.</li> <li>Rock being reduced to progressively smaller particle sizes</li> <li>When combined with organic matter, the smallest rock eventually become soil.</li> </ul> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Where Rock and Water Meet</span><br /> The interplay of rock and water shapes the landscape around you. Close your eyes. Listen. Sniff the air. Even without seeing, you can tell this place differs from others along the Parkway. The difference is rock – exposed beds of limestone and sandstone that effect how the forest looks, sounds, even smells. In the flatlands further south, you do not hear the rush and splash of a cascading stream that breaks down the rock. The rushing creek rounds off edges, tumbles boulders downstream, erodes them down to stone, gravel, sand-grain sized, and eventually to soil. While areas to the south have been shaped by deposited material, this area is being shaped by erosion.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Silent Stonemasons</span><br /> Working their way into cracks and crevices, roots help break down the rocky terrain. A plant can be an irresistible force. Roots from trees or walking ferns probe into cracks or fractures in the rock. In time as they grow, they wedge rocks apart or cause pieces to break off. Aided by the repeated freezing and thawing of water, the slow, silent, relentless power of growth can reduce rock to rubble.<br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#c0392b;\">Rock Today, Soil Tomorrow</span><br /> Rock breaks down into soil, and the kind of soil it forms affects what grows. Soil consists of tiny particles of rock mixed with decaying matter from plants and animals. Different kinds of rock form different kinds of soil.The soil found here results largely from the breakdown of limestone, which has alkaline properties, like baking soda. Alkaline soil reacts chemically with acid from rain and neutralizes it. Hardwood trees (rather than pines) favor this kind of soil, so the rock helps determine what kinds of plants grow here.",

    "audioDescription": "This fourth exhibit in a series of four is titled “Journey of Injustice,” and contains an illustration that depicts the overland journey of the Cherokee from their eastern homeland to Indian Territory. A map shows several routes taken by the Cherokee during the Trail of Tears, but highlights the Bell Route. There are three other exhibits to your left. [Text] In 1835, a small group of Cherokee signed the controversial Treaty of New Echota, leading to the removal of over 15,000 Cherokee from their homelands. A sense of indescribable sadness and foreboding hovered over the Cherokee people as they were removed from their cherished homelands. Due to the raw emotions, illness, and death along the way, the journey became known as the Trail of Tears. Years in the making, the tragic journey began in October 1838. Both state and federal officials wanted the Cherokee removed to the west. The panel shows men, women and children wrapped in long coats and blankets traveling via covered wagon, horseback, but mostly on foot across a barren winter field. A man and woman kneel on the ground next to a baby wrapped in a red blanket. The woman is bent over, her head near the ground, her straw hat next to her. The man removes his hat and reaches toward the deceased infant. Other Cherokee gather round—two men on horseback and a half dozen others watch the kneeling couple. Two women—one an African American—and a child walk away. The Cherokee woman looks down toward the child whose face is sad. Others in the background huddle around fires and wagons covered in canvas. The Cherokee’s clothing varies from simple and unadorned to decorative and multi-colored. A Cherokee man in the foreground looks straight at the viewer. He wears a dark blue turban with red pattern and trim. His hunting frock is blue with pale fringe. He has several silver loop earrings in each ear and a silver nose ring. His lips are pursed, his brow furrowed, his eyes glaring. The panel map highlights the route from Tennessee to Oklahoma followed by John Bell and a group of over 600, including treaty supporters. It shows where Bell crossed the Natchez Trace. The highway near here is the actual Bell Route on the Trail of Tears. Other groups of Cherokee followed different routes over land and water. The Water Route and Benge, Bell, Drane, and Deas-Whiteley routes are marked on the map. All of the panels in this shelter have a black band across the top. The band contains the National Park Service arrowhead on the right and the words National Park Service and U.S. Department of the Interior. On the left, the band contains the words Natchez Trace Parkway.",

    "audioDescription": "This exhibit, titled “The Trail Where They Cried,” contains an illustration that depicts the overland journey of Cherokee from their eastern homeland to Indian Territory. A map shows several routes followed by the Cherokee. You are standing at the corner of the parking area looking into a grove of trees toward the Cherokee removal route. The Parkway is to your left. [Text] In 1838, the Cherokee living in the Southeast faced the combined weight of hostile federal and state policies. Forcible removal from their traditional homeland became a fearful, tearful reality. In the aftermath of hardships suffered by Cherokee who had already traveled west, tribal leaders managed their own removal plans. The illustration shows men, women and children wrapped in long coats and blankets traveling via covered wagon, horseback, but mostly on foot across a barren winter field. A man and woman kneel on the ground next to a baby wrapped in a red blanket. The woman is bent over, her head near the ground, her straw hat next to her. The man removes his hat and reaches toward the deceased infant. Other Cherokee gather round—two men on horseback and a half dozen others watch the kneeing couple. Dozens of others in the background huddle around fires and wagons covered in canvas. Four women—one an African American—and a child walk away. One woman is dressed in a long hooded cape over a bonnet with ribbon tied under her chin. An ornamented bag with shoulder strap hangs on her hip. She looks down toward the child whose face is sad. The African American woman carries a large bundle against her chest, her apron is tattered and mud spattered. The two other Cherokee women carry large baskets. Two mounted soldiers watch from the left side of the painting. On the right there is a covered wagon pulled by oxen—their backbones and ribs are clearly visible. A man wearing a slouch hat, a sash with a black, red, and blue geometric design, and an ornamental belt walks ahead of the wagon. A Cherokee man in the foreground looks straight at the viewer. He wears a dark blue turban with red pattern and trim. His hunting frock is blue with pale fringe. He has several silver loop earrings in each ear and a silver nose ring. His lips are pursed, his brow furrowed, his eyes glaring. The panel map shows the routes, over both land and water, taken by Cherokee groups during Indian removal. John Benge led one detachment of about 1,100 fellow Cherokee across the Natchez Trace near here. On September 29, 1838, John Benge and George Lowrey reported conditions among the Cherokee in their group: “ ... [M]any of them, say at least two thirds are in a destitute condition and in want of shoes, clothing and blankets.” The exhibit panel has a black band across the top. The band contains the National Park Service arrowhead on the right and the words National Park Service and U.S. Department of the Interior. On the left, the band contains the words Natchez Trace Parkway. There is one other exhibit panel with information about this site 15 feet behind you along the walk adjacent to parking.",

Use your imagination to replace some of the fields with forests and swamps. Imagine what it would be like to traverse the area in 1812, on a horse. It sounds like the reverend had a soggy time.<br /> <br /> Water was always a critical survival factor for early travelers. In the west, it was frequently lack of water. In the southeast, it was sometimes too much water. This area averages about 55 inches of rain per year, but yearly totals of rainforest proportion, over 80 inches, have been recorded.<br /> <br /> Take a moment and contemplate being exposed to so much water during all seasons of the year, over weeks or months with no indoor shelter. This was the plight of early travelers on the Old Trace. <br /> <br /> Please note that this is not a circular drive and large RVs will have trouble negotiating the parking area. ",

    "audioDescription": "This pull off is located on the west side of the Natchez Trace Parkway. There is a paved parking lot with space for 4 or 5 cars. Near the parking lot there is two interpretative wayside exhibits. One wayside exhibit is about Choctaw Indian removal and has audio so you can hear from modern Choctaw people. This exhibit, titled “Broken Promises,” features an illustration of a group of Choctaw walking in the snow, away from their Eastern homeland. A map shows the lands ceded by treaties, and a photograph of a commemoration of Choctaw removal. The route the Choctaw took is in the distance, beyond the panel. The landscape is now mixed forest and fields. [Text] After 1800, treaties between the Choctaw and the US government whittled away tribal rights and lands. Finally, in 1830, the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was negotiated at a council house near this spot. All the remaining Choctaw homeland— nearly 10.5 million acres—was taken. From 1831 through 1834, thousands of Choctaw trekked over 500 miles to “Indian Territory.” The US War Department had promised in 1830 to “be kind and brotherly to them…to furnish them with ample corn and beef, or pork for themselves and their families.” Instead, the Choctaw had inadequate clothing and supplies. Heavy rain, blizzard-like snowfall, and a shortage of wagons turned the forced removal deadly. On the map, Choctaw land is flanked by the Mississippi River on the west and extends into portions of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Natchez Trace runs northeast to southwest across the Choctaw homeland to the port of Natchez on the Mississippi River. Treaties in 1801, 1802, 1805, 1816, and 1820 took two thirds of the Choctaw homeland. The 1830 Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek took the remainder. You are standing along the Natchez Trace in the Choctaw’s land ceded in 1820. [Text] Choctaw artist Gwen Coleman Lester captures the harsh conditions and tribal determination to survive at the core of Choctaw removal. In her painting, the Choctaw, most staring ahead, walk forward on snow-covered ground. They are wrapped in blankets, and wear moccasins. Leafless trees surround them. A man in front uses a walking stick. To the left of the man, a child carries a bundle on its back. To the right, a woman with down turned eyes holds a baby in a blanket. Two uniformed soldiers on horseback watch the Choctaw pass by. The group stretches across a creek in the distance. At the back, livestock pull wagons. A photo shows a uniformed honor guard leading a crowd down a paved road. The honor guards wear red berets. Two carry flags and two have shouldered rifles. The day is bright and sunny. The trees are in full leaf. [Text] Tribal members from the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma walk each year to memorialize their ancestors who survived and perished on the Trail of Tears. The exhibit panel has a black band across the top. The band contains the National Park Service arrowhead on the right and the words National Park Service and U.S. Department of the Interior. On the left, the band contains the words Natchez Trace Parkway. Several yards to your right, there is a group of three, routed wood signs with more information about the Choctaw homeland and treaties.",

    "bodyText": "The Treaty of Paris concluded the struggle for land in the New World between France and Britain, known as the French and Indian War. As a term of the treaty, Great Britain received most of the formally French territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. France also ceded West Louisiana to its ally Spain in compensation for western Florida, which Spain yielded to Great Britain. Britain, in turn, created West Florida. In 1764, this spot was the northern boundary of West Florida, marked by a line from the Yazoo and Mississippi Rivers’ confluence east to the Chattahoochee River. <br /> <br /> The West Florida Boundary Trailhead is the southern terminus of the Yockanookany Section of the Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail. This parking area and trailhead is for hikers only. Hikers may chose to walk a short loop on the nature trail or continue for 26 miles to the northern terminus of this section at the Yockanookany Trailhead.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yockanookanysection.htm\">Hiking the Yockanookany Section of the Nathez Trace National Scenic Trail</a> for additional information.<br /> <br /> See <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/natt/planyourvisit/conditions.htm\">Alerts & Conditions </a>for additional information.",

The site features amenities such as bathrooms, picnic tables, and access to miles and miles of hiking and horseback riding trails through the Tombigbee National Forest. <br /> <br /> Local folklore tells of witch craft and rituals that possibly took place in this area. Legend has it that the places their feet touched in their ceremonies caused the grass to wither away and never grow again. <br /> <br /> While these stories are simply local legends and folklore passed down through generations, keep a lookout as you explore the area. Who knows, you may come across some areas of bare ground! <br /> <br /> Witch Dance has two shaded picnic areas, one at the horse trailer parking (5 tables-shown in photo), and another upper picnic area 150 yards past the horse trailer parking where horses are not allowed. The upper picnic area has nine tables and grills, including an accessible picnic spot, spread around a shady 250-yard paved loop with parking for cars and RVs. <br /> <br /> The two trailheads near the horsetrail picnic area enter Tombigbee National Forest and lead to a horse camp and the fifteen miles of loops and cross-over trails maintained by US Forest Service. The trails are not accessible. ",
    "audioDescription": "In the southwestern end of the Parking lot is a trailhead that has bulletin board for the National Forest Service. The trail goes over a wooden bridge about three and a half feet wide and close to 10 feet long that lead onto the National Forest Service's horse/hiking trails through the Tombigbee National Forest. A small open field is adjacent to the trailhead to the south. Another trail runs from the southwestern portion of the parking lot to the north. This trail leads to several picnic tables with forest on either side of them. The trail continues on to loop back to the northern part of the parking lot. At the center of the parking lot to the east is a brown restroom facility that has light posts outside of it. The entrance to the restrooms is facing west and in between the entrances is a bulletin board for the National Park Service where map brochures can be obtained. To the south of the restrooms is a stairway leading up to a parking lot on the eastern side of the restrooms, and on the southern side of the staircase is a large sign telling of the folklore of Witch Dance. The parking lot that the stairs lead up to is the second exit that can be taken for Witch Dance. The parking lot is a paved pull through parking lot that loop through behind the restroom facility.",

The redoubt was the only Third System fort that did not defend the coast. View the exhibits on the south side of the redoubt and then walk along the Trench Trail-or drive-to Fort Barrancas",

Those platforms face to the west across the entrance to Pensacola Bay.From the landing on the steps there is a short tunnel going through the side of the hill providing access to the interior of the battery.End of Description.",

A number of safety signs flank the entrance to the boardwalk.One sign announces no lifeguard on duty.A sign beneath it instructs swimmers to avoid rip currents. If a swimmer is caught in a rip current, the sign advises the swimmer to swim crossways to the current, parallel to the shore.Two larger interpretive and orientation panels provide in-depth narrative.Interpretive panel: Life on a Barrier Island.Text at the top of this slanted graphic panel reads, \"As you cross this barrier island, notice differences in elevation and how the vegetation and wildlife change. Between the gulf and sound, the island consists of four major habitats: beach, dunes, woodlands, and salt marshes. Some animals, like raccoons and foxes, may be seen in more than one habitat. Stay on Path. Constantly reshaped by waves, currents, winds, and sands, these barrier island habitats are extremely fragile.\"Across the middle of the panel is a row of four photographs showing the different habitats. Beginning at the left, the first shows a white sandy beach, one small tuft of sea oats in the foreground and dark blue water visible in the back ground. The caption reads, \"Waves and prevailing winds build the beach, providing nesting sites for sea turtles and shorebirds, which feed on crabs and clams.\"The next picture shows low rolling sand dunes with scattered grasses and a few shrubs. The caption reads, \"Sea oats take root, helping to form and stabilize primary dunes. Rainwater collects in swales, providing moisture for wildflowers. Here you may see beach mice, red-winged blackbirds, and butterflies.\"The third picture shows higher dunes with lots of vegetation and some small trees. The caption reads, \"Shrubs and trees colonize old, secondary dunes, creating woodlands. Look for hawks, woodpeckers, buntings, snakes, and salamanders.\"The last picture shows a view across flat ground covered with thick grasses and with scattered tall tree trunks. The caption reads, \"Salt marshes form in the brackish waters on the island's north side, attracting herons, kingfishers, and clapper rails.\"Across the bottom of the panel are six photographs showing various animals to be found on the island. Beginning at the left the first shows two ghost crabs with pale bodies and back eyes. The next shows a green darner insect clinging to a reed. It has long narrow transparent wings and a very long thin tail colored turquoise-blue with black specks. The next picture shows a beach mouse, a small rodent nestled in a shallow hole in the sand. It is brown with a white face and throat.The fourth picture shows a green tree frog perched on a leaf. It is bright green with white and black stripes down its side. Next is a belted kingfisher. The long-billed bird sits on a small branch. Its head with its crest is gray as is its back. It has a white band around its throat and brown and rust-colored marking on its breast. The last picture shows a racoon with its gray body and black mask around its eyes. It stands half submerged amid grasses at water's edge.Orientation panel: Beach Safety.This panel is 2 feet wide and three feet tall and has text in both English and Spanish. Text at the top reads, \"In just a few minutes a wonderful day at the beach can turn into a disaster. Stay alert for sudden storms and marine life that could sting or bite. Watch your children. In emergencies, dial 911.\"At the bottom is a photograph with labels showing the smooth water of a rip current as it flows away from shore between two sandbars covered by white frothy waves. On the far side arrows point sideways in both directions with a label reading \"Swim to the side.\" Text below the picture reads, \"Rip Currents Kill. Rip currents commonly form after storms. If you are caught in a rip current, stay calm. Do not try to swim against the current. Swim right or left to escape the flow.\"Down the left side of the panel are specific warnings, each with a small photograph as illustration. Text reads, \"Avoid overexposure to the sun, especially between 10 am and 2 pm. Use sunscreen, sunglasses, hats, and long sleeves to protect skin. Drink plenty of water to help prevent dehydration.\" (Picture of the sun.)\"Thunderstorms develop quickly. If swimming or fishing, get out of the water immediately and seek shelter.\" (Picture of lightning.)\"Jellyfish and sea nettles can inflict painful stings. To reduce pain apply vinegar and do not touch.\" (Picture of a jellyfish.)\"Sharks are present in park waters. Do not swim at dawn, dusk, or night. Avoid schools of fish.\" (Picture of a shark.)\"Be aware of stingrays. Shuffle your feet while wading. Avoid grass beds and murky water. Soak puncture wounds in hot water.\" (Picture of a stingray.)",

    "audioDescription": "876 wordsOnly a stretch of bare white sand lies between the parking area and the beach. A few short lengths of post and rope direct the approach to the beach. A wood structure at the edge of the parking lot contains two interpretive panels. Interpretive panel: Share the Shore.This panel is 2 feet wide and three feet tall. Across the top of the panel is a photograph of the shoreline of a beach, sand on the right and water on the left. Several people of all ages sit and stand near a low rocky point of land farther up the beach. Across the bottom of the panel is a photograph of a green sea turtle with its large shell moving across the sand towards the water in the background.Text at the top of the panel reads, \"While you are here, keep in mind that you are sharing the shore with birds, turtles, and small mammals. Some of them are threatened or endangered species. Do not disturb the animals or their nests, burrows, eggs, or young. Stay out of protected areas. Use boardwalks to protect fragile dunes and habitats. Wildlife can choke on or become entangled in litter, so please carry out what you carry in and remove any debris you find on the beach.\"Below the text is a row of three smaller photographs. At left, the first one shows a black skimmer, a seabird with black back and white belly standing at the water's edge. It has a long orange and black bill and orange legs. The middle picture shows a ghost crab perched on the sand, all white except for its button-like black eyes. The third picture shows a Perdido Key beach mouse, a tiny brown rodent with a white face sitting in a sandy depression underneath grasses.Below the photographs more text reads, \"A Wildlife Habitat. Least terns, snowy plovers, and black skimmers make nests in the sand. Stay out of protected areas. Kemp's Ridley, loggerhead, green, and leatherback sea turtles crawl ashore and lay eggs in the sand. About 60 days later the hatchlings emerge and make their way to the sea. Biologists and trained volunteers mark nests of endangered and/or threatened sea turtles to monitor and protect nests from predators. The Perdido Key beach mouse is nocturnal and feeds on seeds of sea oats and beach grass. This small mouse is threatened with extinction because of diminishing coastal habitat. The National Park Service provides boardwalks for beach access and to protect the dunes. Untrampled, plants thrive and stabilize the dunes.\"To the right of the text is a small photograph showing a sea turtle tangled in a net. The caption reads, \"Marine Debris Kills. Many animals including birds and turtles die when they become entangled in nets and fishing lines or ingest plastic trash.\"Orientation panel: Beach Safety.This panel is 2 feet wide and three feet tall and has text in both English and Spanish. Text at the top reads, \"In just a few minutes a wonderful day at the beach can turn into a disaster. Stay alert for sudden storms and marine life that could sting or bite. Watch your children. In emergencies, dial 911.\"At the bottom is a photograph with labels showing the smooth water of a rip current as it flows away from shore between two sandbars covered by white frothy waves. On the far side arrows point sideways in both directions with a label reading \"Swim to the side.\" Text below the picture reads, \"Rip Currents Kill. Rip currents commonly form after storms.

Some tufts of sea grasses dot the edge of the parking area and some dunes in the distance. Three interpretive panels stand in wood frames at the edge of the parking lot.<br /><br />Interpretive panel: Santa Rosa Area.<br /><br />This panel is 2 feet wide and three feet tall. Across the top is a photograph of low white sand dunes with tufts of dune grass. The bottom of the panel has a map of the section of Santa Rosa Island that includes the park. Symbols mark the locations of parking and of the facilities at Opal Beach near the middle of the park's section. Text at upper left reads, <br /><br />\"This section of Gulf Islands National Seashore encompasses a day-use area of Santa Rosa Island. Here you may enjoy wildlife and other natural features of this coastal peninsula. Hike on the Florida National Scenic Trail or bike on the multi-use trail. Swim, fish, and do some beachcombing. Facilities at Opal Beach are basic: picnic shelter, restrooms, and outdoor showers. Avoid walking on the fragile sand dunes and remain outside of nesting area closures.\"<br /><br />Interpretive panel: Share the Shore.<br /><br />This panel is 2 feet wide and three feet tall. Across the top of the panel is a photograph of the shoreline of a beach, sand on the right and water on the left. Several people of all ages sit and stand near a low rocky point of land farther up the beach. <br /><br />Across the bottom of the panel is a photograph of a green sea turtle with its large shell moving across the sand towards the water in the background.<br /><br />Text at the top of the panel reads, <br /><br />\"While you are here, keep in mind that you are sharing the shore with birds, turtles, and small mammals. Some of them are threatened or endangered species. Do not disturb the animals or their nests, burrows, eggs, or young. Stay out of protected areas.

Wildlife can choke on or become entangled in litter, so please carry out what you carry in and remove any debris you find on the beach.\"<br /><br />Below the text is a row of three smaller photographs. At left, the first one shows a black skimmer, a seabird with black back and white belly standing at the water's edge. It has a long orange and black bill and orange legs. The middle picture shows a ghost crab perched on the sand, all white except for its button-like black eyes. The third picture shows a Perdido Key beach mouse, a tiny brown rodent with a white face sitting in a sandy depression underneath grasses.<br /><br />Below the photographs more text reads, <br /><br />\"A Wildlife Habitat. Least terns, snowy plovers, and black skimmers make nests in the sand. Stay out of protected areas. Kemp's Ridley, loggerhead, green, and leatherback sea turtles crawl ashore and lay eggs in the sand. About 60 days later the hatchlings emerge and make their way to the sea. Biologists and trained volunteers mark nests of endangered and/or threatened sea turtles to monitor and protect nests from predators. The Perdido Key beach mouse is nocturnal and feeds on seeds of sea oats and beach grass. This small mouse is threatened with extinction because of diminishing coastal habitat. The National Park Service provides boardwalks for beach access and to protect the dunes. Untrampled, plants thrive and stabilize the dunes.\"<br /><br />To the right of the text is a small photograph showing a sea turtle tangled in a net.

These wooden buildings were built between 1900 and 1910 to support the Coast Artillery Corps whose job was coastal defense. This building was used at different times as a guardhouse with quarters for three sergeants, a mess and kitchen, and lastly as an administration building for the 13th Coast Artillery in 1945.<br /><br />The U.S. military used this end of Santa Rosa Island for over 100 years. Fort Pickens, the first of four forts built to protect Pensacola Bay, has an unusual history. Union forces still held the fort during the Civil War in the 1860s even though Florida was a Confederate state. Because artillery technology changed, the U.S. Army later made big changes to Fort Pickens and built reinforced concrete batteries on the island starting in 1894.",

Tour the fort and learn about its role as a Union stronghold during the Civil War in the 1860s, then tour a series of fortifications that protected Pensacola Bay from the 1890s to the 1940s.

Fort Pickens sits on the western end of Santa Rosa Key where the boundary of the National Seashore stretches back east almost to the bridge leading to Gulf Breeze. Just east of Gulf Breeze is the Naval Live Oaks Area. <br /><br />Just below is a larger map showing the Fort Pickens Area with more details. Fort Pickens Road extends down the center of the island then makes a loop around the island's end just west of Fort Pickens.

Crews planted trees in eroded areas and built roads, picnic grounds, cabins, piers, and other structures. These CCC facilities became the nucleus of Magnolia State Park, which was incorporated into the national seashore when it was established in 1971. Seafood specialties right out of the golf can be had for the asking at District E’s only “seashore” camp, a few yards from the Gulf of Mexico, near Ocean Springs, Mississippi.” The sign also has three images.

In the back ground lies a forest.<br /><br />Below the picture on the left text reads, <br /><br />\"The salt water of the Gulf of Mexico mixes here in the Davis Bayou Area with fresh water from the mainland to create a rich estuary teeming with wildlife. Walk the trails, camp, and explore the bayous and salt marshes, which serve as nurseries for crabs, fish, and other marine life. See the film and exhibits in the visitor center. Fish from the pier, paddle around a bayou, or camp here in the 52-site campground. Plan your visit to Fort Massachusetts on Ship Island, or one of other the barrier islands off the coast.\"<br /><br />The middle of the panel features a map of the Davis Bayou Area. Several smaller waterways join to form the wide estuary. The park wraps around the main bayou on the eastern and northern sides with the visitor center in the lower south east part. From there roads go north, then west, crossing some of the waterways, to the campground. From there the road goes north again passing picnic areas in the northwest part of the park. From the main part of the park the park road turns back to the east then heads north, crossing railroad tracks to connect with Highway 90 at the park entrance. Park land extends in a narrow corridor along this route.<br /><br />At the bottom of the panel are two smaller photographs. The one on the left shows an Asian-American woman and a small child looking out over the grasses of a marsh along the Davis Bayou Trail. To the right is a picture of a man in a kayak drifting on the water as he holds his paddle across his lap, marsh grasses in the background. Text at the lower right reads, <br /><br />\"A Few Precautions. Be alert for sudden storms. Be aware of uneven and slippery surfaces. Watch children closely. <br /> <br />\"Park Restrictions. Do not disturb or remove any natural, historical, or archeological objects. Do not feed wildlife. Metal detectors are prohibited.\"<br /><br />Gulf Islands National Seashore. 417 words.<br /><br />This panel is four feet wide and three feet tall. Across the middle is a map showing the various areas of the park. The map includes most of the Mississippi coastline, the Alabama coastline and the westernmost part of the Florida panhandle. Areas included in the park are outlined in green - several off-shore islands near Biloxi, Mississippi and other islands off the Florida coast from Perdido Key in the west to Okaloosa at the eastern end. Park areas on the mainland include Davis Bayou near Biloxi, Fort Barrancas in Pensacola and Naval Live Oaks south of Pensacola.<br /><br />Text on the panel is in both English and Spanish. At the top text reads, <br /><br />\"This national seashore protects our historical heritage and ever-changing features of the Gulf Coast-salt marshes, marine woodlands, sparkling white beaches, and coastal waters. Walk the trails, photograph seashore plants and wildlife, swim and boat in the emerald green waters, learn the stories of early inhabitants, or just relax and enjoy the solitude.\"<br /><br />To the right of the text is a photograph of a white sandy beach stretching into the distance, wispy dune grass on the right and water at upper left.<br /><br />Text below the map reads, <br /><br /> Gulf Islands National Seashore includes several islands and portions of the mainland. Here you can boat, fish, and swim in the gulf waters. On land the national seashore provides campgrounds, primitive camping areas, and trails that pass through dunes, woodlands, and marshes-habitats of a variety of mammals, reptiles, and birds. For information, exhibits, and bookstores, stop at the visitor centers.\"<br /><br />Across the bottom of the panel are five photographs. Beginning at the left, the first one shows an alligator stretched out on a log in bright sunshine. The label reads, \"Wildlife.\" <br /><br />The next picture shows a group of people looking out over a grassy area surrounded by red brick walls. The back wall has large arched openings into dark spaces behind. In the middle are three uniformed men standing with rifles at their sides. At the right is a man dressed in a park uniform. The label reads, \"Tours.\"<br /><br />The middle photograph shows crooked live oak tree branches dripping with long Spanish moss. The label reads, \"Nature.\"<br /><br />The fourth picture shows three children in swim suits splashing in shallow water. The label reads, \"Recreation.\"<br /><br />The last picture shows a view down a structure made of a series of rounded arches, light coming from openings on the left. The label reads, \"History.\"<br /><br />End of Description.",

Halfway along the walk it bends slightly to the right. In the corner there is a bench. At the end there is a six-sided covered pavilion about 25 feet wide with benches along the railings. The pier extends out to the left from the pavilion, paralleling the bank for another 75 feet. There the pier connects to a maintenance area with boat slips and small maintenance buildings. This area is closed off by chain link fencing.From the pavilion looking west, which is to the right as you stand with your back to the shore, the tall buildings of Biloxi are visible in the distance. Closer along the shore is the entrance into the bayou. The shore is lined with marsh grasses and reeds with small shrubs behind and then the woods.<br />End of Description.",

The woods on either side are a mix of tall pine trees and smaller deciduous trees. The undergrowth is fairly thick with smaller trees and shrubs. From here, the trail goes straight into the woods and then curves to the left.<br /><br />The parking lot behind you has several islands with grass, trees and shrubs. That, along the woods on all sides, provides lots of shade.<br /><br />Orientation panel: Davis Bayou Trails. 438 words.<br /><br />At the top of this panel is a photograph looking across the reeds and cattails alongside the waterways of the bayou. A blue heron stands in the water in the back ground.<br /><br />At the bottom of the panel is a photograph of two alligators resting on shore.<br /><br />Down the right side of the panel is a map of the Davis Bayou Area identifying the trails and facilities of the park. The visitor center is near the southern end of the park. The main park road goes from there north along the east side of the park, then turns west through the middle of the park crossing several of the bayous. The campground is at the western edge of the park. From there the road turns north to reach a loop at the northern edge, past a picnic area. Several trails extend out form the visitor center. Another follows the road through the park, with side trails along the way. A bicycle/multiuse trail follows the road on the western side of the park.<br /><br />Text on the left reads, <br /><br />\"Walk the trails in the Davis Bayou Area and discover the sights and sounds of the salt marsh and coastal woodlands on Mississippi's Gulf Coast. <br /><br />\"Davis Bayou Trail. Listen to the birds and other sounds as you explore the forest and bayou along this 1-mile trail from the visitor center to the picnic area. The trail provides access to the CCC Spur Trail and the Nature's Way Loop Trail. <br /><br />\"CCC Spur Trail. Follow this 0.2-mile trail along a wooded section to the Civilian Conservation Corps camp location. This trail was once a roadbed built by the CCC.<br /><br />\"Nature's Way Loop Trail. Hike this 0.5-mile trail and notice how the types of plant species change as the elevation rises slightly between the bayou and forest in a former dune area. <br /><br />\"Visitor Center Trails. Walk the short trails for views of Davis Bayou and Mississippi Sound; 100 yards; the fishing pier is wheelchair-accessible. <br /><br />\"Live Oaks Bicycle Route. Follow this paved route as it winds 2 miles through the park and 13 miles through the adjacent community to downtown Ocean Springs.<br /><br />\"Safety Precautions. Wear a hat and sunglasses. Drink plenty of water. Be aware of venomous snakes, insects, and poison ivy. Stay on the trail. Watch children closely. In emergencies call 911. <br /><br />\"Park Regulations. Do not disturb or remove any natural, historical, or archeological objects. Do not feed wildlife. Metal detectors are prohibited.<br /><br />\"If you are fortunate you may see a great egret or an alligator sunning itself at the bayou along Robert McGhee Road.\"<br /><br />End of Description.<br />",

    "audioDescription": "157 words, plus orientation panel<br /><br />At the east side of the parking lot by Fort Pickens is a sand and gravel path heading off into a bushy area dotted with a few tall trees. <br /><br />At the start of the trail is a sign with the logo for the Florida Trail at the top: a rounded triangle with a silhouette of the state in the middle with the initials \"F-T.\" The top strokes of the initials are slanted and connected to form a peaked roof. The sign gives distances to Battery Worth (0.8 miles), Campground Loops A-E (0.85 to 1.3 miles) and the southern terminus in Big Cypress National Preserve (1,300 miles). Text reads, <br /><br />\"One of 11 national scenic trails in the United States, this trail provides one of the best ways to get around Fort Pickens and beyond! Hiking, biking, and pets on leash permitted.\"<br /><br />To the right of the sign is a dog waste station. <br /><br />Orientation panel: Florida National Scenic Trail. 526 words.<br /><br />This panel is 2 feet wide and three feet tall. Down the right side is a footprint with tread, like a hiking boot. In the upper right corner is a logo for the Florida Trail, a rounded triangle with the silhouette of the state in the middle and the initials \"F-T.\" Text at upper left reads, <br /><br />\"The Florida National Scenic Trail, or just Florida Trail, is a federally-designated trail intended to offer a continuous non-motorized recreation opportunity showcasing the biodiversity, history, and culture of Florida. Its northern terminus lies here on the white sands of Gulf Islands National Seashore. Follow it south for over 1,300 miles and you'll eventually find its southern terminus in the river of grass in Big Cypress National Preserve. Across the United States there are only 11 National Scenic Trails. The Florida Trails offers an exclusive Florida experience including the only segment of a National Scenic Trail that follows an ocean beach right here at Gulf Islands National Seashore.\"<br /><br />Below the text is a column of four photographs. Beginning at the top, the first one shows a hiker wearing a backpack moving away from us along a beach's water's edge. The one below that shows a young woman relaxing as she sits in the opening of a tent in the woods. The next one shows four hikers walking down a path through the woods, ferns on either side. The bottom picture shows a young woman pointing to the Florida Trail logo on a wooden post. Text beside the photographs reads, <br /><br />\"The Authentic Florida Experience. Florida is home to many unique environments, some of which are not seen anywhere else in the world. This gives trail users prime access to some of the best nature and wildlife viewing opportunities in the country. By traveling the Florida Trail, one can experience a variety of ecosystems including longleaf pine forests, sand dune scattered beaches, and hardwood hammocks. Wildlife viewing along the Florida Trail is also spectacular, providing visitors with the opportunity to see black bears, alligators, panthers, gopher tortoises, and many species of endangered birds including wood storks, red-cockaded woodpeckers, and roseate spoon bills. Whether exploring a secluded wilderness area or a Florida Trail Gateway Community, the Florida Trail is the perfect place to find an authentic outdoor experience.\"<br /><br />At lower right is an image of an orange paint blaze. The text reads, <br /><br />\"Follow the Orange Blazes. If you wanted to hike from the western end of Florida's panhandle to the Southern tip of the state, how would you do it?

    "bodyText": "<h3>Spanish Water Battery</h3> <p>A steep tunnel runs underground from the parade to Batería de San Antonio, or the Spanish Water Battery, a National Historic Landmark.<br /> <br /> In the military, a battery is a small structure designed for cannon or a group of cannon commanded by a single officer. Spanish engineers built this battery between 1797–1798 after declaring war on Great Britain. From its location at the shoreline, seven cannon could ricochet cannonballs across the surface of the bay to hit ships at the water line. To protect the battery’s rear, a small stockade named Castillo de San Carlos was built on the bluff rising above.<br /> <br /> After Spanish West Florida became a US territory in the 1820s, Army engineers demolished the Castillo and built Fort Barrancas in its place. They then modernized the Spanish Water Battery and named it Barrancas Water Battery. With 15 cannon, the battery continued its original purpose in protecting the entrance to Pensacola Bay.</p> <p> </p>",
    "audioDescription": "161 words.<br /><br />This tour stop is located on one side of the main part of the Spanish Water Battery as you exit the tunnel passageway from the parade ground of Fort Barrancas. To the left is a 10-foot-high wall topped by a level space where the cannon were placed. To the right there is an alcove in the wall of the main structure about 15 feet wide and 10 feet deep. On the back wall of the alcove is an opening near the ground level, now covered with iron bars. The opening has a wooden shutter which can be closed. <br /><br />Underfoot a narrow brick walk leads around the wall to the right to the main open space of the fort. From there on the right is a long staircase, 26 steps in all, which leads up to a platform with high walls. On the left, a shorter staircase, 14 steps, leads up to the cannon area.<br /><br />End of Description.",

    "bodyText": "<h3>Guard Room</h3> <p>In the 1800s, people in the United States believed that keeping a large army during peacetime was a threat to their nation. They preferred to rely on citizen-soldiers if war erupted, like their ancestors had in the American Revolution.<br /> <br /> Of the forts, one Army engineer wrote: “When once constructed they require but little expenditure for their support. In time of peace they withdraw no valuable citizens from the useful occupations of life. Of themselves they can never exert an influence dangerous to public liberty; but as the means of preserving peace, and as obstacles to an invader, their influence and power are immense.”<br /> <br /> To support this attitude and tradition, Army engineers did not design Fort Barrancas with living quarters for soldiers. Instead, professional soldiers serving in the small US Army lived nearby at Barrancas Barracks.<br /> <br /> Even in peacetime, Fort Barrancas stored dozens of cannon and large quantities of ammunition that needed guarding. Soldiers stationed at the Army post took turns standing guard over the fort. They rotated with two men on duty (two hours on, four hours off, for 24 hours) while four men rested in this guard room.</p>",
    "audioDescription": "148 words.<br /><br />This tour stop is in the guard room to the right of the entrance tunnel or sally port. It is a room with an arched ceiling, 15 feet wide and 23 feet deep. One end is along the outer wall with three narrow window openings overlooking the dry ditch. To reach the gallery under the fort's walls, move to that end of the room and turn left. A set of four steps leads down to the gallery.<br /><br />At the other end of the room is the door off the sally port. One the wall there are two graphic panels. One the side wall nearest the sally port is a display of illustrations of the fort. Down the other side of the room are rows of short benches, facing the end of the room. A larger bench sits along the outside wall.<br /><br />End of Description.",

In 1851, a slaveholder rented an enslaved man named Peter Dyson to Army engineers. Engineers forced Dyson to make masonry repairs to the fort. In 1861, the first year of the American Civil War, Peter and his wife Henrietta sailed to Fort Pickens and freedom on the Underground Railroad.</p>",

On the other side of the room is a five-foot high wall with the space behind filled with sand. You can reach over the wall to feel the sand.<br /><br />The rooms are connected by three-foot-wide arched doorways through the walls in between the rooms which form one long corridor. The bricks forming the doorway arches has been cut to form the curved shape. Feel free to touch.<br /><br />The flooring is brick and may be uneven.<br /><br />End of Description.",

    "audioDescription": "Fort Barrancas Visitor Center. 191 words.The visitor center is a one-story building with a brick and concrete facade with a concrete patio in front. The glass entrance is near the center of the building. To the left of the entrance a breezeway leads to the rear of the building where the walk to the fort is located. On the left side of the breezeway are the restrooms. On the rear of the building on the right is a water fountain and water bottle refill station.Five benches are located around the patio in front. In the middle of the patio is a nine-foot-long cannon resting on concrete mounts. Between the patio and the entrance drive is a grassy area with a flag pole and two more cannon.The parking area lies to the left of the patio. At the right a sidewalk borders the entrance drive. Along the walk is an artillery exhibit with additional cannon and two mortars. There are several graphic panels in this area, mounted on the wall near the entrance, in the breezeway, in a kiosk near the parking area and next to the artillery exhibit.The Draw of Pensacola. 190 words.The background of this panel features a satellite image of Pensacola Bay and its surroundings. Along the bottom is the long thin line of barrier islands on either side of the passage into the bay itself. The large bay extends east from the entrance with two arms that go to the north. Just north of the entrance the runways on the naval air base can be seen with the city of Pensacola lying to the north of the main part of the bay.At the bottom of the panel is a drawing of a three-masted sailing ship. Text at the bottom right reads, \"Emerald waters, sandy beaches, and naval aviation bring visitors to Pensacola today. The attraction to Europeans 300 years ago was underwater: the 20- to 50-foot-deep bay. The largest sailing ships could get close to the shore and they had natural protection by the barrier islands. Colonists settled near the harbor because it was the gateway to the rest of the world. The coastal forts now protected by Gulf Islands National Seashore were the locks on that gate.\"Defending Pensacola Bay. 203 words.Text at the upper left of this panel reads, \"In the sweeping plan to defend our coastline in the early 1800s, Pensacola Bay rated four state-of-the-art fortifications. Military planners decided it was worth the expense. The bay could hold a whole fleet in its wide and deep waters. And in 1825 the Navy chose Pensacola to locate a facility for building, repairing, and supplying its ships - the only such facility in the Gulf of Mexico.\"Below the text is a drawing of a ship at anchor with three masts and a paddlewheel along its side. Behind it is a fort on a small peninsula of land.At the bottom of the panel is attached an old map of the entrance to the bay with Fort Pickens at the western end of Santa Rosa Island and Fort McRee on the other side of the entrance. On the mainland to the north of this part of the bay is a corner of land showing two street grids, one labeled Warrington and the other labeled Woolsey. To the west of them is a Naval Hospital, U.S. Barracks, Fort San Carlos and Advanced Redoubt, and two lighthouse beacons.Third System Forts. 535 words.This large panel is divided into three vertical sections. The section at left has a quote from Lieutenant Henry W. Halleck from the Report on the Means of National Defense from 1843. It reads, \"When once constructed they (forts) require but little expenditure for their support. In time of peace they withdraw no valuable citizens from the useful occupations of life. Of themselves they can never exert an influence dangerous to public liberty; but as a means of preserving the peace, and as obstacles to an invader, their influence and power are immense.\"Underneath the quote is a portrait of Halleck from circa 1860 when he was a Major General.Text in the middle section of the panel reads, \"The United States built Fort Barrancas and 41 other fortifications as part of a grand system to protect the nation's 35,000-mile coastline. Built between 1816 and 1870, this was the third such system in the nation's history. The defense system focused on harbors and river mouths, the major gateways to the nation's people and resources. Coastal forts functioned as locks on these gates. The state-of-the-art forts were designed to withstand the worst an enemy navy could send against them: wooden sailing ships with smoothbore cannons. Of the 42 Third System forts, only Fort McRee has completely disappeared.\"Above the text is a photograph of men loading cannon lined up along the walls of a fort. The caption reads, \"Fort Barrancas was one of four forts built to protect Pensacola Bay and the Navy Yard. It didn't see action until the Civil War, when Confederate troops briefly held it against the Union.\"At the bottom of this section is a color illustration of a five-sided fort with a last projecting bastion at each point. A large harbor lies in the background full of various sailing ships. The caption reads, \"Fo",

The caption reads, <br /><br />\"A gun crew at Fort Warren in Boston, Mass., loads a Rodman. The cannon, designed by Thomas Jefferson Rodman, was first cast in 1860.<br /><br />Labels on the photograph identify the different elements. One stands at the rear of the large cannon, where its diameter is almost equal to his height. He leans over to look at a small rod sticking up for the top of the cannon. The label reads, <br /><br />\"Gunner using sight to aim cannon.\"<br /><br />At the front of the cannon one man holds a long rod with a round black sponge on its end. Next to him two other men pass a white sack which holds the powder charge. Another man stands waiting below the cannon's bore holding the long ramrod.

Retaining walls on all sides support mounded soil covered with vegetation. In the middle of this 15-foot-wide roughly circular area is a concrete pad with four iron circular rails on top. Scattered on top of the pad and on the grass around the pad are large broken pieces of a cannon. Feel free to explore these pieces. <br /><br />Interpretive panel: Pieces of the Past.<br /><br />The background of the panel has a photograph of a 15-inch Rodman cannon on a metal carriage sitting on a concrete pad like the one here. Wheels on the bottom of the carriage sit on the circular metal railings on the pad, allowing the cannon to rotate to point in different directions. Text at the top of the panel reads, <br /><br />\"These cannon fragments, which come from a 15-inch Rodman smoothbore barrel like the one pictured, reflect technological changes in coastal defense artillery in the late 1800s. This fort was designed for 37 cannon, but only 17-including two 15-inch Rodmans-were mounted. Rifled cannon made the fort's smoothbore guns obsolete, and except for one Rodman they were sold for scrap iron in 1901. Explosives were used to break up the cannon to make them easier to remove.\"<br /><br />End of Description.",

The U.S. Army started construction in March 1859 and finished the fort in October 1866. First a small crew built temporary quarters, office, storehouse, wharf, and a plank road to the building site. Then, amid summer's staggering heat and a series of fierce storms, workers dug deep in the sand to build the fort's concrete foundations. Masons laid the brick walls and arched casemates.<br /><br />\"Naming the Fort. The fort was called \"The Fort on Ship Island\" in military records. It was named \"Fort Massachusetts\" after the Union gunboat.\"<br /><br />Across the middle of the panel is an 1862 \"harper's Weekly\" illustration shows six ships sailing past the west end of Ship Island. The ships have empty masts and tall smoke stacks with black smoke. On the island behind them the tall lighthouse is visible near the middle of the island. At the right, a flag flies over the fort, although the caption tells us the walls were not visible due to delays in construction.<br /><br />At the left side under the illustration are portraits of two men, both in uniform. The man on the left has white hair. The other has dark hair. The caption below reads, <br /><br />\"Gen. Joseph G. Totten (left), chief of Army Engineers, argued that Fort Massachusetts had to be built to defend New Orleans and to serve as a Gulf Coast military supply depot. Between 1859 and 1862 four officers served as engineers in charge. Construction resumed earnestly under the fifth, Lt. John C. Palfrey (right). He focused first on building barracks, huts, storage sheds, and a new wharf, and then on finishing the fort.\"<br /><br />To the right of the pictures is a plan view of the fort, showing its \"D\" shape with the closed rooms along the straight side. <br /><br />At the bottom of the panel is a brown-toned photograph with a bird's eye view of the fort. The curve wall has soil mounded on top protecting the semicircular cannon emplacements behind. More soil cover the straight band across the front with the large cannon clearly visible in the lower left corner. A caption reads,<br /><br />\"The fort's D-shape design is unique among the Third System coastal fortifications built between 1816 and 1867.\"<br /><br />To the left a quote from Alfred Parmenter, a musician in the 26th Massachusetts, reads, <br /><br />\"What a hell of a place to send 2,000 men 3,000 miles.\"<br /><br />End of Description.",

    "bodyText": "<p>The United States Army built Fort Pickens in the 1800’s to help defend the Gulf Coast from overseas enemies. In 1821, the Third System of coastal forts was extended to include protecting Pensacola Bay and the communities that lined the mainland shore. Pensacola Bay had long been considered important by European powers that sought to colonize North America.<br /> <br /> By 1825, legislation was passed to establish a navy yard and depot on the bay. Fortifications were needed to protect the new territory, its resources, and assets.<br /> <br /> From Santa Rosa Island, the fort worked with Fort McRee on Perdido Key to guard the entrance to Pensacola Bay. Fort Barrancas and the Spanish Water Battery, staring down from a bluff facing the harbor’s entrance, added more protection. Fort Barrancas and Advanced Redoubt guarded the Pensacola Navy Yard from land attacks.<br /> <br /> What many people don't know is that Fort Pickens was built on a bed of violence and cruelty. The Army forced enslaved Black men to build and later repair the fort. This didn't stop Fort Pickens from becoming a destination on the Underground Railroad during the Civil War and after. Freedom-seeking African Americans traveled to the fort to emancipate themselves.<br /> <br /> Following the Civil War and after the Apache Wars ended in the 1880’s, the Army concentrated Chiricahua Apache at Fort Pickens. Prisoners of war like Geronimo, a leader and medicine man, labored at the fort for one and a half years. The Chiricahua Apache remained prisoners of war for another 27 years.<br /> <br /> However, new technologies made Fort Pickens outdated. The Army continued using the fort until the end of World War II. In the 1890s, the fort supported an underwater minefield. Soldiers kept supplies for Battery Pensacola inside the fort's brick rooms. In the early 1900's, the Army set up a power plant in the fort to create electricity for the base.<br /> <br /> Fort Pickens joined the National Park Service's Gulf Islands National Seashore in 1971.

    "audioDescription": "Fort Pickens fishing pier. 220 words. The fishing pier stretches out 200 feet into Pensacola Bay from the shore. The pier may be reached through an opening in the four-foot wide concrete wall that extends around the end of the island from Fort Pickens to the west. From the entrance platform a ramp leads to the right down to the beach. To the left a boardwalk with a board railing parallels the beach for about 200 feet to reach the end of the pier. Here at the entrance platform is a panel titled \"Fishing Pier Rules.\"Along the boardwalk to the left are two more graphic panels titled \"Anglers. What should you do?\" and \"What Did I Catch?\" Along the left side of the boardwalk are a couple of places with benches. Sets of steps lead down to the beach near the graphic panels and also at the end of the pier itself. The pier is 20 feet wide. At the end is a 35-foot square platform. Seabirds, such as gulls and pelicans, are common around the pier. You may hear them calling or the splash of water as they dive for fish. Out in the water to the right of the pier is an open rectangular structure on pylons which is a common perch for many of the birds.End of Description.",

In the foreground the view is cutaway showing the underwater scene as well. The various plants and animals are identified by numbers corresponding to a legend at upper left. Beginning at the left, there are small periwinkle snails, attached near the base of reeds growing out of the mud. Sitting on the mud next to that are two fiddler crabs, each with one large claw and one small one. <br /><br />Next, underwater, is the larger blue crab, its shell with blue highlights along its claws and legs. Flying just above the water's surface is an osprey, its talons ready as it swoops towards a fish jumping out of the water. <br /><br />Just below the water's surface are several mullet, gray fish with horizontal stripes and two, equal-sized fins on top.<br /><br />At the right side of the drawing is a great blue heron, standing at the edge of the water. It has a blue-gray body and a long, pointed yellow beak. Hiding behind some reeds behind the bird is an American alligator, floating along the surface of the water. <br /><br />Under water there is a comb jelly, almost oval-shaped with tentacles trailing below it. Flat on the bottom is a flounder, its body almost blending with the sandy bottom and both eyes on top.<br /><br />Just above the water at the base of more reeds is a cluster of mussels. The two halved shells are elongated and irregular in shape.<br /><br />Underwater near the heron's feet is a gulf killifish with a specked body and a single dorsal fin near its tail. <br /><br />Standing behind the heron is a clapper rail, a smaller wading bird with a brown-speckled body. The reeds that the bird hides in is Spartina cordgrass, with flat pointed blades. Under water at the far right is a grass shrimp, a small crustacean with long feelers. On the bottom is a hermit crab, peeping out of the shell it uses as its house.<br /><br />End of Description.<br />",

    "audioDescription": "466 words<br />Along the dirt path near the south wall of the fort there is a slanted graphic panel mounted on the side away from the wall. Standing facing the panel gives a view back across the remaining bit of the original open space at this end of the fort which is now partially taken up by the long mound which is the sand and vegetation-covered front of Battery Pensacola. Along the left is the line of arched openings along one of the fort's south walls, ending at the bastion located at the west-facing point. Sitting on top there, pointing to the west, is a huge black cannon mounted on a rust-red metal carriage.<br /><br />At the bottom of this panel is a historical photograph showing a group of men around a large cannon mounted on a large metal carriage and pointing to the left. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"A gun crew at Fort Warren in Boston, Mass., loads a Rodman. The cannon, designed by Thomas Jefferson Rodman, was first cast in 1860.<br /><br />Labels on the photograph identify the different elements. One stands at the rear of the large cannon, where its diameter is almost equal to his height. He leans over to look at a small rod sticking up for the top of the cannon. The label reads, <br /><br />\"Gunner using sight to aim cannon.\"<br /><br />At the front of the cannon one man holds a long rod with a round black sponge on its end. Next to him two other men pass a white sack which holds the powder charge. Another man stands waiting below the cannon's bore holding the long ramrod. Near the rear of the canon four men hold a metal bar, two at each end, with a large cannon ball attached to the middle. A label reads, <br /><br />\"\"Shell hooks and carrying bar for moving cannonballs.\"<br /><br />At lower left is a pyramid-shaped pile of cannon ball, four wide and four high. The top cannonball has a rectangular object sitting on top of it. The label reads, <br /><br />\"Cannonball attached to sabot, which prevented it from rolling in barrel.\"<br /><br />Next to the stack is a square metal box called a pass box.<br /><br />Text at the top reads, <br /><br />\"A 15-inch Rodman like this gun-one of the largest smoothbore cannon ever developed-was installed here in 1868 but never fired in combat.

On land the national seashore provides campgrounds, primitive camping areas, and trails that pass through dunes, woodlands, and marshes-habitats of a variety of mammals, reptiles, and birds. For information, exhibits, and bookstores, stop at the visitor centers.\"<br /><br />Across the bottom of the panel are five photographs. Beginning at the left, the first one shows an alligator stretched out on a log in bright sunshine.

The label reads, \"History.\"<br /><br />Beach Safety. 223 words.<br /><br />At the bottom of this panel is a photograph of four children of different races running and splashing in shallow water at the edge of a beach. Text on the panel is in both English and Spanish. Text reads, <br /><br />\"In just a few minutes a wonderful day at the beach can turn into a disaster. Stay alert for sudden storms and marine life that could sting or bite. Watch your children. In emergencies, dial 911.<br /><br />Across the middle of the panel are specific warnings, each with a small photograph as illustration. Text reads, <br /><br />\"Avoid overexposure to the sun, especially between 10 am and 2 pm. Use sunscreen, sunglasses, hats, and long sleeves to protect skin. Drink plenty of water to help prevent dehydration.\" (Picture of the sun.)<br /><br />\"Thunderstorms develop quickly. If swimming or fishing, get out of the water immediately and seek shelter.\" (Picture of lightning.)<br /><br />\"Jellyfish and sea nettles can inflict painful stings.

Soak puncture wounds in hot water.\" (Picture of a stingray.)<br /><br />Location and Legacy. 251 words.<br /><br />Text at the left side of this panel reads, <br /><br />\"Immerse yourself in the cultural history of Gulf Islands National Seashore. Visit Gulf Coast bays and harbors that have attracted humans since American Indians settled here between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago. Delve into the adventures of Spanish, French, British, and American explorers and settlers. Learn the stories of soldiers, sailors, slaves, and Apache prisoners. Ship Island, Santa Rosa Island, Barrancas, Naval Live Oaks-visit these places along the Gulf of Mexico that helped shape America's national heritage.\"<br /><br />Across the top of the panel is a 1743 engraving which depicts the Spanish settlement on Santa Rosa Island that was destroyed in a hurricane in 1752. The engraving shows a walled fort at the left with buildings inside the wall and a large flag flying overhead. The rest of the land stretching to the right has a large number of small buildings along with two larger buildings with cupola-topped towers. Several small ships with bare mast float on the water in the foreground.<br /><br />Across the bottom is a brown-toned photograph showing Victorian era beachgoers - dressed in their Sunday best- on the Beach at Santa Rosa Island. A group of 20 to 30 men, women and children are on the beach, waves lapping on the shore at the left. Most stand, but some sit on wooden benches in a line at the right, facing the water. The men wear dark suits. The women wear long dress. Everyone wears hats.<br /><br />Forts and Firepower. 153 words.<br /><br />Text at the top of this panel reads, <br /><br />\"Take a trip back in time by touring the many coastal fortifications in the national seashore. These historic structures, preserved by the National Park Service, symbolize European colonization, American expansionism, and the evolution of military technology to deter invasions. Visit Forts Massachusetts, Pickens, Barrancas, and Advanced Redoubt and learn about the roles they played in the Civil War. Tour coastal batteries that helped protect Pensacola Bay from the 1890s through World War II.\"<br /><br />The panel features a photograph of a large black cannon from Fort Massachusetts on Ship Island. Pointing over a low brick wall at the gulf waters beyond, the cannon rests on a dark red metal base with wheels. The front wheels sit on a circular metal track, allowing the gun to pivot. At upper right an American flag flies at the top of a tall flag pole.<br /><br />Sea...Sand...Salt Marshes...Woodlands. 159 words.<br /><br />Text at the top of this panel reads, <br /><br />\"Explore the extensive beaches, salt marshes, and woodlands of the ever-changing northern Gulf Coast. Discover how the waves and wind shape and reshape offshore islands that shield the mainland in fierce storms. Visit salt marshes that serve as nurseries for crabs, fish, and other marine life. Walk trails that meander through coastal forests-habitats for a variety of plants and animals. The National Park Service protects these special places for you and future generations to enjoy.\"<br /><br />The top half of the panel has a photograph of a dead tree branch, half buried in the sand at the edge of the beach. The branch cast long shadows to the right and the sand is tinged a rosy pink.<br /><br />The bottom half of the panel has a photograph of rippling water flowing through a wide area of thick marsh reeds and sedges. A tree line is in the background.<br /><br />End of Description.",

    "audioDescription": "Approaching the pier from land, one passes between the historic mine sheds. As the path rises, Pensacola Bay comes into view, spanning the entire horizon. The opposite shore is visible in the distance, with marine traffic frequently passing crossways. Dune vegetation creeps over the sides and through the cracks of the boardwalk. At the top of the rise, a path to the left leads to the sandy beach and a path to the right leads to a boat dock. As one progresses down the slope, the boardwalk continues over plain white sand and then blue water. The boardwalk's entire length is roughly 40 yards. Returning from the boat dock, Fort Pickens rises into view beyond the mine sheds as one ascends the boardwalk.",

Between them Dan McColl and Claude H. Stone, Sr., tended the Ship Island Lighthouse for 40 years. Their wives and children helped them fuel the lanterns, clean the glass lenses, and maintain the boats and buildings, but the children had plenty of time to play and explore the island. The first lighthouse, built in 1853, guided ships traveling between New Orleans and Mobile away from shallow waters in the Mississippi Sound and into the deep-water channel west of the island. Over a century, Confederates and a fire damaged or destroyed the original brick tower and its wooden successor.\"<br /><br />Below the text a quote from Recollections and Memories of a Lighthouse Family by Rev. Claude Howard Stone, Jr. reads, <br /><br />\"Were we going fishing, walking on the beach, swimming, boating or just playing in the cool shade of the porch? Boy! What a terrible decision we had to make as ... kids.\"<br /><br />On the right side are three smaller photographs of the light house at various times. The top picture shows a solid white round tower with a cylindrical lamp on top. The middle picture shows a square white wooden tower with a many-sided lamp on top. The bottom picture shows a similar-looking lighthouse as viewed from the water. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"The 1853 brick lighthouse (below, top) was replaced in 1886 by the wooden tower (large image). The tower was later enclosed (below, middle). Fire destroyed it in 1972. A replica of the wooden lighthouse was built in 2000 (below, bottom), but Hurricane Katrina destroyed it in 2005.\"<br /><br />End of Description.",

This pier is located on Ship Island, and can take visitors to Biloxi or Gulfport.<br /> <br /> Ship Island is one of the most popular of Coastal Mississippi’s six barrier islands. Located approximately 11 miles south of Gulfport and Biloxi, its beautiful beaches are a part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore.<br /> <br /> Arriving on the north shore of the island, you’ll witness the beautifully preserved Fort Massachusetts, a brick fortification completed in 1868. With a strategic deep-water harbor located near the island, Ship Island was used in battle as far back as the War of 1812. Rangers and volunteers lead free guided tours for those interested in learning more about its incredible history.<br /> <br /> The north shore also features a boardwalk that extends to the more-popular south shore of the island, where you’ll find beautiful beaches, pristine waters, public restrooms, and a snack bar.<br /> <br /> A portion of the pier is open to loading and unloading from private vessels, look for signs on the pier to direct you to the appropriate locations. Private vessels may not be left unattended at the pier. </p>",

Near the entrance another sidewalk curves around to the left towards a small brick building against the wall of the fort. <br /><br />Left of the entrance weathered brick of the fort's walls rise tall. Small openings covered by iron bars are spaced along the walls. To the right of the entrance a section of the fort's walls is missing giving a glimpse of the arched gallery along the inside of the far wall. A wooden rail fence runs across the opening left by the missing wall section.<br /><br />Behind you as you face the entrance to the fort, on the far side of this end of the parking lot, is a sidewalk leading towards a group of white wood-frame buildings, some single-story and others two-story. <br /><br />Interpretive panel: Step back in history.<br /><br />On the right side of this panel is a map showing the layout of the fort as it looks today. The basic shape of the main fort is five sided with an extended area called a bastion at each corner. The fort is longer in the north-south direction than east-west. Your current location at the corner of the parking lot is at the end of a sidewalk which leads to the entrance in the northern face. The northwest section of the fort, the original Bastion D, is missing.<br /><br />The open area in the middle of the fort is called the parade. A roughly rectangular structure, called Battery Pensacola, lies across the middle of that space.<br /><br />Along the eastern side, the left on the diagram, is an outer wall called the counterscarp wall with a dry ditch between it and the main walls of the fort. <br /><br />A dotted line shows the route of a wheelchair-accessible tour route through the fort. Symbols indicate the location of restrooms and drinking fountain down a sidewalk to the left of the main entrance. The bookstore is located on the right along the entrance tunnel through the north face.<br /><br />In the bottom left corner of the panel is a black and white photograph looking down into the parade area. Two of the inner walls are visibly lined with arched openings. A pyramid of stacked cannon balls sits in one corner. The caption reads, <br /><br />\"Fort Pickens was a Union fort during the Civil War.\"<br /><br />At upper left text reads, <br /><br />\"Fort Pickens played a critical role in an 1800s homeland-security program. Pickens was the largest of four forts the US government built to protect Pensacola Bay and the navy yard. The fort succeeded, not against a foreign invasion, but against the Confederacy during the Civil War. To learn more about the fascinating history of this defensive fortification, follow the sidewalk straight ahead and begin your self-guiding tour. The fort closes at sunset.\"<br /><br />Below the text is a quote by Lieutenant Henry W. Halleck, \"Report on the Means of Defence,\" 1843, which reads, <br /><br />\"...as the means of preserving peace, and as obstacles to an invader, [the forts'] influence and power are immense.\"<br /><br />End of Description.",

Across the top, beginning at the left is an eastern mole. The small mammal peers out from a hole in the dirt covered with thick gray fur except for its smooth pointed snout and its longs claws on its front feet.<br /><br />Next is a racoon, perched on the edge of a hole in a tree trunk. He looks at us with his black mask, white nose and brown and black ringed tail.<br /><br />At the right is an eastern gray squirrel sitting on a tree branch. Its body is gray with a white underbelly and its long busy tail makes an \"S\" curve over its back.<br /><br />Below these are two more pictures. At left is a gray fox trotting across a stony patch in tall grass. Its pointed nose is black and it has a red patch behind its ears. Its long bushy tail has a black band down its top.<br /><br />The final picture shows a Virginia opossum. It clings to a narrow branch. It has a white face and pointed snout with a pink tip. Its body has thick gray fur but its tail is furless and whip-like.<br /><br />A label invites you to touch the footprint impressions below of a few mammal species that live in the coastal plain.<br /><br />Beginning at bottom left are mole footprints. The front foot on top is wider, almost round, while the rear foot below is long and narrow.<br /><br />Next are gray fox prints. These are similar to dog footprints, with a central pad and four large toes on each foot.<br /><br />Next is a racoon, similar to a tiny human's hand and foot, only slightly longer and with longer toes.<br /><br />Next is the gray squirrel. Its prints are like the racoon's but smaller and narrower.<br /><br />The final set of prints are from an opossum. Its front print is roughly rectangular with the five pointed toes prints spread wide. The hind foot is long and has one to separate from the rest, like a mitten.<br /><br />End of Description.",

    "bodyText": "This is the location of the heaviest fighting during the Battle of Mill Springs on January 19, 1862. Confederate troops moved up into this area from the south early in the morning on January 19th, after meeting Federal pickets stationed at Timmy's Branch. Fighting occurred on both sides of the road, near where modern KY 235 is located. Heavy morning fog, bad weather, and the thick haze of black powder smoke created an environment of confusion as inexperienced troops struggled to see more than a rifle's length in front of them. <br /> <br /> On the eastern side of the road, where Zollicoffer Park is located, Confederate troops were down in the ravine to the east and were fighting uphill against Federal forces located on the other side of a rail fence. Today you can see a facsimilie of this fence in the park. <br /> <br /> On the western side of the road (across KY 235), Federal and Confederate forces clashed, moving through fields and among dense forested areas to exchange fire. <br /> <br /> This site has multiple interesting features: a historic wall and gate built in the early 1900s, a monument to Confederate General Felix K. Zollicoffer, the marker for a Confederate mass grave, the earth-print of a large witness tree that fell in the 1990s (The Zollicoffer Tree), multiple symbolic Confederate headstones, and the Ravine Trail, a 3/4 of a mile hiking trail. ",
    "audioDescription": "A historic stone wall with a wrought iron gate leads into Zollicoffer Park. You first enter the park in lightly wooded area with a small cement walkway that leads to the stone obelisk monument to Confederate General Felix K. Zollicoffer to the front and to the right, to the marker for the Confederate mass grave. To the right are the symbolic Confederate headstones and to the left is an open field with a rail fence laid diagonal on the hillside. Down the hill that the main area of the park sits on is a heavily wooded area, through which winds the moderately difficult Ravine Trail which guides visitors through the ravine from which Confederate troops fought during the battle.",

Along this northern edge was a line of formidable earthworks designed by military engineers. This winter encampment was located on a peninsula created by the Cumberland River and White Oak Creek. Confederate General Felix K. Zollicoffer chose this position, with his back to the river, believing it to be an easily defensible position, with the river covering any enemy attacks from the rear. His commanding officer, General George B. Crittenden disagreed with this, believing that Zollicoffer would be placing his troops in a precarious situation. If he was unable to fend off an attack from the north the river would make any evasive manuevers impossible. <br /> <br /> Despite Crittenden's direct order not to cross the river, Zollicoffer established his winter encampment here at Beech Grove. The first thing he had his troops do was create earthworks and entrenchments to protect themselves from Federal attacks from the North. ",

Confederate soldiers crossed from the south side of the river on with orders to move north to build fortifications. Trees were felled and the soldiers began to build winter quarters of log huts for their own personal comfort. <br /> <br /> When the Confederate army retreated back to Beech Grove, Confederate Major General George B. Crittenden ordered the systematic retreat across the Cumberland River throughout the night of January 19-20. Everything the soldiers had brought over was left in their quarters and anything of military necessity was abandoned. The demoralized men marched down the road to the ferry crossing to board the Noble Ellis, a sidewheeled steamer, or rafts, that brought them to safety on the southside of the river. Crittenden successfully extracted his force to Mill Springs, then marched them to Monticello.",

    "bodyText": "After United States troops defeated Confederate forces on the South Carolina Sea Islands, and likewise drove white plantation owners from their homes in November 1861, the Beaufort District became a central hub for military operations along the southeasten coast and a starting point for Reconstruction in the South. While most properties and homes of the white planter class were eventually auctioned off for the nonpayment of Federal taxes, largely to freed African Americans, the US military and freedmen's aid organizations likewise repurposed a number of properties for their own use.<br /> <br /> In addition to the more than fifteen US Army hospitals established, a care facility was set up toward the center of the town of Beaufort for freed African Americans, also referred to by occupying troops as \"contraband,\" or refugees. This term, contraband, was a reference to the legal status of enslaved African Americans who escaped bondage and sought refuge behind US lines.<br /> <br /> The \"contraband\" hospital was established in the former home of B.B. Sams on the corner of Craven and New Streets. While hospitals such as this would have been filled with those affected by disease, other patients suffered from wounds received while escaping the bonds of slavery. Among those who were employed in Beaufort's hospitals was <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/harriet-tubman.htm\">Harriet Tubman</a>, who, according to local tradition, is said to have provided aid for Black refugees on the grounds of the \"contraband\" hospital.<br /> <br />  ",

It was home to the 1st South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, later renamed the 33rd United States Colored Troops, which was made up almost entirely of formerly enslaved African Americans from the coastal islands of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. On January 1, 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation was read to the men of the regiment, along with hundreds of other formerly enslaved people, in a stand of live oak trees at the site of Camp Saxton.<br /> <br /> The best way to explore Camp Saxton is by visiting Beaufort County's Fort Frederick Heritage Preserve. Fort Frederick was a small fortification built by the British in the 1730s, however, during the Civil War, the tabby ruins of Fort Frederick served as the foundation for the dock at Camp Saxton. Many of the participants in the Emancipation Day celebration came ashore at the ruins of Fort Frederick, and noted it as a landmark near Camp Saxton. The <a href=\"https://www.beaufortcountysc.gov/passive-parks/index.html\">Fort Frederick Heritage Preserve is a county-managed passive park</a> located at 601 Old Fort Road, Port Royal South Carolina. Please be respectful of nearby private property, as the property managed by the United States Navy. Please note that the traditional location of the Emancipation Oak and historical marker are located within the boundaries of the Naval Hospital Beaufort and are not accessible to the general public.<br /> <br /> Park rangers periodically lead tours to Fort Frederick, exploring the Camp Saxton story. <a href=\"https://cms.nps.gov/reer/planyourvisit/calendar.htm\">Visit our calendar</a> for more information before you visit. In addition, the Town of Port Royal has rebuilt Pinckney-Porter's Chapel, a Reconstruction Era Freedman's Chapel. Pinckney-Porter's Chapel is located within the Naval Heritage Park just outside the entrance to Naval Hospital Beaufort. Exhibits at the chapel share the story of Camp Saxton and the soldiers who trained there, as well as a history of the chapel itself. On Saturday mornings, during the <a href=\"http://www.beaufortsc.org/things-to-do/attractions/port-royal-farmers-market/\">Port Royal Farmers Market</a>, a park ranger is available at Pinckney-Porter's Chapel to answer questions about the site.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">The Harriet Tubman Memorial Bridge spans the Combahee River between Beaufort and Colleton Counties in South Carolina. It is the site of a raid conducted by </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/people/harriet-tubman.htm\">Harriet Tubman</a><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> and African American soldiers of the 2nd South Carolina Infantry in June 1863.</span><br /> <br /> <span style=\"color:#000000;\">In the Fall of 1861 United States troops arrived in the South Carolina Lowcountry, along the shores of Beaufort County and Port Royal Sound, and in so doing pushed plantation owners, enslavers, and Confederate troops from the region. Living in this area were approximately 10,000 enslaved African Americans on nearly 200 plantations, who long remembered November 7 – the day of the “Big Gun Shoot” – as a day of military emancipation. With a foothold established in the heart of secessionist territory, the federal military, alongside government officials and missionaries, were able to begin the process of Reconstruction, and thousands of formerly enslaved people began the transition to a life of freedom – an operation known as “The Port Royal Experiment.”</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Among those who voluntarily migrated from the northeastern United States to assist in this process was Harriet Tubman, whose reputation as the “Moses of Her People” followed her to the US Army’s Department of the South. While thousands of enslaved people were freed under US military occupation, there were still countless numbers in neighboring counties who remained in bondage. Tubman’s role as a conductor on the Underground Railroad in the pre-war period, which included the liberation of approximately 70 people, was one of the many hats she wore upon her arrival in South Carolina in the Spring of 1862. With ongoing military operations in the region, Tubman continued her work through a network of spies, pilots, and soldiers to secure the freedom of enslaved people and to assist with gathering military intelligence.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Perhaps Tubman’s most noted role in local operations was the Combahee River Raid of June 1863. During the weeks and months prior, her network of spies and boat pilots collected valuable information from plantations along the Combahee River – information which helped Tubman and US Army officials in the planning of a joint operation to liberate those enslaved along the river and to disrupt enemy activity in the area. In the rice fields between Beaufort and Colleton Counties, along the Combahee River, hundreds of African Americans continued to toil under the watch of their enslavers. Tubman’s plan to free those enslaved people in the Combahee River rice fields involved the participation of elements of the 3rd Rhode Island Heavy Artillery and approximately 300 Black soldiers of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry – a regiment comprised mostly of freed men from the Sea Islands along the South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida coasts. The 2nd South Carolina’s commander, Colonel James Montgomery, worked with Tubman to execute her plan, which was set to be carried out in secrecy.</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">On the evening of Monday June 1, Tubman directed three steamships from Saint Helena Sound up the Combahee River and reached their destination in the early morning hours of June 2. Under the protection of the 2nd South Carolina, and with Confederate troops retreating from the area, enslaved people ran from the surrounding plantations toward the US ships as they sounded their steam whistles – notes which personified the sound of freedom. Thanks to the intelligence collected by Tubman, more than 750 men, women, and children were liberated, and US troops destroyed several million dollars-worth of plantations, warehouses, and rice fields along the river, including the vicinity of Combahee Ferry. As one journalist later noted, Tubman, along with the Black soldiers of the 2nd South Carolina, “struck terror to the heart of rebeldom.”</span></p> <p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Those who sought freedom along the Combahee River joined Tubman on the return to US lines in Beaufort County on June 3. Here, the work of Tubman continued as she recruited additional troops from the population of freed men - many of whom joined the ranks of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry. This single action on the Combahee River Raid not only added to Harriet Tubman’s reputation as a freedom fighter, but also solidified her status as the only African American woman to lead troops in a military operation during the Civil War.<br /> <br /> This bridge and boat landing is at the approximate location of the Combahee River Ferry, one of the key landing spots and points of liberation on the Combahee Raid. </span></p>",

    "bodyText": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\">First African Baptist Church is a historic African American church located on 601 New Street in Beaufort County, South Carolina. This church is still active today, and is a part of the </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/reconstruction/network.htm\">Reconstruction Era National Historic Network</a><span style=\"color:#000000;\">. <br /> <br /> The church started in 1863 as a praise house called “Baptist Church Colored.” Praise houses are one room church houses in the Sea Islands that provides places of worship, social events, and educational classrooms for African Americans. During the Civil War, the site was a school as part of the Port Royal Experiment. Reverend Arthur Waddell, from Georgia, was the church’s first pastor. “Pastor Emeritus” Dr. H. J. Brooks served as pastor after Waddell’s passing. Through the church's history, ministers and the congregation participated in religious and civic affairs.<br /> <br /> Civil War hero Robert Smalls and his family attended First African Baptist Church. Robert Smalls and others helped to purchase the church from the larger Baptist Church of Beaufort. In addition, Smalls financially supported the pastor of First African by donating weekly 25 cents. On February 5, 1905, Robert Smalls was baptized at First African. In 1915, Smalls's funeral was held at First African Baptist Church and his procession and burial was at Tabernacle Baptist Church located on Craven Street. Throughout his life, Smalls knew the importance and role of black churches in African American communities and continued to support the community spiritually, financially, and politically through church affiliation.</span></p>",

The function of Coleman Hall was to serve as a dining hall, which was located on the first floor, and the basement served as a food storage area. As the school started seeing significant growth, a living area for students was added to the building. Coleman Hall stood for 25 years before it burnt down in 1950. The building received damage; however, the building was able to be recovered and later received renovations. These renovations included an extension of the building to allow faculty to live within it and allow them to supervise student extracurricular activities. Today, Coleman Hall is used as the administrative center for the Technical College of the Lowcountry, which contains services such as admissions, career planning and student records.</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>Founded in 1862 as a school for freed slaves, Penn School established a commitment to Black education, community welfare, and cultural heritage that has remained strong for over 150 years. Penn School functioned as an educational institution, health clinic, farm bureau, catalyst for community action, and a repository for preserving St. Helena Island’s unique Gullah heritage and written history.<br /> <br /> The founders of Penn School were northern missionaries and abolitionists who came to the South Carolina sea island following the Union occupation of the area during the Civil War. Education was a top priority; classes for freedmen were held in barns, cabins, and deserted plantation houses scattered across St. Helena. The only school of this type to survive was Penn School, established by Laura Town and Ellen Murray, on land purchased from Hasting Gantt, a freedman and entrepreneur. A private charity composed mostly of Quaker abolitionists in Philadelphia supported Penn during its early decades. After the demise of the state’s Reconstruction regime, the school struggled financially. Rossa B. Cooley and Grace House, two northern white educational philanthropists, took over leadership of the school at the turn of the century and revised the curriculum to follow the Hampton-Tuskegee model of Black education. In addition to training students in masonry, carpentry, and the domestic arts, Penn School trained midwives and offered relief to St. Helena Island residents suffering from economic hardship during the Great Depression. Although the school closed in 1948, the community service and cultural preservation functions originated by the school’s founders flourished through Penn Community Services, Inc., organized in 1951. Penn opened South Carolina’s first day care center for African Americans, provided a community health care clinic, and began a Teen Canteen for local teenagers.<br /> <br /> Under the direction of devout Quakers, Courtney and Elizabeth Siceloff, Penn Center became a major facilitator for civil rights and social justice activism. The isolated campus was one of the few places in the Jim Crow South where interracial organizations met, and sometimes stayed overnight, without the threat of legal action. The Siceloffs embraced the movement after conversations with local residents who shared how unequal education, generational poverty, political disenfranchisement and segregation shaped their lives. According to historians Orville Burton and Wilbur Cross, the Siceloffs broke away from the condescending notion that the Black community needed to be “taught” citizenship to become “civilized” and “Americanized” and eventually understood the “Christian commitment and theological worldview” of their African American neighbors long before Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. brought it into the mainstream.<br /> <br /> Throughout the 1960s, Penn Center sponsored and hosted interracial conferences on civil rights organized by groups such as the NAACP, CORE, SNCC, Southern Regional Council, South Carolina Council on Human Relations, World Peace Foundation, and the Peace Corps. The Baha’i Faith also held religious meetings at Penn to avoid scrutiny due to the interracial makeup of its congregation and their opposition to segregation. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) held citizenship education classes at Penn, taught by iconic organizers Andrew Young, Dorothy Cotton, Bernice Robinson, and Septima P. Clark. These integrated organizations stealthily met and strategized on this isolated campus, safely under the radar of local authorities, the public and the press.Young eventually introduced Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to Penn Center. King, his SCLC lieutenants, and countless unnamed activists met with the SCLC at Penn five times between 1964 and 1967.<br /> <br /> The isolated campus on St. Helena Island became a bastion of peace and a place of refuge where King could unwind, breathe freely and express himself openly, saying things in front of groups at Penn that he couldn’t say on the national stage. Folk singer Joan Baez, who attended a retreat in 1966, recalled King saying, “he couldn’t take the pressure anymore, that he just wanted to go back…and preach in his little church, and he was tired of being a leader.” At Penn, King was able to voice publicly his unpopular anti-Vietnam War stance and express his concerns for the 40 million Americans living in poverty, which led to his strong opinions about the intrinsic evils of capitalism.<br /> <br /> King organized retreats at Penn Center as opportunities for he and fellow SCLC members to debate the utility of nonviolence and the need to broaden the civil rights movement from a regional to a national focus. During a retreat in September 1965, SCLC leadership and staff became embroiled in fierce debate over whether to relocate the movement to Chicago. Septima Clark and other veteran staffers, as well as the Penn staff, felt that citizenship education should be the focus. They believed that protests and demonstrations had a place in the movement but should be secondary to laying the groundwork.<br /> <br /> Younger staffers, frustrated by the slow pace of progress, wanted more direct-action protests. SCLC leaders decided to take the movement to the North and begin training staff for activism in the Chicago campaign. At the same time, Diane Nash Bevel, a former Freedom Rider who had joined the SCLC staff in 1962, would continue to develop educational programs on nonviolence in the South.<br /> <br /> Subsequent retreats revealed the continuing evolution of the nonviolent philosophy of Dr. King and the SCLC. In November 1966, during one of the only formal speeches he gave at Penn, Dr. King connected the long struggle for African American civil rights to the neglected fight for economic equality. Tying his antiwar stance to his broader focus on human rights, the civil rights icon pledged to use nonviolence to fight America’s three evil, “inseparable triplets”: racism, excessive materialism, and militarism. King’s speech and the sessions from this retreat became the basis for his 1967 book entitled Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? A year later, King and the SCLC returned to finalize plans for a mass demonstration in Washington D.C. to protest poverty and the evils of capitalism. Dubbed the “Poor People’s Campaign,” the plan received mixed reviews and caused further division within the ranks of the SCLC.<br /> <br /> King did his best to reaffirm the SCLC’s role of offering hope, determination, and a commitment to nonviolence. Four months later, on April 4, 1968, he was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, the day after he arrived to support striking sanitation workers in the city. Penn had begun constructing a remote cabin on the marsh for future visits but he was killed before it was completed. It is still referred to as the Martin Luther King cabin.The historic campus, Brick Church, and surrounding areas were listed in the National Register of Historic Places on September 9, 1974. In subsequent decades, Penn Center continued to serve as a site for church and organizational retreats, a training center for various organizations, and an educational site for Black history and culture.<br /> <br /> In January 2017, President Barack Obama designated the Beaufort National Landmark District, Camp Saxton Site, Penn Historic District and the Old Beaufort Firehouse as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/reer/index.htm\">Reconstruction Era National Historical Park</a> to preserve and commemorate activities during Reconstruction under management of the National Park Service.<br /> <br /> In 2021, the Penn Center was added to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/civilrights/african-american-civil-rights-network.htm\">African American Civil Rights Network</a> (AACRN), as well as the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/reconstruction/network.htm\">Reconstruction Era National Historic Network</a><br />  </p>",

Today, the home is a private residence.<br /> <br /> Originally constructed around 1840 by Smalls's enslaver, Henry McKee, this building served as a setting for some of the most influential years of Robert Smalls's life - from his time of enslavement to his service as a member of the United States House of Representatives, and as one of the most influential African American figures during the Reconstruction Era. <br /> <br /> Smalls was born on the property on April 5, 1839 to Lydia Polite, who was also enslaved by McKee. For the first twelve years of his life, Smalls bore witness to the horrors of slavery on and around this property, as well as on land owned by McKee on Lady's Island. In 1851, Smalls was hired out and sent to work in Charleston, where, in 1856, he married Hannah Jones, with whom he had two children. Before the start of the Civil War, Smalls worked aboard a transport boat known as \"The Planter.\" It was on this ship that he escaped Confederate forces in Charleston Harbor and self-emancipated himself and his family, as well as several other enslaved crewmen, on May 13, 1862. For this act he received a Congressional reward of $1,500, which he used to purchase the home where he and his mother were once enslaved. <br /> <br /> After white residents fled Beaufort County in 1861, and US troops occupied the region, much of the property abandoned went up for auction due to unpaid taxes. Among the properties that were sold during early Reconstruction was the former McKee home, which Smalls purchased for $605 in January 1864. He lived in this house with his family for the rest of his life. When he died in 1915, the home was inhereted by his descendants. His daughter, Elizabeth Smalls Bampfield, noted in a 1959 interview that the home remained in the family's hands until the early 1950s. In 1974, the house was designated a <a href=\"http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/beaufort/S10817707017/\">National Historic Landmark</a> and in 2022 was listed on the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/reconstruction/network.htm\">Reconstruction Era National Historic Network</a>. </p>",

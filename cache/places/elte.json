The acequia served to raise and direct the flow of water toward the eastern bank to a canal intake. The acequia remained in use until 1912.",

The Spaniards' goals were to Christianize and civilize the numerous Indian tribes in the area and to establish a presence. During this period, a rock dam and a system of acequias (canals) were constructed just east of Apache Pass to irrigate the fields of one of the nearby missions. All of these improvements were abandoned in 1755 due to a combination of disease, drought, and Indian troubles.

After that time, the Caddo continued to live in the area and shared the culture of previous residents, but later groups lacked the sophisticated ceremonialism and material wealth characterized by earlier times. The Hasinai Caddo groups continued to live through the 1830s in their traditional East Texas homeland. By the early 1840s, all Caddo groups had moved west to the Brazos River area to avoid Anglo settlers who brought repressive measures and colonization efforts.

    "bodyText": "<p>During the Spanish colonial period in North America, numerous ‚Äúroyal roads‚Äù‚Äîor caminos reales‚Äîtied far-flung regions of the empire to Mexico City. One particular collection of indigenous trails and trade routes became known as El Camino Real de los Tejas, the primary overland route for the Spanish colonization of what is today Texas and northwestern Louisiana. The trail‚Äôs name is derived not only from its geographic extent but also from some of its original users. Spaniards referred to a prominent group of Caddo Indians as the Tejas, a word derived from the Caddo term for ‚Äòfriend‚Äô or ‚Äòally.‚Äô Thus, the Spanish province of Tejas, the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas, and the historic trail traversing them owe their name to the Caddo language.<br /> <br /> Spanish interest in Texas began because of the expedition of Ren√© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, a French explorer who established a fort along the Texas coast in 1685. Spanish officials saw this incursion as a threat to their silver mines and their shipping routes through the Gulf of Mexico. Though La Salle‚Äôs settlement failed after he was killed by his own men, the threat of French colonization remained a powerful motivating force behind the development of Spanish Texas‚Äîmuch of which occurred along El Camino Real de los Tejas.<br /> <br /> In 1690, a party of soldiers and priests crossed the Rio Grande on their way to the Neches River, where they established two missions intended to cultivate religion and a sedentary lifestyle among the Caddos. Following a smallpox outbreak in 1693, however, Caddos warned the Spaniards to leave or die. They retreated back across the Rio Grande, establishing one of the enduring themes of El Camino Real de los Tejas: American Indians often dictated the terms of Spanish settlement in eastern Texas, and not vice versa.<br /> <br /> Prompted once again by the threat of the French, Spaniards reestablished their presence in eastern Texas in 1716 by building four churches and a presidio; however, the missions largely failed to attract the desired number of American Indian converts. A few years later, Spaniards constructed a fort at Los Adaes‚Äîjust twelve miles west of the French post at Natchitoches. Yet even though Los Adaes would serve as the capital of Spanish Texas until 1770, it relied heavily upon illegal trade with its neighboring French settlement to stay afloat. Its isolated position at the eastern end of El Camino Real de los Tejas, separated from other Spanish settlements by a long trail with treacherous river crossings, made life at Los Adaes a daily struggle.<br /> <br /> The governor of the Spanish province of Texas began eyeing a new settlement along the San Antonio River to serve as a midpoint between the Rio Grande and the East Texas missions. This area eventually turned into the heart of Spanish Texas, as the Crown‚Äôs eastern outposts continued to be hamstrung by supply shortages and indifference from members of the Caddo confederacy who‚Äîwell-armed with French trade goods and able to sustain themselves without Spanish assistance‚Äîfound little use for the mission complexes. The Spaniards eventually abandoned three of the East Texas missions, reestablishing them near San Antonio in 1731. By 1750, peace with Apaches allowed the area‚Äôs Hispanic settlers to expand their ranching and farming activities along the San Antonio River. By 1773 San Antonio was the new capital of Tejas, and the residents of Los Adaes were forced to relocate there. Once again, El Camino Real de los Tejas played a prominent role in the Spanish cycle of populating and abandoning eastern Texas.<br /> <br /> The trail retained its importance after Mexican independence in 1821. Ranchers continued to bring cattle along El Camino Real, establishing large ranches along the Rio Grande south of Laredo. Large numbers of Anglo settlers used the trail en route to their new homes in Texas; their arrival eventually led to revolt against Mexico, during which armies from both sides moved along the royal road. Usage of the original route diminished in 1845 when the United States annexed Texas.</p> <p><strong>More Information</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elte/index.htm\">El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail</a><br /> <br /> Learn more about other¬†<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1453/national-trails-office-administered-trails.htm\">National Historic Trails</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>On a mission to establish trading ties with Spain, French-Canadian trader Louis Juchereau de St. Denis encountered an impenetrable logjam on the Red River; at this spot he hastily built two crude huts, which become Fort St. Jean Baptiste and the town of Natchitoches, the oldest permanent settlement in what would become the Louisiana Purchase. St. Denis was named the commandant of the fort in 1722, and the colony thrived until his death in 1744.<br /> <br /> In 1731, an attack by the Natchez Indians exposed the fort's vulernability, prompting French officials to send an engineer to oversee the construction of a stronger structure. The fort was garrisoned by French soldiers until 1762, when France ceded Lousiana to Spain. Spanish authorities continued to operate the fort as a military outpost and trading center; however, the fort no longer protected a territorial boundary, so its strategic importance diminished. Spain eventually abandoned the fort, and--when the United States acquired the territory in 1803--it was in ruins.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (155 Jefferson Street in Natchitoches, between Keyser Street and University Parkway)</p> <p><strong>Available Facilities/Exhibits</strong><br /> The fort replica, a picnic area, and restrooms. In 1979, work began on the fort reconstruction at a location a few hundred yards from the original fort site.

The Presidio Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar de Los Adaes (Fort of Our Lady of Pilar at the Adaes) was surrounded by a hexagonal stockade with three bulwarks. In 1729, Spain designated Los Adaes the capital of the province of Texas. This made Los Adaes the official residence of the governor, and a house was constructed for him within the presidio. Los Adaes remained the administrative seat of government for the entire province until 1772 (10 years after Louisiana was transferred to Spain); Los Adaes closed that year and the inhabitants moved to San Antonio. However, many of the 500 soldiers and family members soon left San Antonio and returned to Louisiana, where their descendants live today.</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (6354 Highway 485, one mile northeast of Robeline)</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elte/planyourvisit/safety.htm\">Safety Considerations</a></em></p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.lastateparks.com/\">More site information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elte/index.htm\">El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail</a></h2>",

    "bodyText": "<p>This national historic landmark was settled in 1830 by former residents of Revilla (now Nuevo Guerrero, Tamaulipas) under the leadership of Jes√∫s Trevi√±o. The site was in the southwest corner of the original Hacienda de Dolores, a grant made in 1750 by Col. Jos√© de Escand√≥n to Jos√© V√°zquez Borrego, and was named for the patron saint of Guerrero, Saint Ignatius Loyola. In 1830 Trevi√±o built a sandstone home, known as Fort Trevi√±o, 100 by 140 feet. Jos√© Villareal placed a sundial at the home in 1851; the timepiece has become a tourist attraction. San Ygnacio became a center of trade by the mid-1800s, and the town was the scene of several border skirmishes throughout the years.¬†<br /> <br /> Like many frontier buildings of its era, the fort is fortified by strong walls that protect a courtyard within. Its walls have no windows, only small gunports through which those inside the fort could fire at attackers outside. The fort sits on a small bluff above the Rio Grande, and the lush vegetation and plentiful birdsong creates an almost tropical feeling.¬†</p> <h2>Site Information</h2> <p><strong>Location</strong> (300-398 Trevino St, at the corner of Trevi√±o and Uribe streets, in the northwestern part of San Ygnacio, Texas)</p> <h3><a href=\"https://www.riverpierce.org/\">More Site information</a></h3> <h2><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/elte/index.htm\">El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail</a></h2>",
